APPENDIX B: ADDITIONAL INVERSION CRITERIA,0.0
In Section 1 we describe an additional criteria which we apply,0.0
to refine our classification of inverted HMF. In this appendix we,0.0
shall provide the justification for taking this step. To recap Section,0.0
"1, the first criteria for inverted HMF is that the strahl is oriented",0.0
in the anti-parallel (parallel) direction for positive (negative) HMF,0.0
"polarity. The second, new, criteria is that the HMF polarity of a",0.0
given sample be opposite to the modal polarity over a 12 hr window,0.0
centred on that sample. Samples which meet the first criteria but,0.0
not the second are discarded.,0.0
"      Figure B1 contains plots identical to Figure 4, 𝛿𝑣 k (⊥) for low",6.0
"relative 𝐴𝐶 samples, except do not discard inverted samples which",0.0
do not meet the second criteria. There is a clear additional popu-,0.0
"lation of points, located around Δ𝜙 𝑃 = ±180°. These samples are",0.0
"concentrated around 𝛿𝑣 k = 0 at Δ𝜙 𝑃 = ±180°, and increase towards",0.0
"Δ𝜙 𝑃 = 0°. This trend is consistent with an Alfvénic relationship,",0.0
"which is found in e.g., Figure 4, but shifted by 180°. This may be",0.0
due to incorrect rectification of Δ𝜙 𝑃 . Mis-rectification would occur,0.0
when some samples are wrongly identified as inverted HMF. The,0.0
"distributions of Δ𝜙 𝑃 , shown above the 2-dimensional histograms,",0.0
"also increase towards ±180°, which appears unusual compared to",0.0
the monotonic decrease which is present for Δ𝜙 𝑃 at lower values.,0.0
      Mis-identification of inverted HMF could occur because the,6.0
"strahl alignment is not being accurately determined, perhaps due",0.0
to a low overall strahl flux or otherwise anomalous distribution,0.0
function. Examining electron PADs corresponding to the samples,0.0
"which fall in the additional populations in Figure B1, we find that",0.0
"a sizeable fraction have a particularly low total strahl flux, which",0.0
"supports this hypothesis. However, removing all samples with a",0.0
low strahl flux does fully not eliminate the apparently mis-rectified,0.0
population. Some further inverted samples in this population occur,0.0
"just before or after bidirectional strahl is observed, indicating that",0.0
the sunward-travelling strahl (which we assume indicates inverted,0.0
HMF) may be instead due to the appearance of strahl PADs on,0.0
closed HMF (see Macneil et al. 2020b).,0.0
"      The second additional criteria for inversions, which we apply",6.0
"for the data used in this study, is designed to mitigate the apparent",0.0
mis-identification of inversions by applying a separate verification,0.0
"step. Comparing Figure B1 to Figure 4, we see that the additional",0.0
