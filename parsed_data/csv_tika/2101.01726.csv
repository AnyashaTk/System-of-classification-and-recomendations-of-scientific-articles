ABSTRACT
"We present the discovery and characterization of five hot and warm Jupiters — TOI-628 b (TIC 281408474;
HD 288842), TOI-640 b (TIC 147977348), TOI-1333 b (TIC 395171208, BD+47 3521A), TOI-1478 b (TIC
409794137), and TOI-1601 b (TIC 139375960) — based on data from NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS). The five planets were identified from the full frame images and were confirmed through a
series of photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations by the TESS Follow-up Observing Program
(TFOP) Working Group. The planets are all Jovian size (RP = 1.01-1.77 RJ) and have masses that range from
0.85 to 6.33 MJ. The host stars of these systems have F and G spectral types (5595≤ Teff ≤ 6460 K) and are all
relatively bright (9.5 < V < 10.8, 8.2 < K < 9.3) making them well-suited for future detailed characterization
efforts. Three of the systems in our sample (TOI-640 b, TOI-1333 b, and TOI-1601 b) orbit subgiant host stars"

"(log g <4.1). TOI-640 b is one of only three known hot Jupiters to have a highly inflated radius (RP > 1.7RJ,
possibly a result of its host star’s evolution) and resides on an orbit with a period longer than 5 days. TOI-
628 b is the most massive hot Jupiter discovered to date by TESS with a measured mass of 6.31+0.28"
"−0.30 MJ and a
statistically significant, non-zero orbital eccentricity of e = 0.074+0.021"
"−0.022. This planet would not have had enough
time to circularize through tidal forces from our analysis, suggesting that it might be remnant eccentricity from
its migration. The longest period planet in this sample, TOI-1478 b (P = 10.18 days), is a warm Jupiter in
a circular orbit around a near-Solar analogue. NASA’s TESS mission is continuing to increase the sample of
well-characterized hot and warm Jupiters, complementing its primary mission goals."
1. INTRODUCTION
"The discovery of hot Jupiters, combined with the assump-
tion that gas giant planets must form at separations from their
host star similar to our own giant planets, indicated that gi-
ant planets likely undergo large-scale migration from their
formation locations. Various mechanisms have been pro-
posed to emplace giant planets into very short-period orbits
(Goldreich & Tremaine 1980; Lin & Papaloizou 1986; Lin
et al. 1996; see Dawson & Johnson 2018 for a detailed re-
view). However, it is not clear which of these mechanisms
(if any) are dominant, govern this migration, or whether hot
Jupiters can form in situ (Batygin et al. 2016), obviating the
need for large-scale migration. One possibility is that giant
planets migrate slowly and smoothly within the circumstellar
gas-dust disk, resulting in well-aligned, nearly circular orbits
(D’Angelo et al. 2003). It is also thought that planetary mi-
gration may be heavily influenced by gravitational interac-
tions with other bodies within the system. These interactions
result in highly eccentric and misaligned orbits (relative to
the rotation axis of the star), and are typically referred to as
a type of “High Eccentricity Migration"" (HEM) or “Kozai-
Lidov"" (Kozai 1962; Lidov 1962; Rasio & Ford 1996; Wu &
Murray 2003; Fabrycky & Tremaine 2007; Nagasawa & Ida
2011; Wu & Lithwick 2011; Naoz 2016). For short-period
hot Jupiters, with periods less than about 5 days, the orbits
will circularize in only a few billion years, erasing the ev-
idence of HEM. Additionally, these interactions can cause
misalignments in the planet’s orbital plane (relative to the
original disk plane), that can remain present for much longer,
and such misalignments can be detected through Doppler
spectroscopy, using observations of the Rossiter McLauglin
effect (Rossiter 1924; McLaughlin 1924) or Doppler tomog-
raphy (e.g., Miller et al. 2010; Johnson et al. 2014; Zhou
et al. 2016). Longer-period hot (P & 5 days) and warm
(P>10 days) Jupiters experience smaller tidal forces, pre-
serving their orbital eccentricities. It is likely that multiple
mechanisms shape the short-period giant planet population,
and studying these longer period hot Jupiters may give clues
to their common evolutionary pathway."

"While some ground-based transit surveys that were ded-
icated to discovering hot Jupiters had near 24-hour cover-
age (Bakos et al. 2013), in general they struggled to discover
planets with periods &5 days due to the poor duty cycle from
weather and only being able to observe at night (Gaudi et al.
2005). Additionally, many of the first hot Jupiters discov-
ered were assumed to reside in circular orbits when analyz-
ing the observations, an assumption that may confuse cur-
rent efforts to understand migration. Fortunately, NASA’s
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission was
launched in April of 2018, and completed its primary 2-year
long mission in July of 2020 (Ricker et al. 2015). TESS was
awarded a 27-month first extended mission in which it will
not only re-observe some areas covered in the primary mis-
sion but also observe most of the ecliptic plane, nearly com-
pleting coverage of the entire sky. TESS has a minimum ob-
serving baseline of ∼27 days, and from recent occurrence
rate studies, TESS planet searches will be mostly complete
for hot Jupiters with periods /10 days (Zhou et al. 2019).
Therefore, TESS provides a great resource for the discovery
and confirmation of new longer-period hot and warm Jupiters
(5< P <15 days) where eccentricities from migration would
not be completely erased by tidal forces. TESS has already
discovered a number of statistically significant hot Jupiters
with highly eccentric (e > 0.2) orbits like HD 2685 b (Jones
et al. 2019), TOI-172 b (Rodriguez et al. 2019), TOI-150 b
(Kossakowski et al. 2019), TIC 237913194 b (Schlecker et al.
2020), and TOI-559 b (Ikwut-Ukwa et al. 2021). Addition-
ally, TESS recently confirmed that the hot Jupiter HD 118203
b, an RV-identified planet with high eccentricity discovered
with the radial velocity method (da Silva et al. 2006), transits
its host star (Pepper et al. 2019)."
"TESS will also provide the ability to study hot Jupiter re-
inflation since its high photometric precision will allow it
to discover giant planets around larger, more evolved host
stars. As a star evolves off the main sequence, the stellar
irradiation received by warm Jupiters is similar to that of
a hot Jupiter. Therefore, discovering gas giant planets or-
biting evolved stars at longer periods (10s of days) can test
whether this increased irradiation causes the same inflation
seen for short-period hot Jupiters (Lopez & Fortney 2016).
Most warm Jupiters orbiting main sequence stars show little
to no inflation (Demory & Seager 2011), suggesting that this
energy must be transferred deep into the planet’s interior (Liu"

are suggestive of reinflation (Almenara et al. 2015; Grunblatt

640 b, TOI-1333 b, TOI-1478 b, and TOI-1601 b, five new
hot and warm Jupiters from NASA’s TESS mission. All five
planets were discovered from an analysis of the 30-minute
cadence Full Frame Images (FFIs), and first identified as
TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) by the TESS Science Office1.
These five new systems increase the known sample of well-
characterized hot Jupiters, particularly those with longer or-

all five targets, specifically on TOI-1333 and its two nearby
companions. Our methodology for our global modeling us-
ing EXOFASTv2 (Eastman et al. 2019) is summarized in §3.
We place these systems in context with the known population

"We used a series photometric and spectroscopic observa-
tions to confirm and characterize the new systems, includ-
ing high-spatial resolution imaging to rule out false positives,
confirm them as bona-fide planets, and measure key parame-
ters such as orbital eccentricity and the planet’s density."
2.1. TESS Photometry

collected by the TESS mission. TESS images the sky with a

month before moving on to observe a different region. Dur-"

6 RODRIGUEZ ET AL.
"ing its primary mission, TESS saved and downloaded images
of a smaller number of pre-selected stars every two minutes,
while downloading co-added images of its entire field of view
every 30 minutes. None of the planets described in this paper
orbit stars that were pre-selected for two-minute cadence ob-
servations, so we use data from the 30-minute cadence FFIs."
"After the data were transferred from the orbiting spacecraft
back to Earth, the FFIs were calibrated using the TICA soft-
ware (Fausnaugh et al. in prep) and light curves for a set of
stars complete down to TESS-band magnitude = 13.5 were
extracted with the MIT Quick Look Pipeline (QLP, Huang
et al. 2020a). The QLP extracts light curves from the FFIs
using a difference image analysis technique. After remov-
ing the effects of scattered earthshine and moonshine from
the images, the QLP subtracts a high-quality reference im-
age from each individual science frame and measures differ-
ence fluxes within sets of photometric apertures surrounding
each star in the image. These difference fluxes are then con-
verted to absolute brightness measurements by adding back
the median flux expected from each star based on its TESS-
band magnitude. The QLP light curves have been used to dis-
cover dozens of planets (e.g., Huang et al. 2018; Rodriguez
et al. 2019; Huang et al. 2020b) and a few thousand planet
candidates (N. Guerrero et al. submitted). Additional infor-
mation and a description of the QLP procedures are given
by Huang et al. (2020a). The QLP lightcurves are shown in
Figure 1. All five of these light curves were flattened using
Keplerspline2, a spline fitting routine to divide out the best-fit
stellar variability (Vanderburg & Johnson 2014). The spacing
of the spline break points for each system was determined by
minimizing the Bayesian information criterion following the
methodology from Shallue & Vanderburg (2018). After re-
moving the stellar variability, we keep all data from one full
transit duration before the transit until one full transit dura-
tion after the transit, and discard the remaining baseline data
(which contains very little useful information but is compu-
tationally expensive to model). We use these lightcurve seg-
ments for the global fitting of each system (see §3)."
"Because the QLP uses aperture photometry on differ-
ence frames using a median combined reference image, it
does not always measure absolute transit depths, only differ-
ence fluxes. Transit depths measured by QLP, especially in
crowded fields, might be dependent on the accuracy of the
TESS-band magnitudes from the TESS Input Catalog (Stas-
sun et al. 2018) to correct for contamination due to blend-
ing of nearby stars within the aperture. To check that the
transit depths measured by QLP for these targets are reason-
ably accurate, we performed a spot check for TOI-1601 with
light curves extracted using a more traditional simple aper-"
2 https://github.com/avanderburg/keplerspline
"ture photometry method (Vanderburg et al. 2019). We did
not deblend the photometry in this test because TOI-1601 is
in a relatively sparse field, as shown from our high resolution
imaging (see §2.6.2). We ran an independent EXOFASTv2
fit for TOI-1601 b (swapping this lightcurve for the QLP one)
following the strategy discussed in §3, and the results were
consistent to within <1σ uncertainties. Additionally, for
each system we used the follow-up ground-based photometry
within the global analysis to also constrain the depth, provid-
ing independent constraints that can be used to confirm the
QLP depths (since the TFOP photometry is at a higher angu-
lar resolution than TESS). Within our global fit, we checked
on any unknown contamination by fitting for a dilution term
on the TESS bandpass to account for any difference compared
to the SG1 photometry. In all cases other than TOI-1478,
the fitted dilution was consistent with zero and well within
our Gaussian 10% prior around zero, showing clear consis-
tency between TESS and the TFOP seeing-limited photome-
try. TOI-1478 showed a significant required dilution on the
order of 12%. To properly account for this, we removed the
TESS dilution prior (see §3 for details), allowing it to be a
free parameter, to properly correct for this within the fit."
"We searched the non-flattened QLP light curves for
rotation-based modulations using the VARTOOLS Lomb-
Scargle function (Hartman & Bakos 2016). Specifically, we
searched from 0.1 to 30 days and detect a clear strong pe-
riodicity at 5.296 days for TOI-1333, significantly different
from the orbital period of its planetary companion (Pb = 4.72
days). This same periodicity is observed in our ground-based
photometry, ruling out any systematics in the TESS observa-
tions. We see some tentative evidence of a periodicity at 10-
11 days for TOI-628, however it was only observed in one
TESS sector."
2.2. WASP Photometry
"The WASP transit search consisted of two, wide-field ar-
rays of eight cameras, with SuperWASP on La Palma cover-
ing the northern sky and WASP-South in South Africa cov-
ering the south (Pollacco et al. 2006). Each camera used a
200-mm, f/1.8 lens with a broadband filter spanning 400–
700 nm, backed by 2048x2048 CCDs giving a plate scale
of 13.7′′ pixel−1. Observations then rastered available fields
with a typical 15-min cadence."
"We searched the WASP data for any rotational modulations
using the methods from Maxted et al. (2011). TOI-640 was
observed for spans of 150 nights in each of four years. The
data from 2008, 2009 and 2010 show no significant modula-
tion. The data from 2007, however, show significant power
at a period of 62 ± 5 days, with an amplitude of 3 mmag and
an estimated false-alarm probability below 1%. Since this is
seen in only one season, and given that the data span only
2.5 cycles, we do not regard this detection as fully reliable."

2.3. KELT Photometry
"To complement the TESS photometry, we analyzed obser-
vations of these five TOIs from the KELT survey3 (Pepper
et al. 2007, 2012, 2018). For a full description of the KELT
observing strategy and reduction process, see Siverd et al.
(2012); Kuhn et al. (2016). KELT has two fully robotic
telescopes, each of which uses a Mamiya 645 80mm f/1.9,
each of which uses a Mamiya 645 80mm f/1.9 lens with
42mm aperture and Apogee 4k×4k CCD on a Paramount ME
mount. This setup provides to a 26◦×26◦ field of view with
a 23′′ pixel scale. The two telescopes are located in at Winer
Observatory in Sonoita, AZ and at the South African Astro-
nomical Observatory (SAAO) in Sutherland, South Africa.
KELT covers∼85% of the entire sky and the observing strat-
egy results in a 20-30 minute cadence. Some of the KELT
lightcurves are publicly available through the NASA Exo-
planet Archive. KELT observations were available for TOI-
628, TOI-1333, TOI-1478, and TOI-1601. KELT-South ob-
served TOI-628 2828 times and TOI-1478 4632 times from"
3 https://keltsurvey.org
"2010 to 2015. KELT-North observed TOI-1333 from 2012
to 2014 and TOI-1601 from 2006 to 2014, acquiring 2580
and 8520 observations, respectively. Since KELT has been
observing since 2006 in some cases, the observations signifi-
cantly extend the baseline of the photometry and can provide
a strong constraint on the ephemeris of each system. Follow-
ing the strategy described in Siverd et al. (2012) and Kuhn
et al. (2016), we also search the KELT lightcurves for tran-
sits of each planet. Unfortunately, no significant signs of the
known planetary transits were found, likely due to the poor
duty cycle for longer orbital periods."
"Following the approach of Stassun et al. (1999) and Oelk-
ers et al. (2018), we executed a search for periodic signals
most likely to come from the rotation period of the star.
For these stars, we post-processed the light curve data us-
ing the Trend-Filtering Algorithm (Kovács et al. 2005) to
remove common systematics. We then searched for candi-
date rotation signals using a modified version of the Lomb-
Scargle period finder algorithm (Lomb 1976; Scargle 1982).
We searched for periods between a minimum period of 0.5
days and a maximum period of 50 days using 2000 frequency
steps4. We masked periods between 0.5 and 0.505 days and
0.97–1.04 days to avoid the most common detector aliases
associated with KELT’s observational cadence and its inter-"

number of data points in any given light curve."

"action with the periods for the solar and sidereal day. For
each star, we selected the highest statistically significant peak
of the power spectrum (hereafter, γ) as the candidate period."
"We then executed a boot-strap analysis, using 1000 Monte-
Carlo iterations, where the dates of the observations were
not changed, but the magnitude values of the light curve
were randomized, following the work of Henderson & Stas-
sun (2012). We recalculated the Lomb-Scargle power spec-
trum for each iteration, and recorded the maximum peak
power (hereafter, γsim) of all iterations. If the highest power
spectrum peak was larger than the maximum simulated peak
(γ > γsim) after 1000 iterations, we considered the periodic
signal to be a candidate rotation period."
"We find TOI-1333 to have a strongly significant (γ > 50)
candidate rotation period at 5.3 days, which is consistent with
TESS (see §2.1), and TOI-1601 and TOI-1478 to have weakly
significant (γ > 10) candidate rotation periods of 9.3 and 16.6
days, respectively. However, we do not see these periodici-
ties in the TESS photometry, and they are likely aliases of the
KELT observing strategy. KELT did not obtain observations
of TOI-640."
"2.4. Ground-based Photometry from the TESS Follow-up
Observing Program Working Group"
"To refine the ephemerides and transit parameters for each
system while ruling out false positive scenarios, we obtained
photometric follow-up observations on all five systems from
the TESS Follow-up Observing Program Working Group5,
sub-group 1 (SG1) for seeing-limited photometry. Specifi-
cally, the follow-up comes from the Las Cumbres Observa-
tory (LCO) telescope network (Brown et al. 2013), Whitin
Observatory at Wellesley College, KeplerCam on the 1.2m
telescope at Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO),
Brierfield Observatory, PEST Observatory, C. R. Chambliss
Astronomical Observatory (CRCAO) at Kutztown Univer-
sity, Adams Observatory at Austin College, and Suto Obser-
vatory. To schedule the photometric transit follow-up obser-
vations, we used the TAPIR software package (Jensen 2013).
The data reduction and aperture photometry extraction was
performed using AstroImageJ (Collins et al. 2017) for all
follow-up data other than the PEST observations which were
done using a custom software package PEST Pipeline6.
The TFOP follow-up photometry for these five systems are
shown in Figure 2, and a list of each telescope’s information
and details on each follow-up transit can be seen in Table 2.
The follow-up transits presented in Figure 2 are available as
machine-readable tables with this paper."

2.5.1. TCES Spectroscopy
"Reconnaissance spectroscopic observations of TOI-628
were carried out with the Tautenburg Coudé Echelle Spectro-
graph (TCES) mounted at the 2-meter ""Alfred Jensch"" Tele-
scope of the Thuringian State Observatory (TLS) in Tauten-
burg, Germany. The spectra cover the 470-740 nm wave-
length range and have a resolution R=57000. A 40 min expo-
sure was taken at BJD=2458777.6053 (orbital phase φ∼0.5),
and a 3×20 min exposure at BJD=2458855.3720 (φ ∼0.0).
We measured for the two single-lined spectra a ∆RV . 1 km
s−1, ruling out an eclipsing binary as the cause of the event
detected by TESS. These velocities were not included in the
global fit for TOI-628."
2.5.2. TRES Spectroscopy

we observed TOI-628, TOI-1333, TOI-1478, and TOI-1601

2.5.3. CHIRON Spectroscopy
"We obtained a series of spectroscopic observations with the
1.5 m SMARTS / CHIRON facility (see Table 3 Tokovinin
et al. 2013) for TOI-640 and TOI-1478 to measure the host
star parameters, and constrain their masses and eccentrici-
ties. The 1.5 m SMARTS facility is located at Cerro Tololo
Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), Chile. CHIRON is a
high resolution echelle spectrograph fed via an image slicer
through a single multi-mode fiber, with a spectral resolving
power of R∼ 80,000 over the wavelength region from 410 to
870nm. For the case of TOI-1478, we treat the pre- and post-
shutdown RVs as separate instruments within the fit (see §3)."
"To obtain the stellar atmospheric parameters, we matched
the CHIRON spectra against an interpolated library of ob-
served ∼ 10,000 spectra classified by SPC (Buchhave et al.
2012). The metallicity from this analysis was used as a prior
for global fit of TOI-640 (see Table 4). RVs were derived
via the least-squares deconvolution (Donati et al. 1997; Zhou
et al. 2020) of the spectra against non-rotating synthetic tem-
plates matching the spectral parameters of each host star,
generated using the ATLAS9 model atmospheres (Kurucz
1992). The RVs were then measured by fitting a least-squares
deconvolution line profile with a rotational broadening kernel
as prescribed by Gray (2005). The velocities for each system
are presented in Table 3."
2.5.4. FEROS Spectroscopy
"Using the FEROS spectrograph (Kaufer et al. 1999)
mounted on the 2.2m MPG telescope at La Silla observatory
in Chile, we obtained 8 observations of TOI-1478. FEROS
has R=48000, and the observations were between UT 2020
March 02 and UT 2020 March 22. A ThAr+Ne lamp was
used to illuminate the fiber simultaneously to the observa-
tions to determine the instrumental offset. We reduced the
spectra, derived the RVs, and produced the bisector spans"
"using the CERES suite for echelle pipelines (Brahm et al.
2017)."
2.5.5. CORALIE Spectroscopy
"TOI-1478 was observed with the CORALIE high resolu-
tion spectrograph (R=60,000) on the Swiss 1.2 m Euler tele-
scope at La Silla Observatories, Chile (Queloz et al. 2001).
A total of 14 spectra were obtained between UT 2020 Jan-
uary 26 and March 16, covering several orbits of TOI-1478
b. CORALIE is fed by a 2′′science fiber and a secondary fiber
with simultaneous Fabry-Perot for wavelength calibration.
RVs were computed with the standard CORALIE data re-
duction pipeline via cross-correlation with a binary G2 mask.
Activity indices, bisector spans (BIS) and other line profile
diagnostics were extracted as well. We find no correlation
between the RVs and BIS, nor activity indicators. Our expo-
sure times varied between 1200 and 1800 seconds depending
on site conditions and observing schedule."
2.5.6. MINERVA Australis Spectroscopy
"MINERVA-Australis is an array of four PlaneWave
CDK700 telescopes located in Queensland, Australia, fully
dedicated to the precise RV follow-up of TESS candidates.
The four telescopes can be simultaneously fiber-fed to a sin-
gle KiwiSpec R4-100 high-resolution (R=80,000) spectro-
graph (Barnes et al. 2012; Addison et al. 2019, 2020). TOI-
628 was monitored by MINERVA-Australis using 2 or 3 tele-
scopes in the array (Minerva3, Minerva4, Minerva6) between
UT 2019 Sep 15 and Dec 3. Each epoch consists of two 30-
minute exposures, and the resulting RVs are binned to a sin-
gle point as shown by the example in Table 3. Telescopes
1 and 3 obtained seven RV epochs, while Telescope 4 ob-
tained four epochs. RVs for the observations are derived for
each telescope by cross-correlation, where the template be-
ing matched is the mean spectrum of each telescope. The
instrumental variations are corrected by using the RVs com-
puted from different Minerva telescopes as originating from
independent instruments within our global model."

2.6. High Resolution Imaging
"As part of our standard process for validating transiting
exoplanets to assess possible contamination of bound or un-
bound companions on the derived planetary radii (Ciardi
et al. 2015), we obtained high spatial resolution imaging ob-
servations of all five systems."
2.6.1. Speckle Imaging
"We searched for close companions to TOI-628, TOI-640,
and TOI-1478 with speckle imaging in the I-band on the
4.1-m Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) telescope
(Tokovinin 2018). The speckle imaging was conducted us-
ing HRCam (field-of-view of 15′′) and had a 0.01575′′ pixel
scale. TOI-628 was observed on UT 2019 November 11 with
a sensitivity of ∆Mag = 7.2 at 1′′. Speckle observations of
TOI-640 were taken on UT 2019 May 18 and had an esti-
mated contrast of ∆mag = 6.6 at 1′′. Observations of TOI-
1478 were taken on UT 2020 January 07 and had an esti-
mated contrast of ∆mag = 6.8 at 1′′. See Ziegler et al. (2020)
for a description on the general observing strategy for TESS
targets. No nearby companion was observed for any of the
three targets out to 3′′."
"We also obtained two sets of high-resolution speckle im-
ages of TOI-1478. One was collected on UT 2020 January
14 using the Zorro instrument mounted on the 8-meter Gem-
ini South telescope located on the summit of Cerro Pachon
in Chile and the other on UT 2020 February 18 using the
‘Alopeke instrument mounted on the 8-m Gemini-North tele-
scope located on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii. These
twin instruments simultaneously observe in two bands, i.e.,
λ
∆λ"
"= 832/40 nm and 562/54 nm, obtaining diffraction lim-
ited images with inner working angles 0.026′′ and 0.017′′,
respectively. Each observation consisted of 6 minutes of total
integration time at each telescope taken as sets of 1000×0.06
second images. All the images were combined and subjected
to Fourier analysis leading to the production of final data
products including speckle reconstructed imagery (see How-
ell et al. 2011). Both speckle imaging results showed similar
contrast limits and revealed that TOI-1478 is a single star to
contrast limits of 5 to 9 magnitudes (out to 1.17′′, ruling out
most main sequence companions to TOI-1478 within the spa-
tial limits of∼4 to 180 au (for d=153 pc, as determined from
the Gaia DR2 parallax Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018)."
2.6.2. Adaptive Optics Imaging
"We observed TOI-628 on UT 2019 November 11 using the
ShARCS adaptive optics system on the 3-m Shane Telescope
at Lick Observatory. ShARCS has a field of view of 20′′ ×
20′′ and a pixel scale of 0.033′′ pixel−1. We conducted our
observations using a square 4-point dither pattern with a sep-
aration of 4′′ between each dither position. Our observations
were taken in natural guide star mode with high winds. We"
"obtained one sequence of observations in Ks-band and a sec-
ond sequence in J-band for a total integration time of 510 s
in Ks-band and 225 s in J-band. See Savel et al. (2020) for a
detailed description of the observing strategy. Neither set of
observations revealed any companions for TOI-628."
"We observed TOI-1333 (Br − γ and H − cont) and TOI-
1478 with infrared high-resolution adaptive optics (AO)
imaging at Palomar Observatory. The Palomar Observatory
observations were made with the PHARO instrument (Hay-
ward et al. 2001) behind the natural guide star AO system
P3K (Dekany et al. 2013). The observations were made on
2019 Nov 10 UT in a standard 5-point quincunx dither pat-
tern with steps of 5′′. Each dither position was observed three
times, offset in position from each other by 0.5′′ for a total
of 15 frames. The camera was in the narrow-angle mode
with a full field of view of ∼ 25′′ and a pixel scale of ap-
proximately 0.025′′ per pixel. Observations were made in
the narrow-band Br-γ filter (λo = 2.1686;∆λ = 0.0326µm)
for TOI-1333 and TOI-1478, and in the H − cont filter (λo =
1.668;∆λ = 0.018µm) for TOI-1333. The observations get
down to a ∆Mag = 6.54 (Br-γ) and = 7.52 (H −cont) for TOI-
1333 and a ∆Mag = 6.8 (Br-γ) for TOI-1478 (all at ∼0.5′′)."
"TOI-1333 was also observed using NIRI on Gemini-North
(Hodapp et al. 2003) on UT 2019 November 14 in the Br-γ
filter. NIRI has a 22′′×22′′ field-of-view with a 0.022′′ pixel
scale. Our sequence consisted of nine images, each with
exposure time 4.4s, and we dithered the telescope between
each exposure. A sky background was constructed from the
dithered frames, and subtracted from each science image. We
also performed bad pixel removal and flatfielding, and then
aligned and coadded frames. NIRI got down to a ∆Mag =
6.7 at 0.472′′."
"We also observed TOI-1601 using the Near Infrared Cam-
era 2 (NIRC2) adaptive optics (AO) set up on the W. M. Keck
Observatory in the Br-γ filter and in the J − cont filter on UT
2020 September 09. The NIRC2 detector has a 9.971 mas
pixel−1 using a 1024×1024 CCD (field-of-view = 10′′×10′′,
Service et al. 2016). Unfortunately, the lower left quadrant
of the CCD is known to have higher than typical noise levels
in comparison to the others. To avoid this issue, a 3-point
dither pattern technique was used. The images were aligned
and stacked after normal flat-field and sky background cor-
rections. No nearby companions were seen down to a ∆mag
= 6.680 (J − cont) and = 6.402 (Br-γ) for TOI-1601 at 0.5′′."
"While the observing strategy differed, all of the AO data
were processed and analyzed with a custom set of IDL tools.
The science frames were flat-fielded and sky-subtracted. The
flat fields were generated from a median combination of the
dark subtracted flats taken on-sky. The flats were normal-
ized such that the median value of the flats is unity. The
sky frames were generated from the median average of the
15 dithered science frames; each science image was then"

"NOTES:
See Table 3 in Eastman et al. (2019) for a detailed description of all derived and fitted parameters.
¶ No TESS dilution prior was used for TOI-1478 b because initial fits showed a fitted dilution past the 10% prior we used in the other systems. We fit for a
dilution term within the fit for the TESS bandpass but with no prior.
§ The SED was not included within the global fit for TOI-1333.
∗∗ TC prior comes from analysis of the WASP photometry (see §2.2). We note that this time is in HJDTDB while all data files and results here are BJDTDB. The
difference between these two time systems is on the order of seconds while the precision on TC used as a prior is on order of minutes, and therefore has no
influence on the results.
∗∗∗Dilution prior for TOI-1333 comes from our 3-component SED analysis (see §2.6.4).
′We assume the TESS correction for blending is much better than 10%. We use a prior of 10% of the determined blending from TICv8 (Stassun et al. 2018).
†The initial metallicity is the metallicity of the star when it was formed.
‡The Equal Evolutionary Point corresponds to static points in a stars evolutionary history when using the MIST isochrones and can be a proxy for age. See §2 in
Dotter (2016) for a more detailed description of EEP.
?Optimal time of conjunction minimizes the covariance between TC and Period. This is the transit mid-point.
πThe tidal quality factor (QS) is assumed to be 106."

"sky-subtracted and flat-fielded. The reduced science frames
were combined into a single combined image using an intra-
pixel interpolation that conserves flux, shifts the individ-
ual dithered frames by the appropriate fractional pixels, and
median-coadds the frames (see Figure 4). The final resolu-
tion of the combined dither was determined from the full-
width half-maximum of the point spread function; the res-
olutions of the Br − γ and H − cont images are 0.092′′ and
0.075′′, respectively (Figure 4)."
"The sensitivities of the final combined AO images were de-
termined by injecting simulated sources azimuthally around
the primary target every 20◦ at separations of integer multi-
ples of the central source’s FWHM (Furlan et al. 2017, Lund
et al. in preparation). The brightness of each injected source
was scaled until standard aperture photometry detected it
with 5σ significance. The resulting brightness of the injected
sources relative to the target set the contrast limits at that in-
jection location. The final 5σ limit at each separation was
determined from the average of all of the determined limits
at that separation and the uncertainty on the limit was set by
the rms dispersion of the azimuthal slices at a given radial
distance. The sensitivity curves for TOI-1333 are shown in
Figure 4 along with an inset image zoomed to the primary
target showing no other companion stars."
2.6.3. TOI-1333 Companions
"In the case of TOI-1333, two additional sources were de-
tected in the PHARO and GEMINI AO imaging (Figure 4,
only the 3′′ companion is shown). The first source is 7.43′′"
"(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) to the east of the primary tar-
get and is separately resolved by the 2MASS survey (2MASS
J21400422+4824221; TIC 395171213). The second source
is only 2.81′′ (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) away and was
not separately detected by 2MASS - although it was de-
tected by Gaia and hence is in the TESS Input Catalog (TIC
2010985858). Based upon the differential magnitudes mea-
sured by Palomar, the deblended infrared magnitudes for the
primary star and nearby companion are K1 = 8.355± 0.024
mag, H1 = 8.514± 0.043 mag (H1 − K1 = 0.159± 0.049)
and K2 = 10.614± 0.026 mag, H2 = 10.871± 0.044 mag
(H2 − K2 = 0.257± 0.051), respectively. The 3′′ star has a
Gaia magnitude of G = 12.6221±0.0016."
"The primary target has a Gaia distance of 200.5± 1.2pc
whereas the 7′′ companion has a Gaia distance of 1030±35
pc indicating that this companion is not bound to the primary

the TOI-1333. However, the 3′′ companion has a Gaia dis-
tance of 196.8± 1.6 pc and proper motions that are nearly
identical to that of the primary star (µ1α = −9.81±0.05 vs.
µ2α = −9.06± 0.08 and µ1δ = −10.50± 0.04 vs. µ2δ =

formed by TOI 1333 and its companion. LOFTI uses the rel-
ative proper motions of the two stars from the Gaia catalog to
sample probable orbits for a binary star system. To derive the
mass of the companion – required to fit orbit using LOFTI –
we use the isochrones package (Morton 2015a). We per-
form an SED fit on photometry from TOI 1333’s binary com-
panion using the Gaia G, BP, and RP magnitudes, along with
its Gaia parallax. Using the MIST isochrone (Dotter 2016)

2.6.4. TOI-1333 Spectral Energy Distribution
"The presence of the two stellar companions within a few
arcseconds of TOI-1333 implies that the TESS and SG1 light
curves of the TOI-1333 planet transit are likely to be diluted
to some extent by the light from these other stars. Although
the QLP corrects the TESS lightcurve for the blended contri-
butions of known targets in the TESS input catalog (TIC),"

"we need to correct the follow-up photometry from TFOP
for different amounts of dilution. To quantify this flux di-
lution, we performed a multi-component SED fit with Ku-
rucz model atmospheres following the procedures described
in Stassun & Torres (2016), utilizing the resolved broadband
measurements from Gaia, 2MASS, and our AO observations
(see §2.6.2)."
"We adopted the spectroscopic Teff (6250±100 K) from
TRES for TOI-1333 and the Teff from the TICv8 (Stassun
et al. 2019) and from the Gaia DR2 catalog for the compan-
ions, with AV being left as a free parameter but limited to the
maximum line-of-sight value from the dust maps of Schlegel
et al. (1998). The resulting fits are shown in Figure 5, with
best-fit AV = 0.06± 0.06 for the TOI-1333 planet host. In-
tegrating the SED models over the TESS bandpass gives the
total flux dilution (F2 +F3)/F1 = 0.55 with values 0.56 in the
I-band 0.54 in the R-band, and 0.58 in the Sloan z′. We also
used the SED fits to constrain the contribution from only the
2′′ companion since some of our follow-up photometry only
resolved the 7′′ companion. The flux dilution of F2/F1 is
0.07 in the I-band, 0.06 in the R-band, and 0.07 in the Sloan
z′. By combining the deblended spectral energy distribution
of the primary star TOI-1333 with the known Gaia DR2 par-
allax, we measure the its radius to be R? = 1.963±0.064 R�.
We use this as a prior on the global fit for TOI-1333 (see §3)."
"2.7. Location in the Galaxy, UVW Space Motion, and
Galactic Population"
"For each of the TOIs analyzed here, we used their paral-
laxes, proper motions, and radial velocities and associated
uncertainties from the Gaia DR2 catalog (Gaia Collaboration
et al. 2018) to determine their location, kinematics, orbits,"
"and associations with known stellar populations8. We cor-
rected the native DR2 parallaxes and uncertainties using the
prescription given in Lindegren et al. (2018). From these we
computed the prior (DR2-based) estimates of the distances
to the systems9. We used these to compute the heliocentric
UVW space motions of the host stars, and then corrected for
the sun’s motion (UVW)� with respect to the Local Standard
of Rest (LSR) as determined by Coşkunoǧlu et al. (2011).
These resulting (UVW) values are shown in Table 1. We
note that we adopt a right-handed coordinate system, such
that positive U is toward the Galactic center."
"We used the Galactic latitudes and distances to the sys-
tems to estimate their Z height relative to the sun, and then
corrected for the Z�' 30 pc offset of the sun from the Galac-
tic plane as determined by Bovy (2017) from the analysis of
local giants. We use the UVW velocities relative to the LSR
to determine the likelihood that the star belongs to thin disk,
thick disk, halo, or Hercules stream10, using the categoriza-
tion scheme of Bensby et al. (2014). We also report the esti-
mates of the parameters of the Galactic orbits of the systems
as determined by Mackereth & Bovy (2018) using Gaia DR2"
"8 We acknowledge that some of the analysis in this section was inspired by
and follows that of Burt et al. (2020)"
"9 We note that, for self-consistency, we explicitly did not adopt the posterior
values of the parallaxes from the global fit as listed in Table 4."
"10 The Hercules stream is a chemically heterogeneous population of nearby
stars that have distinct kinematics relative to the bulk of the local stellar
distribution. See, e.g., Bensby et al. 2007."

"astrometry and radial velocities11. We estimated the spectral
type of each TOI using its Teff as determined from the global
fit and given in Table 4, and using the Teff-spectral type rela-
tions of Pecaut & Mamajek (2013). We then compared the
position and orbits of the systems to the scale height hZ of
stars of similar spectral type as determined by Bovy (2017)."
"Finally, we also consider whether the systems may belong
to any of the known nearby (. 150 pc young (. Gyr) associ-
ations using the BANYAN Σ (Bayesian Analysis for Nearby
Young AssociatioNs Σ) estimator (Gagné et al. 2018). Not
suprisingly, none of the systems had any significant (& 1%)
probability of being associated with these young associa-
tions, and the BANYAN Σ estimator assigned all five systems
as belonging to the ‘field’ with a high probability & 99%. We
now discuss the results for each of the systems individually."
"TOI-628: We find a distance from the sun of d = 178±
3 pc, consistent with the posterior value listed in Table 4, and
Z − Z� ' −23 pc. We derive velocities relative to the LSR
of (U ,V ,W ) = (−8.7±0.4,3.2±0.2,4.2±0.1) km s−1. Ac-
cording to the categorisation scheme of Bensby et al. (2014),
the system has a > 99% probability of belonging to the thin
disk. The Galactic orbit as estimated by Mackereth & Bovy
(2018) has a perigalacticon of Rp = 7.67 kpc, and apogalacti-
con of Ra = 8.19 kpc, an eccentricity of e = 0.03, and a max-
imum Z excursion from the Galactic plane of Zmax = 63 pc.
This orbit is both consistent with the current location of the
system, as well as the scale height of 97 pc for stars of similar
spectral type (F7V). Indeed, TOI-628 is relatively dynami-
cally ‘cold,’ for its spectral type. In other words, it has an
orbit that is fairly close to that of the local LSR."
"TOI-640: We find a distance from the sun of d = 340±
4 pc, consistent with the posterior value listed in Table 4, and
Z − Z� ' −76 pc. We derive velocities relative to the LSR
of (U ,V ,W ) = (−16.8±0.2,−16.7±0.4,−8.7±0.2) km s−1.
According to the categorisation scheme of Bensby et al.
(2014), the system has a ∼ 99% probability of belonging to
the thin disk. The Galactic orbit as estimated by Mackereth
& Bovy (2018) has a perigalacticon of Rp = 6.28 kpc, and
apogalacticon of Ra = 8.16 kpc, an eccentricity of e = 0.13,
and a maximum Z excursion from the Galactic plane of
Zmax = 150 pc. This orbit is both consistent with the current
location of the system, and suggest that the system is nearing
its maximum excursion above the plane. It is also consistent
as the scale height of 85 pc for stars of similar spectral type
(F5.5V)."
"11 We note that Mackereth & Bovy (2018) adopted a solar Galactocentric
distance of R0 = 8 kpc, Z� = 25 pc, and a local circular velocity of
Vcirc = 220 km s−1. The also corrected for the sun’s motion with respect
to the LSR using the values of (UVW)� as determined by Schönrich et al.
(2010), which differ slightly from the values we adopted as determined by
Coşkunoǧlu et al. (2011). However, this is a minor effect and has no quali-
tative impact on our conclusions."
"TOI-1333: We find a distance from the sun of d = 200±

0.1) km s−1. According to the categorisation scheme of
Bensby et al. (2014), the system has a ∼ 99% probability
of belonging to the thin disk. The Galactic orbit as esti-
mated by Mackereth & Bovy (2018) has a perigalacticon of
Rp = 7.25 kpc, and apogalacticon of Ra = 8.32 kpc, an ec-
centricity of e = 0.07, and a maximum Z excursion from the
Galactic plane of Zmax = 91 pc. This orbit is consistent with
the current location of the system. It is also consistent as the
scale height of 97 pc for stars of similar spectral type (F7V)."
"TOI-1478: We find a distance from the sun of d = 153±
1 pc, and Z − Z� ' 67 pc. We derive velocities relative
to the LSR of (U ,V ,W ) = (−37.0± 0.3,26.4± 0.4,32.5±
0.2) km s−1. According to the categorisation scheme of
Bensby et al. (2014), the system has a ∼ 88% probability
of belonging to the thin disk, and a ∼ 12% probability of be-
longing to the thick disk (and negligible probabilities of be-
longing to the halo or Hercules stream). The Galactic orbit as
estimated by Mackereth & Bovy (2018) has a perigalacticon
of Rp = 7.71 kpc, and apogalacticon of Ra = 10.34 kpc, an
eccentricity of e = 0.14, and a maximum Z excursion from
the Galactic plane of Zmax = 650 pc. Unfortunately, Bovy
(2017) was unable to determine the scale height of stars of
similar spectral type (G6V) due to incompleteness. Never-
theless, it would appear that TOI-1478’s orbit has a max-
imum Z excursion that exceeds the expected scale height
for stars of similar spectral type as estimated by extrapo-
lating from the results of Bovy (2017) from earlier spec-
tral types. Surprisingly, its current distance above the plane
is only small fraction of its predicted maximum excursion.
In summary, the weight of evidence suggests that TOI-1478
may well be a thick disk star that we happen to be observ-
ing when it is near the Galactic plane. Detailed chemical
abundance measurements (e.g., [α/Fe]) may provide corrob-
orating evidence for or against this hypothesis."
"TOI-1601: We find a distance from the sun of d = 336±
9 pc, consistent with the posterior value listed in Table 4, and
Z − Z� ' −73 pc. We derive velocities relative to the LSR of
(U ,V ,W ) = (−8.1±0.7,−14.5±0.7,20.9±0.4) km s−1. Ac-
cording to the categorisation scheme of Bensby et al. (2014),
the system has a ∼ 98% probability of belonging to the thin
disk. The Galactic orbit as estimated by Mackereth & Bovy
(2018) has a perigalacticon of Rp = 6.50 kpc, and apogalacti-
con of Ra = 8.32 kpc, an eccentricity of e = 0.12, and a max-
imum Z excursion from the Galactic plane of Zmax = 351 pc.
This orbit is consistent with the current location of the sys-
tem. The maximum Z excursion is a factor of ∼ 3.3 times
larger than the scale height of 103 pc for stars of similar
spectral type (G0V). The probability that a star in a popu-
lation with a given scale height hz = 108 pc has a maximum"
18 RODRIGUEZ ET AL.
"excursion of zmax = 351 pc is non-negligible. Thus we ex-
pect that TOI-1601 is a thin disk star that is simply in the tail
of the distribution of zmax. Again, detailed abundances could
corroborate or refute this conclusion."
3. EXOFASTv2 GLOBAL FITS
"We use the publicly available exoplanet fitting suite,
EXOFASTv2 (Eastman et al. 2013, 2019), to globally fit the
available photometry and RVs to determine the host star and
planetary parameters for TOI-628 b, TOI-640 b, TOI-1333
b, TOI-1478 b, and TOI-1601 b. We fit the TESS and SG1
transits (see §2.4), accounting for the 30 min smearing from
the FFIs. Within the fit, the SG1 lightcurves were detrended
(additive) against the corresponding parameters shown in Ta-
ble 1. See §D in the appendix of Collins et al. (2017) for a
description of each detrending parameter. We use the MESA
Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) stellar evolution mod-
els (Paxton et al. 2011, 2013, 2015; Choi et al. 2016; Dotter
2016) and the spectral energy distribution (SED) within the
fit to determine the host star parameters for all systems but
TOI-1333 b. The SED fit within the global fit puts systematic
floors on the broadband photometry errors (see Table 1, Stas-
sun & Torres 2016). We also note that EXOFASTv2 defaults
a lower limit on the systematic error on the bolometric flux
(Fbol ∼3%) given the spread seen from various techniques
to calculate it (Zinn et al. 2019). We place a Gaussian prior
on the metallicity from our analysis of the host star’s spectra
from TRES, or CHIRON in the case of TOI-640 (see Sec-
tion 2.5.3 and 2.5.2). We also place a Gaussian prior on the
parallax from Gaia (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016, 2018),
correcting for the 30 µas offset reported by Lindegren et al.
(2018), and an upper limit on the line of sight extinction from
Schlegel et al. (1998) & Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011). We
also fit for a dilution term on the TESS band. Since the QLP
corrects the TESS light curves for all known blended com-
panions, we place a Gaussian prior of 0±10% of the con-
tamination ratio reported by the TESS Input Catalog (TIC,
Stassun et al. 2018). We assume that the light curve has been
corrected to a precision better than 10% (and test this with
preliminary EXOFASTv2 showing the dilution to be consis-
tent with zero), but this flexibility also provides an indepen-
dent check on the correction applied and allows us to prop-
agate the uncertainty in the correction. We do not find any
significant additional dilution in any of the systems (within
this prior and consistent with zero dilution) other than TOI-
1478 b, where our fit suggests an additional 13% dilution
(0.126+0.020"
"−0.021) is needed for the TESS light curve to be con-
sistent with the TFOP photometry. For this fit, we remove
this prior, essentially allowing the TFOP observations to con-
strain the depth of the transit. It is not clear what the cause
of this additional dilution is since we see no evidence for any
unknown companions in our high-spatial resolution imaging."
"We note that TESS only observed three transits in one sector
for TOI-1478 b, the longest period planet in our sample, and
the TFOP light curves were both at higher spatial resolution.
We also ran a fit where we allowed for a slope in the RVs,
but found no significant trends for any system (we do not fit
for a slope in the final fits). A list of the priors for each target
is shown in Table 4. Table 3 of Eastman et al. (2019) shows
a list and description of the fitted and derived parameters, in-
cluding the bounds that EXOFASTv2 adopts for each fitted
parameter. We note that eccentricity, a key parameter for this
study, is bound as such: 0 ≤ e ≤ 1 − a+RpR∗ , in order to ensure
that the periastron values of the planet orbits are larger than
the sum of the stellar and planetary radius. We deem a fit to
be fully converged by following the recommending statistical
threshold of a Gelman-Rubin statistic (<1.01) and indepen-
dent draw (>1000) that is recommended by Eastman et al.
(2019). The results from our EXOFASTv2 fits are shown in
Table 4 & 5, and the models are shown for the transits and
RVs in Figures 2 & 3."
"In the case of TOI-1333 b, we deviate slightly from the
methodology in the previous paragraph because there are
two nearby bright companions, both detected by high res-
olution imaging (see §4). The 2′′ nearby companion and
7′′ star were blended in the TESS and CRCAO photome-
try (see §2.4), but only the 2′′ companion was blended in
the LCO observations. While the TESS light curve has al-
ready been deblended as part of the reduction pipeline (see
§2.1), the SG1 observations were not. Our three-component
SED analysis (see §2.6.4) determined that the nearby com-
panion 2′′ from TOI-1333 accounts for 6.6% in the z′-band,
where LCO did not resolve the close companion. The com-
bined flux contribution from both stars is 36.1% in the I-band
and 35.0% in the R-band, where both companions were unre-
solved by CRCAO. We use these values with a 5% Gaussian
prior EXOFASTv2 global fit (also placing the prior on the
TESS dilution as discussed in the previous paragraph). We
place a Gaussian prior on the host star’s radius from the SED
analysis of R? = 1.963± 0.064 R�. Preliminary SED fits
of TOI-1333 using EXOFASTv2 and independent logg con-
straints from the SPC analysis of the TRES spectra suggested
that TOI-1333 is a slightly evolved star. Given that the SED
would normally constrain the Teff of the host star within the
fit but was excluded for TOI-1333, we also place a prior on
the Teff of 6250±100 K from the SPC analysis of the TRES
spectroscopy."
"For TOI-1478 global fit, five RVs were acquired in the
summer and winter of 2020, after a multi-month shutdown
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When included as part of
the CHIRON RVs in the fit, we see a statistically significant
slope measured of 0.176 m/s/day. However, the RV base-
line for CHIRON observations has appeared to shift slightly
when pre- and post-shutdown RVs were compared for stan-"
EVERYBODY GETS A GIANT PLANET! 19
"dard stars, consistent with the shift we measured when in-
cluding these post pandemic RVs (T. Henry, private commu-
nication). Since we saw no evidence of a slope in fits with-
out these RVs and we know there is a shift observed in the
RV baseline for CHIRON, we treat these observations as a
separate instrument (labeled ""CHIRON2""). When fitting the
CHIRON RVs separately within the EXOFASTv2 fit, we see
a difference of 65 m s−1 in the fitted RV zero points. We note
that the planet and host star parameters are consistent to <1
sigma whether or not this slope is included in the fit."
3.1. TOI-1601 Bimodality
"After each EXOFASTv2 fit, we inspect the posteriors of
each fitted and derived parameter, visually inspecting for any
anomalies such as multi-modal distributions. In all cases but
TOI-1601 b, no issues were noted. For TOI-1601 b, we see a
clear bimodal distribution in the mass and age of the host star
(see Figure 6). We find two peaks in the mass distribution at
1.340 and 1.517 M�, which corresponds to the two peaks
seen in the age distribution at 4.27 and 2.63 Gyr. There is
no optimal way to represent the bimodal solution, so we split
the mass of the host star at the minimum value of 1.415M�
and extract two solutions for both peaks identified. We adopt
the high mass solution for the discussion since it has a higher
probability (66.7%) of being correct from our analysis, but
present both solutions in Table 4 for future analysis. We note
that we observed no significant change in any systematic pa-
rameters, suggesting the bimodality to be due to our limited
precision that is not sufficient to completely separate similar
solutions due to the host star being slightly evolved."
4. DISCUSSION
"These five newly-discovered hot Jupiters from NASA’s
TESS mission significantly increase (>5%) the number of
well characterized (measured masses and orbital eccentric-
ities) giant planets that reside in orbits with periods between
5 and 15 days, a regime where planets experience weaker
tidal forces than those experienced by planets closer to their
host stars, and as a result, are not likely to have had enough
time to circularize their orbits. Additionally, these longer pe-
riod systems enable us to explore the ""reinflation"" scenario,
an area TESS should make a huge impact in given its high
photometric precision. By continuing to discover and char-
acterize new giant planets at longer periods, we can look for
evidence (through their eccentricity distribution) of the dom-
inant migration mechanism. Additionally, TESS will provide
a complete magnitude-limited sample of hot Jupiters (P<10
days, Zhou et al. 2019), allowing us to test whether multi-
ple populations exist within the distribution of key parame-
ters (mass, radius, eccentricity), where some tentative trends
have been suggested (Nelson et al. 2017; Ikwut-Ukwa et al.
2021). Here we provide a short overview of our global fit re-
sults on each of the five new systems. We note that all three"
"of the planets found to be orbiting subgiant host stars (TOI-
640, TOI-1333, and TOI-1601) reside in circular orbits."
4.1. TOI-628 b
"TOI-628 (TIC 281408474) is a V =10.18 late-F star with
a mass of M∗ = 1.311+0.066−0.075 M�, radius of R∗ = 1.345"
"+0.046
−0.040"
"R�, and an age of 1.28+1.6−0.91 Gyr. Its planetary companion
(TOI-628 b) has a radius of RP = 1.060+0.041−0.034 RJ, a mass of
MP = 6.33+0.29−0.31 MJ, and is on a 3.4096-day period orbit. Our
global analysis measures a non-zero orbital eccentricity of e
= 0.072+0.021"
"−0.023. Within our global fit, we derive a circular-
ization timescale of τcirc = 3.32+0.53−0.61 Gyr (for this system,
assuming equilibrium tides and tidal quality factors for the
planet and star of Qp 106 and Q∗ 106 Adams & Laughlin
2006) for this system, which is longer than our estimated age
from MIST of 1.28+1.6"
"−0.91 Gyr. Thus the small but non-zero
eccentricity is likely a vestige of the initially high eccentric-
ity that the planet obtained during some process that initiated
high-eccentricity migration, a high eccentricity that was sub-
sequently damped to the eccentricity we see today. Without a
tighter constraint on the system’s age, this is not conclusive.
Also of interest is the high mass of TOI-628 b, which makes
it one of only a few dozen known hot Jupiters with a mass
>6 MJ, and the most massive hot Jupiter found from TESS to
date (see Figure 7)."
4.2. TOI-640 b
"The host star TOI-640 (TIC 147977348) is an F-star with
a mass of 1.526+0.072"
"−0.079 M� and a radius of 2.082
+0.064
−0.058 R�."
"The host star appears to be just transitioning off the main se-
quence into the subgiant branch as suggested by our mea-
sured logg = 3.987+0.030"
"−0.036 dex (cm s
−2) and corresponding"
"tight age constraint within our global fit from the MIST evo-
lutionary tracks of 1.99+0.55"
"−0.40 Gyr. It hosts a planetary com-
panion, TOI-640 b, which is highly inflated (RP = 1.771+0.060−0.056
RJ) Jupiter mass (MP = 0.88± 0.16 MJ) planet with a near
integer orbital period of 5.0037775± 0.0000048 days. The
orbit of the planet is consistent with circular, e = 0.050+0.054"
"−0.035.
It is only the third hot Jupiter known with a highly inflated
radius (RP>1.7) and on a period >5 days, joining KELT-12
b (Stevens et al. 2017) and Kepler-435 b (Almenara et al.
2015). Interestingly, TOI-640 b is almost a twin of KELT-
12 b, in that they are highly inflated Jupiter-mass planets on
∼5 day orbits around similar subgiant host stars. All three
host stars in this regime are evolved, possibly suggesting that
the inflation is a result of the host star’s recent evolution (As-
sef et al. 2009; Spiegel & Madhusudhan 2012; Hartman &
Bakos 2016; Lopez & Fortney 2016). Similarly to KELT-
12b and Kepler-435 b, we see no evidence of any significant
eccentricity."

a mass of MP = 2.37± 0.24 MJ, and an eccentricity that is

"−0.052). This is not surpris-
ing given that our derived circularization timescale, 1.29+0.37"
"−0.33
Gyr, is similar to the age of the system."
"In the case of TOI-1333, we have measured a periodic-
ity of ∼5.3 days from the ground-based and TESS photom-
etry (we note that WASP identified a period 3× this). We
have also measured a vsin I∗ of 16.5±0.5 km s−1. If the
periodicity identified in the photometry indeed is the aver-
age rotation period of the host star, then we can estimate
the inclination of the host star’s rotation axis and compare
it to the derived inclination of TOI-1333 b’s orbit follow-
ing the methodology presented in Masuda & Winn (2020).
Using the EXOFASTv2 implementation of a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo, we run a simple fit of the host star’s rotational
velocity and its projection onto our line of sight (vsin I∗)
using the values from our global fit for Rstar (1.925+0.064"
"−0.063
R�), the derived rotational period of TOI-1333 from TESS
and KELT (5.3 days), and the vsin I∗ from the TRES spec-
troscopy (14.2±0.5 km s−1) to calculate the inclination of
TOI-1333’s rotation axis (relative to our line of sight). The
latitudes on the Sun that show star spots have a differen-"
"tial rotation on the surface of a few percent. Therefore, we
place a 3% error on the rotational velocity for this analysis.
We require the same Gelman-Rubin statistic (<1.01) and in-
dependent draw (>1000) for convergence as the default for
EXOFASTv2. We derive the inclination of the rotation axis
to be 51.3◦+3.5"
"◦
−3.3◦ . From our global fit, TOI-1333 b has an in-"
"clination of 85.70◦+1.3
◦"
"−0.65◦ , suggesting that the rotation axis of
the star and the orbital plane are misaligned. TOI-1333 b
is an excellent candidate to confirm this result through spin-
orbit alignment (λ) measurements using the R-M or Doppler
tomography techniques. The planet’s orbit is also misaligned
with the orbit of the wide binary companion TOI-1333 B, for
which we measured an inclination of 125+18"
"−10 degrees from
our LOFTI analysis. Interestingly, we do not detect a sig-
nificant orbital eccentricity from our global fit for TOI-1333
b (though a small eccentricity is still possible) but this sug-
gested misalignment might be a remnant left over from high
eccentricity migration. The likely bound companion at 470
au (see §2.6.2) could be responsible for Kozai-Lidov migra-
tion of the planet."
4.4. TOI-1478 b
"TOI-1478 (TIC 409794137, V = 10.81) is a Sun-like G-
dwarf with radius of R∗ = 1.048+0.030−0.029 R�, mass of M∗
= 0.946+0.059"
"−0.041 M�, and an age of 9.2
+3.1
−3.9 Gyr. Orbiting"
"TOI-1478 is a warm-Jupiter with a period of 10.180249±
0.000015 days, a radius of RP = 1.060+0.040−0.039 RJ, a mass of
MP = 0.851+0.052−0.047 MJ, and resides in a circular orbit (e =
0.024+0.032"
"−0.017). TOI-1478 b is the longest period planet in our
sample, and the planet and its host star (other than their or-"
EVERYBODY GETS A GIANT PLANET! 21
"bital distances) resemble the Sun and Jupiter in mass and ra-
dius, possibly an example of an alternate outcome of our own
Solar System. As a result of the long orbital period, the tidal
forces on TOI-1478 b are too weak to have circularized the
orbit. Therefore, the lack of a significant eccentricity could
suggest a more dynamically quiescent migration history."
4.5. TOI-1601 b
"In the case of TOI-1601 b, our global model showed a
clear bimodality in the posterior distribution of the host star’s
mass and age (See §3.1). This is likely due to the host star’s
evolutionary status, because the star sits on the HR diagram
where isochrones cross, so the evolutionary state is ambigu-
ous given the precision of our observations. and to account
for this we extract two separate solutions, one for each peak
in our posteriors. The higher host star mass solution, M∗ =
1.517+0.053"
"−0.049 M�, has a higher probability of being correct at
66.7%, so we adopt this solution for the discussion but both
results are available in Table 4. TOI-1601 (TIC 139375960,
V = 10.71) is an evolved subgiant (logg of 3.940+0.022"
"−0.025 dex
(cm s−2)) with a radius of R∗ = 2.186+0.074−0.063 R�. We estimate
the age of the system within our fit to be 2.64+0.38"
"−0.39 Gyr. TOI-
1601 b is a Jupiter mass planet (0.99± 0.11 MJ) that shows
some inflation (RP = 1.159+0.062−0.059 RJ) and a circular orbit (e
= 0.037+0.045"
"−0.026), 5.331752± 0.000011 day orbit. The spec-
troscopic analysis of the TRES spectra of TOI-1601 shows
some metal enhancement ([Fe/H] = 0.316+0.072"
−0.074).
4.6. TESS’s impact on Giant Planets
"While the primary goal of NASA’s TESS mission is to dis-
cover and measure the masses of small planets (Ricker et al.
2015), TESS has already provided some valuable discoveries
in the field of giant planets (see, e.g., Huang et al. 2020b;
Armstrong et al. 2020; Vanderburg et al. 2020). Given the
minimum∼27 day baseline for any target, and the complete-
ness in the sensitivity of space-based photometry to detect a
hot-Jupiter transit, TESS provides the opportunity to obtain a
near-complete sample of hot Jupiters (Zhou et al. 2019). To
date, TESS has discovered 26 giant planets (MP > 0.4MJ),
16 of which have an orbital period >5.0 days (these numbers
include the five systems presented in this paper and 2 addi-
tional systems from (Ikwut-Ukwa et al. 2021). For compar-
ison, 36 hot Jupiters have been discovered with orbital pe-
riods >5.0 days from ground-based transit surveys (NASA
Exoplanet Archive, Akeson et al. 2013)."
"If giant planets predominantly migrate through dynamical
interactions, we may find evidence of this evolutionary his-
tory in the eccentricity distribution of hot Jupiters, specifi-
cally those that are dynamically young (where the circular-
ization timescale by tidal forces is longer than the age of
the system). Figure 7 shows the current distribution of gi-
ant planet eccentricities as a function of orbital period out to"
"16 days. Those 26 systems discovered by TESS are shown
colored by their host star’s effective temperature. Although
this is not a homogeneous sample, since a variety of differ-
ent analysis methods and assumptions were made within this
population, there is a wider distribution of eccentricities for
those systems with an orbital period> 5 days, where tidal cir-
cularization timescales are longer (Adams & Laughlin 2006).
Interestingly, of the 5 systems presented here, only TOI-628
b has a statistically significantly measured eccentricity (e =
0.072+0.021"
"−0.023), and is consistent with dynamically driven mi-
gration since its estimated age is less than the circularization
time-scale of the orbit. Although the other systems show
some non-zero eccentricities from our global fits, they are
not statistically significant (>3σ) and could be a result of
the Lucy-Sweeney bias (Lucy & Sweeney 1971). We also
note that there is one very massive hot Jupiter in our sam-
ple, TOI-628 b (MP 6.33+0.29−0.31 MJ), and it is the most massive
hot Jupiter discovered to date by TESS (we note that TESS
has discovered a few transiting brown dwarfs, Jackman et al.
2019; Šubjak et al. 2020; Carmichael et al. 2020b,a and WD
1856+534 which has a mass limit <13.8 MJ, Vanderburg
et al. 2020). These massive Jupiters provide a great labo-
ratory to study the effect of high gravity on the atmosphere
of a gas giant, while studying the transition point between
giant planets and brown dwarfs."
5. CONCLUSION
"We present the discovery and characterization of five new
giant planets (TOI-628, TOI-640 b, TOI-1333 b, TOI-1478 b,
and TOI-1601 b) from NASA’s TESS mission. These planets
were discovered in the primary mission using the 30-minute
cadenced, full frame images. Of the systems TOI-640 b,
TOI-1333 b, and TOI-1601 b all orbit stars that appear to
have just evolved off the main sequence entering the subgiant
phase, as suggested by their estimated logg being under 4.1
dex (cm s−2). None of the planets orbiting these subgiants
appear to reside in a significantly eccentric orbits. TOI-628
b is the most massive hot Jupiter discovered by TESS (MP =
6.33+0.29"
"−0.31 MJ), and resides in an eccentric orbit that is con-
sistent with dynamically driven migration. Another planet
from this work, TOI-640 b, is one of the only highly inflated
(> 1.7 RJ) hot Jupiters with an orbital period greater than 5
days. TOI-1478 b is the only planet in this sample with an
orbital period >10 days, and it and its star are similar in size
and mass to Jupiter and the Sun. All five planets orbit bright
(V <10.7) host stars and significantly increase the sample of
well-characterized, long period (>5 day) hot Jupiters, an area
where NASA’s TESS mission should continue to provide a
wealth of discoveries."
