ABSTRACT
"Context. Many if not most planetary nebulae (PNe) are now thought to be the outcome of binary evolutionary scenarios. However
only a few percent of PNe in the Milky Way are known to host binary systems. The high precision repeated observing and long time
baseline of Gaia make it well suited to detect new close binaries through photometric variability.
Aims. We aim to find new close binary central stars of PNe (CSPNe) using data from the Gaia mission, building towards a statistically
significant sample of post common envelope, close binary CSPNe.
Methods. As the vast majority of Gaia sources do not have published epoch photometry, we use the uncertainty in the mean photome-
try as a proxy for determining the variability of our CSPN sample in the second Gaia data release. We derive a quantity that expresses
the significance of the variability, and consider what is necessary to build a clean sample of genuine variable sources.
Results. Our selection recovers a large fraction of the known close binary CSPN population, while other CSPNe lying in the same
region of the parameter space likely represent low-hanging fruit for ground-based confirmatory followup observations. Gaia epoch
photometry for four of the newly identified variable sources confirms that the variability is genuine and consistent with binarity."

1. Introduction
"Planetary Nebulae (PNe) are the product of low and interme-
diate mass stars that underwent extensive mass loss during the
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase. The textbook version of
the story is that PNe are the swan song of stars between 1 and 8
solar masses that are nearing the ends of their lives. Such stars
shed their outer layers, growing brighter and hotter and ionising
the newly formed nebula before ultimately cooling and fading
into white dwarfs. While this explanation may indeed hold for
some PNe, it has become increasingly clear in recent decades
that many of these stars do not die alone: a significant fraction, if
not a majority, of PNe are produced by systems that have under-
gone binary interactions (Miszalski et al. 2009a; Boffin & Jones
2019). Particularly compelling evidence comes from the diverse
range of morphologies observed in PNe (Balick & Frank 2002),
the most dramatic of which are thought to come from the pres-
ence of a close binary companion (Miszalski et al. 2009b; Jones
& Boffin 2017). Some authors have even suggested that binarity
might be a requirement for the formation of a PN, which would
resolve the tension between population synthesis models and the
unexpectedly low number of PNe observed in the Milky Way
(Moe & De Marco 2006)."
"Close binary central stars of PNe are not only relevant for the
study of PNe: they also place important constraints on common-
envelope (CE) theory (Iben & Livio 1993; Yungelson et al.
1993), a poorly understood evolutionary phase that is critical
for the formation of a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena,"
"including cataclysmic variables, low-mass x-ray binaries, type
Ia supernovae, mergers, and gravitational wave sources (Jones
2020). A statistically significant sample of close binary systems
is crucial for observationally constraining the orbital period dis-
tribution, which, in turn, is an important probe of the CE effi-
ciency (Toonen & Nelemans 2013)."
"Such a sample is lacking: the identification of close binary
central stars has been a painstaking process, with only 15 such
systems revealed in the 30 or so years following the discovery
of the first example (see Chapter 3 of Boffin & Jones 2019, for
a historical overview) and the current total standing around 70.
Binarity manifests itself in various ways. Widely separated pairs
can be detected visibly, particularly from space (Ciardullo et al.
1999; Benetti et al. 2003; Liebert et al. 2013), and bright but
close companions produce blended spectra (which can some-
times be confirmed by long-term, high-resolution radial velocity
monitoring; Jones et al. 2017). Radial velocity variations are the
most conclusive evidence but are often difficult to measure due
to contamination from bright nebula lines and spurious variabil-
ity stemming from post-AGB winds (De Marco et al. 2004). The
most dramatic photometric variability comes from eclipses (re-
quiring a lucky alignment of the orbital plane, e.g.; Jones et al.
2019) and/or the irradiation of a cool companion (e.g.; Munday
et al. 2020). In very close systems, tidal distortion can result
in the presence of ellipsoidal modulation in the observed light
curve (e.g.; Santander-García et al. 2015). Detection of photo-
metric variations is also subverted by the presence of a bright
nebula and aggravated by variable seeing conditions for ground-"

"based monitoring (Jones et al. 2015). Space-based photometric
monitoring has shown promising results, with variability in PN
central stars having recently been identified in Kepler/K2 (De
Marco et al. 2015; Jacoby et al. 2020) and TESS (Aller et al.
2020), though the high sensitivity of these missions is somewhat
offset by the low spatial resolution, which dilutes the signal, par-
ticularly in the presence of nearby stars or bright nebulosity."
"The European Space Agency’s Gaia mission (Gaia Collabo-
ration et al. 2016) offers great promise as it tracks not only posi-
tional but also photometric variations, and does so for the whole
sky, including most known PN central stars (Chornay & Walton
2020). Gaia offers high spatial resolution and long time base-
lines at the cost of irregular sampling and a long wait for the
availability of full epoch photometry for all sources. This paper
illustrates the potential of the Gaia mission for the discovery and
characterisation of new binary PN central stars."
2. Variability from mean photometry
"Over the course of Gaia’s mission, any given source is observed
many times. The pattern of the observations is dictated by Gaia’s
scanning law (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016), and the frequency
at which a given source is observed depends on its position in the
sky. The scanning law is such that a source should be observed at
least six separate times over the course of a year, though due to
Gaia’s two telescopes and its rate of rotation, each of those so-
called visibility periods generally has at least two observations
of the source, separated by a few hours (Eyer et al. 2017)."
"A crossing of a source across Gaia’s focal plane is called a
field-of-view (FoV) transit. During an FoV transit a source’s flux
is measured multiple times across different CCDs and through
different passbands. Gaia has three passbands: the main, wide G
band, and the blue GBP and red GRP bands. In the G band there
are typically eight or nine CCD transits per FoV transit; in GBP
and GRP there is one at most."
"For most sources, Gaia’s intermediate data releases include
only the mean photometry in each band, that is, the mean flux Is
and its uncertainty σIs . In the calculation of these quantities in-
dividual CCD flux measurements are weighted by their nominal
precisions (Eq. 6 and Eq. 7 in Carrasco et al. 2016). However the
uncertainty in the mean is based on the observed measurement
scatter, so it may not match that expected from the uncertain-
ties of the individual fluxes. In particular, if a source is variable,
this will manifest as increased scatter and a higher uncertainty.
If variability is the dominant source of the scatter, the amplitude
of that variability can be derived from the published uncertainty."
2.1. Variability amplitude
"The uncertainty in the mean flux of a source published in the
Gaia catalogue is the weighted standard deviation of the individ-
ual flux measurements divided by the square root of the number
of CCD transits NCCD (corresponding to the phot_g_n_obs col-
umn). The weights are not published, but if we assume that the
weights are equal, we can recover the standard deviation of the
fluxes in the G band as"
"√
NCCD σIG , where now IG and σIG are"
"the mean and uncertainty for the G band flux.
Following Mowlavi et al. (2020), Belokurov et al. (2017),"
"and others, we adopt the variability statistic"
"Avar,G ≡
√"
"NCCD
σIG"
"IG
, (1)"
"which is simply the standard deviation of the individual CCD
fluxes as a proportion of the mean flux. This is related to the"
"scatter in the magnitude as follows. Recall that the Gaia G band
magnitude G = −2.5 log10 IG + G0, where G0 is the zeropoint.
For a scatter in the individual flux measurements that is small
relative to the mean flux (Avar,G � 1), the standard deviation σm
of the corresponding magnitudes is"
"σm =
2.5"
"ln 10
Avar,G, (2)"
"using the properties of the derivative (i.e. the first-order Taylor
polynomial)."
"An even more convenient relation comes from assuming that
the variation is sinusoidal, as it often approximately is for close
binary systems. In that case, σm = A /"
"√
2, where A is the sinu-"
"soid’s semi-amplitude. Equivalently, the range 2A is then"
"range G = 2
√"
"2 σm ≈ 3.07 Avar,G (3)"
"where σm is as in Eq. 2. For the full derivation and a deeper
discussion see Mowlavi et al. (2020)."
2.2. Variability significance
"The intrinsic measurement uncertainty varies significantly with
magnitude, increasing for fainter sources due to photon statis-
tics as well as including noticeable features at other magnitudes
related to differences in data acquisition and calibration. It is im-
portant to ascertain whether the apparent variability that we ob-
tain is actually significant. If we had the per-FoV transit uncer-
tainties, we could determine an excess noise statistic analogous
to the unit weight error for astrometric measurements. However,
we do not have those, and, moreover, the errors are heteroscedas-
tic, depending not only on source colour and magnitude, but
varying temporally and spatially due to factors such as straylight
conditions and sky background. Nonetheless the considerations
are broadly similar to those discussed in Lindegren (2018) in
the context of Gaia’s re-normalised unit-weight error (RUWE)
statistic for astrometry."
"With the aim of obtaining a crude significance statistic, we
suppose that there is an intrinsic uncertainty in the flux measure-
ment for a single FoV transit that depends on a source’s magni-
tude and colour, σG = σG(G,C) (where colour is the magnitude
difference between the GBP and GRP bands, GBP – GRP). We refer
to the standard deviation of the observed fluxes across different
FoV transits for a given source using σG, obs; in general this will
only match σG in the limit of a large number of samples."
"The arrangement of CCDs on Gaia’s focal plane results in
sources having an average of 8.86 G band flux measurements per
FoV transit (Jordi et al. 2010). As CCD transits occur sequen-
tially and the FoV transit time is tens of seconds (Riello et al.
2018), intrinsic source variability on any much larger timescale
contributes to flux scatter only across different FoV transits.
Thus we focus on FoV rather than CCD transits, and define the
effective number of samples k ≡ NFOV ≡ NCCD/8.86."
"For constant sources, values of σ2G, obs will follow a χ
2 distri-"
bution with k − 1 degrees of freedom:
"k σ2G, obs ∼ σ
2
G χ"
"2
k−1. (4)"
"This will not match the distribution that we observe, not only
because of the simplifying assumptions, but because all stars
are variable at some level. However the mode of the distribution
should not be too affected by the addition of these intrinsically"
"Article number, page 2 of 10"
N. Chornay et al.: Towards a more complete sample of binary central stars of planetary nebulae with Gaia
"variable sources, so, as the mode of χ2k−1 is (k − 1) − 2, we can
find σG as"
σ2G = mode
" k σ2G, obs(k − 1) − 2
 , (5)"
"assuming that the empirical distribution of σ2G, obs over which the
mode is taken is appropriately smoothed."
"For sufficiently large k, the χ2k−1 distribution can be approx-
imated as a normal distribution with matching mean k − 1 and
variance 2(k − 1):"
"k σ2G, obs
σ2G"
"∼ χ2k−1 ≈ N(k − 1, 2(k − 1)). (6)"
"This can be related to a standard normal by subtracting the mean
and dividing by the square root of the variance:√"
"k − 1
2"
" k σ2G, obs(k − 1) σ2G − 1
 ∼ N(0, 1). (7)"
"The term on the left is a dimensionless measure of significance,
which can be further approximated for convenience as a natu-
ral logarithm using the relation x ≈ ln (1 + x) for small x (as
the part inside the parenthesis is close to zero). Furthermore, an
additional magnitude- and colour-dependent scale factor can be
added to ensure that the variance is indeed 1 (in practice, to en-
sure that the left side of the distribution has variance 1, as the
right side includes most variable sources). This gives"
"√
k − 1"
" k σ2G, obs(k − 1) σ2G
 (8)"
"where D is the variability significance and D0 = D0(G,C) is
the scale factor. It is straightforward to compare this form of the
expression to the logarithm of our variability amplitude Avar,G."
"In Eq. 8 the significance of any observed variability increases
with the number of FoV transits k. However as k increases, the
simplifying assumptions (rather than statistical properties) will
increasingly contribute to the observed scatter."
"We determine σG and D0 empirically using a representa-
tive sample of Gaia sources. We bin sources by magnitude and
colour and calculate σG and D0 using the distribution of flux un-
certainties in each bin. Interpolating between these values yields
two-dimensional functions of magnitude and colour that we use
to compute the variability significance for individual sources."
3. Results
"We apply our methodology to the CSPN catalogue of Chornay
& Walton (2020). That catalogue was generated using an au-
tomated method to match CSPNe with sources in Gaia data
release 2 (DR2), and includes a reliability parameter (between
0 and 1) that indicates the certainty of the match. We expect
that Gaia’s early data release 3 (EDR3) will not significantly
change the results; in particular it does not contain any new
epoch photometry or variability analysis that can be used to val-
idate our assumptions, and any new detections will be for faint
sources where only the most extreme variability would be de-
tectable. We join our catalogue with a compilation of known and
suspected binary CSPNe from literature,1 excluding one extra-
galactic PN and six objects identified as non-PNe in the Hong
Kong/AAO/Strasbourg Hα (HASH) PN catalogue of Parker et al.
(2016), while adding PHR J1040-5417 (Hillwig et al. 2017).

sample. Filled markers are known or suspected binary systems of differ-
ent observational types; see text for description. Lines indicate constant
variability significance D for different numbers of FoV transits N."
3.1. Known binaries
"Fig. 1 shows the variability amplitude plotted against Gaia G
magnitude for the sources in our sample, colour-coded by binary
type. The sample has been filtered by CSPN match certainty (re-
liability > 0.5) and PN angular size (radius ≥ 10′′; see Sect. 3.2
for motivation) giving 683 objects in total (see Table 1)."
"Non-variable binaries (blue) include those with composite
spectra and those detected (or hypothesised) based on infrared
excess. Visual binaries (green) have typically been discovered
through high resolution Hubble Space Telescope imagery (and
appear blended in ground-based imagery), but do not have mea-
sured radial velocity or photometric variation. Long period bi-
naries (orange) have composite spectra and measured periods
(using radial velocity variations) on the order of years. Some
exhibit shorter timescale variability due to rotation. Short period
or close binaries (red) generally exhibit the greatest photometric
variability. These have typical periods less than a day, with only
a few between 2 and 20 days. Half-filled red circles are possible
short period binaries whose nature is still uncertain: the recent
discoveries in TESS from Aller et al. (2020), objects designated
as in need of further study by Miszalski et al. (2011), and Pa 5
from Kepler (De Marco et al. 2015). A few short period binaries
had also been noted previously as visual binaries or composite
spectra; in these cases the short period binarity takes precedence.
The remainder of the sample (objects of unknown binarity) are
shown as empty circles. Markers outlined in black are objects
that have low astrometric error (RUWE < 3; see Sect. 3.2) and
significant variability (D > 8; see Sect. 3.3)."
"The lines in the plot are lines of constant variability signifi-
cance D = 0 and D = 8 (see Eq. 8) for a source with a represen-
tative CSPN colour, that is, GBP – GRP = 0 (this value, which is
the 44th percentile of the colours of the CSPNe in the plot, is also
used for sources with no colour information). The D = 8 line is
split into two different lines for 15 and 30 FoV transits, which are
typical counts representing the 21st and 63rd percentile of NFOV
for CSPNe in the sample. D scales with the square root of NFOV
(k in Eq. 8 and preceding equations). The non-monotonic pat-
tern in typical photometric uncertainty is evident, and is similar
in shape to the magnitude error distribution in Fig. 9 of Evans
et al. (2018), with peaks around G = 11 and 13 due to differ-
ent instrumental configurations (gates and window classes; Car-
rasco et al. 2016) affecting calibration. Towards fainter magni-
tudes, where photon noise dominates, the errors increase more"

"Fig. 2. Same as Fig. 1, but for short period binaries only and with no
minimum radius cut. The relaxation of the radius requirement means
that not every point on this plot has a corresponding red circle in Fig. 1.
Different marker shapes indicate different means of binarity detection,
with filled markers being eclipsing (possibly in addition to another type
of photometric variation)."
"predictably. Though not shown in the plot, the intrinsic scatter
for sources with extreme colours (e.g. very blue CSPNe) also
tends to be higher, particularly at brighter magnitudes, though
the overall shape of the magnitude dependence is the same."
"In Fig. 2 we further break down known close binary systems
by the type of variability. The criteria for inclusion are loosened
relative to Fig. 1 in order to increase the sample size (see counts
in Table 1). The greatest variability is evident in irradiated bina-
ries. Ellipsoidal modulation generally produces a smaller effect,
while most binaries that have been detected solely through ra-
dial velocity variation (spectroscopic binaries, shown as upward
pointing triangles) have no significant photometric variability in
Gaia, being e.g. double degenerate systems such as Fg 1 (Bof-
fin et al. 2012) and NGC 2392 (Miszalski et al. 2019). Of the
systems with low Gaia variability, only AMU 1 has been pre-
viously identified as a photometric variable, with Kepler pho-
tometry revealing low-amplitude modulation due to relativistic
Doppler boosting (De Marco et al. 2015)."
"These figures demonstrate the power of the scatter in the
Gaia mean photometry. Comparing Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 we can see
that all short period binaries in the sample of extended PN with
CSPNe brighter than G = 19 that have ground-based detections
of photometric variability (i.e. that are not solely spectroscopic
binaries) also have significant variability in Gaia, with variabil-
ity amplitudes corresponding to peak-to-peak amplitudes of at
least 0.1 mag in the G band (around the limit of what is de-
tectable from the ground). The only confidently known extended
binary fainter than G = 19, MPA J1759-3007, is visibly sepa-
rated from the trend, but has a low number of FoV transits and
narrowly fails to meet the D > 8 significance cut."
3.2. Other sources of photometric scatter
"Without time series photometry it is difficult to distinguish be-
tween genuine variability (possibly related to binarity) and un-
usually high photometric scatter. Being bright, extended objects,
PNe are particularly likely to cause problems for Gaia. In this
section we consider possible sources of spurious variability."
"Only single stars are modelled in the Gaia DR2 astrometric
solution. The quality of that fit is indicated by the re-normalised
unit-weight error (RUWE) statistic (Lindegren 2018). Unre-
solved binary systems can introduce wobble in the location of"

"the flux maximum, which will contribute to a poor fit and a
high value of RUWE (Belokurov et al. 2020), though this is
most noticeable for sources near us (within a few hundred par-
secs). For visible binaries separated by less than 0.4′′, astro-
metric issues can also be caused by the two components of a
binary being detected separately and later incorrectly merged
into a single source (Antoja et al. 2018), in which case the
duplicated_source flag will be set. Such merging is also
likely to manifest as spurious photometric variability if the com-
ponents have different magnitudes. Partially resolved binary sys-
tems could also cause issues for Gaia’s point/line spread func-
tion fitting, introducing a scan angle dependence to the flux and
position measurements."
"The top panel of Fig. 3 shows RUWE versus the variabil-
ity amplitude significance, with the same colouring scheme as
in Fig. 1. All known extended short period binary systems (red
points) have RUWE < 3, with most having RUWE < 1.4, 1.4 be-
ing the rather conservative cutoff for well-behaved sources sug-
gested by Lindegren (2018). Such values suggest that the pho-
tometric scatter is real rather than due to cross-matching or fit
issues. Several visual binaries (green) have significant variabil-
ity and high RUWE values. These pairs are typically separated
by around 0.3′′, a separation at which they can be resolved by
Gaia but then are merged into a single source. This merging is
likely responsible for both the high photometric scatter and poor
astrometric fit."
"Several visual binaries also have relatively high photomet-
ric excess factors (middle panel of Fig. 3), as the window used
for GBP and GRP photometry captures both members of the pair.
However the distinction between well-behaved sources and not
is less clear than for RUWE, as other features such as crowded
fields and bright nebulae can also contaminate the GBP and GRP
photometry without necessarily introducing spurious variability
in the G band. The suggested excess factor threshold from Evans
et al. (2018) for an object with GBP – GRP = 0 is shown for ref-
erence, though it is too conservative for our application and we
do not use any cut based on excess factor."
"The lower panel of Fig. 3 shows the relation between vari-
ability significance and nebula radius. There is a notable ex-
cess of high variability objects at smaller radii. This is not sur-
prising, as these nebulae tend be brighter, and thus introduce
an additional source of sky background. Compact nebulae can
also cause the sorts of astrometric issues described previously.
Known binaries at smaller radii do exhibit significant variability,"

Gaia photometry. Markers are different binary types as in Fig. 1. Ver-
tical lines correspond to the lines of constant variability significance in
Fig. 1. The significance of the horizontal lines is described in the text.
Duplicated sources in Gaia are indicated in the upper plot with + sym-
bols. PNe in the upper and middle plots are limited to a minimum radius
of 10′′ (corresponding to the selection in Fig. 1), while the lower plot
has no such restriction."
"but precisely selecting them is difficult. Thus we adopt a mini-
mum radius of 10′′ in our selection."
3.3. New candidate binaries
"Markers outlined in black in Fig. 1 are objects that have signifi-
cant Gaia variability (D > 8) and low astrometric error (RUWE
< 3), in addition to meeting reliability > 0.5 and radius ≥ 10′′ cri-
teria common to all objects in the extended sample. We choose
the criteria, in particular the threshold D = 8, as a balance be-
tween precision and recall, with the aim of selecting known short
period binaries (red points in Fig. 3). The 92 objects meeting
these criteria represent 13% of that sample overall, but include
27 short period binaries (77% of those in the sample), as well
as 4 long period binaries exhibiting shorter timescale variability,
and 1 visual binary with a borderline RUWE value."
"This leaves 58 objects that are not previously known or sus-
pected binaries but exhibit significant variability in Gaia. Of
them, 43 have log variability amplitude > −1.5, suggestive of
a level of variability that, if real, should be recoverable from
ground-based followup. Confirming and measuring the periods
of these systems, even at a moderate success rate, would dramat-
ically increase the sample of known binary CSPNe. The list of
these objects is given in Table A.1."
"Such a wealth of previously undiscovered binaries is not un-
expected. An unbiased ground-based survey, OGLE-III, previ-
ously found a close binary fraction of 12–21% (Miszalski et al.
2009a). Our sample of extended PNe (radii ≥ 10′′) with well-
behaved astrometry (RUWE < 3) and bright central stars (G <
18) contains 318 PNe. Of these 9–11% are known short period
binaries. If we were to assume that all of the detected variables"

sus magnitude plot. Labelled objects are PNe with extreme ADFs that
are not previously known binaries. Marker colours indicate type of bina-
rity if known, and the grey lines are the same lines of constant variability
significance shown in Fig. 1. Likewise, markers outlined in black have
the same meaning as in Fig. 1."
"with log variability amplitude > −1.5 are indeed binaries (i.e.
trying to recreate the limits of the OGLE survey) we would find
a binary fraction of 18%, consistent with the range from OGLE.
The estimate depends on the particular thresholds chosen, and
misses spectroscopic binaries, but this consistency supports the
hypothesis that many of the newly discovered variables are in-
deed binaries."
3.4. Nebular chemistry
"One strong indicator of PN central star binarity is a high abun-
dance discrepancy factor (ADF; Wesson et al. 2018). This is the
ratio of abundances of the same species derived from recombi-
nation lines of a photoionised nebula to those derived from col-
lisionally excited lines. It has a median value of 2.6 for PNe.
Extreme values of the ADF (ADF > 5) in PNe are associated
with close binary central stars with a period of the order of a day
or less. Showing that some of the variables in our sample exhibit
such extreme ADFs would strengthen the link."
"We join our catalogue with a compilation of literature ADF
values,2 and again require reliability > 0.5 but relax the angu-
lar size cut to include more compact PNe (radii ≥ 5′′). The 50
objects that passed these cuts (out of the 123 Galactic PNe with
literature ADFs) are shown in Fig. 4. There are 21 PNe exhibit-
ing extreme ADFs, of which 12 are already known or suspected
to harbour close binaries."
"As in Fig. 1, the lines indicate constant variability signifi-
cance D = 0 and D = 8, and circles with black outlines are
sources with both RUWE < 3 and D > 8. The sources above the
D = 8 lines without black outlines have high RUWE values; the
bias of the ADF sample towards compact, bright PNe, which are
more amenable to spectroscopy, likely contributes to the larger
proportion of astrometric issues relative to the sample in Fig. 1.
These issues could in turn be responsible for some of the ob-
served photometric scatter (as it seems to be for some sources in
the top panel of Fig. 3), though the observed scatter still serves
as an upper bound."
"With that in mind, it is reassuring that, of the extreme ADF
sample, only NGC 40 does not show at least some variability.
Along with NGC 40, NGC 2022 and M 1-42 have so far eluded"

"ground-based detections of periodic variability. From Fig. 4 we
can see that variation in the CSPN of NGC 2022 seems likely
to be genuine (D = 5.7, RUWE = 1.4) but on the threshold of
ground-based detectability, while for M 1-42 with high variabil-
ity significance D = 13.3 but RUWE = 3.0, the situation is less
clear. Of the remaining extreme ADF objects, four have signifi-
cant variability and low RUWE (though most of their amplitudes
are again likely to be difficult to detect from the ground), while
NGC 2440 has an extreme RUWE value that makes its apparent
variability inconclusive, and H 1-41 has a moderate variability
significance of D = 6.8, which may be improved in the future
with more observations."
"Thus, from the Gaia data alone, we can conclude that NGC
40 is unlikely to have strong photometric variability (though that
of course does not preclude it from being a binary), but only state
for other extreme ADF objects that their photometric scatters
are consistent with variability caused by binarity. Light curves
are needed to ascertain whether there is a periodic component to
the scatter of these objects, and whether the period matches the
expectation from Wesson et al. (2018), who found that extreme-
ADF PNe have central stars with periods of less than 1.15 days."
4. Light curves from epoch photometry
"Characterisation of variable sources in Gaia DR2 is limited
to about 550 000 sources that were classified as VARIABLE
by Gaia’s own analysis (Holl et al. 2018). Epoch photom-
etry (flux measurements for a source at each FoV transit)
is published for all of these sources, as well as a table
(vari_time_series_statistics) of summary statistics de-
rived from that photometry. Around 3000 sources exhibiting
short timescale variability additionally have frequency informa-
tion published in the vari_short_timescale table."
"However completeness is low: only four of the known short
period binary CSPNe are classified as VARIABLE, despite many
more being known to exhibit strong photometric variability, and
only two of them have frequencies recovered by Gaia. Addition-
ally four other sources are classified as VARIABLE that are not
previously known binaries. All eight of these VARIABLE sources
were also identified in our selection as significantly variable
based on their flux uncertainties. Though they represent only a
fraction of such sources, their epoch photometry offers a window
through which to probe the nature of their variability, as well as
the assumptions that went into our analysis."
4.1. Frequency extraction
"We performed Lomb-Scargle analysis (using the implementation
of VanderPlas & Ivezić 2015) on the eight G band light curves in
order to extract periodic variability, with a grid of 106 frequen-
cies logarithmically spaced between 10−1.5 and 101.5 days−1. We
select the frequency at the peak with the highest power, and fit
the light curves to a sinusoid"
"G(t) = A sin(2π f t + φ) + c, (9)"
"where A and c are the amplitude and offset in mags, f is
the frequency in days−1, t is the Barycentric Julian Date (JD)
in Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB) relative to 2010-01-
01T00:00:00, and φ is the phase. We determine these param-
eters through least squares optimisation, allowing the frequency
to vary within a small range close to the highest power frequency
extracted from the periodogram."

4.2. Results
"Table 2 contains the parameters of the best fits. Derived phase-
folded light curves and residuals are shown in Fig. 5 for known
binaries and Fig. 6 for new candidates. All eight VARIABLE
sources have good fits, and three out of the four derived periods
for known binary systems also match literature values."
"One exception is Abell 41, where our derived period is half
that in literature (Jones et al. 2010). The variability of Abell 41 is
believed to be due to ellipsoidal modulation and partial eclipses,
so it has two minima per orbit, and the shape of its folded light
curve is different from the others in the sample and less well
described by a sinusoid. We have plotted the folded light curve
for Abell 41 at double our derived period to reflect this, though
the difference e.g. in the depths of the minima is difficult to see
with Gaia’s sparse sampling (cf. Fig. 2 of Bruch et al. 2001)."
"The known irradiated binary PHR J1040-5417 has deep pri-
mary eclipses (Hillwig et al. 2017) that are not visible in the
epoch photometry; instead there is a gap at the light curve min-
imum. The eclipse is deep enough that it would be close to the
detection limit of Gaia DR2; however comparison with the Gaia
scanning law shows that this gap also exists in the sampling."
"The four newly discovered variable CSPNe are those of Cr
1, KTC 1, Kn 124, and Pa 48. All of these PNe are relatively re-
cent discoveries; only Cr 1 and KTC 1 (Jacoby et al. 2010) have
spectroscopic confirmation of their PN status. Kn 124 and Pa
48 (Kronberger et al. 2016) do not and are only listed as possible
and likely PNe in the HASH PN catalogue. None have published
narrowband imagery or morphological information."
"The G band light curves of these newly discovered variables
are well described by sinusoidal fits. The shape, amplitude, and
periods of the curves are consistent with irradiation effects, in
which one side of a cool companion is heated by the CSPN and
contributes to the flux of the system most when it is directly be-
hind the CSPN; i.e. the hot side is facing the observer. With irra-
diation effects there is one flux maximum per orbit, so the period
of the variation is the period of the binary system. None of the
systems appear to be eclipsing, and the uncertainty in GBP and
GRP is too large to measure any colour effects. We conclude that
they are likely binaries, though constraining the parameters of
the systems is not possible without additional data and is beyond
the scope of this work."

known binaries classified as VARIABLE by Gaia. Red ticks on the periodograms indicate the highest peak, and horizontal dashed lines are false
alarm levels at (from low to high) 10%, 1%, and 0.1%. Powers are normalised relative to the residuals of a constant model, and lie between 0 (no
improvement over constant model) and 1 (periodic model has zero residuals). Error bars are 2σ errors for visibility. An additional half phase is
shown for the light curves and residuals. The light curve and residuals for Abell 41 are folded at double the derived period (see text)."
"Fig. 6. Same as Fig. 5, but for new candidate binaries."
4.3. Relation to mean photometry
"The additional data in the epoch photometry tables help to
validate some of our assumptions in Sect. 2 albeit with
a very small sample. For the eight VARIABLE sources in
the vari_time_series_statistics table, the mean of
phot_g_n_obs / num_selected_g_fov (i.e. NCCD/NFOV ) is"
"8.89 ± 0.29, consistent with our choice of 8.86. The mean ra-
tio of G range to Avar,G is 3.15 ± 0.10, slightly higher than but
consistent with the value in Eq. 3 (though Eq. 3 applies only in
the limit of uniform dense sampling)."
"Subtracting the best fit sinusoids removes most of the peri-
odic variability, though HFG 1 in particular shows some in its
residuals (Fig. 5, right panels) that would be easily accounted"

"Fig. 7. Initial variability (points) and residual variability (arrow tips) of
Gaia VARIABLE sources after subtracting sinusoidal fits from the epoch
photometry. The black lines are the same lines of constant variability
significance shown in Fig. 1."
"for by adding a second higher-frequency term to its fit. The am-
plitude of the remaining variability (derived from the weighted
variance of the residuals of the sinusoidal fits) is shown in Fig. 7.
The significance of most of the residuals is low. The low residual
variability of Cr 1 and KTC 1 compared to typical CSPNe is due
to their relatively red central stars, which have a lower intrinsic
measurement uncertainty."
5. Conclusions
"Gaia shows tremendous promise for the study of CSPNe.
Though Gaia’s own variability processing is quite limited, com-
bining the scatter in the photometry with the notion of variabil-
ity significance introduced in this work allows us to retrieve
a large fraction of the binary systems that have been discov-
ered from painstaking ground-based observations over the past
decades. The newly discovered likely variables offer a promising
set of targets for ground-based photometric followups, building
towards a statistically significant sample of post-AGB, post-CE
stars. Many of their nebulae have chemistry or morphology typ-
ically associated with binarity. Selecting targets on variability,
rather than expectations of binarity based on other features, will
help us study how these features relate to binarity in a less biased
manner, in addition to increasing the expected success rate."
"With available Gaia epoch photometry we have shown that
we can recover periods for four known binary CSPNe, and con-
firmed that four of the previously unknown variable sources have
light curves consistent with binarity. This lends weight to our hy-
pothesis that many of the variables that we have identified from
their mean photometry are indeed binaries."
"Completeness and accuracy will improve with future Gaia
data releases, with more transits increasing the statistical signifi-
cance of any observed excess variability. Improved photometric
processing and handling of non-single systems will reduce spu-
rious sources of photometric scatter, and ultimately epoch pho-
tometry will enable us to confirm new binary candidates from
the Gaia data alone."
