"ABSTRACT
We identify a set of planetary systems observed by Kepler that merit transit-timing varia-"
"tion (TTV) analysis given the orbital periods of transiting planets, the uncertainties for their
transit times, and the number of transits observed during the Kepler mission. We confirm
the planetary nature of four Kepler Objects of Interest within multicandidate systems. We
forward-model each of the planetary systems identified to determine which systems are likely
to yield mass constraints that may be significantly improved upon with follow-up transit ob-
servations. We find projected TTVs diverge by more than 90 minutes after 6000 days in 27
systems, including 22 planets with orbital periods exceeding 25 days. Such targets would
benefit the most from additional transit-timing data. TTV follow-up could push exoplanet
characterization to lower masses, at greater orbital periods and at cooler equilibrium temper-
atures than is currently possible from the Kepler dataset alone. Combining TTVs and recently
revised stellar parameters, we characterize an ensemble of homogeneously selected planets
and identify planets in the Kepler field with large-enough estimated transmission annuli for
atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope."
1. INTRODUCTION
"Characterizing the masses of transiting planets is of particular value in comparative planetary science.
Measuring both planetary sizes and masses permits estimates of bulk density and hence a planet’s com-
position. Characterizing the host-star properties and the orbital period permits an estimate of a planetary
equilibrium temperature, which combined with planetary mass and radius measurements constrains the at-
mospheric scale height. In some cases, though not yet among Kepler planets, transmission spectroscopy
has permitted the retrieval of atmospheric atomic or molecular species (see summaries: Stevenson 2016;
Crossfield & Kreidberg 2017)."
"The Kepler mission led to the discovery of thousands of exoplanets in a wide variety of planetary systems
and characterized their physical radii and orbital periods. A small subset of these exoplanets, ≈ 30, have
measured masses based on radial velocity spectroscopy (RV). In addition, from a set of multiplanet systems
with measurably interacting neighbors, transit-timing variations (TTVs) have permitted mass measurements
of ≈ 73 transiting planets, including planets as small as Mars (Jontof-Hutter et al. 2015; Mills & Fabrycky
2017) and at orbital periods up to 191 days (Ofir et al. 2014)."
"TTVs have proven to be complementary to RV mass characterizations. Both techniques have observational
biases which lead them to probe different regions of parameter space in orbital period, mass and radius, with"

"RV dominating at short periods. For given masses and orbital period ratio, TTVs increase in signal strength
with orbital period and have enabled low-mass characterizations at orbital distances beyond the reach of RV
surveys (Steffen 2016; Mills & Mazeh 2017). Fortunately, there is some overlap in the two techniques, and
several systems in the Kepler field benefit from both RV and TTV detections (e.g. Kepler-9, Borsato et al.
2019; Kepler-18, Cochran et al. 2011; Kepler-89, Masuda et al. 2013; Weiss et al. 2013)."
"The most precise TTV characterizations are among systems where the timescales of TTVs are less than
the time span of the photometric data. For example, planet pairs near first-order mean motion resonances
with TTV periodicities from several hundred days to roughly the four-year photometric baseline of Kepler
have been studied by several authors and have productively populated the planetary ""mass-radius diagram""
(e.g., Xie 2014; Jontof-Hutter et al. 2016; Hadden & Lithwick 2017). In addition, in some cases, TTVs are
detectable at period ratios far from first-order resonances due to higher-order resonances (e.g., Kepler-29,
Jontof-Hutter et al. 2016), or synodic encounters (Kepler-36, Deck et al. 2012). While TTV signal strength
increases with orbital period, this is tempered by the limited number of transits for long-period systems,
where there are too few data points to uniquely invert the TTV signal for planet masses and eccentricities,
even with precisely measured transit times."
"It is therefore imperative to monitor future transits in multiplanet systems by ground-based or space-
based observatories. Von Essen et al. (2018) and Vissapragada et al. (2020) have begun this process for
select systems in the Kepler field. In some cases, follow-up transit data will not meaningfully improve the
TTV mass constraints for decades; such is the pristine quality of the Kepler data. The first aim of this study
is to identify which targets in the Kepler field have their TTVs tightly constrained well into the future from
the Kepler dataset, and which planets have uncertain future transit times. The latter group may have their
masses meaningfully constrained by additional transit-timing data. Identifying these candidates optimizes
the efficiency of follow-up campaigns."
"The second aim of this study is to characterize the masses and densities of a homogeneously selected
sample of candidate TTV planets independently of whether TTVs have been clearly detected or analyzed
in prior studies. The majority of our sample has been studied by other authors, and in many cases, detailed
TTV modeling by prior authors has not been improved upon. Nevertheless, since the first data releases of
Gaia (Andrae et al. 2018), improved precision on stellar parameters for Kepler hosts has enabled more pre-
cise planetary characterizations. Furthermore, 11 systems with previously unreported mass constraints are
presented here for the first time. We envision this sample will prove valuable for future detailed population
studies of TTV systems."
"The third aim of this study is to estimate the atmospheric scale heights and transmission annuli of our
planet sample, and hence identify which targets in the Kepler field likely have detectable atmospheres in the
limit of cloud-free or haze-free transmission annuli."
2. SYSTEM SELECTION
"There have been several studies of Kepler planetary systems observed to have significant TTVs. Near-
resonant planet pairs have a TTV period and amplitude that can be measured to infer planet masses and
constrain free orbital eccentricity components (Lithwick et al. 2012). Transit-timing catalogs of Mazeh
et al. (2013), Rowe & Thompson (2015), and Holczer et al. (2016) identified several dozen planet pairs with
measurable TTV periodicities and amplitudes appropriate for this solution, enabling TTV systems to yield
estimates of the planetary mass-radius relation (Wu & Lithwick 2013) and eccentricity distribution (Hadden
& Lithwick 2014). This approach has the advantage of an analytical solution that can be computed quickly.
However, it neglects information that remains in the TTVs from nonresonant interactions and higher-order"
"resonances. More detailed analytical solutions (e.g. Agol & Deck 2016a,b) more closely approach the
results of dynamical models to transit-timing data (Jontof-Hutter et al. 2016)."
"Prior studies share the bias of reporting masses and eccentricities among systems with strongly detected
TTVs. This causes difficulty in analyzing such systems as a population. One solution is to perform TTV
models on all systems, which would be numerically expensive. Most of the numerical expense would be
wasted on planet pairs that are unlikely to have any detectable interactions. We address this by selecting our
sample of systems purely on their photometric properties and not on the measured transit times or properties
inferred from TTVs. This makes our sample more amenable to detailed population modeling. In this paper,
we identify a set of systems with planets where there is an expectation of detectable TTVs prior to any TTV
analysis."
"We estimated the minimum expected TTVs among planets in the Kepler dataset given their orbital peri-
ods, and a conservative estimate of their minimum mass given their radii. These of course depend on the
properties of host stars. For the masses of the host stars, we took the nominal values from Fulton & Petigura
(2018) who used Gaia parallaxes to constrain stellar parameters, with ground-based spectral classification
as part of the California Kepler Survey, and for Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) missing from that catalog,
we rely on Berger et al. (2020). For planet sizes we rely on Fulton & Petigura (2018). However, several
planet candidates within multitransiting systems are missing from that catalog, and for these we rely on an
updated, unified catalog of planet transit parameters in preparation (Lissauer et al.)."
We used the following simple mass-radius relation to estimate a minimum mass for every planet:
"Mp,min = min(4,R
3
p), (1)"
"where Mp and Rp are in units of M⊕ and R⊕, respectively. With this simple relation, we ensure that planets
that are Earth-sized have a density equal to Earth, but we neglect the effects of compression for larger
planets. We put a cap on planet masses, to allow for large gaseous envelopes around 4 M⊕ cores."
"Given the wide range of densities observed among planets larger than 1.6 R⊕ (Rogers 2015; Jontof-Hutter
et al. 2016; Wolfgang et al. 2016), this criterion underestimates the mass of many planets but ensures that
all planets included in our sample have an expectation of detectable TTVs."
"We estimated the minimum expected TTVs among planet pairs in our sample with two analytical solutions
for TTVs, for systems of up to four transiting planets. The solution of Agol & Deck (2016a,b) as imple-
mented by TTVfaster analytically calculates transit times that are accurate to first order in the planet-star
mass ratios and in the orbital eccentricities. We found a simple empirical expression for the amplitude of
TTVs for a pair of planets on circular orbits with no mutual inclination. For each model pair, we numeri-
cally measured the difference between the maximum and minimum deviation in transit time from a linear
ephemeris (in minutes) expected from the transits. We fitted empirical models for the minimum expected
nonresonant TTVs of an inner planet (TTV) based on the orbital periods (Pinner and Pouter measured in days,
with ratio (P = PouterPinner ), and the mass ratio of an outer planet to the star (µouter) is approximated as:"
"TTV(mins) & C′
("
"A
P10 +"
"B
P4
)"
"where A = 50×Pinner, B = 6×Pinner and C′ = 104µouter.
A similar exercise on the TTVs of an outer planet (TTV’) based on the perturbations caused by the inner"
planet yields
"TTV′(mins) & C
("
"P13 +
B′"
"where A′ = 100×Pouter, B′ = 16×Pouter and C = 104µinner.
As shown in Figure 1, these empirical fits neglect the sharp peaks in TTV amplitudes near resonance, but"
"they trace the overall trend in expected TTVs for a planet perturbed by a neighbor over a wide range of
period ratios. The sharp features including drops in TTV amplitude precisely at resonance in Figure 1 are
due to the timescale for planetary perturbations to accumulate to detectable TTVs becoming greater than
the 15,000 days used to model the TTVs in TTVfaster."
"We used this empirical model to identify systems from Kepler that ought to have significant TTVs even if
they are not in or near resonance."

mark the two components of the power laws in Equations 2 and 3, and their sums are marked in solid black."
"For planet pairs near (but not in) first-order mean motion resonance, TTVs are observed as a cycle over
the coherence time of two orbital periods, the so-called TTV “superperiod”. We estimated the minimum
amplitude of such TTVs for two interacting planets (V and V ′) using the solution of Lithwick et al. (2012)
and again neglecting eccentricities:"

"where j is an integer that identifies the nearest first-order mean motion resonance such that the ratio of
orbital periods is close to j : j − 1, ∆ = PP′"
"j−1
j − 1 is the distance of the planet pair from exact resonance, and"
"f and g are sums of Laplace coefficients that depend on the orbital period ratio (Lithwick et al. 2012). We
defined the region in period ratios near first-order resonance as bounded by the nearest third-order mean
motion resonances. For example, we estimated the resonant TTV score of all planet pairs near 2:1 such that
the ratio of periods lies in the range [7:4, 5:2]. We included near-first-order resonances up to j = 5 and only
included planet pairs for which ∆< 0.1."
"For each planet in our sample, we estimated the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the TTVs in the
non-resonant regime (using Equations 2 and 3), and the resonant regime (using Equations 4, and 5). For
both, we divided the TTV amplitude by the median transit-timing uncertainty for the planet as reported in
the TTV catalog of Rowe & Thompson (2015) and multiplied by the square root of the number of transits.
Henceforth, we call these criteria for the expected TTVs of a system the “nonresonant detectability score”
and “resonant detectability score” respectively."
"In assessing the expectation of near-resonant TTVs, we included all adjacent pairs among Kepler’s multis
as well as pairs with one intermediate neighbor. For the nonresonant pairs, we estimated the detectability
score of adjacent pairs only. We include only multitransiting planetary systems of four or fewer plane-
tary candidates, since higher-multiplicity systems require significantly more computational time for each
simulation and have more parameters to explore."
"In cases where the transit times of a particular planet candidate were not available in the Rowe & Thomp-
son (2015) catalog, we did not calculate an expected TTV score, with the exception of Kepler-289 (KOI-
1353), which has a confirmed planet without a KOI number (Schmitt et al. 2014). All multitransiting
systems where at least one planet scores >4 on either test are included in our sample. The bar is set low for
this criterion to ensure that we include nondetections in our target list. Note that our list excludes several
systems with detected TTVs since the planetary masses may well be higher than our expected minimum
masses, and our criterion is chosen to ensure that our list of systems is not overwhelmingly dominated by
nondetections. Figure 2 shows a histogram of the expected minimum TTV S/N for all candidates, and it
highlights how unlikely TTVs are among planet pairs within Kepler’s multiplanet systems."

Equation 1. Note the logarithmic scale. Planet candidates with an expected S/N ≥4 (marked as a black line on the
histogram) were selected for further analysis."
"Our search for candidates with an expectation of TTVs was from a sample that includes 680 planetary
candidates in near-resonant pairs and 849 planetary candidates in nonresonant pairs, with substantial over-
lap between these two lists. From these lists, we identified 57 planetary candidates with a nonresonant
detectability score greater than 4, and 72 planetary candidates with a resonant detectability score above 4.
Among these, some were discarded if no satisfactory preliminary fits were found, as explained in detail"
"in the next section. The scores for systems that were ultimately included for further analysis are listed in
Tables 1 and 2."
3. PRELIMINARY TTV MODEL FITTING
"We performed preliminary dynamical fits against cataloged transit-timing data for our selected systems.
Our dynamical models included five parameters for each planet: the orbital period, the time of the first
model transit after epoch BJD-2,455,680.0, the planet-star mass ratio, and the eccentricity vector com-
ponents ecosω and esinω. We assumed orbits are coplanar since mutual inclinations that are significant
enough to cause detectable TTVs are unlikely in multitransiting systems (Fabrycky et al. 2014; Nesvorný
& Vokrouhlický 2014)."
"In many systems, one or more planets were on short orbital periods or had a large period ratio with their
interacting neighbors and hence likely contribute little to the TTVs. For consistency, we included these
planets in our TTV models if their transit times were available, since their mass upper limits may still be
informative."
"In some cases, the transit-timing catalogs of Rowe & Thompson (2015) and Holczer et al. (2016) lack
data on candidates that are potentially interacting. For KOI-1574 (Kepler-87), we relied on the measured
transit times of Ofir et al. (2014), treating it as a three-planet system with candidates orbiting at 5.8, 114.7
and 191.2 days. A fourth candidate discovered in Kepler DR 24 at 8.98 days is potentially interacting with
the innermost planet, but is unlikely to affect the transit times of the outer two planets. For this paper, we
measured long-cadence transit times for KOIs: 520, 750, 1353 and 3503. We have only measured long
cadence times for consistency with other systems studied in this paper, and because long cadence transit-
timing uncertainties were used in the selection of our sample. We leave more detailed studies of individual
systems of interest that we identify in this paper to future authors."
"Planet Hunters discovered a transiting planet at KOI-1353 (PH3 c), which is confirmed as Kepler-289 d
but has no candidate number (Schmitt et al. 2014). A fourth candidate designated as KOI-1353.03 is an
alias of Kepler-289 d and hence a false positive."
"We excluded the potentially false multiplanet system KOI-284 which has transiting planets orbiting at
6.2 and 6.4 days. This may be a binary system with planets orbiting separate stars with similar orbital
periods (Lissauer et al. 2014). KOI-521 and KOI-3444 are flagged as potentially binaries in ExoFOP and
we exclude them from our analysis. KOI-750.04 is marked as a false positive in Kepler DR 25. We exclude
it and treat the remaining candidates as a three-planet system."
"To identify models that closely match the data, we initialized orbital periods and phases assuming a linear
ephemeris, the stellar mass at 1 M� and planetary masses at 6 M⊕. We initialized eccentricities at 0.001 and
performed a grid-search in eccentricity vector components, with periapses initialized at ±45◦ and ±135◦
for each planet. We performed Levenberg-Marquardt minimization of the goodness-of-fit parameter, χ2 and
noted the best-fit model for each system. We identified systems for which we could not find a satisfactory
preliminary model. We excluded systems where the best-fit model had a reduced χ2 > 2.6, where the
reduced χ2 is the goodness-of-fit divided by the degrees of freedom in the model, (number of transits minus
the number of free model parameters). The excluded systems were KOI-94 (red. χ2 = 3.3), KOI-262 (red.
χ2 = 2.8); KOI-312 (red. χ2 = 2.7); KOI-880 (red. χ2 = 7.1), KOI-1236 (red. χ2 = 5.5), KOI-1426 (red. χ2"
"= 16), KOI-1525 (red. χ2 = 10), KOI-1858 (red. χ2 = 4.0), KOI-2038 (red. χ2 = 3.1), KOI-2173 (red. χ2 =
3.8) and KOI-2672 (red. χ2 = 6.0)."
"KOI-3791 (Kepler-460) has two planets and just 10 measured transit times, leaving zero degrees of free-
dom for our model fits. We exclude this system from our sample."

the highest expected TTV signal in its system, and the second and third column respectively list the best non-resonant
TTV scores and resonant TTV scores within that system given the planetary orbital periods, sizes, stellar parameters,
median transit-timing uncertainties and number of measured transit times. The next column list the reduced χ2 for the
best fit model we have found for each system, including all transiting exoplanets with cataloged transit times."
"To sample the mass posteriors of these planets, we used a differential evolution Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (Ter Braak 2006; Jontof-Hutter et al. 2015, 2016), beginning the chains close
to the best-fit model found from our preliminary fitting. We adopted a uniform prior on orbital periods,
initial orbital phases, and (positive, definite) planet-star mass ratios, and a Gaussian prior on eccentricity
vector components with a standard deviation of 0.1. This was chosen to be wide enough to include most
eccentricities typical in multitransiting systems (e∼ 0.032, Fabrycky et al. 2014) but disfavors eccentricities
much higher than 0.1. Higher eccentricities are unlikely since many of the models would be unstable.
However, due to a degeneracy in TTVs, in many cases high eccentricities fit the data well and permit long-
term stability if the orbits are apsidally aligned (Jontof-Hutter et al. 2016; Gratia & Lissauer 2021). Our
prior in eccentricity vector components reduces the number of high-eccentricity models in our posterior
samples (compared to a uniform prior), but does not eliminate them. After burn-in, we drew samples
and from our MCMC chains measured the autocorrelation length in dynamical masses to ensure 10,000
effective random samples were taken after thinning. In some cases, the sampling was slower to converge
and the effective number of samples was less than 10,000; KOI-137 (effectively 2400 samples), KOI-250
(effectively 3500 samples), KOI-1338 (effectively 3000 samples), KOI-2174 (effectively 7000 samples),
and KOI-2195 (effectively 2500 samples)."
"Our posterior samples from TTV modeling are available in electronic format with 5 columns per planet
listed in the order: mpM?"
", P (days), esinω, ecosω, T0, and first model transit after BJD-2455680 calculated
as (BJD-2454900). The samples are made available on Zenodo: doi:10.5281/zenodo.4422053."
4. PROJECTED TRANSIT TIMES
"From our posteriors, we measured the 15.9th and the 84.1th percentiles, and then we drew 1000 addi-
tional samples with the mass of each planet within, above and below these approximate 1σ bounds. For
each of these three subsamples, we ran dynamical models integrating the planetary motions for a total of
6000 days (from just before the start of the Kepler mission through 2025 August 12) and took the mean and
standard deviation of our model transit times at every projected transit date. This gives us an uncertainty on
future transit times for our samples, which we use to determine whether projected TTVs are rapidly diverg-
ing. Systems where future transit times diverge by an amount that exceeds the transit-timing uncertainty
of a follow-up observation are targets where additional data can improve mass constraints. In addition, our
projections of subsamples where the masses are below or above the 1σ credible intervals in some cases high-
light where projected transit times are separated by uncertainties in dynamical masses. These are displayed
in Appendix A."
"In many cases, the projected transit times are known precisely for decades beyond the Kepler mission.
Figures 7–15 show the divergence of projected transit times and uncertainties for all of the planets in our
final sample. They are displayed in order of the KOI number of the host, but within each set, the candidate’s
TTVs are plotted in order of their orbital periods. These figures include candidates with rapidly diverging
projected TTVs, candidates with slowly diverging TTVs, and candidates with no TTVs."
"Tables 3–6 summarize the photometric properties of each target and the divergence of their TTVs after
4000 days and after 6000 days or until the projected uncertainty in TTVs diverges by more than one day. In
systems where TTVs of at least one planet are readily detected and the uncertainties diverge by at least 90
minutes, future transit-timing data will likely improve constraints on planetary and orbital parameters. We
consider these the most urgent candidates for follow-up transit timing, and these are listed in Table 3 and
4. In other cases, TTVs that are strongly detected and were identified by Holczer et al. (2016) but diverge"
"slowly are in Table 5. A third category in Table 6 includes systems with weakly detected TTVs that also
diverge slowly."

5. INDIVIDUAL SYSTEMS: TTV RESULTS AND THE VALUE OF FOLLOW-UP TRANSIT TIMING
"Joint posteriors of dynamical masses between adjacent planets and eccentricity vector components are
displayed in Appendix B."
"We chose our systems for analysis based on the expectation of TTVs given the periods of the planets and
the median uncertainty of transit times using two analytical models for TTVs. Here, we consider the value
of the existing transit-timing dataset and future data to group the systems as follows: (1) systems with an
expectation of both types of TTV signal, with a score in Tables 1 and 2 above 7; (2), systems with an
expected near-resonant TTV score above 7 but an expected nonresonant signal below 4; (3) systems that
had an expected nonresonant TTV score above 7 but no expected near-resonant signal; and (4) systems with
no expectation of strongly interacting planets such that the highest expected resonant or nonresonant TTV
scores are between 4 and 7. We expect weak upper limits on the masses of most of these planets. How-
ever, planets that are significantly more massive than 4 M⊕ may be strongly detected within this category.
When characterizing the value of future data for any system, we make the assumption that if dynamical con-
straints are expected to improve for any particular planet, then they would likely improve for all interacting
neighbors within that that system."
5.1. Resonant and Nonresonant Interactions Expected
"The extreme low-density planet KOI-152.01 (Kepler-79 d) has strongly detected TTVs induced by two
neighboring planets. All four planets at Kepler-79 are well characterized in both dynamical mass and orbital
eccentricity. The projected TTVs diverge slowly for the Kepler-79 d, and the range of projected transit times
diverges by less than one hour. However, the TTVs of KOI-152.04 (Kepler-79 e) diverge to roughly one
hour of total range. Hence, transit-timing precision of one hour or less may further constrain planetary
masses and orbital parameters."
"KOI-523 (Kepler-177) has strongly detected near-resonant and nonresonant TTVs. The projected TTVs
diverge quickly, and hence follow-up transit-timing (e.g., Vissapragada et al. 2020) would further improve
the planet masses and eccentricities."
"KOI-620 (Kepler-51) has strongly detected near-resonant TTVs, and nonresonant TTVs in KOI-620.03
(Kepler-51 c). The projected transit times diverge quickly, and hence additional transit-timing data (e.g.
Libby-Roberts et al. 2020) would be valuable."
"KOI-1353.01 and its inner neighbor Kepler-289 d (PH3 c) show near-resonant TTVs at a superperiod of
∼1370 days. Both planets have moderately increasing uncertainties on their projected transit times (see
Table 5). However, the outermost planet has a very high transit S/N and its transit timing uncertainties
in the Kepler data are ∼1 minute. Hence, if a transit-timing uncertainty of a few minutes is achievable for
KOI-1353.01, or a few tens of minutes for Kepler-289 d or KOI-1353.02, with follow-up transit photometry,
the TTV constraints on the planet masses would likely improve."
"The inner pair of planets at KOI-1576 (Kepler-307) have strongly detected resonant TTVs as expected.
There is some divergence in the future transit times, with a separation in future times based on the planet
masses, making this a strong candidate for follow-up transit timing."
"KOI-1783 (Kepler-1662) has two long-period transiting planets with relatively few transits in the Kepler
dataset. The future transit times diverge rapidly, and the dynamical mass measurements would benefit from
additional transit-timing data (e.g., Vissapragada et al. 2020)."
"KOI-2092.01 (Kepler-359 c) has a strong expectation of near-resonant and nonresonant TTVs. How-
ever, the superperiod is much longer than the Kepler baseline, and the TTVs provide weak constraints on"
"the planetary masses. The projected TTVs diverge rapidly, and additional transit-timing data is likely to
significantly improve the planet characterizations in this system."
5.2. Resonant Interactions Expected
"KOI-137 (Kepler-18) has strongly detected resonant TTVs with a superperiod of∼300 days which is well
sampled by the Kepler baseline. The TTVs diverge extremely slowly. Similarly, KOI-156.03 (Kepler-114 d)
has strongly detected near-resonant TTVs with a superperiod that is much shorter than the Kepler baseline.
In these cases, follow-up transit timing is unlikely to further constrain the planetary masses for decades."
"This is also the case for the two planets of KOI-244 (Kepler-25), which have strongly detected near-
resonant TTVs with a super-period that is much shorter than the Kepler baseline. In this system, low-mass
solutions with eccentricities . 0.5 provide a good fit to the TTVs that are inconsistent with the larger masses
suggested by RV observations (Marcy et al. 2014) However, there are low-eccentricity solutions are closely
consistent with the RV (Hadden & Lithwick 2017). The projected TTVs diverge slowly, and there is little
evidence that future transit times will further constrain the TTV model, although additional RV data may
be of value. Kepler-25 has a third planet found by RV at 123 days weighing 160 M⊕. We estimate that the
maximum TTVs induced by Kepler-25 d on Kepler-25 c are of order 10 s, too small to have any effect on
our two-planet TTV model."
"KOI-255.01 (Kepler-505 b) has a weakly detected signal. The TTVs provide upper limits only on the
planetary masses, and the projected transit times diverge with some evidence that additional transit-timing
data will further constrain the phase of the TTV signal as well as the planetary masses."
"KOI-314.01 (Kepler-138 c) and KOI-314.03 (Kepler-138 b) have strongly detected TTVs from the orbital
periods being near the 4:3 resonance. The outer pair, KOI-314.01 (Kepler-138 c) and KOI-314.04 (Kepler-
138 d), is near the second-order 5:3 resonance and interact strongly with a superperiod of ∼880 days. Their
TTVs diverge slowly, while the innermost planet has a TTV period of∼1540 days and has rapidly diverging
projected TTVs."
"The two outer planets of KOI-377 (Kepler-9) have masses that far exceed our system selection criteria,
and the TTVs have the highest S/N among the interacting pairs included in our sample. The masses and
orbital eccentricities are very tightly constrained from both near-resonant and nonresonant interactions. The
projected TTVs of KOI-377.02 (Kepler-9 c) diverge by over an hour after 6000 days, making this system of
some value for follow-up transit timing."
"KOI-430.01 (Kepler-551 b) has a strong expectation of near-resonant TTVs at a superperiod of ∼500
days. It is clear that there are excessive outlying transit times caused by underestimated timing uncertainties
or transit-timing error. It appears likely that underestimating the transit-timing measurement uncertainties
was largely responsible for our model predicting that near-resonant TTVs would have a higher S/N than
observed. Nevertheless, we clearly detect a periodic signal, although the phase of the signal in KOI-430.02 is
poorly constrained. The projected TTVs diverge quickly, and mass constraints would benefit from additional
transit-timing data."
"The middle pair of the four-planet system KOI-520 (Kepler-176) is near the 2:1 resonance with a superpe-
riod of ∼1400 days. The outer pair is near the 2:1 resonance with a superperiod of ∼3900 days, far longer
than the Kepler baseline. The TTV amplitude and phase are well constrained for KOI-520.01 (Kepler-176
c) and its projected TTVs diverge slowly. However, its outer neighbors KOI-520.03 (Kepler-176 d) and
KOI-520.04 (Kepler-176 e) have a poorly constrained TTV model and rapidly diverging projected transit
times."
"KOI-730 (Kepler-223) has four planets in a series of resonant chains, with TTV periods exceeding the
Kepler baseline. The projected TTVs diverge rapidly and separate by mass. Hence, further characterization
of this system would benefit from additional transit-timing data."
"KOI-750.01 (Kepler-662 b) is near a 3:2 resonance with its inner neighbor, with a superperiod of ∼1600
days. The TTV model is a poor fit to KOI-750.01, with excessive outlying transit times. The projected
TTVs diverge rapidly."
"The inner pair of KOI-877 (Kepler-81) has strongly detected near-resonant TTVs. The projected TTVs
diverge quickly, and additional transit-timing data would further constrain the dynamical masses."
"KOI-1338 (Kepler-822) has three planet candidates. The orbital periods of KOI-1338.02 and KOI-1338.03
indicate a superperiod of ∼180 yr, and the two candidates are likely in a 2:1 mean motion resonance. It is
clear that the transit times vary little from a constant period over the Kepler baseline. The projected TTVs
diverge rapidly."
"KOI-1599 (Kepler-1659) has an interacting pair with a near-resonant superperiod longer than the Kepler
baseline. Projected TTVs diverge rapidly, and additional measurements would be of value in constraining
the phase and the amplitude of the TTVs, and hence the planetary masses."
"KOI-1833.03 (Kepler-968 c) and KOI-1833.02 are near the 4:3 mean motion resonance, with a relatively
short superperiod of ∼200 days. Projected TTVs diverge slowly."
"KOI-1955.02 (Kepler-342 c) and KOI-1955.02 (Kepler-342 d) have strongly detected near-resonant TTVs
with a superperiod of ∼5000 days, which is longer than the Kepler baseline. The projected TTVs diverge
quickly with separation based on the planetary masses."
"KOI-2086 (Kepler-60) has strongly detected TTVs, due to libration within a three-body resonance chain
(Goździewski et al. 2016). The projected TTVs diverge, and additional transit-timing measurements would
enable tighter constraints on the planetary masses."
"KOI-2195 (Kepler-372) has three transiting planets. The interacting pair have a near-resonant superperiod
of ∼90 yr and is likely in a 3:2 mean motion resonance. With little evidence of TTVs over the four-year
Kepler baseline, the planetary masses are poorly constrained. However, divergence in the projected transit
times makes this system a strong candidate for follow-up transit timing."
"KOI-2414.01 (Kepler-384 b) has an expectation of detectable TTVs caused by near-resonant interactions
with Kepler-384 c. However, the super-period of ∼6700 days exceeds the Kepler baseline, and the upper
limits on the masses of the planets are weak. There are clearly non-Gaussian residuals to the model fits,
casting some doubt on the model. However, the projected transit times rapidly diverge, and future transit
data will further constrain the model."
5.3. Nonresonant Interactions Expected
"KOI-85.01 (Kepler-65 c) and KOI-85.02 (Kepler-65 d) interact with no TTVs discernible by eye. Never-
theless, it is illustrative to compare the projected TTVs of KOI-85.01 and its isolated inner neighbor KOI-
85.02, which has a precise linear ephemeris. The weakly interacting pair has divergent projected TTVs
and well-constrained dynamical mass upper limits, even from the nondetection of TTVs. It is unclear how
valuable additional transit data would be for this system."
"KOI-115.01 (Kepler-105 b), has TTVs primarily caused by its outer neighbor Kepler-105 c (KOI-115.02)
with a periodicity of ∼140 days (Jontof-Hutter et al. 2016). This is caused by a near-resonance, which, as
shown in Table 1 was expected to cause a moderate signal. However, this system was selected because of
the expectation of nonresonant TTVs, and the posteriors show relatively tight constraints on the mass of"
"the outermost planet. The TTVs diverge slowly, and it is unlikely that mass constraints will improve with
additional transit-timing data in the near future."
"KOI-250.01 (Kepler-26 b) was expected to have a strong nonresonant TTV signal. The TTVs are in fact
dominated by a near-second-order resonance (7:5) and its∼770 day superperiod. Nevertheless, nonresonant
components are also readily detected. Both have well-characterized masses, while the other two planets have
useful upper limits only. The projected TTVs of Kepler-26 b and Kepler 26 c diverge, and hence this system
would benefit from follow-up transit-timing data."
"KOI-277 (Kepler-36) shows strongly detected nonresonant TTVs. The dynamical masses and eccentric-
ities are among the most precisely characterized for low-mass exoplanets (Deck et al. 2012). We note that
the future times diverge and that additional transit-timing data would further constrain the TTV models.
Vissapragada et al. (2020) report follow-up transit times that further constrain the planetary masses and
orbital eccentricities."
"KOI-654.01 (Kepler-200 b) and KOI-654.02 (Kepler-200 c) have an orbital period ratio of just 1.19 and
interact with nonresonant TTVs, although the dynamical masses and eccentricities are weakly constrained.
The projected TTVs diverge slowly following the Kepler baseline."
"KOI-738 (Kepler-29) has strongly detected nonresonant TTVs and a superperiod associated with the
second-order 9:7 resonance, that exceeds the Kepler baseline. While it is not apparent by eye, synodic
periodicities are detected in the TTVs, and the dynamical masses are well constrained even though the
baseline is too short to measure the amplitude of the near-resonant TTVs. Projected TTVs diverge quickly,
motivating follow-up transit timing, as has been done by Vissapragada et al. (2020)."
"KOI-1070.03, an unconfirmed candidate of Kepler-266 with a period of 92.8 days, has an expected non-
resonant TTV signal due to its proximity to its outer neighbor KOI-1070.02 (Kepler-266 c) with a period
of 107.7 days. The projected TTVs diverge rapidly to beyond one day within a few years after the Kepler
mission."
"KOI-1574.01 (Kepler-87 b) is an extreme low-density planet with a strong nonresonant TTV signal. With
relatively long orbital periods, the outer pair at Kepler-87 has few measured transit times, and additional
data should tighten mass constraints significantly. The projected TTVs diverge rapidly."
"KOI-2174.01 and KOI-2174.03 have orbital periods around 6.7 and 7.7 days respectively, and an expec-
tation of nonresonant TTVs. The ∼2000 day periodicity seen in the model fits to the TTVs is caused by
the near-second-order 15:13 resonance, and future transit data may enable tighter mass constraints on these
candidates."
5.4. No Strongly Detectable Interactions Expected
"KOI-168.01 (Kepler-23 c) has the expectation of a weak detection of near-resonant TTVs, and the TTVs
are strongly detected. The projected TTVs diverge slowly, although the separation between high-mass and
low-mass solutions indicates that follow-up transit timing may be of value in constraining the planetary
masses."
"KOI-222.01 (Kepler-120 b) has weakly detected near-resonant TTVs that are projected to diverge slowly.
KOI-248.01 (Kepler-49 b) has strongly detected TTVs at the near-resonant superperiod, although the"
"higher frequency nonresonant TTVs are not apparent. The near-resonant TTVs are also detected as expected
in Kepler-49 c. More detailed modeling using short-cadence transit-timing data by Jontof-Hutter et al.
(2016) provides tighter constraints on the strongly interacting middle pair of planets in this four-planet
system, although we find an upper limit on the mass of the outermost planet KOI-248.04 (Kepler-49 e).
However, the poor fit to the transit times of Kepler-49 e, where no strong TTV signal is expected, hints"
"at poorly characterized transit-timing uncertainties for this small planet. The low-mass solutions are a
better fit to the data than the higher mass solutions and show a wider posterior distribution in eccentricity
components. These may be distinguished with additional transit timing. The projected TTVs of Kepler-49
b and Kepler-49 c diverge slowly."
"KOI-255.01 (Kepler-505 b) has TTVs at the superperiod associated with the 2:1 resonance, although it
appears that the phases of the TTVs are uncertain, and there is some divergence in projected transit times.
Hence, additional transit-timing data, particularly of KOI-255.02 should be of value in further characterizing
this system."
"The inner pair at KOI-401 (Kepler-149) has a weakly detected near-resonant signal . Diverging projected
TTVs imply that follow-up transit times would be of some value, although the uncertain future transit times
for the isolated outermost planet, KOI-401.02 (Kepler 149 d), are most likely due to a poorly characterized
linear ephemeris, given how few transits Kepler observed."
"KOI-457.01 (Kepler-161 b) has an expectation of weakly detected nonresonant TTVs. Nevertheless, there
are strong upper limits on the dynamical masses. There are no resonances near the orbital period ratio
(P
′"
"P = 1.44), and projected TTVs diverge slowly.
KOI-567.02 (Kepler-184 c) has an expectation of weakly detectable nonresonant TTVs. These are seen"
"by eye in the model fits but not in the data. We find a strong upper limit to the dynamical mass of planet
KOI-567.02 (Kepler-184 c). The projected TTVs diverge rapidly."
"KOI-806 (Kepler-30) has stronger detected TTVs than expected in Table 2, and the masses were initially
characterized by Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2012). There is some divergence in the projected TTVs, particularly
in KOI-806.01 (Kepler-30 d), as shown in Figure 11, and hence additional transit-timing data may be of
some value in further characterizing the planets."
"KOI-886 (Kepler-54) also has much stronger TTVs than expected in Table 2. The projected transit times
diverge in phase after several thousand days. This divergence appears correlated with dynamical masses,
and hence additional transit-timing data would be useful in further characterizing this system."
"KOI-934.03 (Kepler-254 d) is near a 3:2 resonance with its inner neighbor KOI-934.02 (Kepler-254 c),
which has a strong mass upper limit. The projected TTVs of both planets diverge, and additional transit
timing data would further characterize this system."
"KOI-1279 (Kepler-804) has two small planets with a weakly detected near-resonant TTV signal with weak
constraints on the TTV amplitude. The projected TTVs diverge slowly."
"KOI-1598 (Kepler-310) has strongly detected TTVs from the second-order 5:3 near-resonance. There
is also an expectation of detectable nonresonant interactions, which led to its inclusion in our sample.
The outer planet, KOI-1598.02 (Kepler-310 d), has an apparent signal at the expected superperiod for the
second order resonance of ∼1400 days. Shorter periodicities are detected in KOI-1598.02 (Kepler-310 c).
The projected TTVs diverge rapidly, although there is little difference between the low-mass and high-mass
solutions."
"KOI-1831.01 (Kepler-324 c) has strongly detected TTVs with a superperiod longer than the Kepler base-
line. The projected TTVs diverge quickly, and follow-up transit-timing data would improve constraints on
planetary masses."
"Both KOI-2113.02 (Kepler-417 b) and KOI-2113.01 (Kepler-417 c) have mass upper limits imposed by
nonresonant TTVs. The projected TTVs diverge slowly."
"KOI-3503 has two planet candidates with strongly detected near-resonant TTVs, despite an expectation
of just weakly detectable TTVs, with a superperiod of ∼7800 days. The projected TTVs diverge rapidly,
and this system is an ideal candidate for follow-up transit timing."
5.5. Evaluating Our Sample
"As we have seen in this section, the future transit times of some planets diverge more quickly than oth-
ers. We do not apply a quantitative test for whether TTVs are classified as rapidly or slowly diverging.
Nevertheless, the projected TTVs are valuable here in identifying even weak TTV signals. The inclusion
of isolated neighbors within the systems of interest in our sample highlights this. The first few examples
in Figure 7 include KOI-85.02 (Kepler-65 b), KOI-155.03, and KOI-137.03 (Kepler-18 b). For these iso-
lated candidates, the uncertainty in the projected transit times grows linearly and is primarily due to the
uncertainty in the measured linear ephemeris from the transit data. This is in contrast to candidates with an
expected nonresonant TTV signal where projected transit times diverge rapidly, even though by eye, there is
no obvious detection of TTVs. In most of these cases, the existing transit data may not provide useful upper
limits on the masses, although there are exceptions like KOI-85.01 (Kepler-65 b), KOI-156.01 (Kepler-114
c), and both planets at KOI-2113 (Kepler-417)."
"In some cases with strongly detected TTVs, projected TTVs diverge exponentially, most likely due to
poorly constrained parameters within the TTV model (e.g. KOI-314 (Kepler-138) in Figure 8). We also
observe some projected TTVs with pulsating uncertainties, like KOI-1599 (Kepler-1659) in Figure 13,
where the uncertainties increase overall with some modulation at the superperiod."
"There are some common aspects to the systems that we judge to have rapidly diverging TTVs. Several
candidates with an expectation of detectable resonant and nonresonant TTVs have slowly diverging TTVs,
presumably because the data provides strong constraints on the TTV periodicities (e.g. KOI-115.01, KOI-
152.01 in Figure 7). On the other hand, systems with longer TTV superperiods tend to have more rapidly
diverging TTVs. In some cases (e.g. KOI-620.03 (Kepler-51 c) in Figure 10), this is likely due to the
resonant TTV superperiod being comparable to or exceeding the Kepler baseline. In such cases, even a
single future transit-timing measurement may place valuable constraints on the phase or amplitude of the
TTVs. In other cases, even if the superperiod is well sampled by the Kepler baseline, the data may be
noisy enough to leave some uncertainty on the amplitude or phase of the TTVs (e.g., KOI-1576, Kepler-
307 in Figure 13). Otherwise, most of the systems with an expectation of nearresonant TTVs where the
superperiod is much shorter than the Kepler baseline tend to have slowly diverging projected TTVs (e.g.,
KOI-137 (Kepler-18), KOI-156 (Kepler-114) in Figure 7). The three-planet system KOI-314 (Kepler-138)
provides an illustrative example; the coherence time of the inner pair is longer than the Kepler baseline and
the projected TTVs of the innermost planet diverge rapidly, while the outer and more strongly interacting
pair has a TTV period shorter than the Kepler baseline, and for both planets the projected TTVs diverge
slowly (see Figure 8)."
"We consider two possible effects that determine how rapidly the projected transit times diverge. Firstly, we
would expect that periodicities in the TTVs that are longer than the Kepler baseline have poorly constrained
amplitudes and hence that such planets have rapidly diverging projected transit times. An additional factor
could be how information-rich the data are. Where both near-resonant and nonresonant frequencies are de-
tected in the TTV, the TTV model may be more constrained and the projected times more certain. Figure 3
compares the divergence of projected TTVs with the near-resonant superperiods of relevant candidates.
Note that as the orbital period ratio approaches mean motion resonance, the near-resonant superperiod in-
creases to infinity. Such pairs have a finite TTV periodicity due to libration, which we neglect in Figure 3."
"The figure highlights the correlation between the divergence of the projected TTVs and the superperiod—
typically reaching hours if the superperiod exceeds the Kepler baseline of ∼1460 days. We also note a cor-
relation between the expectation of nonresonant TTVs (using the scores in Tables 1–2) and the divergence
of the projected transit times, such that planets with a lower expected signal for the nonresonant TTVs
(among planets that also have an expectation of near-resonant TTVs) typically have more rapidly diverging
TTVs. Hence, two factors become relevant in observing campaigns to follow up on TTV targets: the base-
line of observations compared to the superperiod, and the prospect of detecting nonresonant frequencies
in the TTVs. We calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient of the logarithms of TTV divergence and
the superperiod to be 0.99. By comparison, the correlation coefficient between the logarithm of the TTV
divergence and the nonresonant TTV expectation score among planets near first order resonances with a
neighbor was -0.23, a much weaker correlation."

5.6. Post-Kepler Transit Timing Observations
"Some transiting planets on our list have had follow-up transit-timing observations since the Kepler mission
ended. We compare our predicted transit times, with their 68.3% confidence intervals, to the observed transit
times in Table 7 below. In all cases, our predictions agree closely with follow-up observations, hence we
find no evidence that our multiplanet TTV models given the known planets are inadequate to explain the
follow-up data."
5.7. Newly Confirmed Kepler Planets
"Several candidate KOIs remain in our sample of systems that have not been named as verified Kepler
planets. We tested whether our best-fit models with free dynamical masses are better than best-fit models
with the mass fixed at zero for these candidates, and we include the results in Table 8 below. Since the mass-
less models are nested within the parameter space of our standard models, we also include the F-statistic
for model comparison."

"We exclude KOI-1574.03 (Kepler-87 from Table 8) since it is potentially interacting with a fourth candi-
date identified in Kepler DR 24 whose transit times are unavailable. We also exclude KOI-1070.03 from
confirmation since in our light-curve analysis it has a transit S/N of just 7.2."
"Of the remaining unverified KOIs, we find improvement with nonzero mass where ∆BIC> 3 and where
F-test > 9 (the 3 −σ level) for KOIs: 1831.03, 1833.02, 2174.01, 2174.03, 2174.04, 3503.01, and 3503.02."
"Of these, KOI-1831.03 and KOI-1831.04 are both high S/N candidates from the light curve. KOI-1831.03
is close to but not in a first-order mean motion resonance with its outer neighbor, with a period ratio of
1.515, and it is strongly detected and hence confirmed in the TTV model. KOI-1831.04, however, is not
near resonance with any of the others, and the evidence for it in the TTVs is much weaker. We do not
confirm it at this time."
"We confirm the planetary nature of KOI-1833.02, given the improvement in the TTV model we find with
a nonzero mass. Its orbital period lies just outside the 4:3 mean motion resonance with its inner neighbor,
and TTVs are expected."
"KOI-2174 has four candidates, and the expected TTVs are due to the unusually proximate orbits of the
middle pair (KOI-2174.01 and KOI-2174.03), at 6.7 and 7.7 days. KOI-2174.03 has a relatively low transit
S/N and may be a false alarm. Furthermore, there is a possibility that these are not false planets but perhaps
a blend of two planet-hosting stars with a single light curve. However, both candidates show moderate
improvement with nonzero masses over a model with zero-mass models, which provides evidence that the
candidates are interacting planets. The inner-most candidate (KOI-2174.04) has a moderate improvement
in the TTV model with nonzero mass, but given that there is no expectation of TTV for this candidate and
the S/N < 10, a confirmation appears unjustified. The outermost planet, KOI-2174.02 is strongly detected in
the light curve, but the improvement it offers the TTV model is too moderate to warrant confirmation. We
leave all four candidates unconfirmed."
"KOI-3503.01 has S/N = 8.50 from Kepler DR 25, which is too low for validation on its own. Our fit to the
light curve allowing free transit times increases the S/N to 12.2, as quoted in Table 8. The improvement is
consistent with the expected TTVs caused by its neighbor, KOI-3503.02, given the period ratio of 1.5021,"

"and the expected TTV period >10 yr. For KOI-3503.02, we find a weaker S/N of 9.6. Nevertheless, an
astrophysical false positive seems unlikely given the anticorrelated polynomial TTV signals that can be
seen by eye in the data in Figure 15. Hence, we confirm these two candidates as planets."
"In summary, we confirm the planetary nature of KOI-1831.03, KOI-1833.02, KOI-3503.01, and KOI-
3503.02."
5.8. Eccentricity
"In Figure 4 we plot the eccentricity posteriors of planets with strongly detected dynamical masses such
that the 15.9th percentile of the posterior is more than half of its median. Eccentricities are weakly anticor-
related with planetary masses, consistent with the expectation that multi-planet systems are more likely to
be unstable if planets have both high masses and high eccentricities. Furthermore, we see fewer planets with
both low masses and eccentricities since for Figure 4 we have selected for strong TTV detections. There is
no discernible correlation between eccentricities and orbital period."
"Individual planets with strongly constrained eccentricities include planets within the systems of KOI-377
(Kepler-9), KOI-806 (Kepler-30), and KOI-1353. These systems have planets that are among the most
massive of our sample, with strong near-resonant and nonresonant components to their TTVs. In these
systems, dynamical masses are detected to high significance, such that the ratio of the median to the length"

"of the interval between the 15.9th percentile and the median is greater than 9. KOI-620 (Kepler-51) and
(KOI-152) Kepler-79 also have eccentricity constraints significantly narrower than our prior. For the planets
in these systems, the ratio of the median to the length of the interval between the 15.9th percentile and the
median ranges from 2.3 to 7.2."
"The remainder of the candidates have eccentricity constraints that improve little on our prior. In systems
with moderately detected TTVs, individual eccentricities are poorly constrained. Nevertheless, TTVs are
sensitive to relative eccentricities in interacting pairs (Lithwick et al. 2012), whereby adding the same eccen-
tricity vector to both planetary orbits has little effect on the TTVs. We are left with tightly correlated eccen-
tricity vector components between interacting pairs, unless the TTVs contain enough information to break
this eccentricity-eccentricity degeneracy. There are many examples of these correlations in Figures 20–33,
and in general the solutions are stable since the orbits are apsidally aligned and locked (Jontof-Hutter et al.
2016). Nevertheless, we expect eccentricities in compact transiting systems to be small from tidal eccentric-
ity damping. Hansen & Murray (2015) show that eccentricity damping in a planet near the host propagates
to secularly coupled neighbors, leading to circular orbits even beyond the range of efficient tidal damping
from star-planet interactions. Yet the possibility of aligned and eccentric orbits still cannot be ruled out,
since the aligned component damps the slowest (Mardling 2007; Van Laerhoven & Greenberg 2012)."
"Despite these limitations on constraining eccentricity from TTVs, there is still useful information in our
eccentricity posteriors when only relative eccentricities are constrained. In some cases, joint posteriors
of eccentricity vector components exclude the possibility of zero eccentricity in both interacting planets,
and hence some eccentricity in the system is required. See for example, KOI-2086 in Figure 28 where
there is no likelihood in joint posteriors of eccentricity vector components both equalling zero. In such
cases, we detect nonzero orbital eccentricities even though the data cannot determine which planetary orbit
must be eccentric. We identified planet pairs that require some relative eccentricity where for adjacent
planet pairs ecosω=0 and e′ cosω′=0 are excluded from the joint posterior, or where for adjacent planet
pairs esinω=0 and e′ sinω′=0 are excluded from the joint posterior (i.e., where the joint distributions in
Figures 20–33 for ecosω=0 and e′ cosω′ or esinω=0 and e′ sinω′ do not include the graph origin). We
counted the number of samples in the parameter space where ecosω < 0 and e′ cosω′ < 0, ecosω < 0 and
e′ cosω′ > 0, ecosω > 0 and e′ cosω′ >0, and where ecosω > 0 and e′ cosω′ <0 and repeated the same"
"for pairs in esinω and e′ sinω′. Planet pairs where none of our 10,000 samples are in one of these eight
‘quadrants’ were considered detections of relative eccentricity. This criterion works well to identify the
pairs where individual eccentricities are not well constrained, but relative eccentricities are constrained.
However, where some individual eccentricities are strongly constrained, like in the three-planet KOI-377
(Kepler-9) system, this test mistakenly places the noninteracting inner pair in the ‘detections’ column (see
joint posteriors for KOI-377 in Figure 24)."
"In the tables in Appendix C, we list planet pairs that show evidence of relative eccentricity (excluding pairs
with planets where individual eccentricities are strongly constrained). Two of the systems with nonzero
eccentricity are known to be in Laplace-like resonant chains, KOI-2086 (Kepler-60, Goździewski et al.
2016; Jontof-Hutter et al. 2016) and KOI-730 (Kepler-223, Mills et al. 2016), and are likely in pairwise
mean motion resonances. We also find nonzero eccentricity at KOI-738, (Kepler-29) which is likely in the
second-order 9:7 mean motion resonance (Migaszewski et al. 2017)."
"Other examples of nonzero relative eccentricities, with no evidence of mean motion resonances include
KOI-277 (Kepler-36), KOI-1783, KOI-3503, KOI-115.01 and KOI-115.02 (Kepler-105 b and Kepler-105
c), KOI-314.01 and KOI-314.02 (Kepler-138 c and Kepler-138 d), KOI-886.01 and KOI-886.02 (Kepler-
54 b and Kepler-54 c), and KOI-250.01 and KOI-250.02 (Kepler-26 b and Kepler-26 c). In the remaining
systems, zero eccentricity cannot be excluded. This includes KOI-1599 (Kepler-1659) which is known to
be in resonance (Panichi et al. 2019)."
"The planet pairs with poorly constrained eccentricities and poorly constrained relative eccentricities are
listed in Table 18 in Appendix C. We note that there are no detections of relative eccentricity among planets
orbiting at less than 5.7 days, while detectable interactions were expected for two pairs with an inner planet
orbiting at less than 5.7 days. This is consistent with reduced tidal damping at greater orbital distances.
However, it is also consistent with stronger TTV signals at greater orbital periods."
6. STELLAR PARAMETERS AND PLANET CHARACTERIZATION
"Our adopted stellar parameters for planet characterization are in Table 9. We rely on Fulton & Petigura
(2018) for stellar effective temperatures, masses and radii as our first choice of stellar parameters. Several
of our systems are missing data in that catalog. Our second choice was to retrieve stellar radii from Berger
et al. (2020)."
"We drew samples from posterior summary statistics of stellar parameters and combined them with our
samples of planetary dynamical masses and published planetary radii to characterize credible intervals of
planetary masses, densities, equilibrium blackbody temperatures, and atmospheric transmission annuli. We
summarize our posteriors of planetary parameters with sample medians and bounds enclosing 68.3% of
samples with equal weight in the tails. In some cases, parameters drawn from other studies have substantial
skewness. This is particularly a problem for derived quantities based on skewed parameters like bulk density
or atmospheric scale height that are sensitive to planetary radii. We considered posteriors with quoted
negative error bars within 10% of the positive error bar as Gaussian distributions and adopted the average of
the published uncertainties as the uncertainty. For moderately skewed distributions over a variable x where
we rely on skewed posteriors, we adopt the following approximate likelihood:"
"p(x|xmode,κ+,κ−)'
1√"
"2πκ2m
exp"
"(
log(1 +γ(x − xmode))"
")2]
(6)"
"where for non-Gaussian uncertainties κ+ and κ−, β = κ+/κ− and γ = κ

"κ+κ−

"While the denominator in the exponential function in Equation 6 approaches zero in the limit of symmet-
ric uncertainties, it does provide a smooth distribution with skew from just three parameters and closely
approximates a Gaussian where β = 1.1 or 0.9. Equation 6 requires positive definite quantities, which is
satisfied for our parameters of interest. For moderate asymmetries in the uncertainties, the function gives
excellent agreement with the 68.3% central region of a log-normal distribution. One disadvantage of this
function is that it is not normalized; if β = 1.1 or 0.9, the integrated likelihoods sum to 1.003, and the
normalization error rises to ≈ 17% if β = 2."
"To calculate planetary bulk density, we rely on Berger et al. (2018) for planetary radii where available.
However, where planetary radii in Berger et al. (2018) have significantly different upper and lower uncer-
tainties such that β > 2 or β < 1/2, where the approximation of equation 6 loses accuracy, we adopt relevant
parameters from other sources if they are skewed less, since excessively skewed radius distributions cause
an excess of posterior likelihood at extreme bulk density or atmospheric scale height. For example, Berger
et al. (2018) estimate the radius of KOI-620.03 (Kepler-51 c), which has a grazing transit and large TTVs,
as Rp = 5.44+29.43−1.15 R⊕. In this case, the poorly constrained upper bound coupled with a stronger lower bound
could lead to an overly optimistic estimate of the transmission annulus. Other large catalogs of Kepler
planetary parameters like Kepler DR 24, DR 25, or Fulton & Petigura (2018) have similar difficulty with
either skewed or imprecise errors for KOI-620.03. Hence, for this system, we adopt the transit parameters
of Libby-Roberts et al. (2020)."
"Elsewhere, when our default source has skewed uncertainties, such that β > 2 or β < 1/2, we adopt the
parameters of Kepler DR 25 if less skewed. This included the planet radii of KOIs 85.03, 115.02, 115.03,

"Among our selected systems, KOIs 1599, 2092, and 2174 are missing from Berger et al. (2018). For KOI-
1599, we adopt the planet radii of Panichi et al. (2019): Rp = 1.9±0.2 R⊕ for KOI-1599.01 and 1.9 ±0.3
R⊕ for KOI-1599.02. Although the dynamical masses of the planets are constrained to an uncertainty ∼3%
(Panichi et al. 2019), the mass of the star KOI-1599 is poorly constrained, leading to weak constraints on
the planetary bulk properties. For KOI-2092.03, we adopt our own measurement of the radius from analysis
of the light curve."
"In cases where the planetary mass upper limits are weak, we imposed a maximum bulk density of 10 g
cm−3. Our results are in Tables 10–13. For some individual systems, other authors have used short-cadence
transit-timing data (Jontof-Hutter et al. 2016), or performed photodynamical models to self-consistently
account for eccentricities and the host density (Almenara et al. 2018) or have adopted different priors in
mass or eccentricity than we have here (Hadden & Lithwick 2017). In several cases, our adoption of post-
Gaia stellar parameters improves upon the published precision in measured planetary parameters, but not
always. Hence, we report both our results and the results of other studies in Tables 10–13. We attempt to
highlight which is the preferred source for planet parameters although for many candidates this cannot be
done in an objective and uniform way. For example, the radius of Kepler-105 following Gaia is∼ 39% larger
than the size adopted by Jontof-Hutter et al. (2016), but also has larger uncertainties. As another example,
in the case of Kepler-9, TTV data are supplemented with RV data which further constrain planetary masses
(Borsato et al. 2019). However, the high S/N TTVs enable precise measurements of dynamical masses,
orbital eccentricities, and the bulk density of the host. The Gaia stellar parameters agree closely with the
photodynamical model of Freudenthal et al. (2018)."
"For KOI-137 (Kepler-18), updated planetary radii are smaller and inconsistent with those adopted by
Cochran et al. (2011). We also find lower masses for KOI-137.01 and KOI-137.02 than Cochran et al. (2011)
did. On the other hand, Cochran et al. (2011) combined RV and TTV data in their mass measurements, and
while they did not have the complete transit-timing data set, the amplitude, phase and superperiod of the
near-resonant TTV signal of the outer two planets were well constrained by the data at that time. The TTVs
do little to constrain the mass of the inner planet KOI-137.03, and the RV measurement of Cochran et al.
(2011) remains preferred."
"Panichi et al. (2018) report the size of KOI-806.03 (Kepler-30 b) as 3.75 ±0.18 R⊕, consistent with
the earlier measurement of 3.9 ±0.2 R⊕ by Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2012) but significantly greater than the
radius measurement we adopt from Berger et al. (2018) (1.84 +0.13"
"−0.17 R⊕). Some of the disagreement may be
attributed to the stellar radius measurement. Sanchis-Ojeda et al. (2012) report R? = 0.95±0.12 R�. Fulton
& Petigura (2018) revise this to R? = 0.819 +0.036−0.034 R�. The revised planet radius increases the inferred density

(2017). In addition, our revised planet sizes are inconsistent with earlier estimates. For KOI-1574.01
(Kepler-87 b) and KOI-1574.02 (Kepler-87 c), our revised radii are smaller than those adopted by Ofir et al.
(2014), leading to a slightly higher density for the extreme low-density planet KOI-1574.02 (Kepler-87 c).
On the other hand, our planetary radii for KOI-1576 (Kepler-307), taken from Berger et al. (2018), are less
precise than those adopted by Jontof-Hutter et al. (2016) and agree more closely with Hadden & Lithwick
(2017)."
"For several candidates, we find higher masses and consequently higher densities than those found by
Hadden & Lithwick (2017). In that study, the default prior on planetary masses was uniform on a logarithmic
scale and hence weighted towards lower masses. The alternative prior adopted by Hadden & Lithwick
(2017) was uniform in planet masses and hence closer to our adopted prior, although in their study, this was
coupled with a logarithmic prior in eccentricity. This provided a conservative test for the “robustness"" of the
inferred parameters, but also effectively added more weight to low eccentricity solutions leading to tighter
constraints on mass. Hence in Tables 10–13, there are several cases where we report upper limits only,
where Hadden & Lithwick (2017) report tighter constraints under their high mass prior. Among the TTV
candidates that have not been subsequently studied by other authors, we compared the results of Hadden &
Lithwick (2017) following their high mass prior with our own results."
"All of the planets with a strong expectation of nonresonant and near-resonant TTVs have strongly detected
TTVs and the measured transit times impose useful constraints on interacting planets of those systems. All
of these systems have TTVs detected and cataloged by Holczer et al. (2016), and have been characterized
in other studies. Of the systems with an expectation of near-resonant TTVs only, the TTVs of KOIs 255,
430, 750, and 1833 were not detected by Holczer et al. (2016) but we have found useful mass upper limits
for KOI-255.01, KOI-430.01, KOI-750.01 and KOI-1833.03. Despite an expectation of TTVs due to near-
resonance, the transit times of KOIs 1338, 2195 and 2414 provide weak constraints on planetary masses,
most likely because their TTV superperiods far exceed the Kepler baseline."
"Among systems with an expectation of strong nonresonant TTVs that are not identified in the catalog of
Holczer et al. (2016), we have found dynamical mass constraints on KOI-85.01, KOIs 654.01 and KOI-
654.02, and KOI-1070.02. The existing transit data do not usefully constrain the masses of the planets at
KOI-2174. For the systems where we had an expectation of either weakly detected TTVs or a nondetection,
several have mass constraints that have not been characterized in other studies. KOIs 222.01, 255.01, and
1279.01 have weak constraints whereby the mass upper limits are lower than those imposed by our prior
on bulk density although the densities are still conspicuously high. KOIs 401.03, 413.02, 567.02, 934.02,
2113.01, and 2113.02 all have strong and useful mass constraints imposed by the TTVs."
"Most of the candidates with mass upper limits that are tighter than that imposed by our prior, ρ < 10
g cm−3, were expected to have strong TTV signals (see Tables 1–2). The exceptions to this are planets
that have poorly constrained masses. They include KOI-314.01 (Kepler-138 c) which likely has a high
bulk density. Different authors have found discrepant stellar parameters for KOI-314, which in turn casts"
"some doubt on the likely bulk densities of the planets despite the dynamical mass constraints (Jontof-Hutter
2019). KOI-314.01 and KOI-314.02 have a similar size but a very tightly constrained mass ratio of ∼3 (see
Figure 17). Thus the density upper limit on KOI-314.01 leads to the expectation that KOI-314.02 is rich in
volatiles."
"KOI-934.03 has weak constraints on its mass upper limit following a moderately weak expected resonant
TTV score of 5.3 (see Table 2)."
"KOI-1070.03 has an expectation of strongly detected nonresonant TTVs due its close neighbor KOI-
1070.02 (P.02P.03 = 1.16 ) and its long orbital period (P.03 = 92.8 days). Nevertheless, its mass upper limit is
imposed by our prior, not the data."
"KOI-1338.03 and KOI-1338.02 have a TTV period longer than the Kepler baseline and weak upper limits
on their masses. Nevertheless, the TTVs provide a strong nonzero lower bound on the mass of KOI-1338.03.
Among our 10,000 samples, the lowest dynamical mass is 0.99 M⊕M� ."
"KOI-2414.01 (Kepler-384 b) and KOI-2414.02 (Kepler-384 c) have expected resonant TTVs (see Table 2),
although in both cases, our mass upper limits are imposed by the prior in density. The TTV period is far
longer than the Kepler baseline, and a wide range of masses are consistent with the data. In both cases, the
prospects for improved mass constraints with future transit times and RV data are high. Similarly, KOI-
2092.03 (Kepler-359 d) has a TTV baseline longer than the Kepler period and a weak upper limit on its
mass."
"Among planets that have not been characterized in prior studies, we note the newly characterized small
planet KOI-654.02 (Kepler-200 c) that has size Rp =1.86 +0.32−0.35 R⊕ and inferred density ρp = 3.36"
"+3.89
−1.68 g cm"
"−3.
Although nominally not dense enough to be rocky, there is a nonnegligible likelihood that the planet is
dense enough to be rocky. Unfortunately, tighter dynamical mass constraints may not become available for
some time: the future TTVs diverge slowly, and the expected RV signal from the each planet at KOI-654 is
just ∼1 m s−1. We also note that at KOI-3503, future transit times should improve the mass constraints on
two Earth-sized planets."
6.1. Estimated Atmospheric Transmission Annuli
"We estimated the 68.3% central credible intervals on the planetary atmospheric scale heights H, where"
"H =
kTeqR2p
µmHGmp"
"Here, k is the Boltzmann constant, µ is the mean molecular weight in atomic mass units, mH is the mass
of atomic hydrogen, G is the gravitational constant and Teq is equilibrium black body temperature given a
Bond albedo of 0.3 and a circular orbit. We assume an atmospheric composition of 75% H2 and 25% He by
mass. We estimated the atmospheric transmission annuli (δann) of our candidates assuming that the annulus
probes five scale heights:"
"δann ≈
10Hδ"
"Rp
(8)"
"where δ is the transit depth.
We consider the planetary masses where the 15.9th percentile is more than half of the median of our pos-"
"terior samples to be strong detections. These are prime candidates for initial atmospheric characterization
with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST, Batalha et al. 2019). For these exoplanets, we convolve
our posterior samples of mass, radius, and equilibrium blackbody temperature to derive posteriors on the"
"estimated planetary atmospheric scale height and the transmission annulus in a cloud-free atmosphere. For
the weaker detections, we report mass upper limits only corresponding to the 97.7th percentile of mass
posterior samples, or the upper limit imposed by a maximum bulk density of 10 g cm−3 on our samples. All
else being equal, a mass upper limit corresponds to a lower bound on the atmospheric scale height. Here
we estimate the minimum transmission annulus from the 2.27th percentile of our samples; that is, 97.7% of
our posterior samples give a transmission annulus above this lower bound."
"Our results reveal promising exoplanets for atmospheric transmission observations, over a wide range
of hosts and equilibrium temperatures. Tables 10—13 list constraints on planetary parameters including
bulk density, equilibrium blackbody temperature, and estimated atmospheric scale height. We compare
our mass estimates to those of prior studies for the same candidates where available, and we estimate
derived quantities including scale height and transmission annulus given the information available in the
prior studies, with additional parameters drawn from Kepler DR 25 as needed."
"Among our candidate sample, several planets have high estimated atmospheric scale heights, and expected
transmission annuli are above 100 ppm, including 35 strong mass detections and 16 planets with upper limits
only on the masses."

"Table 13. Results for four-planet systems: Planetary sizes, masses, bulk densities, equilibrium blackbody tempera-

Uncertainties enclose the 68.3% confidence intervals (with 95.5% confidence intervals in parentheses to inform skew-
ness). We include the Kepler numbers of candidates that are previously confirmed or validated in the first column.
KOI names with an asterisk indicate newly confirmed planets."
"Figure 5 shows the period-radius distribution and mass-radius distribution of our sample. Although the
detections and nondetections are well mixed in the relevant ranges of period, radius, and mass, we see that
the upper limits are, on average, at shorter orbital periods and among smaller planets, consistent with the
detection biases of TTVs (Steffen 2016; Mills & Mazeh 2017). The majority of our planet sample have
sub-Neptune masses."

the sizes of Earth, Neptune and Jupiter. Right panel: Mass-radius diagram of our sample, with the same color scheme
as on the left. Error bars mark 68.3% confidence intervals centered on the median. Upper limits marked with arrows
signify 97.7th percentile boundaries."
"Figure 6 highlights the planets among our sample with estimated transmission annuli above 10 ppm,
alongside their orbital periods, masses, equilibrium temperatures, and some of their host properties. The
highest transmission annuli occur where TTV mass determinations are at their most sensitive, from ∼10
to 200 days. This group is dominated by sub-Neptune-mass planets over a wide range of equilibrium
blackbody temperatures that reach as low as ∼300 K. The hosts have a wide range of sizes and effective
temperatures, although the strong planet mass detections are primarily at hotter stars."
6.2. Radial Velocity Candidates
"We estimated the RV signal expected from our mass determinations or upper limits, and we list the
strongest candidates in Table 19 in Appendix D. Of the planets with strongly detected masses, we identify
planets with a nominal RV signal above 2 m s−1. For candidates with mass upper limits only, we estimate the
expected upper limit in RV amplitude. Where these upper limits exceed 2 m/s, RV may impose tighter mass
upper limits than the existing transit timing data, assuming a precision of 2 m s−1 for Kepler magnitudes <
13.5 (Marcy et al. 2014), and we mark these with an asterisk. In addition to these, we note that ExoFOP
Kepler lists the Kepler magnitude of KOI-2414 as 13.6, making it a strong candidate for combined RV and
TTV follow-up. RV may also be useful where dynamical mass posteriors of interacting planets are strongly
correlated, even if only one of the planet pair is detectable in RV. Such targets include KOI-222, KOI-877,
KOI-2195, KOI-2414, and KOI-3503."
7. CONCLUSION
"We have identified a sample of planets with an expectation of TTV mass detections, and we include the
nondetections in our analysis to reduce the detection bias in population studies with TTV masses. Our sam-
ple of systems for TTV analysis is based on planet sizes and orbital periods and not any prior identification
of periodicities in the transit times. With forward-modeling of our TTV posteriors, we project future transit
times with uncertainties for our planetary sample up to 2026 and have further identified a target list for
follow-up transit photometry that can be efficiently planned. This is a compromise between systems with"

"TTVs that diverge slowly enough for additional data to be of value, but not so much that a transit observa-
tion cannot be planned for a specific future date. We have found that the uncertainty on projected transit
times is most sensitive to the coherence time of near-resonant signals, with TTV periodicities longer than
the Kepler baseline causing the most rapid divergence in predicted times. However, we also found that the
expectation of TTV signals of both resonant and nonresonant periodicities is moderately correlated with
smaller projected uncertainties in transit times."
"We verify the planetary nature of four candidates: KOI-1831.03, KOI-1833.02, KOI-3503.01, and KOI-
3503.02, where TTV models improve at the 3 −σ level with free masses compared to massless models for
the previously unverified candidates."
"We have identified where eccentricities are well constrained and where joint posteriors imply non-zero
relative eccentricity among planet pairs."
"To characterize our planet sample, we have used stellar parameters that in many cases improve upon data
that were available in prior TTV studies of Kepler’s multitransiting systems."
"Finally, we have identified candidate systems for atmospheric transmission spectroscopy by estimating the
cloud-free transmission annulus for TTV systems to provide an unbiased target list for atmospheric retrieval
with JWST, over a wide range of stellar parameters and planetary orbits. While the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite (TESS) will provide typically brighter targets than our sample, the Kepler sample will likely
provide an important contribution to atmospheric studies among Neptunes and sub-Neptunes in the range
of orbital distances probed by TTV analyses."

APPENDIX E: MEASURED LONG-CADENCE TRANSIT TIMES FOR SYSTEMS
"For most systems, we adopt the transit times of Rowe & Thompson (2015). For Kepler-289 d (Planet
Hunters PH3 c), we use the times of Schmitt et al. (2014). For planets that are likely interacting that are not
in the TTV catalog of Rowe & Thompson (2015), we measured center of transit times using the photomet-
ric transit modeling TRANSITFIT5 package (Rowe 2016). The model assumes a noninteracting Keplerian
orbit with the analytic quadratic limb-darkening model of Mandel & Agol (2002). An initial model fit was
performed assuming no transiting timing variations. The model parameters for the template are stellar mean
density, photometric zero-point, mean orbital period, center of transit time, impact parameter, and scaled
planetary radius. Model parameters were initialized using the parameters reported in the Kepler DR 25
catalog (Thompson et al. 2018). The template is then fitted to each individual transit with only the center of
transit time allowed to vary. The individual midtransit times are then used to deTTV the photometric light
curve by adjusting observation times to produce a perfectly periodic transit curve. Observation time adjust-
ments are based on a linear interpolation of measured transit times relative to the orbital period (observed
versus calculated). The transit-template model is then updated by the fitted model against the deTTVed light
curve. Uncertainties are based on the variance of model fit residuals that assume independent photometric
measurements with Gaussian uncertainties."
"Our measured transit times are available in their entirety in electronic format. We list the first few rows of
Table 20 (KOI-520), Table 21 (KOI-750), Table 22 (KOI-1353), and Table 23 (KOI-3503) in this appendix
to show formatting."
