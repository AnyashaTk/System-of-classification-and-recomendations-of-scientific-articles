"ABSTRACT. In this paper, we study the linear stability properties of perturbations around the"
homogeneous Couette flow for a 2D isentropic compressible fluid in the domain T× R.
In the inviscid case there is a generic Lyapunov type instability for the density and the
"irrotational component of the velocity field. More precisely, we prove that their L
2"
norm grows
"as t
1/2"
"and this confirms previous observations in the physics literature. Instead, the solenoidal"
"component of the velocity field experience inviscid damping, meaning that it decays to zero"
even in the absence of viscosity.
"For a viscous compressible fluid, we show that the perturbations may have a transient"
"growth of order ν
−1/6"
"(with ν
−1"
being proportional to the Reynolds number) on a time-scale
"ν
−1/3"
", after which it decays exponentially fast. This phenomenon is also called enhanced"
dissipation and our result appears to be the first to detect this mechanism for a compressible
"fluid, where an exponential decay for the density is not a priori trivial given the absence of"
dissipation in the continuity equation.

respectively. The shear viscosity is proportional to the inverse of the Reynolds number. When
"ν = λ = 0 we are reduced to the Euler system.
A stationary solution to (1.1)-(1.2) is given by the homogeneous Couette flow, namely a"
"shear flow with a linear velocity profile uE = (y, 0) with constant density ρE = 1. We are
interested in studying the linear stability properties of this flow. Therefore, we consider a"
perturbation around it which is given by
"ρ̃ = ρE + ρ, u = uE + v,"
"for ρ̃,u satisfying (1.1)-(1.2).
The linearized system around the homogeneous Couette flow read as follows"
"∂tρ+ y∂xρ+ div(v) = 0, for (x, y) ∈ T× R, t ≥ 0, (1.3)"
∂tv + y∂xv +
"M2
∇ρ = ν∆v + λ∇div(v), (1.4)"
"where we set p′(1) = 1.
The study of linear stability properties of particular solutions to the equations governing the"
"motion of a fluid is a classical topic in hydrodynamic stability theory [25, 60]."
"For an incompressible fluid, the linear analysis for the Couette flow was already done by"
Kelvin [43] in the 1887. Other classical results have been obtained via an eigenvalue (or
"normal mode) analysis in many different cases, however, the classical stability analysis in"
"general does not agree with the numerical and physical observations [25,57,60]. For instance,"
Trefethen et al. [57] observed that a common feature in these problems is the non-normality
"of the operators involved. In particular, this implies the possibility of large transient growths"
(which are not captured via a pure eigenvalue analysis) that can take out the dynamics from the
linear regime before the stability mechanisms takes over. The Couette flow is the simpler flow
"where these phenomenon are present, therefore the stability analysis of this particular case is"
the prototypical example to understand some of the mechanisms involved in the dynamics.
The analysis of the full nonlinear problem is extremely challenging even in the simpler
"cases. For an incompressible and homogeneous fluid in the Euler regime, Arnold [2] obtained"
"an elegant stability result for a particular class of shear flows. However, some relevant flows,"
"such as the Couette one, do not belong to this class. In the last ten years, the problem re-"
"ceived a renewed attention. For the Couette flow, Lin and Zeng [47] showed the existence"
of stationary solutions which are not shear flows and are arbitrarily close to the Couette flow
"in a sufficiently low regularity space (H3/2
−"
"for the vorticity), meaning that a perturbation"
around Couette may not converge towards a shear flow. A breakthrough in the understanding
of the nonlinear stability properties of the planar Couette flow has been made by Bedrossian
"and Masmoudi [7]. In particular, in the domain T × R they proved the asymptotic stability
of the vorticity in a high-regularity space (Gevrey-1/2−) which implies the inviscid damping
of the velocity field. Namely, the vorticity is mixed by the background flow and the velocity"
"field strongly converge in L2 to a shear flow close to Couette with polynomials rates of conver-
gence. This phenomenon share analogies with the Landau damping [8, 14, 33, 54]. For more"
"general shear flows the analysis is highly non-trivial even at a linear level [40, 58, 59, 62] and"
"nonlinear inviscid damping results have been obtained very recently [39, 52]. Linear inviscid"
damping results are available also for the Couette flow [61] and shear near Couette in a 2D
inhomogeneous incompressible fluid [10].
"When viscosity is present more stability results are available, for instance the nonlinear"
Couette case was studied by Romanov in the ’70s [55]. The stability mechanism present
at the inviscid level can also combine with the dissipation and one observes an enhanced
dissipation of some components of the perturbations around the equilibrium. This is possible
since the advection causes an energy cascade towards small spatial scales where dissipation
"takes over. In addition, due to the observed transient growths, a question of great interest in"
1 Introduction 3
"the viscous problem is a quantification of transition thresholds, namely how small the initial"
"perturbation has to be with respect to the viscosity parameter. On this side, several numerical"
studies predicted a power law dependence and estimated the exponents below which stability is
"possible. In the last ten years, enhanced dissipation and transition thresholds results have been"
proved in several cases and we refer to [5] for a detailed literature review on the known results
"until 2017. More recent results, including vortices, inhomogeneous incompressible fluids and"
"passive scalar problems related to fluid dynamics can be found in [6,17–23,29,46,51,63,64]."
In the compressible case the literature is significantly less developed with respect to the
incompressible one. The extension of the standard stability analysis to the compressible case
"has been already considered starting from the ’40s [11, 12, 24, 27, 44, 56]. In the review paper"
"[37] there is the extension of Arnold’s method for a 2D isentropic compressible fluid. However,"
"at least to our knowledge, a complete non-modal mathematical analysis of the Couette flow"
was not considered previously in the literature. The linearization around the Couette flow in the
"2D isentropic compressible Euler dynamics was instead considered in the physics literature,"
"both from the numerical point of view and from the theoretical one, a highly incomplete list"
"of papers includes [3, 15, 16, 35, 36] and references therein. In particular, the 2D inviscid"
problem (with an additional Coriolis forcing term) has been considered as a first model to
understand the formation of spiral arms in a rotating disk galaxy by Goldreich and Lynden-
"Bell [31, 32]. In [32, Sec. 5-6] they directly consider the linearized initial value problem"
and they derive a second order ODE satisfied by the density in the Fourier space. From this
"equation, appealing to some formal approximation, they deduce an instability phenomenon"
"that appears specifically due to the compressibility of the flow. More precisely, they obtain"
"that |ρ(t)| ∼ O(t1/2). The problem (without the Coriolis force) was then studied also by
Chagelishvili et al. in [15, 16] where, with analogous computations, it is observed that"
|ρ(t)|+ |v(t)| ∼ O(t1/2).
"In [13] the analysis of Goldreich and Lynden-Bell was revisited, supplemented with numerical"
"simulations and are also highlighted similarities to the case studied in [16]. Recently, more re-"
"fined numerical simulations and analysis can be found in [3,36], where the results are justified"
with some formal asymptotic expansion. We notice that in the results mentioned above the
"asymptotic expansions are formally justified if M ≪ 1, whereas in astrophysical applications
the interesting regimes are for M > 1 [13, 49]."
"For the viscous compressible plane Couette flow, Glatzel in 1988 [30] has investigated linear"
"stability properties via a normal mode analysis, see also [26, 38]. Hanifi et al. in [35] have"
"numerically investigated a transient growth mechanism in the non-isothermal case, showing"
"that the maximum transient growth scales as O(ν−2) and increases with increasing Mach
number, see also the more recent result [50]. Then, Farrell and Ioannou in [28] considered"
"the linear problem (1.3)-(1.4) and showed a rapid transient energy growth, that at large Mach"
"numbers greatly exceed the expected one in the incompressible case, which is then damped"
"due to the effect of viscosity. By some heuristic argument, the authors have also observed"
that the transient growth is due to purely inviscid and compressible effects in agreement with
"[15,16]. In addition, in the numerical simulations shown in [28, Fig. 1] the author consider as"
"parameters M = {0, 50} and ν−1 = 5000 (where M = 0 correspond to the incompressible
dynamics) and in both cases the perturbation decay on a time-scale much faster with respect"
to the standard diffusive one (which is O(ν−1)). In the viscous incompressible case it is
"well known [5] that the dissipation become effective on a time-scale O(ν−
1"
"3 ), whereas for
the compressible case a precise quantification of the time-scale is not known. Lastly, in the"
"mathematics literature we mention the more recent results obtained by Kagei [41, 42], where"
"the Couette flow is generated by the top plate of an infinite channel, in dimension n, moving
along the x-direction with constant velocity and with the bottom plate fixed. The author proves
an asymptotic stability result for small Mach and Reynolds numbers. The conditions on the"
1.1 Statement of the results 4
parameters have been relaxed by Li and Zhang [45] imposing Navier-slip boundary conditions
at the bottom plate.
"1.1. Statement of the results. In this paper, we confirm and make more precise the linear"
"inviscid instability phenomena found in the above mentioned literature. In particular, we are"
able to prove that the solenoidal component of the velocity field experience inviscid damping
whereas the irrotational component and the density have a linear Lyapunov instability for a
"generic class of initial data. Then, in the viscous case, we confirm the observations made in"
[28] by showing that dynamics is qualitatively the same to the inviscid case up to a time-scale
"O(ν−
1"
"3 ), after which viscosity become effective and the perturbations decay exponentially
fast. This is not a priori trivial in view of the absence of viscosity in the continuity equation."
"Before stating our main result, for any velocity field v, we denote"
"α = div(v), ω = ∇⊥ · v.
The Helmholtz projection operators are defined in the usual way, namely"
"v = (vx, vy)T = ∇∆−1α+∇⊥∆−1ω := Q[v] + P [v], (1.5)"
"where ∇⊥ = (−∂y, ∂x)T . The system (1.3)-(1.4), in terms of (ρ, α, ω) read as
∂tρ+ y∂xρ+ α = 0, for (x, y) ∈ T× R, t ≥ 0, (1.6)"

"−1)ω, (1.9)"
"hence (1.6)-(1.8) is a closed system in terms of the variables (ρ, α, ω). Notice that when ν = 0
one has"
"(∂t + y∂x)(ρ+ ω) = 0, (1.10)"
"namely, there is an extra conservation law along the flow. We comment about this important"
feature in the sequel.

"For the sake of brevity, we do not explicit the dependence of the bounds with respect to the"
"Sobolev norms of the initial data. We simply write Cin = Cin(ρ
in, αin, ωin) to indicate a"
suitable combination of Sobolev norms of the initial data. Those constants may also depend
"on quantities increasing with respect to the Mach number, namely (1 +M)β or exp(Mβ) for
some β ≥ 1. A more precise statement of the theorem below will be given in Sections 3 and

"Notice that when M = 0 (and αin = ρin = 0), formally the estimates (1.13)-(1.14) give

"We remark that the dynamics of the x-averages decouples with respect to fluctuations
around it, as we will show in Section 2 where we comment more about the evolution of the"
"zero x-mode.
In the following, we discuss the results given in the theorem above and we outline the strat-"
"egy of proof by considering separately the inviscid and the viscous case, which we investigate"
in Section 3 and Section 4 respectively.
"1.2. Inviscid case. For ν = λ = 0, the estimates (1.12) and (1.15) give the first rigorous
justification to the growth predicted in [3, 15, 16, 36], where, in order to implement a WKB"
"asymptotic analysis, the authors had to restrict themselves to a small Mach number regime."
The result in the inviscid case was announced in our unpublished note [1]. We emphasize
that the result stated in Theorem 1.1 is actually more general since it removes the smallness
assumption on the Mach number. We also see that only the density and the irrotational part of
"the velocity field are growing, whereas in (1.13)-(1.14) we show an inviscid damping result for"
"the solenoidal component of the velocity, with slower decay with respect to the incompressible"
"case. Indeed, this slow down of the inviscid damping is exactly compensated by the time"
"growth of the compressible part of the fluid, as we explain in Remark 1.2.1 below."
Remark 1.2. For some particular initial data the lower bound in (1.15) may not be valid.
"However, as we shall see in Proposition 3.8, we are able to explicitly construct an arbitrary"
"small perturbation of the initial data, at any fixed frequency k, η, for which the lower bound
holds true. Therefore the set to exclude is nowhere dense in any Sobolev space in which the"
"initial data is taken, which implies a generic (in the sense of Baire category) Lyapunov type"
instability.
"1.2.1. On the conservation of ρ + ω. As observed in (1.10), when ν = 0 then ρ + ω is
conserved along the Couette flow, namely"
"(ρ+ ω)(t, x+ yt, y) = (ρin + ωin)(x, y). (1.16)"
"This relation was clearly observed also in [3,15,16,31,32,36]. In particular, in [13,16] the au-"
thors notice that this conservation law cause an “emergence of acoustic waves from vortices”.
"Indeed, (1.16) immediately connects compressible and incompressible phenomena. Namely,"
an increase of the vorticity need to be compensated by a decrease for the density and the other
"way around. In addition, Theorem 1.1 implies that the density and the irrotational part of the"
"velocity exhibit a growth in time even when the initial perturbation satisfies ρin = αin = 0.
This can be seen from the linearized equations (1.6)-(1.8), where the identity (1.9) for vy yields"
1.3 Viscous case 6
"a source term, depending on the vorticity, in the equation for the divergence (1.7). This inter-"
play between density and vorticity is also the cause of the slow-down of the inviscid damping
for the solenoidal component of the velocity with respect to the homogeneous incompressible
"We also point out that (1.16) can be seen as the linear analogue of the potential vorticity,"
"i.e. ω̃/ρ̃, being transported along the flow, where ω̃ = ∇⊥ · u for ρ̃,u satisfying (1.1)-(1.2).
Indeed, a direct computation shows that"
")
+ u · ∇"
")
= 0. (1.17)"
"Then, since we are considering perturbations around the Couette flow we have"
"ω̃ = −1 + ω, ρ̃ = 1 + ρ.
Consequently, writing down (1.17) in Lagrangian coordinates we deduce"
"ω(t,X(xin, t)) +
1− ωin(xin)
1 + ρin(xin)"
"ρ(t,X(xin, t)) =
ρin(xin) + ω"
in(xin)
"1 + ρin(xin)
,"
"where X is the flow associated to u, given by"
"dt
X(t,xin) = u(X(t,Xin))"
"X(0,xin) = xin."
"Assuming that we are in perturbative regime, namely |ωin| ≪ 1 and |ρin| ≪ 1 one has
(1−ωin)/(1+ ρin) ≈ 1. Hence, by the previous heuristic argument at the nonlinear level, we
see why, at least formally, the conservation of ρ+ω can be considered as a linear approximation
of the conservation of the potential vorticity for perturbations around the Couette flow with"
constant density.
"The exact conservation along the Couette flow of ρ+ ω plays a central role in our analysis
in the inviscid case."
Strategy of proof. Let us now briefly discuss the strategy of proof for the Theorem 1.1 when
"ν = λ = 0. First of all, we remove the transport terms by defining the change of coordinates
dictated by the background shear. Then, on this reference frame we have the exact conservation"
"of the quantity ρ + ω, so that we are able to reduce the degrees of freedom for the system
(1.6)-(1.8) and write a 2 × 2 system only involving the density and the divergence in the
moving frame. Taking its Fourier transform in all the space variables, it can be studied as a"
"2 × 2 non-autonomous dynamical system at any fixed frequency k, η. Performing a suitable
symmetrization via time dependent Fourier multipliers, we can infer an energy estimate useful"
to deduce some property of the associated solution operator. Once the dynamics at any fixed
"frequency is understood, Theorem 1.1 follows as a consequence and can be proved by going"
back to the original variables.
"We present a more precise statement of Theorem 1.1 in Theorems 3.5 and 3.7, where we"
consider separately the upper and lower bounds respectively.
"1.3. Viscous case. Theorem 1.1 for ν > 0 gives a rigorous mathematical justification for
the observations made in [28]. At least to our knowledge, it appears to be the first enhanced"
dissipation estimate in the compressible case. In the bound (1.12) we see the possibility of a
"large transient growth of order O(ν−
1"
"6 ) on a time scale O(ν−
1"
"3 ). This growth is due to the
instability mechanism found in the inviscid case. Instead, the bounds (1.13)-(1.14) combines"
inviscid damping and enhanced dissipation for the solenoidal component of the velocity.
"The numerical observations made in [28, 35, 50] shows that the transient growth increases"
"at increasing Mach number, see for example [35, Fig. 9]. In Theorem 1.1 we have not an"
"explicit dependence since, as previously mentioned, we are neglecting constants which can"
1.3 Viscous case 7
grow exponentially fast with respect to the Mach number. It may be of interest to estimate the
"dependence on the Mach number in an optimal way. For instance, improving the constants up"
"to O(Mβ) for some β ≥ 1, would imply that the density may experience a transient growth of
order O(Mβ+1ν−"
Remark 1.3 (Restrictions on the Mach number). In Theorem 1.1 we have to restrict our anal-
"ysis to the case of Mach numbers satisfying M ≤ min{(ν + λ)−
1"
"2 , ν−
1"
"3}. For ν, λ ≪ 1 the
last assumption is not really restrictive since in most physical applications M ≤ 1 and in the
astrophysical context M ∼ 10 − 50 [13, 49]. However, as we explain in Remark 4.7, the
condition can be easily relaxed to"
"M ≤ min{(ν + λ)−
1"
"2 , δ−1ν−
1"
"3 }
for any 0 < δ ≤ 1, at the price of deteriorating the decay rates by a factor δ−1, namely instead
of e−cν"
"1
3 t one has e−δcν"
"1
3 t. The hypothesis M ≤ (ν + λ)−"
"2 , instead, is more rigid."
"Remark 1.4 (Absence of shear viscosity). If we set ν = 0 and λ > 0 the dissipation is present
only in the equation for the divergence. This particular case is not immediately covered by"
Theorem 1.1 since one may infer more properties. We briefly discuss more about this point in
Remark 4.2
"Remark 1.5 (Regularity of the initial data). In Theorem 1.1, since we want to combine the"
"inviscid and viscous dynamics, we are not interested in providing sharp regularity assumptions"
"on the initial data. It is indeed natural to trade regularity for time decay in the inviscid problem,"
as also observed in the incompressible case [5].
"In view of the previous remark, we stress that in the viscous case it is not necessary to lose"
regularity and we are able to infer the following.
"Theorem 1.6. Let ν > 0, λ ≥ 0 and M > 0 be such that ν + λ ≤ 1/2 and M ≤ min{(ν +

"In the bound (1.18), at the price of having worst estimates with respect to the one in Theorem"
"1.1, we see that we do not lose derivatives to get the exponential decay for the quantities on"
"the left-hand side. Then, the bound (1.19) does not straightforwardly follow by (1.18). It is"
indeed a consequence of a careful choice of some Fourier multipliers used to prove (1.18). In
"addition, since 〈t〉

"2 . ν−

order of magnitude of the maximal possible growth. The estimates and the method of proof of"
Theorem 1.6 can be useful to extend this linear result to prove a transition threshold in Sobolev
"spaces for the fully nonlinear case, which we aim at studying."
Strategy of proof. We now comment about the strategy of proof of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem
"1.6. Being similar, we outline here the main ideas in both cases."
"When viscosity is present, we have to overcome two main difficulties. First of all, as can be"
"seen by summing up (1.6) and (1.8), the conservation of ρ+ω along the Couette flow no longer"
1.3 Viscous case 8
"holds, which is a crucial point in the inviscid case. Therefore, we cannot reduce the analysis"
"to the study of a 2 × 2 system. The second point is that, since we do not have a dissipative
term in (1.6), it is not a priori trivial to have decay for the density. However, we will be able"
to recover the exponential decay via a weighted energy estimate where it is crucial to exploit
"the coupling between ρ and α,
As done in the inviscid case, we first remove the transport terms via the standard change of"
"coordinates and we perform the Fourier transform in both space variables, leading us to the"
"study of a 3 × 3 system in the Fourier space. It is then crucial to replace the vorticity with
another auxiliary quantity, i.e. ρ + ω − νM2α, which satisfy a more complicated equation
with respect to ω but has a better structure to make use of this variable in energy estimates.
Then, we are able to define a weighted energy functional in terms of (ρ, α, ρ + ω − νM2α)
for which we can infer a Grönwall’s type estimate. The weights are suitable time-dependent"
Fourier multipliers. The main difference between the proof of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.6
is the choice of the weights.
"Outline of the paper. We begin our analysis with the study of the dynamics of the x-averages
in Section 2. In Section 3 we consider the inviscid problem in order to prove Theorem 1.1"
"when ν = λ = 0. In Section 4 we turn our attention to the viscous case. Here, we first prove
Theorem 1.1 in Subsection 4.1. Then, in Subsection 4.2 we present the proof of Theorem 1.6."
"Notations. In this paper, when using the symbol . we are neglecting constants which do not"
"depend on ν but may depend on (1 +M)β or exp(Mβ) for some β ≥ 1. However, we keep
track of constants which goes to zero as M → 0."
When it will be clear from the context whether we are working in the physical space or in the
"frequency space, by an abuse of notation, we will not distinguish between pseudo-differential"
operators and their own symbols.
We denote the Fourier transform as
"f̂(k, η) =
1"
"T×R
e−i(kx+ηy)f(x, y)dxdy,"
"f(x, y) =
1"
"ei(kx+ηy)f̂(k, η)dη,"
We say that f ∈ Hs1x Hs2y whenever
"‖f‖2
H"
"s1
x H"
"∫
〈k〉2s1〈η〉2s2 |f̂ |2(k, η)dη < +∞,"
whereas we denote the norm in the usual Hs(T× R) space as

〈k, η〉2s|f̂ |2(k, η)dη."
"Let Z(t) = (Z1(t), Z2(t))

Given the following 2D non-autonomous dynamical system

2 Dynamics of the k = 0 modes 9
"ΦL is the solution operator associated to L. In particular it satisfies the group property,
ΦL(t, t0) = ΦL(t, s)ΦL(s, t0) for any t, s ≥ 0."
"In order to remove the transport term from the equations, we will always make the following"
change of coordinates
"X = x− yt, Y = y. (1.21)
In particular, the differential operators change as follows"
"∂x = ∂X ,"
"∂y = ∂Y − t∂X ,
∆ = ∆L := ∂XX + (∂Y − t∂X)2."
(1.22)
"In the new reference frame, which we shall often refer to as the moving frame, we also define"
the functions
"R(t,X, Y ) = ρ(t,X + tY, Y ),"
"A(t,X, Y ) = α(t,X + tY, Y ),"
"Ω(t,X, Y ) = ω(t,X + tY, Y )."
(1.23)
"We denote the symbol associated to −∆L as
p(t, k, η) = k2 + (η − kt)2. (1.24)"
Moreover
"(∂tp)(t, k, η) = −2k(η − kt) (1.25)
is the symbol associated to the operator 2∂X (∂Y − t∂X)."
2. Dynamics of the k = 0 modes
"In this section, we investigate in detail the dynamics of the x-averages of the perturbations.
Due to the structure of the shear flow and the fact that the equations are linear, it is clear that"
"the zero mode in x has an independent dynamics with respect to other modes. Consequently, in
our analysis we can decouple the evolution of the k = 0 mode from the rest of the perturbation."
"The system (1.6)-(1.7) when projected onto the k = 0 frequency, recalling (1.11), read as
follows"
"∂tρ0 = −α0, (2.1)"
"∂tα0 = (ν + λ)∂yyα0 −
1"
"M2
∂yyρ0,"
∂tω0 = α0 + ν∂yyω0. (2.2)
"Since v
y
0 satisfy the same equation of α0 = ∂yv"
"y
0 , we will identify ∂"
"−1
y α0 = v"
"When ν = λ = 0 the dynamics of (ρ0, α0) is given by a standard 1-D wave equation,
namely"
"∂ttρ0 −M−2∂yyρ0 = 0, in R, (2.3)
and by adding (2.1) to (2.2) we get"
"∂t(ρ0 + ω0) = 0,"
"hence ω0 = ρ
in
0 + ω"
"in
0 − ρ0. Therefore, when ν = λ = 0 the dynamics of the k = 0 mode is"
"completely determined by solving (2.3). By the explicit representation formula for (2.3), we"
know that there is not decay for the zero modes.
"When ν > 0, one has an explicit representation of the solution in the Fourier space. How-
ever, from this formula it is not immediate to infer decay properties of solutions to (2.1)-(2.2)."
2 Dynamics of the k = 0 modes 10
"We are then going to derive decay properties of the k = 0 by using an energy method in a sim-
ilar way to what was done by Guo and Wang in [34]. In order to perform the energy estimate,"
it will be convenient to replace the equation (2.2) with
∂t(ρ0 + ω0 − νM2α0) = ν∂yy(ρ0 + ω0 − νM2α0)− λνM2∂yyα0.
"In particular, we have the following."
"Theorem 2.1. Let ν, λ ≥ 0 and ρin, αin, ωin be the initial data of (1.6)-(1.8). Then, the
solution (ρ, α, ω) can be decomposed as ρ = ρ0 + ρ6=, α = α0 + α6=, ω = ω0 + ω 6= where
(ρ6=, α6=, ω 6=) satisfy (1.6)-(1.8) and (ρ0, α0, ω0) satisfy (2.1)-(2.2). For the k = 0 mode we
have the following: for any ℓ ≥ 0, let"

"ρin0 = α
in
0 = ω"
"in
0 = 0 =⇒ ρ0(t) = α0(t) = ω0(t) = 0. (2.5)"
"Remark 2.2. In view of the theorem above, it is equivalent to study the dynamics of (ρ −
ρ0, α− α0, ω − ω0) or (ρ, α, ω) assuming that ρin0 = αin0 = ωin0 = 0. In the rest of the paper,
for simplicity of notation, we will always consider the second case."

3. The inviscid case
In this section we investigate in detail the inviscid case. We are going to prove the results
"stated in Theorem 1.1 when ν = λ = 0, for which it is convenient to treat separately the
analysis for the upper and lower bounds, respectively given in Theorem 3.5 and Theorem 3.7."
"As observed in Remark 2.2, we can remove the x-average from the dynamics, so we will prove
the results only for initial perturbations without the k = 0 mode, namely ρin0 = α"
"in
0 = ω"
"in

"0.
To proceed with the analysis of the system (1.6)-(1.8), we eliminate the transport term with"
the change of coordinates (1.21) and we use the notation defined in (1.22)-(1.23).
"By adding (1.6) to (1.8), we find out that ρ+ ω is transported by the Couette flow. Hence,
defining"
"Ξ(t,X, Y ) := R(t,X, Y ) + Ω(t,X, Y ),"
we have that ∂tΞ = 0. Consequently
"Ω(t,X, Y ) = Ξin(X,Y )−R(t,X, Y ), (3.1)
where Ξin = ωin + ρin. In view of (1.9), we also have"

"=(∂Y − t∂X)∆−1L A+ ∂X∆

3.1 Analysis in the Fourier space 13
"We stress again the importance of the identity (3.1), which not only allow us to study the"
system in terms of density and divergence but also relates compressible and incompressible
"effects, see Section 1.2.1."
"In view of the particular choice of the domain, it is now natural to perform the analysis in"
the Fourier space.
3.1. Analysis in the Fourier space. We first take the Fourier transform in both space vari-
"ables of the system (3.2)-(3.3), which become a non-autonomous 2 × 2 dynamical system
at each fixed frequency (k, η). Then, by properly weighting the density and the divergence
we characterize the solution operator of the associated homogeneous problem, i.e. Ξin = 0,
which is a key point in order to prove Theorem 1.1."
"By taking the Fourier transform of the system (3.2)-(3.3), recalling the notation introduced"
"in (1.24)-(1.25), we get that"

"Since in what follows we consider k, η as fixed parameters, we will omit their dependence for
the quantities under study. In Figure 1 we show some numerical simulations of the system"
above.
"Remark 3.1 (Transient decay). From (3.5), since for t < η/k one has ∂tp < 0, the first term"
"in the right-hand side of (3.5) acts as a damping term for Â. Instead, ∂tp > 0 for t > η/k,"
"hence it induces a growth on Â. In the incompressible case, the velocity may experience a
transient growth, here, we see that the divergence may have a transient decay, see Figures 1c"
and 1f. To balance the growth generated by this term we need to properly weight R̂ and Â.

M ≪ 1 one can say that the previous equation is approximated by"

want to construct a perturbation of the initial data. If Ξ̂in(k, η) = 0 there is nothing to prove."
"So we assume that Ξ̂in(k, η) 6= 0.
First of all, by a computation similar to (3.40), we know that limt→∞ Γ(t, k, η) = Γ"

|Γ∞(k, η)| for t ≥ T (Γ∞, k, η). (3.45)"
"Hence, we know that Γ may vanish only for t ∈ [0, T (Γ∞, k, η)]. Then, by (3.44) and the
bound (3.14) in Lemma 3.3, we have"

since in the compact set [0, T (Γ∞)] there are no points t∗ such that Γ(t∗) = ∂tΓ(t"
"∗) = 0,
exploiting also the continuity of ∂tΓ, we have that Γ vanishes at most in a finite number of

Now we can construct the perturbation of the initial data. Consider the set {∂tΓ(ti, k, η)} for

4 The viscous case 22
4. The viscous case
"In this section, we study the system (1.6)-(1.8) in presence of viscosity, namely we assume"
"that ν > 0 and λ ≥ 0. As done in the previous section, we will prove the results only in the
case ρin0 = α"
"in
0 = ω"
"in
0 = 0, since the dynamics of the zero mode decouples with respect to"
"fluctuations around it, see Section 2."
"To remove the transport terms, we again consider the change of coordinates (1.21) and"
"we use the notation introduced in (1.22)-(1.25). Defining µ = ν + λ, by taking the Fourier
transform of the system (1.6)-(1.8) in the moving frame, we have"
"∂tR̂ = −Â, (4.1)"
"∂tÂ =
∂tp"
"p
Â− µpÂ+"
"M2
pR̂−"
"p
Ω̂, (4.2)"
"∂tΩ̂ = Â− νpΩ̂.
In the inviscid case, the conservation of Ξ = R+Ω was crucial in order to have a closed system
in terms of R,A, which allow us to deal with a 2 × 2 non-autonomous system of ODE’s in
the Fourier space. Also in the viscous case it turns out that it is convenient to replace Ω with
another auxiliary variable, however, the conservation of Ξ no longer hold since"
"∂tΞ̂ = −νpΞ̂ + νpR̂. (4.3)
In addition, the last term in the right-hand side of (4.3) may be a problem to perform energy"
"estimates. Indeed, it is not possible to directly control νpR̂ in a straightforward energy estimate
since we do not have a similar dissipative term for R."
"The good unknown. To overcome this difficulty, we observe that"
∂t(Ξ̂− νM2Â) = − νp(Ξ̂− νM2Â) + ν(µ− ν)M2pÂ

"p

"where we have also used Ω = Ξ−R. Although the equation (4.4) looks more complicated with
respect to (4.3), it has a better structure to make use of Ξ−νM2A as an auxiliary variable in an
energy estimate. This because the first term in the right-hand side of (4.4) give us dissipation,"
"the second term scales as the available dissipation for A (notice that if λ = 0 this term does
not appear) and the remaining ones are lower order."
Remark 4.1. One of the main difficulties to obtain an enhanced dissipation estimate is the
"absence of a diffusive term in the continuity equation, because otherwise it would have been"
sufficient to combine the equation (4.3) with an adaptation of the energy estimates given in
"the inviscid case. Instead, we need to take advantage of the underlying wave structure in"
"the system. More precisely, we will be able to exploit the coupling between the density and"
"the divergence to gain a dissipative term for the density. A similar strategy, inspired by the"
"classical paper of Matsumura and Nishida [53], has been already exploited by Guo and Wang"
[34] to prove decay time rates for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with smooth and
small initial data.
"Remark 4.2 (The ν = 0 case). When ν = 0 we have ∂tΞ = 0 as in the inviscid case. This
implies that we can replace Ω with Ξin − R in (4.2) so that the system is closed in terms of
R and A. Then the system to study is much simpler but the exponential decay is not valid
in general. Indeed, if Ξin 6= 0 the forcing term appearing in the equation for the divergence
give us the convergence towards an asymptotic state which is different, in general, from zero."
4.1 Combining the dissipation enhancement with the inviscid mechanism 23
"If Ξin = 0 we again have the exponential decay as in Theorem 1.1 with λ replacing ν in the
bounds. We do not detail this case since it can be deduced with the same method that we are"
going to present in the general scenario.
This section is organized as follows. In Subsection 4.1 we prove Theorem 1.1 whereas in

4.1. Combining the dissipation enhancement with the inviscid mechanism. In this sub-
"section, we prove Theorem 1.1, which combines the dissipation enhancement generated by"
"the presence of the background shear flow with the inviscid dynamics. More precisely, our"
"goal is to obtain estimates such that in the limit ν → 0 we recover the bounds of the invis-
cid case. However, as previously discussed, when viscosity is present there is the loss of a"
"conservation law, meaning that we will need to consider a 3× 3 system in the Fourier space.
The key estimate which allow us to prove Theorem 1.1 is given in the following proposition."

νM2A−R and use the previous proposition to infer estimates on P [v]. This procedure, since
A and Ξ − νM2A have slower decay rates with respect to R (formally, think of p−1 as t−2),
would lead to worst decay rates with respect to the one given in Theorem 1.1 for the solenoidal"
"component of the velocity. In particular, one cannot recover the estimates in the nonviscous"
"and incompressible case by performing the formal limits ν → 0 and M → 0 respectively.
Instead, by solving the equation for Ξ, see (4.3), via Duhamel’s formula, from Proposition"
4.3 we infer the following.

Remark 4.5. Observe that in Proposition 4.3 and in Corollary 4.4 we are losing derivatives.
The loss in (4.6) comes from the technical obstruction that forces us to introduce the weight
"4 for the variable Ξ − νM2A. For λ = 0 one does not have this loss of derivatives, see
Remark 4.8. Instead, the loss of derivatives in (4.7) seems to be necessary in view of the last"

and combining the previous bound with (4.7) we prove (1.13). The bound (1.14) follows

"In order to prove Proposition 4.3, we have to control a weighted energy functional. From"
the bounds on this energy functional the proof of Proposition 4.3 readily follows.
4.1.1. The weighted energy functional. We need to introduce the following Fourier multi-

"Clearly m and m−1 are bounded Fourier multipliers, therefore they generates an equivalent
norm to the standard L2."
The multiplier m is introduced since it enjoys the following crucial property

"m
(t, k, η) ≥ ν"
"3 for any t ≥ 0, k ∈ Z \ {0}, η ∈ R, (4.9)"
which compensates the slow down of the enhanced dissipation mechanism close to the critical
"times t = η/k. We then consider the system given by (R,A,Ξ−νM2A), namely the equations
(4.1), (4.2) when replacing Ω̂ with (Ξ̂−νM2Â)+νM2Â−R̂, and (4.4). Clearly, for the system"

4.2. Dissipation enhancement without loss of derivates. The purpose of this subsection
"is to prove Theorem 1.6, where again we assume that ρin,0 = αin,0 = ωin,0 = 0. In the
following, we first present a toy model to introduce the key Fourier multiplier which is crucial"
"to avoid the loss of derivative encountered in Proposition 4.3, see also Remark 4.5. Then,"
"in analogy with the previous subsection, we present a weighted estimate that follows by the"
control of a suitable energy functional. Theorem 1.6 is a consequence of the weighted estimate.
The key Fourier multiplier. In the inviscid case and in the previous subsection it was crucial
to properly symmetrize the system by weighting the density and the divergence with some
"negative powers of the Laplacian, see (3.7) and (4.10) and recall that p is the symbol associated
to −∆L. This was essential to balance the growth given by the term ∂tp/p present in the
equation for the divergence, see also Remark 3.1. However, in the viscous case it is possible"
"to balance the growth given by ∂tp/p by using the dissipation. To explain how, we consider
a toy model introduced by Bedrossian, Germain and Masmoudi in [4]. In particular, consider"
the following
"∂tf =
∂tp"
"p
f − νpf, (4.46)"
"which is clearly a relevant toy model also in our case, since the first two terms in the right-"
"hand side of (4.2) have exactly this structure. First of all, for t ≤ η/k we know that ∂tp ="
4.2 Dissipation enhancement without loss of derivates 32
"−2k(η − kt) ≤ 0, hence we may ignore this term in an energy estimate. Instead, for t ≥ η/k
we have ∂tp ≥ 0 leading to a growth on f that it is not balanced by the dissipative term, indeed
near the critical times t = η/k one has νp ≈ νk2. More precisely, we cannot hope to have a
uniform estimate like ∂tp/p . νp for t ∈ [η/k, η/k + Cν ] for some Cν . If we are sufficiently

the estimates from weighted to unweighted quantities. Notice also that, in view of (4.54),"
"to control the growth given by ∂tp/p it is enough to have a dissipative term with constant
coefficients. This property will be crucial for the density, where we can hope to recover a"
"similar dissipative term by exploiting its coupling with the divergence, see for example (4.25)."
Let us prove Lemma 4.9
"Proof. The proof of (4.51) and (4.52) readily follows by the definition of w given in (4.50).
To obtain (4.53) and (4.54), when ∂tp ≤ 0, namely 0 ≤ t ≤ η/k, in account of the property"

It thus remain to prove Proposition (4.11). We do not present the proof in detail since it will
