We have computed the properties of compact objects like neutron stars based on equation
"of state (EOS) deduced from a core-envelope model of superdense stars. Such superdense
stars have been studied by solving the Einstein’s equation based on pseudo-spheroidal"
"and spherically symmetric space-time geometry. The computed star properties are com-
pared with those obtained based on nuclear matter equations of state. From the mass-
radius (M −R) relationship obtained here, we are able to classify compact stars in three
categories: (i) highly compact self -bound stars that represents exotic matter composi-"
"tions with radius lying below 9 km (ii) normal neutron stars with radius between 9 to 12
km and (iii) soft matter neutron stars having radius lying between 12 to 20 km. Other"
"properties such as Keplerian frequency, surface gravity and surface gravitational redshift
are also computed for all the three types. The present work would be useful for the study"
of highly compact neutron like stars having exotic matter compositions.
Keywords: neutron star; core-envelope model; dense matter equation of state.

1. Introduction
Neutron stars are one of the densest objects in the observable universe. It represents
"state of matter with highest densities. As such, they are valuable laboratories for"
the study of dense matter. Such studies include interplay between various disciplines
"like general relativity, high-energy astrophysics, nuclear and particle physics etc.1,2"

"Neutron stars have masses of about (1∼3 M�). These stars with masses about 1.2
M� have central densities more than normal nuclear matter density and radius of the"
order of 10 km. The average mass density ρ of the neutron star is approximately 1015
"g cm−3, which is about 3 times the nuclear saturation density ρn= 2.7×1014 g cm−3
and at the core ρ > ρn."
3 The magnetic field of such a compact stars lies between
"108 -10 15 G and possess gravitational field 2 × 1011 cm s−2 times stronger than
that of earth’s gravitational fields. The structure of these stars can be considered"
having an outer and an inner crust. The envelope (outer crust) matter consists of
atomic nuclei (ions) and electrons. The thickness of envelope is few hundred meters.
"The inner crust occurs at a density of 4 × 1011g cm−3 which consists of electrons,
free neutrons and neutron-rich atomic nuclei. The thickness of this crust is typically"
"about few kilometers. The outer crust envelopes the inner crust, which expands"
"from the neutron drip density to a transition density ρ tr ∼ 1.0×1014 g cm−3. And
beyond the transition density one enters the core, where all atomic nuclei have been"
"melt down into their components, neutrons and protons. Caused by the high density"
"and Fermi pressure, the core might also contain more massive baryon resonances"
"or possibly a gas of free up, down and strange quarks. Ultimately, π and K mesons"
condensates may be found there too. All these dissimilar internal structure lead
to different physical equation of state and hence contrasting mass-radius (M-R)
relations.
In view of our inadequate knowledge of the equation of state of matter at ex-
"tremely high densities, when matter density of ultra dense spherical objects is much"
"higher than nuclear saturation density (ρ > ρn), it is difficult to have proper eluci-"
dation of matter in the form of an equation of state and quantitative calculations for
the structure of neutron stars become obscure. A methodical valuation on the struc-
"ture and properties of neutron stars can be found in2,4–10(and references therein)."
Many theorists have developed theoretical models for the structure of neutron stars
"which may be made up of various layers including core (inner and outer), crust"
(inner and outer) in which atomic nuclei are arranged into a crystal and the liq-
"uid ocean composed of the coulomb fluid.2 The central region, i.e., core contains"
"hyperons11,12 or quark matter.13 A detailed analysis of quarks core models are dis-"
"cussed by Bordbar, Bigdell and Yazdizadeh.14 Alternative method to study compact"
high-density astrophysical objects is through the space-time metric of the general
theory of relativity and solving the relevant Einstein’s equations. Such attempts
"particularly for compact object, like the neutron star exist.15 Thus, for the present"
study we make use of the core-envelope model for neutron stars studied based on
the geometric approach making use of the relativistic model for these regions. The
core-envelope model of a neutron star16–18 has different physical properties in en-
"velope and core regions. From this we have considered two different EOS, based"
on anistropic pressure in core or envelope region. The core-envelope models studied
"by Thomas, Ratanpal and Vinodkumar16(TRV model) have considered anisotropic"
pressure in the envelope region and isotropic pressure in the core region. While in

"another case studied by S. Gedela, N. Pant, J. Upreti and R. Pant (SNJR model)17"
have taken both the core and envelope region as anistropic. In both the cases valid
solutions of the Einstein’s equations were studied in appropriate metrics. The EOSs
deduced from these models are then used to compute the neutron star properties.
"Brief descriptions of these two models16,17 are given in the following section."
2. Relativistic core-envelope framework
Our primary focus in this paper is based on the models belonging to the core-
envelope family as discussed by Thomas et al. (TRV) and Gedela et al. (SNJR).
We summarize below only the relevant part of the formalism adopted for the study
of compact objects with appropriate geometric consideration. More details can be
"found in the earlier works16,17"
A nonrotating spherical metric in a most general form can be expressed as19
ds2 = eν(r)dt2 − eλ(r)dr2 − r2dθ2 − r2sin2θdφ2 (2.1)
"where, r is the radial coordinate, θ is the polar angle and φ is the azimuthal angle."
The right boundary condition for the metric is to match (2.1) with the Schwarchild
exterior metric at the surface of the star. It is implemented as20

Thomas et al.16have discussed core-envelope model on pseudo-spheroidal space-
time with core consisting of isotropic distribution of matter and envelope with

"4 A. C. Khunt, V. O. Thomas and P. C. Vinodkumar"
anisotropic distribution of matter. While anisotropic core-envelope models by as-
suming linear equation of state in the core and quadratic equation of state in the
envelope have been studied by Gedela et. al.17 In the following sub-sections we
derive important aspects of these two models.
2.1. The TRV core-envelope model
It has been shown that core and envelope regions consist of different physical fea-
tures. They have chosen ansatz for a pseudo-spheroidal geometry of spacetime to
"solved the Einstein’s equations. According to their metric, potential for pseudo-"
spheroidal geometry is expressed as
"eλ(r) =
1 +K r"

The boundary conditions for the core and envelope regions are
S(r) = 0 for 0 ≤ r ≤ RC and S(r) 6= 0 for RC ≤ r ≤ RE (2.10)
where RC refers to the core boundary radius and RE corresponds to the envelope
boundary radius which is the same as the radius of the star (a) under consideration.
"Making use of these conditions with Eqn. (2.1), (2.4), (2.7) and (2.8), the Einstein"
field equations give the equations for density and pressure
"Accordingly, the density distribution ( core and envelope region ) is expressed as"

"tion in core and envelope region by using boundary condition for 0 ≤ r ≤ RC for
core and RC ≤ r ≤ RE for envelope region.

We have plotted the graph of pressure against density in the TRV model and dis-
played by solid curve in Fig. 1 for density variation parameter λ = 0.01. The best
fit for the pressure-density curve is found to be in the quadratic from

state for different choices of the density variation parameter λ.

An important feature of both of these core-envelope models (TRV and SNJR) is that
they have the stable equilibrium under hydrostatic configuration. Theoretical study
of the relativistic core-envelope model using paraboloidal spacetime by Ratanpal
and Sharma23 have shown that paraboloidal geometry also admit quadratic equa-
tion of state. Other EOSs that we have considered in the present work for com-
parison include those considering different physical compositions of nuclear matter
reported by.24–30 The different models used in this study are listed in Table 1.
A very crucial feature of the equation of state is the causal limit( a sound signal can-
"not propagate faster than the speed of light, ν2s = dp/dρ ≤ c2). In both cases based
on the geometrical models (TRV and SNJR) the causality condition is satisfied."
"In particular, Thomas et al.16 have studied the causality limit for different density"
variables. The computed speed of sound (νs) versus radius as shown in Figure 3.
Both the cases clearly indicate the validity of causality condition.

3. Compact Star Structure : Static Equilibrium configurations
It is vital to explore static and spherical symmetrical gravity sources in general rel-
"ativity, especially when it comes to internal structure of compact objects. For sim-"
"plicity , we consider only nonrotating, spherically symmetric stars. The geometry"
inside the star is described by the familiar Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV)
"equation, which is valid for a perfect fluid.22 The equation of state is all that is"
"required to solve the TOV equations. For static, spherically symmetric stars in hy-"
"drostatic equilibrium, the TOV equations may be written as a pair of first-order"
differential equations. The calculation of neutron star structure is obtained by nu-
merically integrating the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation22

"density for both geometrical models at ρc = 1.34× 1015g cm−3. The seven nuclear
EOSs with a fixed central density at ρc = 1.0×1015g cm−3, equations (3.1) and (3.2)
are integrated numerically to determine the global structure (e.g. radius and mass)"
"of a neutron star. To begin with, the density close to the center of the compact star"
"is assumed to be homogeneous, with the density ρ = ρc, the radius r = 0.1 cm and"
"m(0.1 cm)= 4πρcr
3/3. Equations (3.1) and (3.2) are integrated numerically from"
"r = 0.1 cm to the boundary of the star, where the pressure falls to zero (P (a) = 0"
). The total mass of the star is then given by M = m(a).
"Using the data files provided by Özel et al.,31 we have re-ploted pressure-density"
profile corresponds to all the model EOS’s listed in Table 1 along with geometric
EOS’s of TRV and SNJR. It can be seen that these EOS’s distinctly differ from
each other.

The composition and model used for all these equation of state and their respective
bibliographic references are also listed in Table 1. Making use of these equations of
"state, we obtained the mass-radius relationship for a compact star."
The mass-radius relations obtained with the help of nuclear equations of state of
different compositions are compared with the geometrical equations of state and
are plotted in Fig. 4. These plots reiterate the fact that nuclear and geometrical
equations of state manifest three distinct types of compact stars. The first one cor-
"responds to the two cases represented by the models 7 and 8 of Table 1 , the second"
one corresponds to the models (1 to 6) largely represented by the nuclear matter
EOSs and third type corresponds to the model (9) represented by the geometric
model (SNJR). In all the three cases the maximum masses correspond to stable
"structure varies from 1.4 to 2.3 M�, while the radius at their maximum masses"
"lie 8 - 9 kms in the case of the first category, 9 - 12 kms in the cases of (second"
category) and beyond 12 km in the case of the third category. The central density
"January 5, 2021 2:2 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE ws-ijmpd"
"12 A. C. Khunt, V. O. Thomas and P. C. Vinodkumar"
at maximum mass obtained here for the stable configurations are listed in Table 2.
Fig. 5. (Color online) Neutron star mass as a function of radii for pure nuclear matter EOSs vs.
geometrical EOSs. The labels are explained in Table 1.
The M-R diagram obtained from the two geometrically deduced models behave
differently. We found that TRV equation of state resulted into the mass-radius
"curve similar to the one obtained for strange quark matter stars (SQM1, label-"
"7).39 The monotonically increasing mass with radius (M ∝ a3) is expected for
the class of ultra compact objects which are self-bound.32 The surface density of"
strange star is roughly fourteen orders of magnitude larger than the surface density
of normal neutron stars.40 The TRV model gives a stable configuration in the same
"orders of magnitude, with the surface density, ρs ≈ 2× 1014 g cm−3. Thus, it is an
appropriate geometrical model for the study of ultra compact stars having exotic"
matter composition.
The isotropic fluid distribution in the core part of the TRV model16 is justified if the
"core matter distribution is of quarks or strange matter, governed by MIT bag model."
"Further, the envelope with anisotropic fluid distribution can be viewed as due to"
hadronization to baryonic matter. Thus the TRV model prediction fit well with that
"January 5, 2021 2:2 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE ws-ijmpd"
Distinct Classes of Compact Stars Based On Geometrically Deduced Equations of State 13
"of the strange quark matter stars with its maximum mass, (Mmax = 1.69M�) and"
"radius, 8.76 km. The SNJR model that predicts the third category in which EOS"
has the linear behaviour inside the core and quadratic behaviour at the envelope
has resulted into the M-R diagram different from all other cases. Its M-R curve is
broader as compared to all other cases studied here. And its density is much lower
than that of normal neutron like stars. Recent observations of binary neutron-star
mergers (GW170817) have reported an estimation for the radius of the neutron star
in the range 10.6 to 11.5 kilometers.42
3.2. Keplerian frequency (rotation frequency of neutron star)
The Kepler frequency expresses the balance of centrifugal and gravitational force
on a particle on equatorial plane at the surface of a star. It is expressed as
"a3
, (3.3)"
where the subscript c denotes classical symmetry of the centrifugal and gravitational
"forces, which is the Newtonian expression for the Kepler angular velocity. This"
"equation do to not hold in General Relativity, but as it turn out, it holds to very"
good accuracy if the right side is multiplied by a prefactor(C).44 It has been shown
"by J. M. Lattimer, et al.,43 Haensel et al.44 and B. Haskell et al.45 that the numerical"
"value of the Keplerian frequency, namely the maximum rotational frequency of"
"a neutron star accounting for the effects of general relativity, deformation , and"
"independent on the EOS, can be well fitted from the simple formula"
"ΩK ≈ C
("
")1/2(
10 km"
")3/2
Hz , (3.4)"
"providing the neutron star mass is not very close to the maximum stable value, M"
and a are the mass and the radius of the nonrotating star respectively. The constant
C of Eq.3.4 are given by B. Haskell et al.45 For the self bound compact stars it is
given as 1.15 KHz and for other gravitationally bound neutron stars it is given as
1.08 KHz.
The deduction of ΩK generally requires the calculation of rotating general rela-
"tivistic configurations. Nevertheless , Haensel et al. (2009) have shown to a good"
"degree of accuracy that the mass-shedding frequency ΩK,max can be determined by"
"the EOS-independent empirical formula as given in Eq.(3.4). On the other hand, it"
allows to determine ΩK using the mass and radius of the nonrotating star.
The calculated Keplerian frequency based on the mass-radius relations obtained us-
ing all the nine equations of state are shown in Fig. 6. Here we found that Keplerian
frequency corresponds to TRV and SQM1 are similar with higher values of ΩK (
14-18 KHz). While other cases ΩK varies from 2 KHz to 18 KHz. The results of

Keplerian frequency for the maximum mass of stable stars are shown in Table 2 for
all the nine models.
3.3. Surface Gravity
"The surface gravity of neutron stars denoted by gs (i.e., the acceleration due to"
"gravity as measured on the surface), is an important parameter for the study of"
neutron star atmospheres.36 The upper bound of the surface gravity for neutron
stars with various baryonic EOSs is studied by Bejger et al. (2004).37 The surface
gravity of neutron star is many orders of magnitude larger than that of other stars;
"it is ∼ 1012 times stronger than gravity at the Earth surface, and 105 times larger
than that for the white dwarfs."
"The expression for gs is given by

tance of relativistic effects for a neutron star mass M and radius a is characterized
"by the compactness parameter rg/a. Usually for a neutron star with M = 1.4 M�
and Radius is about 10 km, surface gravity becomes (gs) = 2.43 × 1014 cm s−2. In
consequence it is suitable to measure gs in units of 10"

"as gs,14 ≡ gs/(1014 cm s−2). The computed surface gravity, gs,14 for all the cases
studied here are shown in Fig. 8 against mass expressed in M�. The numerically"

"It is found that for M = 1.4 M�, gs,14 ranges from 1.43 to 2.8 and for M ≈ 2.0 M�
the surface gravity lies between 1.88 to 4.38 . The nuclear EOSs (labeled : 1 and 6)"
"with an exotic quarks phase have relatively low gs,max. A similar situation occurs"
for the SNJR EOS that gives lowest value of surface gravity. The only reason SNJR
EOS have low surface gravity is that they have a greater radius compared to other
"EOSs. The TRV EOS (labeled 8 ) yields gs,max similar to BKS19 and SLy EOSs."

3.4. Gravitational Redshift of Neuron Star
In general relativity the ratio of the emitted wavelength λe at the surface of a
nonrotating neutron star to the observed wavelength λ0 received at radial coordinate
"r, is given by λe/λ0 = [gtt(a)/gtt(r)]
1/2. From this the definition of gravitational"
"redshift, z ≡ (λ0 − λe)/λe from the surface of the neutron star as measured by a
distant observer (gtt(r)→ −1) is given by"
"z =| −gtt(a) |−1/2 −1 =
("
"1−
2GM"
")−1/2
− 1 (3.6)"
We compute the limit of the redshift from the surface of a neutron star using Eqn
"(3.8) where gtt = −eλ(r) = −(1 − 2GM/c2a) is the metric components.22 For a
given EOSs the maximum value zmaxsurf increase with increase of Mmax. Neutron stars"
"of M ≥ M� are expected to have sizable zsurf. The computed values of zsurf for all
the cases studied here are listed in Table 2. The computed values of zsurf are found"
to lie between 0.2 to 0.3.

stellar gravitational mass for the nine considered EOS models.
"From the listed values of xGR in Table 2, we found that all the models studied here"
"satisfy the Buchdahl inequality,46 a ≥ (9/8)rg = (9/4)GM/c2 which is stricter than"
"January 5, 2021 2:2 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE ws-ijmpd"
Distinct Classes of Compact Stars Based On Geometrically Deduced Equations of State 17
the Schwarzschild bound. A consequence of this is that the gravitational redshift
"should satisfy z ≤ 2. The precise upper bound on the surface redshift for neutron
star is zsurf = 0.851 for subluminal EOSs."
"38 In the present study, we found that"
zsurf for all the nine cases computed here lie much below the upper bound for the
gravitational redshift.
4. Results and Discussion
"We have computed several properties of a compact star like neutron star, using"
nuclear and geometrically deduced equations of state. We have used geometrical
"equations of state from the core envelope model, that describes different properties"
of the physics in the core and envelope region. Many similarities and dissimilarities
are observed from the properties computed based on the geometrical EOSs and the
nuclear EOSs.

In Table 2 we have listed computed properties of such a compact star with all
"the different types of EOSs. Like, maximum mass (Mmax), stellar radius (amax)"
"correspond to the maximum mass , central density (ρc), Keplerian frequency (Ωk)"
"correspond to the maximum mass for the stable structure of the star, gravitational"
"redshift (zsurf), surface gravity (gs) and compactness parameter (xGR). We com-"
pared all these properties with the properties obtained from geometrically deduced
equations states. The properties obtained from TRV equation of state are in good
accordance with the properties obtained from other nuclear matter based models.
While the parameters obtained using the SNJR model are quite different from oth-
ers except for zsurf and (xGR). The central density that yields the maximum mass
"of ≈ 2 M� in the case of SNJR is very low and the radius is about 12 km. It is
also reflected in the low values of the surface gravity. It is noticed that mass-radius"
configuration as shown in Fig. 5 obtained from geometrical models will be pertinent
"for divergent class of compact stars. Particularly, the pseudo-spheroidal spacetime"
of TRV model seemed to describe the ultra dense compact stars like the strange

"18 A. C. Khunt, V. O. Thomas and P. C. Vinodkumar"
self-bound stars. The spacetime geometry adopted for the SNJR model represents
"low density neutron like star,17 where radius lie between 12 ≤ R ≤ 20 kms.
The mass-radius diagram in Fig. 5 clearly classify the nature of compact stars in"
three categories :(i) highly compact self-bound stars represented by the TRV Model
and SQM1 model with exotic matter compositions (ii) the normal neutron stars
with nuclear matter EOS and (iii) the ultra soft compact stars represented by the
"SNJR geometrical model. At the end, we are able to identify a correspondence"
between the geometric description with the structure of the matter distribution in
"compact objects like a strange star. To summarize, we have been able to classify"
neutron like compact stars in three distinct types each one having different internal
structures. We hope that TRV model for compact neutron like stars will be useful
for the study of superdense self-bound stars having exotic matter compositions.
