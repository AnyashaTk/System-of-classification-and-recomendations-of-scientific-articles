ABSTRACT
We present panchromatic resolved stellar photometry for 22 million stars in the Local Group dwarf
"spiral Triangulum (M33), derived from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations with the Advanced"
"Camera for Surveys (ACS) in the optical (F475W, F814W), and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)"
"in the near ultraviolet (F275W, F336W) and near-infrared (F110W, F160W) bands. The large, con-"
"tiguous survey area covers ∼14 square kpc and extends to 3.5 kpc (14 arcmin, or 1.5–2 scale lengths)
from the center of M33. The PHATTER observing strategy and photometry technique closely mimics"
"that of Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT), but with updated photometry techniques"
that take full advantage of all overlapping pointings (aligned to within <5-10 milliarcseconds) and
improved treatment of spatially varying PSFs. The photometry reaches a completeness-limited depth
"of F475W∼28.5 in the lowest surface density regions observed in M33 and F475W∼26.5 in the most
crowded regions found near the center of M33. We find the young populations trace several relatively"
"tight arms, while the old populations show a clear, looser two-armed structure. We present extensive"
"analysis of the data quality including artificial star tests to quantify completeness, photometric un-"
"certainties, and flux biases. This stellar catalog is the largest ever produced for M33, and is publicly"
available for download by the community.

1. INTRODUCTION
Resolved stellar photometry has the potential to con-
"strain fundamental processes in astrophysics, including"
"star formation, stellar evolution, feedback into the in-"
"terstellar medium, galaxy formation and evolution, and"
chemical enrichment. The stars themselves are the fos-
"sil record of these processes, which leave signatures in"
"the properties of individual stars, their mass distribu-"
"tion, their distribution of colors and magnitudes, and"
their spatial distribution with respect to other galactic
tracers.
While Gaia is transforming our understanding of the
stars and structure of the Milky Way disk (Gaia Collab-
"oration et al. 2018), we still need comparably detailed"
population studies of other disks to put our Galaxy and
its stellar populations in context. The best targets for

"such studies are the galaxies in the Local Group, which"
"contains two spirals other than the Milky Way — M31,"
"a “green valley” Sb galaxy, and M33, a blue sequence,"
"star-forming dwarf spiral. Along with the Milky Way,"
these two galaxies form our best anchors for baryonic
processes in spiral galaxies. This set of three galaxies
"spans a large dynamic range, giving ample opportunities"
for contrasting how astrophysical processes are shaped
"by other parameters. For example, both M31 and the"
Galaxy are of similar mass and metallicity (Watkins
"et al. 2010; Gregersen et al. 2015), but M31 seems to"
"have a much more dramatic recent merger history (e.g.,"
Hammer et al. 2018; D’Souza & Bell 2018; Kruijssen
et al. 2019).
"In contrast to both of these more massive partners,"
"M33 is of lower mass and metallicity, and appears to"
"have a relatively quiescent merger history, as suggested"
by its inside-out growth (Magrini et al. 2007; Williams
et al. 2009; Beasley et al. 2015; Mostoghiu et al. 2018)
and lack of a significant extended stellar halo (Mc-
Connachie et al. 2010; McMonigal et al. 2016) or promi-
nent thick disk (Wyse 2002; van der Kruit & Freeman
"2011). Thus, M33 probes a different set of physical"
and chemical evolution properties than the other Lo-
"cal Group disk galaxies, and we can constrain these"
in exquisite detail through measurements of M33’s con-
stituent stars.
"Along with M31, previously surveyed with HST as"
part of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury
"(PHAT, Dalcanton et al. 2012), M33 is one of the richest"
galaxies in the Local Group for obtaining photometric
measurements of resolved stars in a spiral galaxy. It is
close enough that we can resolve stars all the way down
to the ancient main sequence (Williams et al. 2009) over
much of the disk. All of its stars are at the same distance
"and foreground extinction, alleviating issues related to"
the wide range of distances and extinctions of stars in
"the Galaxy. Furthermore, M33 has no well-established"
significant bulge component beyond its nuclear cluster
"(McLean & Liu 1996; Kormendy & McClure 1993), and"
at most a weak pseudobulge or bar (Regan & Vogel 1994;
Minniti et al. 1993; Stephens & Frogel 2002; Corbelli &
"Walterbos 2007), meaning that there is little confusion"
between disk and bulge populations.
"The metallicity gradient in M33 is well known, and"
has been measured many times with planetary nebulae
"and HII regions (e.g., Cioni et al. 2008; Rosolowsky &"
"Simon 2008; Magrini et al. 2009, 2010; Bresolin et al."
2010; Toribio San Cipriano et al. 2016; Lin et al. 2017).
These studies have provided a range of measured central
metallicities of 8.4 < 12 + log(O/H) < 8.8 and a range
of slopes of −0.05 < dex/kpc < −0.02. Our representa-
tion in the right panel of Figure 1 is approximate and
"extrapolated based on these measurements, and shows"
how M33 covers the gap in metallicity between the LMC
and M31.
The star formation rate (SFR) density of M33 is sig-
"nificantly higher than in M31, making it an excellent"
probe of higher intensity star formation environments.
The total SFR from the GALEX far-UV (FUV) and
"Spitzer 24 µm observations is ∼0.5 M� yr−1 (e.g., Ver-
ley et al. 2009), which is higher than the rate in the"
"entire PHAT survey: ∼0.3 M� yr−1 in an area about
8 times larger (Lewis et al. 2015). These measurements"
are consistent with the order of magnitude relative dif-
ference in star formation intensity distributions shown
in Figure 1.
M33’s value for obtaining knowledge about disk stellar
populations is reflected in its rich history of resolved star
"studies, dating back to the 19th century (e.g, Roberts"
"1899). Since then, ground-based observations have stud-"
"ied the bright massive stars in great detail, providing"
estimates of star formation rate and constraints on the
"evolution of massive stars (e.g., Madore et al. 1974;"
"Humphreys & Sandage 1980; Massey et al. 1996, and"
many others). The bright stars that can be resolved
from the ground were finally fully cataloged by Massey
"et al. (2006), and its extended halo was probed by the"
Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS; Mc-
Connachie et al. 2010). More recent ground-based work
focuses on the variability of these massive stars to fur-
"ther constrain their complex evolutionary stages (e.g.,"
Gordon et al. 2016; Humphreys et al. 2017; Smith et al.
"2020, and many others)."
"Over the past few decades, past ground-based stud-"
"ies of M33 have been supplemented with HST imaging,"
"both farther into the ultraviolet (e.g., Chandar et al."
1999; Hoopes & Walterbos 2000) and to much fainter
"depth in the optical (e.g., Mighell & Rich 1995; Saraje-"
"dini et al. 2000; Barker et al. 2007a,b; Williams et al."
2009). These capabilities have provided deep insight
into the properties of the youngest and oldest stars and
"stellar clusters, as well as the formation processes of the"
"M33 disk (e.g., van der Kruit & Freeman 2011, and ref-"
erences therein).
M33’s stellar population studies benefit from the
legacy of surveys across virtually all wavelengths.
Its cold interstellar medium (ISM) has been mapped
through 21cm maps of atomic Hi (Deul & van der Hulst
"1987; Gratier et al. 2010; Koch et al. 2018), through mil-"
"limeter maps of molecular gas in the CO(J = 1−0) and
CO(J = 2−1) lines (Figure 2, see e.g., Heyer et al. 2004;
Gratier et al. 2010; Engargiola et al. 2003; Rosolowsky"
"et al. 2003, 2007; Druard et al. 2014), and through"
extensive studies of dust through Spitzer (Hinz et al.
"2004; McQuinn et al. 2007), Herschel (most notably the"
"HerM33es project; e.g., Kramer et al. 2010; Xilouris"
"et al. 2012), and long-wavelength facilities like APEX"
"and Planck (e.g., Hermelo et al. 2016; De Paolis et al."
2016; Tibbs et al. 2018). M33 has been mapped with
GALEX near and far UV (Thilker et al. 2005) in hard
"X-rays from NuSTAR (West et al. 2018), softer X-rays"
from Chandra (Tüllmann et al. 2011) and XMM-Newton
"(Williams et al. 2015), gamma rays from Fermi (Xi et al."
"2020), and deep radio continuum White et al. (2019)."
"This rich compendium of multi-wavelength data, and"
"its associated catalogs, can serve both to support inter-"
"preting M33’s resolved HST photometry, and to be in-"
terpreted in turn by improved knowledge of M33’s stellar
content and spatially resolved star formation history.
"Recently, the power of wide-area, panchromatic imag-"
ing of nearby galaxies has been demonstrated by PHAT
"(Dalcanton et al. 2012; Williams et al. 2014), which cov-"
ered roughly one third of the star forming disk of M31
in 6-bands ranging from the near-UV to the near-IR.
The PHAT survey has produced scientific return span-
"ning a wide range of topics, from star clusters (John-"
son et al. 2015) and the initial mass function (IMF)
(Weisz et al. 2015) to star formation history (Lewis et al.
"2015; Williams et al. 2017), calibration of star forma-"
"tion rate indicators (Lewis et al. 2017), metal retention"
"(Telford et al. 2019), mass-to-light ratios (Telford et al."
"2020), and dust (Dalcanton et al. 2015). We expect sim-"
ilar scientific return from studies of M33 based on the
Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury: Triangu-
lum Extended Region (PHATTER).
In this paper we present first results from an equiva-
"lent high-resolution, 6-band survey of M33, so that we"
may provide a resolved stellar photometry catalog with
"the same quality, giving the community the ability to"
probe the same processes in a galaxy with very dif-
"ferent physical properties, including lower mass, lower"
"metallicity, and higher star formation intensity. Once"
the stellar populations of both galaxies are measured
"in such exquisite detail, the power of direct comparison"
will likely lead to even more illuminating results. While
this paper mainly presents the photometric catalogs and
"demonstrates the quality of the measurements, we an-"
ticipate a number of future dedicated papers on M33’s
stellar populations and their connection to their host.
"Herein we describe our large HST survey of M33,"
PHATTER. Section 2 describes our observing strategy
and data reduction techniques. Section 3 provides our
"results, including our final catalog of 6-band panchro-"
matic photometry of all of the stars detected in our ob-
servations. Section 4 then investigates the quality of
"the photometry in the catalog, including analysis of the"
"luminosity function and artificial star tests. Finally, Sec-"
"tion 5 summarizes the paper. Throughout, we assume"
"a distance to M33 of 859 kpc (m−M = 24.67; de Grijs
et al. 2017)."
2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS
2.1. Observing Strategy
The highest impact science we anticipate from the new
M33 observations comes from exploring galactic environ-
ments that are distinct from other Local Group galax-
ies. Our observing strategy was therefore designed to
"make comparisons as straightforward as possible, by re-"
"producing the observing strategy for M31, but targeting"
regions of M33 with complementary properties.
"As shown in Figure 1, M33 is a lower metallicity"
"galaxy than most of M31 at the present day, and its"
inner regions nicely bridge the metallicity gap between
the LMC and M31’s outer regions (similar gradient to
"e.g., Cioni et al. 2008; Rosolowsky & Simon 2008; Ma-"
"grini et al. 2009, 2010; Bresolin et al. 2010; Toribio San"
Cipriano et al. 2016; Lin et al. 2017). Those same
inner regions of M33 also have a typical star forma-
tion rate intensity that is nearly a factor of 10 higher
"than in the area covered by the PHAT survey in M31,"
adding considerable leverage to studies of the interac-
tion between stars and the ISM. We therefore targeted
"the new M33 observations on these inner regions, where"
there is also considerable multiwavelength coverage from
"other observatories, covering, for example, nearly all of"
"the CO(J = 1 − 0) molecular cloud detections from
Rosolowsky et al. (2007), as shown in Figure 2."
We build up this survey area using the same
"PHAT tiling strategy, as described in Dalcanton et al."
(2012). Observations are organized into “bricks”
"of 3×6 WFC3/IR footprints (Figure 3), with ob-
servations of each 3×3 half-brick taken ∼6 months
apart, after the telescope has rotated 180◦ (see Fig-
ure 3), with ORIENT=55 for one half brick and 235"
"for the other. At each pointing, WFC3/UVIS ob-"
"servations (F275W250−300nm and F336W310−360nm fil-
ters) are taken in one orbit and WFC3/IR observations"
"(F110W900−1400nm and F160W1400−1700nm filters) are
taken in another, while ACS/WFC operates in parallel"
"observing in F475W400−550nm and F814W700−950nm cov-
ering the adjacent half brick. When the telescope rotates"
"orientations in ∼6 months, the primary WFC3 observa-
tions cover the area of the original ACS parallels, and"
vice versa. Note that this produces a time difference be-
"tween the optical and UV+IR observations, which may"
produce unusual colors for time-varying sources. Ob-
servations for this program (GO-14610) were taken be-
"tween February 21, 2017, and February 25, 2018. The"
downloaded calibrated images used for photometry were
processed under OPUS versions 2016 2 - 2017 3b. For
"ACS/WFC and WFC3/UVIS, we start with the CTE-"
corrected (Anderson & Bedin 2010; Anderson & Ryon
"2018), flc image files. For WFC3/IR, we start with flt"
image files.
We chose a 3-brick mosaic to maximize coverage of
the high star-formation intensity regions and existing
"CO detections (Figure 3). Brick 1 is the 3×6 array cov-
ering the northern portion of the galaxy, Brick 2 covers"
"the center, and Brick 3 is to the south. Within each"
"Brick, each WFC3/IR pointing area is given a field num-"
"ber, with Field 1 being the upper left on Figure 3 and"
Field 18 being the lower right. ACS observations are
labeled with the WFC3 field that they overlap. Of the
"54 pointings, one field (Brick 2, Field 5) had no guide"
"stars available in the desired orientation, and was there-"
fore rotated slightly to make observations possible. This
"change led to a slight (∼20 arcsec) gap in coverage at
the northwest corner of Brick 2 (01:33:30, 30:44:00). In"
"total, the survey area tiled the inner 13.2×19.8 arcmin
(3.1×4.6 kpc, projected; 4.3×4.6 kpc, deprojected) of
M33, extending to roughly ∼1.6 disk scale lengths, as-
suming a 6′ scale length (Regan & Vogel 1994)."
We adopted an identical exposure sequence (Table 1)
"and dithering strategy as in PHAT, with the only sig-"
nificant change being switching to using UV pre-flash
to minimize CTE losses in WFC3/UVIS (FLASH= 10
for F336W and = 11 for F275W). WFC3/IR exposures
were taken with 13 MULTIACCUM non-destructive read
samples of the STEP100 sequence for a single F110W
"exposure, three F160W exposures with 9 samples of the"
"STEP200 sequence, and one additional F160W exposure"
with 10 samples of the STEP100 sequence. The adopted
dithers are designed to produce Nyquist sampled images
"in F475W, F814W, and F160W, but do not fill in the"
"ACS chip gap. Instead, the ACS chip gaps are filled"
by overlapping exposures from observations in adjacent
fields. The two WFC3/UVIS exposures for each filter
"are dithered to fill the chip gap, but, have challenging"
"cosmic ray rejection, due to having only 1-2 overlapping"
images. The ACS observations also include very short
“guard” exposures in F475W (10 seconds) and F814W
(15 seconds) to capture photometry for the brightest
"stars, which can be saturated in the longer individual"
exposures. A table of the exposures at each position is
supplied in Table 1.
The resulting map of exposure times in all cameras
is shown in Figure 4. Notable features are the slightly
"larger WFC3/UVIS fields of view, which lead to large"
rectangular overlaps between adjacent fields than the
"minimally overlapping WFC3/IR fields, and the diago-"
nal overlaps of the even larger ACS/WFC exposures.
Some of the inconsistencies in the tiling pattern are
due to adjustments that ensured coverage with the non-
"standard Brick 1, Field 5 rotation. The most highly"
overlapped regions in F475W and F814W have over
"30,000 seconds of total exposure time. However, be-"
cause the majority of observations in the optical and IR
"are crowding-limited, rather than photon limited, the"
varying exposure times due to the overlapping pointings
tend to affect the measured source density in less obvious
ways that are often only noticeable at faint magnitudes.
2.2. Photometry
We measured point spread function (PSF) fitting pho-
tometry on the location of every star detected in our sur-
vey footprint on every exposure that covered the posi-
tion of the star. We closely followed the process used for
the PHAT survey photometry to simplify comparisons;
"however, there have been some improvements made to"
the process from lessons learned by PHAT.
The first improvement was the use of charge trans-
fer efficiency (CTE) corrected flc-type) for photome-
"try. In PHAT, no correction was used for WFC3/UVIS"
"photometry, and ACS/WFC photometry was corrected"
at the catalog level. This change was implemented to
address systematic uncertainties that appeared to be re-
lated to CTE in Williams et al. (2014) at the faint end.
"In addition, we implemented spatially-varying TinyTim"
PSFs (Krist et al. 2011) for all cameras to address the
systematic uncertainties that appeared to be related to
the PSF in Williams et al. (2014). All of these changes
"affect the photometry at the . 0.1 mag level, but may
help to mitigate systematics related to position on the"
detector.
A high-level overview of the process of measuring the
stellar photometry is provided as follows. The first step
was the astrometric alignment of all 972 individual ex-
posures with the Gaia catalog. These images were then
"combined into mosaic images, which were used for iden-"
tifying and flagging bad pixels and cosmic ray affected
"pixels for masking during photometry, as well as for pub-"
lic release images1. The aligned individual images were
processed with the DOLPHOT software package (Dol-
"phin 2000, 2016) to measure PSF corrections and aper-"
"ture corrections, which largely correct for variations in"
telescope focus. All overlapping individual exposures
were stacked in memory to search for all statistically-
significant detections using the full survey depth. At
1 https://hubblesite.org/image/4305/gallery
https://hubblesite.org/image/4305/gallery
"each detected centroid, the appropriate PSF was fit to"
the detection’s locations in each of the overlapping ex-
"posures, for all filters simultaneously. DOLPHOT then"
reported the measured fluxes and corresponding magni-
"tudes in each image, as well as the combined flux and"
"magnitude in each observed band. Finally, the raw pho-"
tometry output was processed to flag possible artifacts
and generate summary catalogs containing a subset of
the many thousands of columns required to describe the
complete measurement suite.
We describe each of these steps in detail below.
2.2.1. Astrometric Alignment & Mosaicking
"We aligned all flc (ACS/WFC, WFC3/UVIS) and"
flt (WFC3/IR) images to the Gaia DR2 astromet-
ric solution following the workflow presented by Bajaj
"(2017)2. Using this workflow, a reference astromet-"
ric catalog was retrieved from the Gaia archive with
"astroquery (Ginsburg et al. 2017, 2019), which was"
then passed to the TweakReg function in the Drizzlepac
package (STSCI Development Team 2012; Hack et al.
"2013; Avila et al. 2015), which finds centroids in each"
image and matches triangular patterns and updates the
image headers with the resulting aligned astrometric so-
lution. The catalogs from which the final alignment
solution was derived typically contained several hun-
"dred stars per ACS/WFC pointing, and 50-200 stars"
per WFC3/UVIS or WFC3/IR pointing.
The RMS dispersions of the alignment residuals in X
and Y are shown for all frames in Figure 5. Typical
overall residual dispersions are on the order of 3 mas for
"ACS/WFC and WFC3/UVIS, and 7 mas for WFC3/IR."
We used the AstroDrizzle function of the
Drizzlepac package (STSCI Development Team
2012; Hack et al. 2013; Avila et al. 2015) to combine
"the images within each band into a distortion-corrected,"
"high-resolution pixel array (0.035′′/pixel in all bands,
combined with a lanczos3 kernel). This higher res-"
olution array allows the full camera resolution to be
"recovered from dithered images, which were Nyquist"
"sampled in F475W, F814W, and F160W. A minmed"
filter flagged statistical outlier pixels on the input
"exposures for all filters except F110W, for which"
"there is only a single exposure, forcing us to rely on"
up-the-ramp fitting to flag bad pixels and filter cosmic
rays. These pixels were not considered when generating
"the combined image, and they can easily be masked"
in any further analysis using those exposures. The
"flagged images were then combined with astrodrizzle,"
weighted by exposure time to produce deep mosaics
2 https://github.com/spacetelescope/gaia alignment
that take advantage of sub-pixel dithering to improve
spatial resolution.
An example of the improvements in depth and res-
olution is shown in Figure 6. The final product from
"the F475W exposures, which is the deepest band with"
"the most sub-pixel dithers, was then applied as the as-"
trometric reference image for all of the photometry mea-
"surements, including the positions of centroids measured"
in other bands but not detected in the F475W data.
2.2.2. Preparing Individual Exposures
After updating data quality extensions of the indi-
"vidual exposures in the astrodrizzle step, we further"
prepared the individual exposures for photometry with
DOLPHOT. This preparation starts with running the
task acsmask or wfc3mask (depending on camera) on
each exposure. This task masks the flagged pixels in
the DQ extensions of each CCD in each exposure and
multiplies the image by the appropriate pixel area map
to take into account the effects of distortion on the flux
measured in each pixel. We also run this step on the
"full-depth F475W combined image, which serves as the"
astrometric reference image for the final photometry.
DOLPHOT uses this image as theastrometric reference
frame to which all of the individual exposures will be
"aligned in memory, and from which all of the final star"
"positions will be reported. As such, it is beneficial to"
use the deepest and highest spatial resolution image for
this purpose.
We then ran the splitgroups task to produce sepa-
"rate files for each CCD of each exposure, and then we"
ran calcsky on each of these individual frames to gen-
erate maps of the sky level in each exposure. These sky
"files, which are simple smoothed versions of the original"
"images, are used by DOLPHOT to find an initial list of"
statistically significant centroids to align each frame to
"the astrometric reference image; in spite of their name,"
they are not actually used for measuring the true sky
"level, which instead is measured in a much more sophis-"
ticated way described in Section 2.2.3. We then ran
"DOLPHOT on each individual exposure, to measure the"
"central PSF and aperture corrections of each CCD read,"
followed by running DOLPHOT’s alignment on the full
stack of CCD reads to determine and record the param-
eters that align each individual frame to the astrometric
reference image.
2.2.3. Running DOLPHOT on Full Image Stacks
"With images, alignment parameters, PSF corrections,"
and aperture corrections for each individual exposure in
"hand, we could run full-stack photometry on any region"
of the survey. We ran these stacks using the DOLPHOT
parameters updated from those of the PHAT survey to
https://github.com/spacetelescope/gaia_alignment
optimize the resulting catalogs for stellar populations
science. The main updates are the removal of catalog-
"level CTE corrections, because we used the on-image"
"CTE corrections (flc images), and the use of TinyTim"
PSFs for all cameras and filters. Values of all of the
adopted DOLPHOT parameters for our reductions are
provided in Table 2.
Memory and time limitations prevent us from simply
putting the entire set of M33 exposures into DOLPHOT
"simultaneously. Instead, we subdivided the data into"
separate stacks to measure the photometry of different
regions of the survey in parallel. We used DOLPHOT
parameters that allow the user to define the region
within which it performs photometry to launch multiple
"photometry processes, each with a different region of the"
survey including all overlapping individual images. We
made these regions sufficiently small that DOLPHOT
could complete the PSF fitting photometry in a reason-
"able amount of clock time, typically about one week. We"
"set up 54 separate processes, each covering ∼4 square ar-
cminutes of the survey area, overlapping by 100 pixels"
on a side to avoid introducing edge effects. We then
merged the resulting catalogs along the centers of the
regions’ overlaps to produce one final catalog for the
survey. We then checked for any edge effects from the
survey division by plotting the densities of stars. Such a
"plot is shown in Figure 7, which shows our measurement"
of completeness- and reddening-independent stellar den-
sity using the bright end of the red giant branch in our
reddest band (number of stars with 19.7<F160W<20.7
per square arcsec). While this is our adopted standard
"for measuring stellar density, such maps made without"
such strict magnitude limits also show no edge effects
related to our division used for processing.
2.2.4. Flagging and Processing Photometry Output
DOLPHOT returns a comprehensive table of all of the
"measurements made on every PSF fit to every image, as"
well as the combined measurement of every source in
"every filter. These measurements include the flux, Vega"
"system magnitude, count-based uncertainty, signal-to-"
"noise ratio, and several measurements of how well the"
source was fitted by the PSF. These quality metrics in-
"clude sharpness, roundness, χ, and crowding. Full de-"
scriptions of these are included in the DOLPHOT docu-
"mentation3. Briefly, the sharpness parameter measures"
"how centrally peaked the source is compared to the PSF,"
or how much flux is concentrated in its central pixels rel-
ative to the outer ones. High values signify a source with
"high central concentration, such as a hot pixel or cosmic"
3 http://americano.dolphinsim.com/dolphot/
ray. Low values indicate that the source is not peaked
"enough, as expected for blended stars or background"
galaxies. The roundness parameter measures how cir-
"cular the source is (zero is perfectly round), and χ pro-"
vides an estimate of the overall goodness of fit to the
PSF. The crowding parameter measures how much the
source’s photometry is affected by neighboring sources.
"The larger the crowding value, the more densely packed"
"the PSF radius is with other sources, and the more likely"
it is that the reported magnitude has systematic uncer-
tainties due to subtraction of neighbors.
"For the PHAT survey, we determined values for the"
DOLPHOT parameters that tend to indicate good mea-
surements of real stars (Williams et al. 2014). We have
"adopted these criteria for this catalog as well, and list"
them here for convenience. For a complete description
"of how they were determined, see Williams et al. (2014)."
"They are different for each camera, as the pixel scale"
"and PSF sampling were different, with the exception of"
"the signal-to-noise ratio, for which we require S/N > 4"
"for all cameras. For ACS, the other parameters are:"
"sharpness2 < 0.2 and crowding < 2.25. For UVIS,"
"they are: sharpness2 < 0.15; crowding < 1.3, and"
for WFC3’s IR channel they are sharpness2 < 0.15;
crowding < 2.25. These culling parameters were found
to have the best balance of removing a high fraction
of sources outside of color-magnitude diagram (CMD)
features while keeping a very high fraction of total mea-
"surements. Thus, they lean towards inclusive to avoid"
"over-culling the data, at the expense of allowing a larger"
fraction of less certain measurements and contaminants.
We show the results of the above cuts on the CMD
"in Figure 8, where the stars that pass the metric"
"make a CMD with well-defined, well-populated features,"
whereas the rejected stars form a relatively featureless
"cloud of points. However, there is always some risk in"
excluding important individual detections that did not
"produce high-quality PSF fits, such as bright stars in"
"clusters. Thus, we include in our catalog all measure-"
"ments, but we add a flag column to each band indicating"
whether it passes. This method allows the user to search
"the full catalog for specific source, but also allows one to"
easily look at populations without being distracted by
artefacts. For science cases that require a very clean
"sample, we recommend going to the full catalog and"
applying more conservative culling criteria than those
adopted for our quality columns reported here.
The CMDs in all bands for the stars that pass our
GST quality checks are shown in Figures 9-13. These
"figures also show, in the upper panels, the fraction of"
accepted measurements over the same CMD space.
http://americano.dolphinsim.com/dolphot/
"In general, the highest impact of any metric on the"
"culling of the data is the signal-to-noise ratio, which"
culls 100% of the the measurements fainter than the
"detection limit in each band. However, in the IR, the"
quality metrics greatly reduce the amount of scatter in
"the CMD features at the faint end, as demonstrated by"
the low fraction of passing measurements up to 2 mag-
nitudes brighter than the detection limit in F160W in
the crowded central regions. This difference is mainly
"attributable to the lower spatial resolution in the IR,"
"which increases the impact of crowding, making more"
unreliable measurements that fall outside of the main
features of the CMD.
We also show the effects of the depth in each band
on our recovery of different features in Figure 14. Here
a representative subsample of stars is plotted on CMDs
color-coded by the number of bands in which they were
detected. It is clear from this figure that the UV obser-
"vations are our shallowest, as nearly every UV detection"
"is also detected in all of the other bands, and no RGB"
"stars are detected in the UV. On the other hand, nearly"
"every star in the catalog is detected in the optical, and"
all but the faintest main-sequence stars are detected in
the IR. It is important to keep these depth effects in
mind when working with the catalogs to perform anal-
ysis on the populations present in M33.
2.3. Artificial Star Tests
"We quantify the accuracy, precision, and completeness"
"of our photometry through artificial star tests (ASTs),"
wherein artificial stars with known parameters are in-
jected into the data and then recovered (if possible).
ASTs place stars with realistic spectral energy distribu-
tions (SED) at a fixed sky position in each overlapping
input image. We then put those images through the
"same photometry routine as the original data, and com-"
pare the output measurements for the star to the input
values. If the star is not recovered by the photometry
"routine, that is also recorded. We repeat this process"
many thousands of times in many locations in the survey
to characterize the quality of our photometry catalogs
"as a function of survey stellar density, where density is"
the number of stars with 19.7<F160W<20.7 per square
"arcsec, which is also a proxy of galactocentric distance,"
as the stellar density falls off smoothly with radius. We
describe each step in detail below.
We generated input artificial star magnitudes with
MATCH (Dolphin 2002) using the fake utility to pro-
duce a simulated 6-band photometric catalog sampled
from the MIST model suite (Choi et al. 2016). We used
"two age bins, 1 Myr to 1 Gyr and 8 to 16 Gyr, and a"
"metallicity range of −2 < [Fe/H] < 0.5, which together"
span sufficient color space to be applicable to the ma-
jority of our photometry. We restricted the optical mag-
"nitudes to 15 < F475W < 31 and 17 < F814W < 30,"
but left the UV and IR magnitudes effectively uncon-
"strained. To ensure sufficient sampling of bright stars,"
we used a top-heavy IMF. CMDs of the final AST in-
puts are shown in Figure 15. For the purposes of as-
"sessing our photometric quality for each band, we per-"
formed tests that covered at least one magnitude beyond
the full range of magnitudes passing our quality cuts in
"each band, but we did not cover the full range of de-"
tected colors. Full statistical modeling of the color dis-
tributions and stellar spectral energy distributions will
"require more comprehensive ASTs, but these are suffi-"
cient for determining the completeness and precision as
a function of magnitude in each of our observed bands.
"The results of these tests are supplied in Table 6, and"
described below.
We select four regions roughly along the major axis
"that span the full range of stellar densities, as shown in"
the right panel of Figure 7. For each region we create
"input lists of 50,000 artificial stars with random XY lo-"
"cations, for a total of 200,000 ASTs. We run the stars"
from the input AST lists through our photometry rou-
"tine one at a time, such that the ASTs were not able to"
affect one another. DOLPHOT’s output in AST mode
"includes the location and flux of each input star, fol-"
lowed by all of the output that is reported for all of the
unaltered data. Quality metrics that were used to flag
measurements in the star catalog can then be applied to
the AST catalog for consistency.
While Table 6 reports all of the output measured mag-
"nitudes, for our quality analysis, we consider an artificial"
star to be “recovered” in a given band if it is within 2
"reference frame pixels (0.07′′) of the input source po-
sition and 1 magnitude of the input magnitude, and"
fulfills the GST (“good star”) quality requirements for
said band discussed in Section 2.2.4. Figure 16 and Ta-
ble 3 provide the completeness as a function of magni-
tude as well as the magnitude m50 at which 50% of in-
serted artificial stars are recovered (the “50% complete-
"ness limit”). For typical astronomical point sources, this"
completeness limit is largely set by the number of pho-
"tons detected from an astronomical source. However, at"
"high stellar densities, the completeness limit is set by"
the magnitude at which the surface density of sources
"(i.e., # of sources per square arcsec) is so high that"
"they are always blended with brighter sources, render-"
ing the original source undetectable. In this “crowding
"limited” (rather than “photon limited”) regime, the lim-"
iting magnitude is set more by stellar density than by
photon counting statistics.
"In both M31 and M33, HST imaging is crowding lim-"
"ited in the optical and NIR over much of the disk, with"
the effects being most significant in the NIR where the
larger pixel scale and PSF size severely limit detec-
tion and reliable measurement of faint stars. In con-
"trast, the PHAT and PHATTER observations in the UV"
bands are sufficiently shallow that they do not reach
magnitudes where UV-detectable stars are so numer-
"ous that they begin to crowd together. For M33, the"
"UV observations reach F275W∼24.5 relatively indepen-
dent of stellar density (or galactocentric distance), as ex-"
"pected for photon-limited images, whereas for the opti-"
"cal, the depth changes by ∼1.3 magnitudes moving from
the inner to outer disk, reflecting the role that stellar"
crowding plays in setting the detection limit. In addi-
"tion, the variation in completeness with magnitude (Fig-"
ure 17) is qualitatively different in the photon-limited
"and crowding-limited data. In the former, the complete-"
ness drops from near 100% to 0% over a narrow range in
"magnitude (.1) , whereas in the crowding-limited data,
the roll-off in completeness is much more gradual with"
"magnitude (&2), such that stars begin to be “hidden”
by crowding several magnitudes before the magnitude at"
which they disappear from the catalog. The slow roll-off
in completeness is the result (in part) of increasing odds
that a star will fail the quality cuts with the increasing
likelihood of it blending with a star of comparable flux.
"As with completeness, photometric uncertainties re-"
flect impacts from both photon-counting uncertainties
and crowding. There are multiple contributors to pho-
tometric uncertainty and bias in crowded-field photom-
etry beyond the well-known impact of photon-counting
statistics for the source and sky. These effects include
uncertainties and biases from deblending of neighbors
"and sky estimation, as well as brightward biases from"
blending with undetected sources (which also increases
the chance of detection). These effects are captured well
"by artificial star tests, though other systematic effects"
due to CTE or imperfect PSF models will remain. These
"various drivers of uncertainty and bias — crowding, ex-"
"posure time, and background — all vary among filters"
"and cameras, and thus will have different behavior in"
We summarize the AST results for uncertainties and
bias in Figure 18 and Table 4. Figure 18 shows the
median difference in magnitude between the recovered
and input magnitudes (recovered - input) as a func-
"tion of input magnitude, and the 16th and 84th per-"
"centile ranges for the distribution of differences, shown"
"as solid and transparent lines, respectively, plotted for a"
"range of mean local densities (different color lines, with"
"darker, thinner lines indicating higher stellar densities)."
Positive values indicate sources that are recovered at
fainter magnitudes than their true magnitudes. Table 4
compiles numerical measurements of the bias and un-
certainty for different filters and source densities. The
uncertainty is also reported in units of the DOLPHOT-
"reported photometric uncertainty, which is based en-"
tirely on photon-counting uncertainties. The measured
scatter between the true and recovered magnitudes is
"typically ∼20% larger than the photon-counting uncer-
tainty in the NUV, a factor of ∼4 larger in the optical,
and a factor of ∼5 larger in the NIR."
"Figure 18 shows that, as expected, both the bias"
and and the measurement uncertainty increase towards
"fainter magnitudes, where photon counting and crowd-"
ing is worse. The biases are much smaller than the pho-
tometric uncertainties (typically by a factor of 2-4) at
"all but the very faintest limits, where very few sources"
would be recovered at all. At a fixed magnitude in the
"optical or NIR bands, the biases and uncertainties are"
"larger in regions with higher source densities, due to"
"the higher crowding. In the optical and NIR bands,"
"as sources become intrinsically fainter, their measured"
"fluxes tend to be biased towards brighter magnitudes,"
"due to unresolved, overlapping sources boosting the in-"
serted artificial star above the detection limit. These ef-
"fects are somewhat more pronounced in the NIR, most"
likely due to the camera’s larger pixels and longer wave-
lengths producing lower resolution images (see Figure 6)
and thus larger impacts due to crowding. No corrections
for these biases have been made to the catalog.
"In the UV, the trend of increasing bias and uncer-"
tainty for fainter sources is similar to what is seen in the
"optical and the NIR. However, the variations with UV"
magnitude are largely independent of local source den-
"sity, reflecting the lack of significant crowding except at"
the very highest density in F336W. Another notable dif-
ference is in the sign of the bias. Well before complete-
"ness begins to decline significantly, the bias begins to"
"become substantial, but has the opposite sign as seen in"
"the optical and NIR, such that measurements seem to be"
biased significantly faint. The effect appears most con-
"sistent with a slightly high background measurement,"
since the bias induced from high sky subtraction would
"be very small for bright sources, and increase for fainter"
"source, as we see in the NUV photometry. A similar"
"trend was seen in the W14 PHAT photometry study,"
and the speculation was that perhaps charge transfer
efficiency (CTE) effects were causing the sky brightness
"to be overestimated. However, in this work we have"
"used pre-flashed, CTE-corrected UVIS images, which"
should have reduced CTE effects on the sky brightness.
"Nonetheless, it is clear that our technique is likely at-"
tributing too much flux to sky in the NUV images. None
"of these biases have been corrected for in the catalog, al-"
though they can be accounted for using our ASTs.
3. RESULTS
Tables 5 and 6 provide samples of the photometry
catalog and AST results from the survey. The cata-
"log included here contains the positions, magnitudes,"
"signal-to-noise ratio, and data quality flag for each de-"
tected star. While this table contains all of the stars
"detected and measured by DOLPHOT, not all of those"
measurements are likely to be stars in M33 with reli-
able photometry. To simplify the use of this version of
"the catalog, we have supplied a flag column (GST) for"
"each band, which is set to “T” for sources that pass our"
"quality checks detailed in Section 2.2.4, and to “F” for"
"sources that do not. If a source has a T in any band,"
"it is likely to be a real star in M33. However, it still"
"may have “F” flags in other bands, which indicates that"
the star was not reliably measured in that band. Only
sources with “F” values in all bands are unlikely to be
stars in M33.
"Many of the stars in our catalog, as for a large fraction"
"of stars, are likely to be binary systems (e.g., Niu et al."
"2020). At the distance of M33, we are not able to resolve"
"binary stars, so that our photometry contains the light"
"of both members. However, the impact of binary stars"
varies by phase of stellar evolution. Many of the stars
"in our catalog are red giants, which is a short-lived and"
very bright phase of stellar evolution in the life of a rela-
tively low-mass star. The binary companions of almost
all of these stars are not in their red giant phase and
are faint low mass stars contributing insignificantly to
"the measured flux. In contrast, the more massive stars"
that make up the bright main-sequence are more likely
"to have bright companions of similar mass (e.g., Kobul-"
nicky & Fryer 2007). The companions of these stars will
affect their photometry by contributing as much as half
of the measured flux and should be considered when
modeling photometry of upper main-sequence stars in
our catalog.
"The comprehensive, and much larger, catalog is avail-"
able as a high-level science product (HLSP) in the Mul-
timission archive via 10.17909/t9-ksyp-na40. This com-
prehensive catalog includes the combined measurements
"of each star in each band, as well as in each of the in-"
"dividual measurements in all of the survey exposures,"
along with all of the measurement quality information
"reported by DOLPHOT (uncertainty, χ, sharp, round,"
"crowd, error flag). This catalog includes thousands of"
"columns, and is hundreds of GB in size."
The simplified AST results (with limited columns) in
"Table 6 are the location, input magnitude, output mag-"
"nitude, output signal-to-noise, and output quality flag"
for each artificial star. The full catalog with all of the
columns includes the input counts into each individual
"exposure, as well as all of the output photometry mea-"
surement columns as for the detected stars in the survey.
"As such, the HLSP catalog again is much larger and con-"
tains thousands of columns for those who would make
use of the full AST input and output.
3.1. Color-magnitude Diagrams
In Figure 8 we plot the entire catalog of detections in
"the optical bands, and we label the strongest features."
"The left panel shows all of the measurements, and the"
right panel shows the measurements that do not pass our
quality metrics. The vast majority of these failed mea-
surements are located at the faint end where spurious
"and blended measurements are much more likely, while"
the few brighter ones are most likely contaminants and
artifacts. This overview CMD shows the high fidelity
"of the photometry, which produces well-populated and"
clearly defined features. The high-definition of these fea-
"tures, described below, all suggest that a very large frac-"
tion of our photometry is reliable.
"On the blue edge, the vertical plume of the upper-main"
sequence (MS) is narrow and confined to a sharp edge
determined by the saturation of color when the effec-
"tive temperature of stars reaches hotter than ∼104 K.
Slightly to the red of this, is a second, less populated"
blue plume that is the blue helium burning (BHeB) se-
quence. This sequence marks the bluest extremity of the
loop that characterizes the core-helium-burning phase
of stars of intermediate and high masses. Its continuous
appearance suggests that M33 has been forming stars at
a relatively high intensity for hundreds of Myr.
The next bright plume to the red (brighter than
"F814W∼20 and starting at F475W–F814W∼2) is the
red helium-burning (RHeB) sequence. This feature con-"
sists of massive stars in the initial stage of core-helium-
"burning, with convective envelopes, before the decrease"
in the central helium content that drives their move to-
wards the blue BHeB. It also contains the stars at the
"very latest phases of core-helium-burning, that move to"
the red again as their He-exhausted cores contract and
"extended convection sets in their envelopes. In theory,"
this RHeB sequences extends down in the CMD until
it merges with the red clump (RC) of low-mass core-
"helium-burning stars at F814W∼25. The width of the
color gap between the RHeB and the BHeB is sensitive"
"to the metallicity, as more metal rich stars will be redder"
during this phase.
https://doi.org/10.17909/t9-ksyp-na40
"These sequences (MS, BHeB, and RHeB) are all in-"
"dicative of recent star formation, and their numbers are"
consistent with the much higher star formation rate den-
"sity in M33 relative to M31. For example, our cata-"
"log has ∼30% more OB stars (F336W − F475W < 0,
MF475W < 0) than the entire PHAT catalog (∼300000,
vs. ∼230000 in PHAT), resulting in a factor of 10 larger
density of these young stars in M33 than in M31. Maps"
"of recent star formation history, similar to those for M31"
"(Lewis et al. 2015), are in preparation."
The cloud of stars redward of the RHeB consist of
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that have ex-
panded to be so large and cool that they become very
bright and very red. The brightest among these stars
can undergo extreme mass loss and develop dusty cir-
"cumstellar shells, making them extend to fainter and"
extremely red optical colors.
Below the AGB is the familiar red giant branch (RGB)
"of evolved shell-hydrogen burning low-mass stars, ex-"
"tending from F814W∼21 down through the AGB bump
and red clump (RC) to the subgiants at F814W∼26.
The AGB bump is comprised of early AGB (EAGB)"
"stars, which are low-mass stars that undergo a pause"
in evolution when forming their double-shell structure
(Gallart 1998). Below the AGB bump is the prominent
RC of stable core-helium burning low mass stars. In ad-
"dition, there is a small tail of stars departing from the"
"RC towards the top-left part of the CMD, which we ten-"
"tatively identify as blends of RC plus MS stars, either"
because they are crowded together or are real binaries.
Tails of reddened stars depart from the most prominent
"features, namely the RC and AGB bump, along the red-"
"dening vector, reflecting spreads in the internal extinc-"
tion that often exceed half a magnitude in the V band.
We compare our photometry to ground-based pho-
tometry of the same region from LGGS (Massey et al.
2006) and PAndAS (McConnachie et al. 2018) in Fig-
"ure 19. Compared to ground-based imaging, our catalog"
"extends 3 to 5 magnitudes deeper, has three orders of"
"magnitude more stars (22 million vs. ∼70,000 in both
LGGS and PAndAS), and has qualitatively more and"
tighter feature. This comparison clearly demonstrates
the improvement in available photometry and the power
of HST to resolve stars in the M33 disk.
3.2. Star Clusters
The PHATTER data are able to resolve individual
"stars within star clusters in M33, allowing detailed age"
and metallicity studies. We show a few examples of
"young stellar clusters of a range of masses in Figure 20,"
all of which were identified by citizen scientists as part
of the Local Group Cluster Search on Zooniverse (John-
son 2019; Wainer et al. 2020)4. The lower panels of this
"figure show zoomed-in F475W images of the clusters,"
and the upper panels show optical CMDs of the regions
"within the clusters’ radii. In all cases, the blue plume of"
"main-sequence stars is visible, showing the young popu-"
"lation of cluster stars. Moreover, the sequence on the"
"CMD is more populated in the more massive, larger"
"clusters, showing the quality of the resolved photome-"
try. While photometry in the clusters does not reach
"the faintest magnitudes of the survey due to crowding,"
it is clear that the PHATTER catalog will be a power-
ful tool for future studies of resolved populations in star
clusters in M33.
3.3. Population Maps
Because features on the CMD roughly correspond to
"distinct populations, we have generated maps of the stel-"
lar density within some of the most distinct CMD fea-
tures. Figure 21 shows the portions of the CMD used to
"select MS (young), AGB (intermediate age), and RGB"
(old) populations. Figure 22 shows the density maps of
"each of these populations. As might be expected, the"
young population is highly structured and largely traces
the spiral arms and the old population follows a smooth
"density gradient expected of a disk. Interestingly, the"
old and intermediate populations appear to show two
"faint arms, while the young population appears to trace"
out more. The structures suggest a long-lived two-
"armed density structure, along with other, more tran-"
"sient, short-lived arms."
The intermediate age population is not as simple to
"interpret on its own. However, in Figure 23 we show"
"a map of the ratio of AGB to RGB stars, along with"
a plot of the ratio as a function of distance from the
M33 center. There is a clear radial trend showing a
higher fraction of intermediate age stars farther out in
the disk. These maps thus confirm measurements in
"several previous works (e.g., Davidge 2003; Block et al."
2007; Verley et al. 2009) and are consistent with other
"indications of inside-out disk formation in M33 (e.g.,"
Magrini et al. 2007; Williams et al. 2009; Beasley et al.
"2015; Mostoghiu et al. 2018), demonstrating the poten-"
tial for our catalog for future detailed population studies
in M33. M33’s structure as seen by PHATTER will be
explored in detail in a future paper.
3.4. Luminosity Functions
While these initial qualitative evaluations of our pho-
"tometry are promising, we now move into quantitative"
"4 https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/lcjohnso/
local-group-cluster-search"
"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/lcjohnso/local-group-cluster-search
https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/lcjohnso/local-group-cluster-search"
tests of the fidelity and consistency of standard CMD
features to further assess the robustness and homogene-
ity of the catalog. Two features that are very well-suited
to such quality checks are the tip of the RGB (TRGB)
and the RC. By comparing the locations of these fea-
"tures in the luminosity function, as a function of posi-"
"tion in the survey, we can ensure that any variations are"
"smooth, and thus, most likely related to gradients in the"
"stellar population demographics (e.g., age and metallic-"
The left panel of Figure 24 shows the optical color-
magnitude selection regions for the TRGB and the RC
on a CMD of the entire survey. The upper right panel
"shows the F814W luminosity function, normalized by"
"the total number of stars sampled, for stars in the color"
range 2.5 <F475W–F814W< 3.5 at F814W = 20.7 and
"20.3<F814W<21.3 at several locations in the survey,"
which should be dominated by the metal-poor RGB that
"has a TRGB absolute magnitude of F814W∼ −4.05±0.1
(Beaton et al. 2018). We see that the function steepens"
"at the TRGB, and that the TRGB at this color remains"
"consistent to within ∼0.1 mag over the survey, showing
that the amount of systematic uncertainty over large"
"areas in our catalog is small. Furthermore, this TRGB"
magnitude is within the uncertainties of that expected
for a foreground AF814W of 0.063 (Schlafly & Finkbeiner
"2011) and a distance modulus of 24.67 ± 0.07 (de Grijs
et al. 2017), suggesting that our absolute photometric"
calibration is also accurate.
"In the lower right panel of Figure 24, we show"
the F814W luminosity function for stars in the
color range 1<F475W-F814W<2 at F814W=25 and
23.5<F814W<25.5 at several locations to check the po-
sition of the RC. This can be compared to M IRC =
"−0.22 ± 0.03 from Groenewegen (2008), which converts
to M IRC = 24.51 at the distance and extinction of M33."
The magnitude of the peak of the RC remains consistent
"to within 0.1 mag (24.51±0.10), confirming that even at
much fainter fluxes, the systematic uncertainties over"
large areas are small. There is a hint of a small bias
"to brighter magnitudes in some regions, as evidenced by"
the slightly brighter peak in some samples. Some bias
is expected given the results of the ASTs at this mag-
"nitude, as shown in Figure 18. However, some of the"
variation could also be an effect of the stellar popula-
tion gradient. A future detailed study of the feature
will be required to definitively determine the origin of
this variation.
3.5. Foreground and Background Contamination
Our catalog has a small amount of contamination from
Milky Way foreground stars and from background galax-
To estimate the severity of the foreground contamina-
"tion, we produced model Galactic populations using the"
Trilegal software package (Girardi et al. 2005). The
"model suggests ∼3400 foreground stars in our survey
footprint with F160W<26 with ∼2200 of these having
F475W<28. Thus, our catalog of 22 million stars con-"
tains only <0.02% foreground contamination. This frac-
tion increases to <0.1% for the 5 million stars that pass
"our cuts in at least 2 bands. However, in certain areas"
"of color-magnitude space, it is important to be able to"
identify foreground features so that they are not con-
"fused with M33 populations. To aid in this recognition,"
Figure 25 provides CMDs of the foreground model on
the same axes as our survey CMDs. These plots show
the locations of features associated with the foreground
populations. Mostly the foreground occupies the space
"between the BHeB and the RHeB, along with slightly"
contaminating the RGB and AGB.
The only highly visible foreground feature is the nar-
"row bright plume of stars at F110W − F160W = 0.7
that is the shared color of virtually all of the fore-"
"ground main sequence stars in the IR. Interestingly, M33"
has a well-populated RHeB feature that is vertical at
"F110W − F160W = 0.9. We have verified that the ma-
jority of stars in this feature are the same as those in the"
"bright feature at F475W − F160W ∼ 5, which has no
significant foreground equivalent. Thus, not only are the"
"RHeB stars separated from the foreground in IR color,"
the foreground contamination in our catalog appears to
be less than expected.
To estimate the severity of the background contam-
"ination, we looked for color outliers that were blue in"
F475W-F814W compared to their F814W-F160W col-
"ors, which is similar to the combination used for star-"
"galaxy separation in previous works, such as Robin et al."
(2007). We found outliers from the stellar locus fell at
"F475W − F814W < 2.5 and F814W − F160W > 3.
Only 7183 sources passing our quality criteria in the IR"
"bands have such colors, which corresponds to approx-"
imately 0.16% background contamination when taking
the IR quality flags into account. The contamination
"drops to 1073 sources, and 0.025%, for sources passing"
our quality criteria in the IR and optical bands.
4. CONCLUSIONS
We have produced a catalog of resolved stellar pho-
tometry for 22 million stars in the field of M33 from
"54 HST pointings covering the inner 3.1×4.6 kpc in
6 bands, including F275W, F336W, F475W, F814W,"
"F110W, and F160W. The astrometry of this catalog"
is aligned to the Gaia DR2 astrometric solution to
"∼5 milliarcsec. This catalog reaches mF275W = 24.5,
mF336W = 25, mF475W = 28.5, mF814W = 27.5,"
"mF110W = 26, and mF160W = 25 with a signal-to-noise"
limit of 4. Crowding causes the limiting magnitude to be
brighter in the redder bands closer to the center of M33.
This photometry will be studied in great detail by many
"future studies, such as the history of star formation in"
"M33, the M33 star cluster population, the initial mass"
"function of star clusters in M33, feedback between the"
"stars and interstellar medium in M33, the dust content"
"of M33, and many more."
We have performed many quality checks of the pho-
"tometry, including ensuring that the tip of the red gi-"
ant branch is consistent with previous distance measure-
"ments of M33, as well as running suites of artificial star"
"tests, where stars of known SEDs are put into the data"
and the analysis routine was rerun to assess the precision
and completeness with which stars are recovered.
A simplified version of our results catalogs are pro-
"vided here, which will likely provide all of the infor-"
"mation required for many science use cases; however,"
the exhaustive and complete output from our photom-
etry measurements are available from the multimission
archive HLSP.

the M33 (blue) and M31 (red) survey areas. The new M33 observations have a significantly higher average SFR intensity than
M31. (Right) The approximate present day metallicity gradient of M33 (blue) and M31 (red), and the range of metallicities in
the Magellanic Clouds (Gregersen et al. 2015; Kwitter & Aller 1981; Choudhury et al. 2015, 2018). The solid line shows the
extent of the new HST observations. The shaded region shows that the metallicity covered by M33 spans the gap in metallicity
between the Large Magellanic Cloud and the M31’s outer disk."

3 is the southernmost set. The field numbers for each brick are 1−18, where 1−6 are the top row from left to right, 6−12 are
the next row down, etc. The orientation of Field 5 in Brick 2 was shifted due to a lack of available guide stars in the standard

"Figure 16. Magnitudes at which we measure 50% completeness by stellar density in all filters. Stellar density corresponds to
the maps in Figure 7, where density is the number of stars with 19.7<F160W<20.7 per square arcsec; specifically, the right
hand panel is binned to complement the data points in this plot. Completeness limits in the UV are largely consistent over the
full density range of the survey, whereas they grow brighter with increasing density in the optical and NIR due to crowding."

"Figure 21. CMDs showing selection regions for three stellar subpopulations of different characteristic ages. Left: F475W–
F814W vs. F814W for stars meeting the GST criteria in the optical. The magenta polygon shows the selection region for young
main sequence stars. Right: F110W–F160W color vs. reddening-free F160W magnitude (qF160W, as defined in Dalcanton et al.
2015) for stars that meet the GST criteria in the IR, but do not pass the GST criteria in F275W. The UV constraint helps to
eliminate contamination from young BHeB stars in the selection of older populations. The orange polygon shows the selection
region for asymptotic giant branch stars, and the blue shows the same for the red giant branch. The limiting magnitudes of the
RGB and MS selection regions roughly correspond to &80% completeness in the relevant bands (see Figure 16). As completeness
in F160W varies substantially with stellar density, RGB stars are selected using two different criteria. Stars located more than
1.2′ from the M33 nucleus (01h33m51s, +30◦39′36.72′′; van der Marel et al. 2019 and references therein) are selected with
qF160W < 22, while stars at radii < 1.2"
"′ are selected with qF160W < 21 (dashed line). This radial cut roughly corresponds to a
stellar surface density cut at 0.6 stars per square arcsec as measured in Fig. 7."

and young MS stars (right). The selection criteria for these subpopulations are shown in Figure 21. For the RGB, star counts
in the inner 1.2′ have been scaled to correspond to the deeper selection at larger radii. The RGB and MS maps have been
smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with σ = 0.25′, and the AGB with σ = 0.5′."

"Figure 23. Left: Median-filtered spatial map of the ratio of AGB to upper RGB stars (see Figure 21). In this case, RGB
stars were selected across the entire field with qF160W < 21 (as opposed to the dual selection shown in Figures 21 and 22) to
eliminate varying completeness as a source of uncertainty in the ratio. The large dotted ellipses show one of the radial annuli
used for the averaging in the right panel (inclination, position angle, and central coordinates from van der Marel et al. 2019 and
references therein), while the small dashed ellipse shows the approximate orientation, axis ratio, and maximum scale of M33’s
weak central bar (Corbelli & Walterbos 2007). Right: Average AGB/RGB ratio as a function of deprojected distance from the
M33 nucleus in kpc. The estimated maximum scale of M33’s weak bar is shown for reference (∼559 pc or 2.24′). In both the map
and radial profile, there is a distinct enhancement of AGB populations in M33’s outskirts relative to the center. This supports
previous work (e.g., Davidge 2003; Block et al. 2007; Verley et al. 2009) as evidence of M33’s “inside-out” star-formation history
(Williams et al. 2009; Mostoghiu et al. 2018)."
