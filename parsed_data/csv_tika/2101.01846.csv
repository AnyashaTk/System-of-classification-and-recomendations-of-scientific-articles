ABSTRACT
While magnetic fields likely play an important role in driving the evolution of protoplanetary disks
"through angular momentum transport, observational evidence of magnetic fields has only been found"
in a small number of disks. Although dust continuum linear polarization has been detected in an
"increasing number of disks, its pattern is more consistent with that from dust scattering than from"
magnetically aligned grains in the vast majority of cases. Continuum linear polarization from dust
"grains aligned to a magnetic field can reveal information about the magnetic field’s direction, but not"
"its strength. On the other hand, observations of circular polarization in molecular lines produced by"
Zeeman splitting offer a direct measure of the line-of-sight magnetic field strength in disks. We present
upper limits on the net toroidal and vertical magnetic field strengths in the protoplanetary disk AS
209 derived from Zeeman splitting observations of the CN 2-1 line. The 3σ upper limit on the net
line-of-sight magnetic field strength in AS 209 is 5.0 mG on the redshifted side of the disk and 4.2
"mG on the blueshifted side of the disk. Given the disk’s inclination angle, we set a 3σ upper limit"
"on the net toroidal magnetic field strength of 8.7 and 7.3 mG for the red and blue sides of the disk,"
"respectively, and 6.2 and 5.2 mG on the net vertical magnetic field on the red and blue sides of the"
"disk. If magnetic disk winds are a significant mechanism of angular momentum transport in the disk,"
magnetic fields of a strength close to the upper limits would be sufficient to drive accretion at the rate
previously inferred for regions near the protostar.

magnetorotational instability (MRI) (Balbus & Haw-
ley 1998) or magnetic disk winds (Blandford & Payne
1982). The MRI mechanism requires that material have
a high enough ionization fraction to be well-coupled to
"the magnetic field. In protoplanetary disks, the ioniza-"
tion fraction is only expected to be high enough to pro-
"duce magnetorotational instability within ∼0.1 au of the
central protostar, where the temperature is high enough"

"to produce thermal ionization, and in the surface layers"
"of the disk, where non-thermal ionization sources such as"
"cosmic rays, X-rays (Igea & Glassgold 1999), and FUV"
photons (Perez-Becker & Chiang 2011) can penetrate
(Gammie 1996). The poloidal component of the disk
magnetic field gives rise to the magnetic disk wind. The
disk wind system modeled in Suriano et al. (2018) pre-
dicts that the disk magnetic field will have both toroidal
"and poloidal components, with the toroidal component"
being stronger than the poloidal component in regions
above and below the disk midplane (see Suriano et al.
2018 Figures 4 and 5).
Observationally determining magnetic field strengths
and morphologies in protoplanetary disks to constrain
the various angular momentum transport mechanisms
has proven difficult. The original motivation behind
many millimeter and sub-millimeter continuum polar-
ization observations of protoplanetary disks was to find
evidence of dust grain alignment to disk magnetic fields
"(e.g., Stephens et al. 2014; Rao et al. 2014; Segura-Cox"
"et al. 2015). However, the polarized emission seen in"
many disks at these wavelengths is better explained by
"dust scattering of thermal emission (e.g., Kataoka et al."
"2015; Yang et al. 2016, 2017). While possible evidence of"
grain aligment to disk magnetic fields has been found in
the circumbinary disks BHB07-11 (Alves et al. 2018) and
"VLA 1623 (Sadavoy et al. 2018; Harris et al. 2018), and"
"in the disk of HD 142527 (Ohashi et al. 2018), these ob-"
servations provide information about the direction and
"morphology of the magnetic field lines, not the magnetic"
field strength.
The Zeeman effect offers a direct means of constrain-
ing the line-of-sight magnetic field strength without con-
"tamination from continuum dust scattering; however, it"
is possible to produce circular polarization in molecular
lines through resonant scattering (Houde et al. 2013). In
"the presence of a magnetic field, spectral lines split apart"
in frequency to a degree that depends on the magnetic
"field strength as ν = ν0± eB4πmec (e.g., Crutcher & Kem-
ball 2019), where ν0 is the line frequency in the absence"
of a magnetic field and B is the magnetic field strength.
In astronomical sources with intrinsically weak magnetic
"fields compared to those in, for example, stellar photo-"
"spheres, the observable of Zeeman splitting is circular"
"polarization of the spectral line, which measures the line"
"of sight magnetic field strength. Paramagnetic species,"
"such as the CN radical, are particularly sensitive to the"
Zeeman effect. CN is also one of only three species in
which the Zeeman effect has been unambiguously de-
tected in extended molecular gas in star forming regions
"(Crutcher 2012). However, the Zeeman effect has yet to"
"be detected in a protoplanetary disk, despite a recent"
attempt with ALMA (Vlemmings et al. 2019).
AS 209 is a protoplanetary disk located in the Ophi-
uchus star forming region at a distance of 126 pc from
the Sun (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016). The proto-
star has a mass of 1.25 M� (Teague et al. 2018) and a
luminosity of 1.5 L� (Tazzari et al. 2016). The disk is
known to have two rings at r = 75 au and r = 130 au
and two gaps at r = 62 au and r = 103 au (Fedele et al.
2018). This source was selected as a target source based
"on its inclination angle, the presence of a bright CN line"
"(Öberg et al. 2011), and high accretion rate of nearly"
"10−7 M� yr
−1 (Johns-Krull et al. 2000). The disk’s in-"
"clination angle (i) of 35.3◦ ±0.8◦ (Fedele et al. 2018),
where i = 0◦ represents a face-on disk, means that both"
toroidal and vertical magnetic field lines would have a
"component along the line of sight, with the toroidal com-"
ponent Bφ = BLOS/ sin i along the disk’s major axis
"and the vertical component Bz = BLOS/ cos i. Finally,"
a strong magnetic field would likely be needed to drive
its high accretion rate.
"In this paper, we present Zeeman observations toward"
"AS 209 using CN 2-1. In Section 2, we present the obser-"
"vations, including the continuum polarization. Without"
"an obvious Zeeman detection, we then use two analysis"
"approaches in Section 3. In Section 4, we place limits on"
"the magnetic strength, and in Section 5, we summarize"
the results.
2. OBSERVATIONS
These observations were taken with the Atacama
Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA). All
data discussed in this paper were taken as part of ALMA
project 2018.1.01030.S (PI: Rachel Harrison). The ob-
servations were taken in four execution blocs between 6
March and 7 March 2019 while the array was in config-
"uration C43-1. The total observing time was 6.1 hours,"
of which 2.7 hours were spent on AS 209. The aver-
"age sampling time was ∼6 seconds. J1733-1304 was the
phase calibrator, J1751+0939 was the polarization cal-"
"ibrator, and J1427-4206 was the bandpass calibrator."
The dataset consists of two spectral line windows with
a channel width of 122.070 kHz and a total bandwidth of
"117.1875 MHz each, and two continuum windows with a"
channel width of 976.562 kHz and a total bandwidth of
937.5000 MHz each. The spectral line windows are cen-
tered on 226.64013 GHz and 226.88081 GHz. One spec-
"tral line window covered lines 1-4 listed in Table 1, and"
the other covered lines 5-9. The Zeeman factors for all of
the lines observed are from Shinnaga and Yamamoto (in
preparation). Shinnaga and Yamamoto calculated the
Zeeman factors under the framework of the first-order
CN Zeeman AS 209 3
"perturbation, as the interstellar magnetic field is quite"
"weak, as weak as 100 µG or less. The authors employ the"
Hund’s case (b) for the coupling scheme of the angular
momenta for the calculation (Gordy & Cook 1970). We
quote Shinnaga and Yamamoto’s Zeeman factor values
"to the second decimal place, and they are in agreement"
with those reported in Vlemmings et al. (2019).

Frequencies and Zeeman splitting factors (Z)
calculated from theory for the hyperfine lines
(Shinnaga and Yamamoto in preparation) covered in
these observations. The Zeeman splitting factor is a
measure of how much a line will be split in frequency
by a given magnetic field strength. A higher absolute
value of Z means that a line is more sensitive to the
line of sight magnetic field.
The data were calibrated by data analysts at the
NAASC using a script developed for calibrating ALMA
polarization observations. All data reduction was per-
formed using the Common Astronomy Software Appli-
cations (CASA) version 5.4.0. The data were cleaned
using Briggs weighting with a robust parameter of 0.5
to create image cubes and continuum images for all four
Stokes parameters. We performed one round of phase-
"only self calibration on the continuum I data, with the"
solution interval set to the scan length. Before mak-
"ing the line image cubes, we subtracted the continuum"
emission from the spectral line windows. The image
cubes were created with a spectral resolution of 0.25
"km/s. The images have a beam size of 1.40′′ × 1.27′′.
The linear polarized intensity map was debiased using"
the average noise value determined from the Q and U
"maps, an estimator used by e.g. Wardle & Kronberg"
(1974) and Vidal et al. (2016):
"

√
Q2 + U2 − σ2 if"
"√
Q2 + U2 ≥ σ"
"0 otherwise
(1)"
We estimate that the uncertainty on the amplitude
"calibration is ±10%, and from here on, we only give sta-
tistical uncertainties. The rms values of the image cubes"
"are σ(I,Q,U,V ) = (0.91, 0.95, 0.96, 0.95) mJy beam
−1 per"
0.25 km/s channel in the spectral window containing
"lines 1-4 and σ(I,Q,U,V ) = (0.95, 0.88, 0.90, 0.89) mJy"
beam−1 per 0.25 km/s channel in the spectral window
containing lines 5-9. The continuum I rms value was
0.60 mJy beam−1 before self calibration and 0.33 mJy
beam−1 after self calibration. The rms values for the
"Q, U , and V continuum images are σ(Q,U,V ) = (0.015,"
"0.012, 0.013) mJy beam−1. The higher noise value in"
"Stokes I compared to Q, U , and V is due to dynamic"
range limits.
3. RESULTS
"In the dust continuum total intensity (Stokes I), the"
disk has a peak flux of 127.4 mJy/beam and a total in-
"tensity of 215.0 ± 1.8 mJy. All nine of the hyperfine
components that we targeted were detected in Stokes I."
The integrated line intensity for the hyperfine compo-
"nents of lines 5-7 in Table 1 is 3.874 ± 0.015 Jy km/s,
which is consistent with the value of 3.32 ± 0.14 Jy km/s
from (Öberg et al. 2011), given that the absolute flux"
"calibration uncertainty is ∼10% for ALMA and ∼10-
15% for the SMA. The velocity map of the source shows"
the pattern expected from a rotating disk (see Figure

polarization effects such as beam squint that produce
"pseudo-Zeeman splitting, which shows up as the same"
splitting in each hyperfine line. B will be non-zero only
if there is circular polarization due to the Zeeman ef-
fect. We used this method to simultaneously fit all the
unblended portions of the lines integrated over the cir-
"cumstellar disk, but we were still unable to find a detec-"
tion of Zeeman splitting.
"However, unlike the case for the clouds studied by"
"Crutcher et al. (1996), the disk of AS 209 is rotating,"
which broadens the line emission and would impact any
"disk spatial averaging. To account for this, we used"
the package gofish (Teague 2019) to shift the veloci-
ties in the Stokes I and Stokes V cubes by the amounts
appropriate to correct for Keplerian motion. Based on
"the disk’s inclination angle, position angle, distance, and"
"stellar mass, gofish calculates the expected Keplerian"
velocity for each pixel in the image cube. This allows us
to shift the line emission for each Stokes parameter onto
a common centroid velocity range based on the disk’s
deprojected Keplerian rotation profile. Teague et al.
(2018) showed that AS 209’s rotation profile differs from
the Keplerian profile of a disk with the parameters listed
"in the introduction by at most ±5%. For the purposes of
this paper, assuming a Keplerian rotation profile is suf-"
ficient to account for the large majority of the motion
within the disk. Figure 2 shows a moment 1 map cre-
ated from an image cube whose pixels have been shifted
along the velocity axis to correct for Keplerian motion
using gofish. This velocity correction process is lim-
ited by our angular resolution. Pixels within one beam
of the disk’s center will contain emission from both the
"redshifted and blueshifted sides of the disk, and will thus"
have a velocity closer to the central velocity of the line
than they would in an image with infinite angular reso-
lution. This leads to the overcorrection of the velocities
near the center of the disk seen in Figure 2. We therefore
exclude the region within a 0.7 arcsecond radius (half of
the beam major axis) of the disk’s center from our fits.
Our angular resolution is sufficient to resolve the red-
shifted and blueshifted sides of the disk. This is advan-
tageous for investigating any toroidal component of the
magnetic field because we expect a toroidal magnetic
CN Zeeman AS 209 5
field to have opposite signs on the red and blue sides
of the disk. We used two different methods to extract
"information about the magnetic field in the disk. First,"
we created average Stokes I and average Stokes V pro-
files for the redshifted and blueshifted sides of the disk
and fit these data using the technique described earlier
in this section. The Stokes I and V spectra for all of the
hyperfine components created using gofish are shown
in Figure 3. To calculate the uncertainties in each ve-
"locity bin, we calculated the per-channel rms in a region"
outside the disk from spectral line cubes whose velocities
had been Kepler-corrected in gofish.
After using gofish to account for line broadening
"due to Keplerian motion, lines 5, 6, and 7 were still"
blended. We therefore used only the lower-frequency
portion of the Kepler-corrected line 5 data and the
higher-frequency portion of the Kepler-corrected line 7
data in the Crutcher et al. (1996) fit. The magnetic field
strength that produced the best fit to these data was 1.9
"± 1.7 mG on the redshifted side of the disk and 1.0 ±
1.4 mG on the blueshifted side of the disk. The value of"
"C1 was -3.7×10−3±1.1×10−3 on the red side of the disk
and −4.1×10−3±1.1×10−3 on the blue side. The value
of C2 were 1.8±2.3 Hz on the red side of the disk and
-1.4±1.9 Hz on the blue side. The Stokes V profiles cre-
ated by Zeeman splitting are dependent on the Zeeman"
"splitting factors which are different for each line, making"
it unlikely that an instrumental effect like beam squint
(which would affect all lines in the same way) could de-
stroy a real Zeeman signal. The uncertainty of 0.8◦ on
the disk’s inclination angle adds an additional 0.07 mG
to the 1σ error bar on the net line-of-sight magnetic field
"strength on the redshifted side of the disk, and 0.03 mG"
on the blueshifted side of the disk. For the remainder
"of this paper, we will deal with the upper limits derived"
using an assumed inclination angle of 35.3◦. Using the
uncertainties on the magnetic field strengths as the 1σ
"value, the limit on the net line-of-sight magnetic field"
strength is 5.0 mG on the redshifted side of the disk
and 4.2 mG on the blueshifted side of the disk. Given
"the disk’s inclination angle of 35.3◦, this places 3σ up-"
per limits of 8.7 mG (red) and 7.3 mG (blue) on the net
toroidal magnetic field and 6.3 mG (red) and 5.1 mG
(blue) on the net vertical magnetic field. The Stokes I
and V averaged spectra from the red and blue sides of
each line are shown in Figure 3.
"Second, we stacked (i.e., summed) the Stokes I and"
Stokes V spectra from both the red and blue sides of
the disk for only the unblended lines. The Stokes I
"spectra were scaled by their relative intensities, and the"
Stokes V spectra were scaled by the relative Stokes I
intensities and the Zeeman splitting factors. If the disk
"field is toroidal, we would expect the Stokes V spectrum"
from one side of the disk to be the same shape as the
"spectrum from the other side of the disk, but mirrored"
across the velocity axis. This is because the line-of-sight
component of a toroidal field would have opposite signs
"on the redshifted and blueshifted sides of the disk, and"
V (v) is proportional to the line-of-sight component of
"Bz, including the sign. Therefore, stacking V (v) from"
"the red side of the disk with −V (v) from the blue side
of the disk should increase the SNR of any Stokes V"
"emission that comes from a toroidal field. However, this"
method of stacking would destroy any Stokes V signal
"from a vertical magnetic field, as we expect the direction"
of the vertical component of the field to remain the same
"across the disk. Nonetheless, stacking the lines in this"
way did not lead to a detection of circularly polarized
emission. We fit the weighted sum of the line profiles
"Vtot =
1"
"2I0
Blos"
"∑
i Zi"
"dIi
dνi
wIwZ to the stacked line data,"
"where the i’s are lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9; I0 is the max-"
"imum Stokes I intensity, and wI and wZ are weighting"
factors that account for the relative intensities of the
lines and the relative strengths of their Zeeman splitting
"factors, respectively. The stacked spectra are shown in"
Figure 4. The best fit values for Blos from this stacking
"technique were -4.2 ± 6.9 mG for the redshifted side of
the disk, 2.0 ± 4.6 mG for the blueshifted side of the
disk, and 0.4 ± 4.9 mG for the full disk. Because this
method does not account for circular polarization from"
"instrumental effects, we report the results of using the"
first fitting technique described above as our final upper
limits on the magnetic field strength.
3.2. Continuum linear polarization
The continuum polarization pattern in AS 209 at 1.3
mm is shown in Figure 5. Our observations are similar to
"those observed at 870 µm by Mori et al. (2019), with the"
direction of polarization oriented parallel to the disk’s
minor axis in the inner part of the disk and oriented
azimuthally in the outer part of the disk. This pattern
closely matches the polarization from scattering in a disk
with a similar inclination to AS 209’s predicted by the
model in Yang et al. (2016). We plan to explore the
possible mechanisms behind this polarization pattern in
a future paper.
4. DISCUSSION
We did not detect circular polarization in any of the
"individual CN 2-1 lines or in the stacked lines, so we have"
calculated 3-σ upper limits on the net toroidal and ver-
tical magnetic field strengths. The minimum detectable
degree of circular polarization with ALMA is 1.8% of the

peak Stokes I flux according the ALMA Cycle 7 Tech-
nical Handbook. The Stokes V flux does not reach this
1.8% threshold in any channel of any individual hyper-
fine line or the stacked lines in our observations. Because
the fitting technique described in Section 3.1 removes in-
strumental effects that could produce spurious Stokes V
"signal, and because the Stokes V spectrum is noise-like,"
the uncertainities on the magnetic field strengths calcu-
lated using the fitting technique can be used to calculate
upper limits on the disk’s magnetic field strength. The
average rms values on the Stokes V spectra shown in
"Figure 3 were ∼0.9% of the Stokes I peak of the bright-
est line, which means that a Stokes V signal ≥ 0.02 Jy
beam−1 would be detectable in the brightest line. Here,"
we discuss the implications of our field strength upper
"limits for the disk’s mass accretion rate, as well as pos-"
sible reasons for the non-detection.
Our non-detection of Zeeman splitting in the CN 2-1
line allows us to put constraints on the mass accretion
rate that the magnetic field can drive in the disk on the
10’s of au scale. The magnetically driven accretion rate
"Ṁmag is related to the magnetic stresses through, e.g.,"
equation 18 of Wang et al. (2019). Making the sim-
"plifying assumptions that |BR|, |Bz|, and |Bφ| are con-
stant, and that Bφ has opposite signs above and below"
"the midplane, this equation can be recast into a rough"
order-of-magnitude estimate of the magnetically driven
accretion rate:

tion is mass accretion driven by a magnetized disk wind
and the second term is that from magnetic stresses in-

"mates from Bai & Goodman 2009, see their equations"

"thin, with h/R � 1, the magnetic disk wind tends to
remove angular momentum more efficiently than the in-"
ternal magnetic stresses for comparable Bz and BR. In

where we have normalized the vertical and toroidal com-
ponents of the magnetic field by their respective 3σ up-
per limits and the stellar mass M∗ by the value inferred
"in Teague et al. (2018). The ∼ 10−6 M� yr−1 value we
estimate from our magnetic field strength upper limits"
is to be compared with the mass accretion rate from the
disk onto the central star of 10−7 M�/yr estimated by
Johns-Krull et al. (2000) based on the luminosity of ul-
traviolet lines (especially CIV). This accretion rate is on
the high side for classical T Tauri stars and needs to be
checked through independent methods.
It is possible that the absolute value of the disk
"magnetic field strength |B| is substantially higher than
our upper limits on the net line-of-sight magnetic field"
strength. This is particularly true in the case where the
magnetic field in the disk is dominated by the toroidal
component Bφ and Bφ reverses polarity across the disk
midplane. Such a field reversal would be naturally pro-
duced if there is a net magnetic flux threading the disk
(as is likely given that the disk forms out of magnetized
dense cores that appear to have fairly regular magnetic
"fields as traced by dust polarization; for a recent review,"
see Hull & Zhang 2019). The differential rotation be-
tween the disk midplane and the atmosphere and/or disk
wind naturally twists the polodial field into a toroidal
field that reverses direction around the midplane (for

"if the disk is not too optically thick, an individual line"
of sight will contain CN emission from above and below
the disk midplane and thus sample gas with reversed
toroidal magnetic fields and thus Zeeman signals of op-
posite sign. The optical depths of the bright rings of AS
209 are estimated to be 0.46 and 0.52 at ALMA Band
6 (Dullemond et al. 2018) and should be much lower
in the gaps. It is likely that the bulk of the CN emit-
ting materials both above and below the disk midplane
"contribute to the observed signals, which leads to a can-"
"cellation of the Zeeman signal. In this case, the Zeeman"
measurement can significantly underestimate the abso-
"lute strength of the magnetic field, as illustrated quan-"
"titatively by Mazzei et al. (2020, MNRAS, submitted)."
5. CONCLUSIONS
We present the first Zeeman observations toward the
"circumstellar disk of AS 209, using 9 hyperfine compo-"
nents of CN 2-1 in ALMA Band 6. Although we easily
"detect the dust polarization of the disk, which is consis-"
"tent with previous Band 7 observations, we do not detect"
any polarized emission in the CN lines. After correct-
"ing for the Keplerian rotation of the disk using gofish,"
we used two approaches to derive upper limits on the
magnetic field strengths: fitting the equation described
in Equation 2 to each hyperfine component as described
in Crutcher et al. (1996) and fitting an equation with
the form of the Zeeman splitting profile to the scaled
sum of all of the un-blended components. We derived
these limits for the redshifted and blueshifted sides of
"the disk, as well as the entire disk. We present 3σ up-"
per limits based on the stacking technique described in
Crutcher et al. (1996) because this technique allows us
to remove circular polarization from instrumental effects
"from the Stokes V spectra. In that case, we have cal-"
culated 3σ upper limits on the net toroidal and vertical
magnetic field strengths of Bφ < 8.7 mG and Bz < 6.1
mG. A change in polarity of the toroidal magnetic field
across the disk midplane may cause us to underestimate
the absolute strength of the toroidal component of the
"magnetic field, and therefore the true toroidal magnetic"
field strength could be > 8.7 mG. Our constraints on
the magnetic field strength provide an upper limit on
the magnetically-driven mass accretion rate on the 50
"au scale of order 10−6 M�yr
−1 or smaller, which is con-"
sistent with the mass accretion rate onto the star previ-
ously inferred for this object.
