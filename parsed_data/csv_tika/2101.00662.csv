"ABSTRACT
The [O iii] 88 µm fine structure emission line has been detected into the Epoch of Reionization
(EoR) from star-forming galaxies at redshifts 6 < z . 9 with ALMA. These measurements
provide valuable information regarding the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) in the
highest redshift galaxies discovered thus far. The [O iii] 88 µm line observations leave, how-
ever, a degeneracy between the gas density and metallicity in these systems. Here we quantify
the prospects for breaking this degeneracy using future ALMA observations of the [O iii] 52
µm line. Among the current set of ten [O iii] 88 µm emitters at 6 < z . 9, we forecast 52
µm detections (at 6-σ) in SXDF-NB1006-2, B14-6566, J0217-0208, and J1211-0118 within
on-source observing times of 2-10 hours, provided their gas densities are larger than about
nH & 10"
"2−103 cm−3. Other targets generally require much longer integration times for a 6-σ
detection. Either successful detections of the 52 µm line, or reliable upper limits, will lead to
significantly tighter constraints on ISM parameters. The forecasted improvements are as large
as ∼ 3 dex in gas density and ∼ 1 dex in metallicity for some regions of parameter space. We
suggest SXDF-NB1006-2 as a promising first target for 52 µm line measurements. We discuss
how such measurements will help in understanding the mass metallicity relationship during
the EoR.

1 INTRODUCTION
"Recent ALMA observations of atomic fine structure emission lines
have provided spectroscopic redshifts for galaxies into the EoR at
6 < z . 9 and started to probe their ISM properties (e.g., Willott
et al. 2015; Inoue et al. 2016; Marrone et al. 2018). Specifically,
these measurements constrain the internal structure, dynamics, ion-
ization state, and gas phase metallicity in some of the first galaxies.
The fine structure line observations can be further combined with
rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) estimates of the star-formation rates
(SFRs) in these galaxies and infrared (IR) determinations of stellar
mass, allowing one to study correlations between gas content and
stellar populations into the EoR. These, in turn, give crucial empir-
ical guidance for models of galaxy formation and help to determine
the properties of the sources that reionized the universe."
"More specifically, this paper focuses on [O iii] fine-structure
emission lines from the EoR, which probe the gas phase metallicity
and density in the HII regions in these galaxies. First, these observa-
tions help in understanding the chemical enrichment history in early
galaxy populations. Furthermore, in lower redshift galaxy samples,
there is a well-established correlation between gas phase metallic-"

"ity and stellar mass (Lequeux et al. 1979; Tremonti et al. 2004):
this is thought to reflect the impact of outflows which drive gas and
metals out of the shallow potential wells of small mass galaxies but
have less affect in larger galaxies. The recent [O iii] measurements,
combined with stellar mass estimates, start to study whether these
correlations hold and/or evolve into the EoR (Jones et al. (2020),
hereafter Jones2020). Next, the gas density measurements are rel-
evant for understanding the internal structure and escape fraction
of ionizing photons from these galaxies (e.g. Benson et al. 2013;
Kimm & Cen 2014; Ma et al. 2015; Kimm et al. 2019). The escape
fraction plays a critical, yet highly uncertain, role during cosmic
reionization."
"Thus far, ALMA has detected the [C ii] 158 micron emission
line and the [O iii] 88 micron line from tens of 6 < z . 9 galaxies
(e.g., Pentericci et al. 2016; Laporte et al. 2017; Carniani et al. 2017;
Smit et al. 2018; Carniani et al. 2018a,b; Hashimoto et al. 2018,
2019; Tamura et al. 2019; Harikane et al. 2020b; Novak et al. 2019).
Intriguingly, in some cases the [O iii] luminosities from this sample
exceed those of local galaxies (De Looze et al. 2014) with the same
SFRs (Moriwaki et al. 2018). The ratio between the [O iii] 88 µm
and [C ii] luminosity is also larger than in local galaxies (Harikane
et al. 2020b). In short, the [O iii] 88 µm line is a bright and promis-
ing tracer of reionization-era galaxies."

"Motivated by the ALMA [O iii] 88 µm detections and their
future promise, we developed a first-principles analytic model for
[O iii] emission in Yang & Lidz (2020), (hereafter Yang2020). We
leave the more complex modeling required for studying [C ii] emis-
sion (e.g. Ferrara et al. 2019; Katz et al. 2019) to future work. The
Yang2020 model determines the [O iii] luminosity from galaxies
with a given SFR, metallicity, gas density, and ionizing spectral
shape. Briefly, in these calculations we first compute the total vol-
ume in HII regions across each galaxy and the [O iii] fraction within
these regions. We then determine the level populations in the dif-
ferent fine-structure states and the resulting line luminosities. We
cross-checked these calculations against CLOUDY (Ferland et al.
2017) simulations and find that they agree to better than 15% ac-
curacy across a broad range of model parameters. We then applied
the model to derive bounds on the gas phase metallicity and den-
sity in the HII regions from the current ALMA sample of 88 µm
detections and measurements of their luminosity to SFR. (This is
denoted herein as L10/SFR since the 88 µm transition is between
the first excited level and the ground state, i.e. it is a 1 → 0 transi-
tion)."
"An important degeneracy is left, however, between the metal-
licity and gas density from the 88 µm and SFR measurements alone
(Yang2020). At high densities, nH & 102 − 103 cm−3, collisional
de-excitations become important and it is impossible to distinguish
galaxies with high density and metallicity from those with lower
density and metallicity, since the line luminosity drops with increas-
ing density and/or decreasing metallictiy. The 88µm and SFR mea-
surements alone yield only an upper bound on gas density, nH, and
a lower bound on metallicity, Z."
"Previous work suggests that future ALMA measurements of
the [O iii] 52 µm transition may help to break this degeneracy
(Jones2020,Yang2020). This line arises from transitions between
the second excited and first excited fine structure levels in [O iii]
(and so the luminosity in this line is denoted hereafter as L21). As
noted in these previous studies, the ratio between the 52 µm and
88 µm emission (L21/L10) provides a powerful density diagnos-
tic (e.g. Draine 2011), since the lines have different critical densi-
ties and their ratio hence depends on the importance of collisional
de-excitations. As the energy splitting between these fine-structure
states is small compared to the temperature of the HII region gas,
the line ratio is insensitive to the temperature of the gas. Further, the
lines arise from the same ion and so the ratio does not depend on
the ionization state of the gas, nor appreciably on its metal content."
"Jones2020 also considered the prospects for detecting 52 µm
emission with ALMA from some of the current sample of [O iii]
88 µm emitting galaxies at 6 < z . 9, finding that some of these
sources are detectable in reasonable observing times. Here we ex-
tend the work in these previous studies to forecast the quantitative
improvements on the gas density and metallicity error bars that will
be enabled by new 52 µm measurements in the future. Furthermore,
we consider the implications of these improvements for our under-
standing of the mass-metallicity relationship during the EoR, build-
ing off of the earlier work on using the [O iii] 88µm line to constrain
this important correlation in Jones2020 and our previous analytic
model in Yang2020."
"The plan of this paper is as follows. In §2 we describe the cur-
rent ten ALMA [O iii] targets at 6 < z . 9. §3 reviews the [O iii]
88 µm and 52 µm analytic model introduced in Yang2020. In §4 we
consider the nH−Z parameter space allowed by current L10/SFR
observations and compute the range of observing times required to
achieve 6−σ 52 µm detections using the ALMA sensitivity calcu-
lator. In §5 we perform Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) cal-"
"culations to quantify the parameter space improvements expected
towards four promising 52 µm targets. We show that both success-
ful detections and upper limits on the 52µm signal will significantly
tighten the gas density posteriors and also bring stronger constraints
on the ISM metallicities. We compare the ISM metallicity con-
straints from Jones2020, Yang2020, and the future improvements
enabled by joint [O iii] 88 µm and 52 µm fits in §6. We discuss
how these observations can advance our understanding of the mass-
metallicity relationship during the EoR. We conclude in §7."
2 DATA
"We consider the sample of nine ALMA [O iii] 88 µm detections
plus one upper limit at 6 < z . 9, published in the current litera-
ture, and summarized in Table 1. These include one gravitationally-
lensed galaxy at z = 9.1 (Hashimoto et al. 2018) (MACS1149-
JD1), a lensed Y-band drop-out galaxy A2744 YD4 at z ∼ 8 (La-
porte et al. 2017), and the z ∼ 8 Y-dropout Lyman break galaxy
(LBG), MACS0416 Y1 (Tamura et al. 2019). At z ∼ 7, [O iii] from
one Lyα emitter is detected in a follow up measurement carried out
by Inoue et al. (2016). In addition, the LBG B14-65666 is measured
by Hashimoto et al. (2019), and the star forming galaxy BDF-3299
is detected in Carniani et al. (2017), each near z ∼ 7. Three lu-
minous LBGs, J1211-0118, J0235-0532, and J0217-0208 at z ∼ 6
are presented by Harikane et al. (2020a). The galaxy SFRs summa-
rized in Table 1 can also be found in Harikane et al. (2020a). We
use the Salpeter IMF based results from this study, rather than the
ones in Harikane et al. (2020b) which assume a Charbier IMF, for
consistency with our model. Finally, a non-detection of [O iii] from
the Lyα emitting galaxy z7 GSD 3811 at z = 7.7 is reported in
Binggeli et al. (2020)."
3 MODEL
"Our aim is to forecast the expected SNR for 52 µm emission line
observations of this sample of galaxies as well as the improvements
expected for the ISM parameter constraints. In order to do this we
need to account for current uncertainties in the [O iii] 88 µm lu-
minosities and SFRs, and we also need to span the allowed ISM
parameter space."
"To accomplish this, we turn to the Yang2020 [O iii] emission
model. In brief, this model treats the ionizing output of each galaxy
as concentrated into a single effective source of ionizing radiation
at the center of a spherically symmetric HII region, which is in
photo-ionization equilibrium. The rate of hydrogen ionizing pho-
tons emitted by this source is given byQHI and is determined by the
galaxy’s SFR, stellar metallicity, and IMF. Although in reality the
[O iii] emission arises from a complex ensemble of discrete HII re-
gions distributed across the galaxy, our simplified treatment – with
a single effective HII region – should provide an accurate prediction
of the total [O iii] luminosity summed over all of the HII regions in
the galaxy. We adopt a Starburst99 population synthesis stellar
spectrum (Leitherer et al. 1999) with a continuous SFR, a Salpeter
IMF (Salpeter 1955), and an age of 10 Myr throughout, in which
case the doubly-ionized oxygen fraction is close to unity through-
out the HII region for the SFRs considered here. As discussed in
Yang2020, we don’t expect the precise choice of stellar spectrum
here to significantly impact our results. For simplicity in making
our forecasts we ignore variations in the gas density and metallicity
across each galaxy (see Yang2020 for extensions to this and further"

"discussion). In this case the gas density is characterized by a single
number, nH, across each galaxy, while the metallicity is described
by the parameter Z."
"For simplicity, our baseline model assumption is that the stellar
metallicity matches the gas phase metallicity. Note, however, that
Steidel et al. (2016) find evidence for super-solar oxygen to iron
abundance ratios in z ∼ 2− 3 LBGs and argue that this is a natural
consequence of chemical enrichment dominated by core-collapse
supernovae, as would also be expected at the z ≥ 6 redshifts in our
sample. Since iron largely controls the stellar opacity and mass loss,
this case can be roughly described by adopting a lower stellar metal-
licty for a given gas phase metallicity. To account for this, we there-
fore consider also an alternate case in which the stellar metallicity
is a factor of 5 smaller than the gas-phase metallicity. The reduced
stellar metallicity in this scenario increases the ionizing photon out-
put for a given SFR, and thus enhances the [O iii] emitting volume,
relaxing the gas-phase metallicity bound from the L10/SFR mea-
surements (see Yang2020 and further discussion below)."
"The Yang2020 model then solves for the fine structure level
populations in the three-level atom approximation, accounting for
radiative de-excitations, collisional excitations and de-excitations,
and sub-dominant radiative trapping effects (computed in the es-
cape probability approximation; these effects are unimportant for
plausible [O iii] velocity distributions)."
"Under these assumptions, the luminosity in the [O iii] 88 µm
line (L10) and the 52 µm luminosity (L21) may be written as:"

specifying the spontaneous decay rate from the i-th to the j-th energy
level. The optical depth, τij , is treated self-consistently in the escape

line, αB,HII is the case B recombination rate of hydrogen, and ne

"Yang2020 used this analytic model to constrain the ISM prop-
erties of nine ALMA targets with L10/SFR observations. As dis-
cussed earlier, this left a degeneracy between gas density and metal-
licity (see also Figure 2). This can be broken by adding [O iii] 52
µm measurements, owing to the different critical densities of the
two lines. It is instructive to examine the asymptotic behavior of the

The low-density limit has a slight temperature dependence, but this
is weak since the energy separation between these states is small
relative to the HII region temperature. The number given in Eq 2
assumes a gas temperature of T = 104 K. To further illustrate,
Figure 1 shows the line ratio across the lognH − logZ1 parameter

"Using the nH − Z constraints in Yang2020, determined from
the L10/SFR measurements in the literature, we identify the cur-

The maximum and minimum values of L21/L10 allowed at 68%
confidence after spanning the nH − Z parameter space are given
in column (6) of Table 1 for each target. In the alternate case, mo-
tivated earlier, that the stellar metallicity (Z?) is 0.2 times the gas-
phase metallicity (Z), the higher rate of ionizing photon production
in this scenario increases the L21/L10 upper bounds by 5%-28%,
depending on the target."
4 OBSERVING TIME
"We now turn to compute the expected SNR for future ALMA 52
µm observations. We determine the ALMA sensitivity for a 10-
hour measurement as well as the on-source observing time required
to achieve a SNR= 6 [O iii] 52 µm detection at peak flux density
for each target under different L21/L10 scenarios. Specifically, we
consider the minimum and maximumL21 allowed by the Yang2020
constraints at 68% confidence, as well as an average between these
two luminosity limits."
"In order to compute the ALMA sensitivity for each of the ten
targets in Table 1 we use the ALMA Sensitivity Calculator web in-
terface. We assume a Gaussian line profile for each emission line
and that the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the 52 µm
line matches the best fit observational line width of its 88 µm coun-
terpart. We adopt the 43 ALMA antenna configuration and fre-
quency channels of width set by the FWHM/3, such that each spec-
tral line is resolved by three channels. We furthermore assume that
the angular size of the target is smaller than the beam of the ob-
servations, i.e., that the observations do not resolve the target. For
simplicity we set the declination as zero for all of the sources. The
ALMA band containing the 52 µm line for each target is listed in
column (5) of Table 1. The resulting 1-σ noise on the integrated
52 µm luminosity for a 10-hour on-source measurement is given in
column (7). Finally, the on-source integration times required for 6-
σ detections are shown for the maximum, mean, and minimum L21"
"cases in column (8). As mentioned in §3, decreasing Z? at fixed
gas phase metallicity increases L21/L10 and so shorter integration
times are required for 52 µm detections in this case. We are there-
fore providing conservative detection time estimates."
"Among the ten targets studied in this work, the 52 µm line
emitted by MACS1149-JD1 is not observable by ALMA because
its observed 52 µm frequency falls in the gap between the band 8
and band 9 windows. The other nine targets are in principle ob-
servable. The atmospheric opacity is, however, very large at the ob-
served frequencies of the 52 µm line for A2744-YD4, MACS0416-
Y1, and BDF-3299 and so it is not feasible to detect these objects
in practice. If the galaxies in this data set tend to have high gas
densities, nH & 102 − 103 cm−3, then the [O iii] 52 µm lines
from SXDF-NB1006-2, B14-65666, J0217-0208, and J1211-0118
can be detected within 10 hours, in agreement with the earlier work
of Jones2020. As noted in Jones2020, modeling of [O ii] and [S ii]
doublet emission lines in the spectra of LBGs at z ∼ 2−3 indicates
gas densities in the nH ∼ 200 − 300 cm−3 range (Sanders et al.
2016; Steidel et al. 2016; Strom et al. 2017). If the ALMA galaxies
are similar, or still more dense – as one might expect for galaxies
at higher redshifts – then this bodes well for detecting their 52 µm
emission. 2"
"At low gas densities, the 52 µm emission line is significantly
harder to detect and it may be possible to place only upper limits
on the luminosity of this line. Nevertheless, even in the low density
case where the 52 µm line is almost a factor of 2 less luminous than
the 88 µm emission, J0217 is still theoretically detectable within 24
hours of on-source integration time. In the intermediate density case
(where we takeL21 = L10×((L21/L10)max+(L21/L10)min)/2),
we find that 6-σ detections are possible in less than 10 hours for
SXDF-NB1006-2 and B14-65666. In the high and intermediate
density cases, SXDF-NB1006-2 requires the least time for a sig-
nificant detection (∼ 2 − 6 hours). We therefore suggest SXDF-
NB1006-2 as a promising first target for an ALMA 52 µm follow
up measurement."

the 52 µm followup observations (see column (7) of Table 1 for
the resulting noise estimates.) These forecasts are combined with
the constraints obtained in Yang2020 from the L10/SFR measure-
ments of Harikane et al. (2020a) (grey regions in the figure). In each
case, we adopt a hard metallicity prior enforcing Z ≤ Z�."
"As in the previous section, we explore the constraints expected
for three different assumptions regarding the line ratio L21/L10.
We assume a Gaussian likelihood for the line ratio, the standard er-
ror propagation formula to compute the uncertainties on this ratio"
"2 The listed times are on-source observing times only, ignoring the calibra-
tion overheads. Furthermore, observations in ALMA band 9 and 10 require
excellent weather conditions with good phase-stability. In practice, the ef-
fective band 9 and 10 observing time per local siderial time hour is limited
to just a few hours per ALMA configuration. This is especially true for the
compact configurations offered in Cycle 8 2021, the configurations most
suitable for a detection experiment."

"from the independent luminosity measurement errors, and MCMC
calculations to forecast the expected parameter constraints. The top
row of Figure 2 shows the maximal case, the middle row the inter-
mediate scenario, and the bottom row gives the minimum line ratio
model calculations. The forecasted constraints from the line ratio
alone are shown by the red regions/lines in Figure 2, while the com-
bined constraints are given in blue. The variations from bottom to
top correspond to increasing the gas density in the ISM, as discussed
earlier and indicated by the yellow arrow in the figure."
"As noted previously, the L10/SFR measurements alone leave
a strong degeneracy between gas density and metallicity, giving rise
to the “L”-shaped grey regions in the figure. The 52 µm line ratio
measurements will add nearly horizontal ellipses in the lognH −
logZ plane through their sensitivity to the gas density. The three
cases show the impact of shifting the fiducial gas density from a
higher value to a lower value as one moves from the top row to the
bottom one. Note that in some examples these constraint forecasts
come only from upper limits on the 52 µm line emission: for the
minimum L21/L10 case we do not expect 6-σ line detections to-
wards any of the four targets in less than ten hours. Further, for the
intermediate L21/L10 model, J0217-0208 and J1211-0118 still fall
below the SNR=6 threshold. Those examples illustrate that even an
upper limit will help to constrain the parameter space here."
"In most cases, we forecast that the gas density posteriors will
tighten significantly after including 52 µm follow-up measure-
ments. In many of the examples shown this should also help to
tighten the metallicity constraint by breaking the degeneracy be-
tween density and metallicity. For instance, in the maximal line ra-
tio case it will be possible to decisively show that SXDF-NB1006-
2 has a high metallicity Z ≥ 0.092Z� at 95% confidence, while
based on L10/SFR alone this galaxy’s metallicity may be as low as
Z = 0.011Z�, again at 95% significance. The improvements fore-
cast are weakest for the case of J0217-0208. This galaxy has a very
large L10/SFR and so high densities are already excluded for this
system (at least under our Z ≤ Z� prior). Nevertheless, we expect
the gas density determination to improve for this galaxy although
the metallicity constraint will not tighten. Overall, the prospects for
obtaining more stringent ISM parameter constraints from 52µm ob-
servations towards several of the galaxies in the current sample ap-
pear promising. In addition, we expect that further 88 µm detections
will extend the list of promising targets here in the near future.3"
"6 52 MICRON MEASUREMENTS AND THE
MASS-METALLICITY RELATION"
"The previous section shows that 52 µm measurements can help
sharpen constraints on the gas density and metallicity. Here we turn
to further explore the potential scientific impact of these measure-
ments, by quantifying the improvements that will be possible in our
understanding of the mass-metallicity relationship during the EoR.
This will extend the work of Jones2020, which started to constrain
this important relationship from the current [O iii] 88µm measure-
ments. As mentioned in the Introduction, the improved gas density
limits may also help in understanding the escape fraction of ioniz-
ing photons. Exploring this, however, will likely require compari-
son with detailed radiation-hydrodynamical simulations capable of
modeling the escape fraction and its dependence on galaxy proper-
ties, and so we defer this to possible future work."
"3 For example, the ALMA Large Program REBELS (2019.1.01634.L) aims
to discover the most luminous [C ii] and [O iii] galaxies in the EoR."
"The top left panel of Figure 3 compares empirical fits to the
mass-metallicity relationship at lower redshifts and a fitting for-
mula from a current simulation in the literature, along with the 88
µm based metallicity determinations from each of Jones2020 and
Yang2020 at 6 < z . 9. More specifically, the best-fit empiri-
cal Z(M∗) relationships at z ∼ 0 and z = 3.5 from Maiolino
et al. (2008) (hereafter Maiolino2008) are shown in solid curves.
These are compared to results from the FIRE simulations (dashed
line), calibrated from simulated galaxies at z = 6 (Ma et al. 2016)
(hereafter Ma2016). Note that the Ma2016 Z(M∗) fitting formula
predicts a drop of only 0.05 dex between z = 6 and z = 9; this esti-
mate requires extrapolating their formula beyond the redshift range
in which it was calibrated, at z ≤ 6, out to the highest redshift
(z ∼ 9) in the current ALMA sample. Hence the evolution across
the redshifts of this data set is expected to be negligibly small com-
pared to present and upcoming measurement errors."
"The current 6 < z . 9 metallicity constraints from Jones2020
and Yang2020, along with the stellar mass measurements in Table 1,
are given by the yellow and grey points, respectively, each with
1−σ error bars. As discussed further in Yang2020, these two stud-
ies agree despite different methodologies, although the error bars in
the Yang2020 work are larger, given the more agnostic prior on den-
sity adopted in that work. Note also that the sample considered in
Yang2020 includes additional galaxies beyond those in Jones2020:
BDF-3299, J0217-0208, J0235-0532, and J1211-0118."
"In order to quantify the constraints on the mass-metallicity re-
lation from Jones2020 and Yang2020, we calculate the reduced χ2
difference between the measurements and model Z(M∗) relation-
ships. In doing so, it is important to account for the intrinsic galaxy-
to-galaxy scatter in this relationship, which is not well character-
ized in the current AMAZE observations of Maiolino2008 nor in
the FIRE simulations of Ma2016. We therefore adopt an intrinsic
scatter of σint = 0.2 dex based on results from another simula-
tion study, using the IllustrisTNG simulations (Torrey et al. 2019).
Specifically, we denote the metallicity measurements towards the
ith galaxy by Zi and the corresponding metallicity error as σlog Zi .
The fitted Maiolino2008 and Ma2016 Z(M∗) relations are labeled
as logZmodel. The value of χ2 per degree of freedom, χ2ν , is then
calculated as:"
"χ

ν ="
"N=9∑

"(σ

"2 + (σinti )
2 + f ′(logM∗)2(σ"
"logM∗
i )"
"(3)
where the sum runs over the nine ALMA [O iii] 88 µm detections.
In order to account for the uncertainties in the stellar mass esti-
mates, we include a term in the variance that depends on the local
derivative of the Z(M∗) relationship with respect to the logarithm
of stellar mass (Clutton-Brock 1967), denoted above as f ′(logM∗).
This is calculated assuming the Ma2016 Z(M∗) relationship as
f ′(logM∗) = 0.35."
"The comparison with current constraints from Jones2020 and
Yang2020 indicates that none of the mass-metallicity relationships
in the literature are strongly favored or disfavored at the moment.
Quantitatively, the χ2ν values for the example relationships in Fig-
ure 3 are given in the first two columns of Table 2. The maximum
χ2ν values for Jones2020 and Yang2020 are 0.88 and 1.23, respec-
tively, corresponding to minimum p-values of 0.49 and 0.27, and so
the current measurement errors are too large to distinguish models."
"However, 52 µm measurements may help here, although the
constraint obtained will depend on the gas densities in the tar-
get galaxies. Here we only consider the additional metallicity con-
straints contributed by 52 µm measurements of the most promising"

"Figure 2. Forecasted improvements on gas density-metallicity parameter constraints from combining current L10/SFR measurements with upcoming red-
shifted 52 µm observations in four example galaxies, SXDF-NB1006-2, B14-65666, J0217-0208, and J1211-0118 (see Table 1). In each panel, the grey regions
and lines show the constraints from the current L10/SFR measurements, the red regions and lines show forecasts for the 52 µm line detections alone, while
the blue regions and lines give the joint constraints that will be possible. The upper/middle/lower rows show results for the maximum/average/minimum L21
scenarios (see text). The shaded regions give 68% and 95% confidence intervals."
"targets: NB1006, B14, J0217, and J1211, as identified in §4. The top
right panel of Figure 3, for instance, illustrates that if the gas density
in the four promising ALMA targets is large (so thatL21/L10 is near
the maximal case identified in the previous section), the high metal-
licity implied in these galaxies would disfavor the simulated mass-
metallicity relation in Ma2016 and the higher redshift empirical fit
from Maiolino2008. That is, in this case, the data may prefer less
redshift evolution in the normalization of the mass-metallicity rela-
tionship than in the AMAZE sample and in the FIRE simulations.
On the other hand, in the minimal L21/L10 scenario (bottom right)
the lower redshift mass metallicity relationships of Maiolino2008
would be modestly disfavored. In the intermediate case (lower left)
the results may not strongly discriminate between any of the models
shown."
"In order to quantify these qualitative trends and our ability to
constrain the mass-metallicity relationship with the upcoming 52
µm measurements, we calculate χ2ν between mock metallicity mea-
surements in each scenario and the different empirical/simulation
models. In computing χ2ν with Eq 3 we use here the joint metallic-
ity constraints from the currentL10/SFR and mock L21/L10 mea-
surements for NB1006, B14, J0217, and J1211, while we use the"
"constraints from Yang2020 for the other fixe ALMA [O iii] 88 µm
targets. The χ2ν test results are summarized in the fourth through
sixth column in Table 2. Most notably, in the ‘L21/L10 = max’
scenario, the χ2ν forecasts for the Maiolino2008 z = 3.5 model and
Ma2016 z = 6.0 model are 2.81 and 2.85 respectively, correspond-
ing to p-values on the order of 10−3. That is, these cases would be
strongly – if not decisively – disfavored."
"Furthermore, as discussed in Jones2020, future JWST mea-
surements of recombination lines such as Hα and Hβ should allow
improved SFR determinations and dust extinction corrections. To
gauge the improvements that may be possible, we suppose that the
L10/SFR measurement errors become dominated by σL10 alone.
In this case, the forecasted χ2ν values increase to 4.28 and 3.97 for
the maximal mock [O iii] 52 µm signal scenario, corresponding to
p-values of 1.4×10−5 and 4.4×10−5. That is, in this case, the high
redshift Maiolino2008 and Ma2016 models can be decisively ex-
cluded. The prospects in other scenarios are summarized in columns
seven to nine of Table 2. In addition, JWST will be able to measure
rest-frame optical emission lines from [O iii] and [O ii]. The [O iii]
optical lines are sensitive to the temperature of the emitting gas (e.g.
Jones2020 and Yang2020) and so are likely less robust metallicity"

thin curves at z = 0.07 and z = 3.5.). The results from the FIRE simulation suite (Ma2016) at z = 6 are given by the purple dashed line. In each panel, the

and 52 µm transitions, the rest-frame optical [O iii] and [O ii] lines
can help in empirically determining gas temperatures and ionization
states. See Jones2020 for further discussion. Hence the future com-
bination of 52 µm and JWST SFR measurements should help in de-
termining the mass-metallicity relationship during the EoR. It will
also be important, however, to obtain a significantly larger sample of"
"targets. In this context, galaxies with relatively low stellar masses,
such as NB1006-2, seem especially interesting since measurements
at the low mass end will be valuable in determining the shape of the
Z(M∗) relationship at high redshift."
"In the nearer term, these results suggest that the upcoming
measurements will start to place interesting constraints on the evolu-
tion in the normalization of the Z(M∗) relationship. Since the cur-"
"MNRAS 000, 1–8 (2021)"

"rent data are consistent with a range of possibilities, from surpris-
ingly little evolution – in comparison with even the z ∼ 0 normal-
ization from the AMAZE sample – to strong evolution (e.g. the cur-
rent measurements are consistent with models below the Ma2016
z ∼ 6 normalization), it is perhaps premature to speculate on the
precise implications in different scenarios. Instead, we only remark
that the Z(M?) normalization depends on the combined impact of
evolving gas fractions, the efficiency of metal retention, and metal
yields; it therefore provides a rich test of models of galaxy forma-
tion and feedback in a redshift regime well beyond that in which the
models have been calibrated (e.g. Ma2016, Torrey et al. 2019)."
7 CONCLUSION
"We have forecast the prospects for detecting the [O iii] 52 µm emis-
sion line from the current sample of ten ALMA [O iii] 88µm mea-
surements towards galaxies at 6 < z . 9. Adding 52 µm detections
or upper limits will break the degeneracy between gas density and
metallicity that remain from 88 µm and SFR measurements alone.
Using the Yang2020 model we forecast that the [O iii] 52 µm lines
from SXDF-NB1006-2, B14-65666, J0217-0208, and J1211-0118
can be detected within 10 hours of on-source observing time, pro-
vided these galaxies have gas densities larger than nH & 102−103
cm−3."
"We forecast the parameter space improvements that will be
possible for the four most promising targets, SXDF-NB1006-2,
B14-65666, J0217-0208, and J1211-0118, with a ten hour ALMA
52 µm measurement. We find that the gas density constraint should
tighten by 1-3 dex for these sources, while the metallicity posterior
will narrow by as much as 1 dex for SXDF-NB1006-2, B14-65666,
and J1211-0118. We identify SXDF-NB1006-2 as the most favor-
able target for first followup observations. The 52µm measurements
will enable interesting constraints on the mass metallicity relation-
ship during the EoR, especially if these target galaxies have high gas
densities. Further improvements are expected here following better
SFR determinations from the JWST."
"The 52 µm measurements should also help us understand the
gas density of some of the first galaxies. These observations will
help determine the internal structure of high redshift galaxies and
photon escape fraction in the sources that reionized the universe."
