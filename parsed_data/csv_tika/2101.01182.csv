ABSTRACT
"Star formation in galaxies is regulated by the heating and cooling in the interstellar medium. In particular, the"
processing of molecular gas into stars will depend strongly on the ratio of gas heating to gas cooling in the neutral
"gas around sites of recent star-formation. In this work, we combine mid-infrared (mid-IR) observations of Polycyclic"
"Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), the dominant heating mechanism of gas in the interstellar medium (ISM), with [C II],"
"[O I], and [Si II] fine-structure emission, the strongest cooling channels in dense, neutral gas. The ratio of IR cooling"
"line emission to PAH emission measures the photoelectric efficiency, a property of the ISM which dictates how much"
"energy carried by ultraviolet photons gets transferred into the gas. We find that star-forming, IR luminous galaxies"
in the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) with high IR surface densities have low photoelectric
"efficiencies. These systems also have, on average, higher ratios of radiation field strength to gas densities, and larger"
average dust grain size distributions. The data support a scenario in which the most compact galaxies have more young
"star-forming regions per unit area, which exhibit less efficient gas heating. These conditions may be more common at"
"high−z, and may help explain the higher star-formation rates at cosmic noon. We make predictions on how this can
be investigated with JWST."
1. INTRODUCTION
Star-formation in a galaxy is dependent on processes
which remove energy allowing gas to cool. Only the
coldest phases will collapse under self-gravity to form
"stars, and so characterizing the mechanisms by which"
gas heats and cools is critical to our understanding of
"star-formation, and galaxy evolution. The cold gas asso-"
ciated with star-formation emits strongly in low energy
"atomic and molecular transitions, bright at infrared (IR)"
wavelengths.
Studies with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO)
"were key in unveiling the 5 − 200µm wavelength regime
of the electro-magnetic spectrum of galaxies, which is"
rich in strong atomic and molecular emission lines that
"trace the ISM (Malhotra et al. 1997, 2001; Dale et al."
2000). Amongst the brightest of these features are [O I]
"63µm, and [C II] 157.7µm which can contain 0.1−1% of
total infrared luminosities (Malhotra et al. 2001; Stacey"
et al. 2010; Dı́az-Santos et al. 2013; Brisbin et al. 2015;
Ibar et al. 2015). The Herschel Space Telescope was
used to significantly increase the number of galaxies de-
"tected in the far-IR lines (e.g., Sturm et al. 2000; van"
"der Wel et al. 2014; Dı́az-Santos et al. 2011), and studies"
with the Spitzer Space Telescope added other prominent
"cooling lines such as [Si II] 34.8µm, as well as Polycyclic"
Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) vibrational lines between
"3 − 17µm that trace photoelectric heating.
[C II], [O I], and [Si II] are well-established as"
strong coolants in Milky Way photodissociation re-
"gions (PDRs), the transition zones between H II regions"
"and the cold-neutral-medium (e.g., Wolfire et al. 1990,"
2003). As the boundary layer between warm and cold
"gas, PDRs are an excellent place to study the processes"
"of heating and cooling, as the relative balance of en-"
ergy gains and losses can impact future star-formation.
"Emission from small grains, PAHs, provide an excellent"
tracer of the photoelectric heating of gas in PDRs (Gal-
liano et al. 2008; Tielens 2008). Photoelectrons ejected
"from PAH grains share energy with H and H2, which"
go on to collisionally excite fine-structure transitions of
"C+, O, and Si+. Although [C II] and [O I] emission are"
the dominant cooling channels in more normal PDRs
"(e.g., Tielens & Hollenbach 1985; Kaufman et al. 1999),"
[Si II] can also act as a significant coolant at high inter-
stellar radiation field densities (Kaufman et al. 2006).
"Thus, the cycle of gas heating and cooling in PDRs is"
"traced by [C II], [O I], [Si II], and PAH emission, which"
collectively make for a powerful diagnostic of the ISM in
"extragalactic sources (e.g., Malhotra et al. 2001; Helou"
et al. 2001; Croxall et al. 2012; Beirão et al. 2012; Sutter
et al. 2019.
The deficit of [C II] emission per unit LIR in warmer
"(higher dust temperatures; Tdust), and more compact"
"Luminous IR Galaxies (LIRGs: log LIR/L�= 11 − 12,
ULIRGs: log LIR/L�> 12) as compared to less extreme"
"galaxies is a well-studied phenomenon (e.g., Malhotra"
"et al. 1997, 2001; Luhman et al. 1998, 2003; Stacey et al."
"2010; Herrera-Camus et al. 2015; Dı́az-Santos et al. 2013,"
"2014, 2017; Ibar et al. 2015; Smith et al. 2017). More-"
"over, PAH emission and other far-IR fine-structure lines"
key to PDR heating and cooling show similar deficits
"(e.g., Brauher et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2010; Graciá-Carpio"
et al. 2011; Pope et al. 2013; Stierwalt et al. 2014; De
Looze et al. 2014; Cormier et al. 2015; Dı́az-Santos et al.
2017). The IR emission line deficits can be due to
changes in ISM densities and the strength of the ra-
"diation field impinging upon PDR surfaces (e.g., Dı́az-"
"Santos et al. 2017), and/or opacity effects, thermal line"
"saturation, and evolution in dust grain properties (Luh-"
man et al. 1998; Malhotra et al. 2001; Helou et al. 2001;
"Muñoz & Oh 2016; Smith et al. 2017); however, the"
deficits largely disappear in normal star-forming galax-
ies when the line emission is normalized by total PAH
emission (Helou et al. 2001; Croxall et al. 2012; Sutter
et al. 2019). This reinforces the link between the ejection
of photoelectrons from PAH grains and the collisional
"excitation of [C II] and other fine-structure lines, and"
suggests that the heating and cooling processes within
PDRs behave similarly for normal star-forming condi-
"tions over a range of Tdust and LIR. Interestingly, McK-"
inney et al. (2020) found lower [C II]/PAH emission at
"z ∼ 2 than z ∼ 0, suggesting evolution in the heating
and cooling balance with redshift. However, the cool-"
ing/heating ratio has yet to be fully characterized in
"z ∼ 0 starbursts, which represents a key step for future
studies of the early Universe."
"In this work, we explore the range of the ratio be-"
tween fine-structure line cooling to photoelectric heat-
"ing in local dusty, star-forming galaxies by comparing"
"[C II], [O I], and [Si II] emission to PAH emission in"
the Great Observatories All Sky LIRG Survey (GOALS;
Armus et al. 2009). GOALS is comprised of 244 galaxy
nuclei within 202 LIRGs and ULIRGs spanning a range
in merger stage and morphology. The range in IR lumi-
nosities and stellar masses of galaxies in GOALS makes
the sample a bridge between normal star-forming galax-
"ies and the most extreme, compact starbursts that host"
atypical PDR conditions exposed to stronger radiation
fields (Dı́az-Santos et al. 2017). Whether or not the gas
cooling/heating properties are fundamentally different
in such extreme environments remains an open question
which this work aims to address.
GOALS has been the subject of extensive study with
"observations spanning the electromagnetic spectrum1,"
including mid- and far-IR measurements of PDR cool-
"ing lines and PAHs, the ratio of which is an empirical"
"measure of the photoelectric efficiency, �PE: the fraction"
"of energy, in UV photons, emitted by hot stars that is"
absorbed by small dust grains and transferred into the
"neutral PDR gas via the photoelectric effect (e.g., Gerola"
& Schwartz 1976; de Jong 1977). There is evidence that
�PE is a constant amongst normal star-forming galax-
"ies (Helou et al. 2001; Sutter et al. 2019); however, this"
has yet to be tested in the starburst regime typical in
luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies powered
by star formation..
The paper is organized as follows: We review the
"multi-wavelength observations in Section 2, and discuss"
the sample selection. Section 3 summarizes important
derived quantities of GOALS galaxies presented in other
"works, as well as key analysis steps we take in this pa-"
per to appropriately combine the multi-wavelength data.
"Our results are presented in Section 4, which we discuss"
in Section 5 in the context of local star-formation and
trends in galaxy evolution. Section 6 summarizes the
paper.
2. SAMPLE SELECTION AND DATA
This work focuses on data from Spitzer/IRS (Dı́az-
"Santos et al. 2010, 2011; Petric et al. 2011; Stierwalt"
"et al. 2013, 2014; Inami et al. 2013), Spitzer/IRAC"
"(Mazzarella et al. 2020, in prep.), Herschel PACS and"
"SPIRE (Zhao et al. 2013; Dı́az-Santos et al. 2013, 2014,"
"2017), and AKARI/IRC (Inami et al. 2018)."
To measure the ratio of cooling and heating in star-
"forming gas, we select from the 244 galaxies in GOALS"
all sources with [Ne V]14.3µm / [Ne II]12.8µm < 0.5
and/or [O IV]25.9µm / [Ne II]12.8µm < 1 in oder to ex-
clude from the sample those galaxies with significant
heating from a central AGN (Inami et al. 2013; Petric
et al. 2011). Sources with low PAH equivalent widths
(EW) but no high-ionization emission lines are not re-
moved from the sample to avoid biasing the results con-
cerning grain properties such as size and ionization. As
"a result, 16 strong AGN systems are removed from con-"
sideration. Heavily dust obscured AGN could still be
"lurking in the sample, and we use mid-IR AGN frac-"
"tions (fAGN,MIR) derived in Dı́az-Santos et al. (2017) to"
identify sources with excess warm dust in the remaining
"sample, which we show in Figures to concentrate on the"
star-forming properties of the sample galaxies.
"1 For a complete list, visit http://goals.ipac.caltech.edu/
publications.html."
To fully explore the properties of interstellar PAH
"grains, we use AKARI 2.5−5µm spectra of 145 GOALS
(U)LIRGs presented in Inami et al. (2018), in which"
the 3.3µm PAH feature was detected for 133 targets.
This sub-sample spans the full range of LIR and lumi-
"nosity distance, and is representative of the range in"
star-formation properties of GOALS.
3. ANALYSIS
"In addition to measured line fluxes, this work makes"
use of a number of quantities from Herschel/PACS ob-
servations derived in Dı́az-Santos et al. (2017): We sub-
tract out the ionized component of [C II] emission us-
"ing the neutral [C II] PDR fractions (fPDR), estimated"
with [N II]122 and [N II]205 available for 54% of the sam-
"ple, and far-IR colors Sν,63µm/Sν,158µm otherwise, as de-"
scribed in Dı́az-Santos et al. (2017). We use IR surface
densities from Dı́az-Santos et al. (2017) which are cal-
"culated from the effective area measured at 70µm, and"
total IR luminosities from Armus et al. (2009). We also
use measurements of the average intensity of the UV in-
terstellar radiation field impinging onto the surface of
"PDRs, G, measured in local units (G0 = 1.6 × 10−3 erg
s−1 cm−2, Habing 1968), and neutral gas volume densi-"
"ties, nH, derived using the Kaufman et al. (1999, 2006)"
PDR models through PDR TOOLKIT (PDRT; Pound &
Wolfire 2008) which depend principally on the galaxy-
"integrated [C II] and [O I] line fluxes, as well as LIR."
3.1. PAH Properties
The PAH line fluxes used in our analysis are reported
"in Stierwalt et al. (2013, 2014), and Inami et al. (2018)."
"We take the PAH luminosity, LPAH, to be the sum of"
"features measured between ∼ 5−18µm by Spitzer IRS.
Specifically, LPAH includes the 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and"
"17µm PAH lines and all sub-features therein, as mea-"
"sured by CAFE which fits the line fluxes, continuum and"
the extinction simultaneously (Marshall et al. 2007). On
"average, these five PAH lines account for 76%±9% of the
total PAH luminosity measured by both the Short-Low"
"(SL, 5.5−14.5µm) and Long-Low (LL, 14−38µm) slits
in GOALS galaxies (Stierwalt et al. 2014). Because the"
"SL and LL slits have different widths, tied to the chang-"
"ing PSF with wavelength, some highly resolved galaxies"
show a small jump between their SL and LL IRS spec-
"tra. This is discussed fully in Stierwalt et al. (2013),"
and we combine the SL and LL data using their scale
factors derived from the wavelength overlap between the
two slits. LPAH is normalized to the SL slit. The 3.3µm
PAH luminosities (L3.3) are also matched to the aper-
ture extraction of IRS/SL data (see Inami et al. 2018
"Section 3); however, L3.3 represents a small component"

nosity. The ionized gas contribution to L[C II] has not been
subtracted out. Each data point is colored by the far-IR color
measured with the ratio of continuum at 63µm and 158µm.
Black contours contain 33%, 66%, and 95% of normal star-
forming galaxies measured by ISO (Helou et al. 2001; Mal-
hotra et al. 2001; Dale et al. 2000). Note that we have scaled
the ISOCAM PAH measurements by a factor of 42% to es-
timate LPAH from the 6.75µm broadband photometry, cor-
recting for the underlying continuum and longer wavelength
features. The correlation between [C II]/PAH and LIR in
local LIRGs and ULIRGs is weak, with a great deal of scat-
ter, but warmer objects tend to have lower [C II]/PAH ratios
compared to normal star-forming galaxies and cooler LIRGs."
"of LPAH (5% ± 1.5%), and is therefore only used to in-
vestigate the properties of PAH line ratios. In general,"
"the fraction of total PAH power measured through the
SL slit compared to the LL slit does not correlate with"
"galaxy distance, or other quantities we compare against"
"in this work, namely ΣIR. The sum of PAH features"
between 6 and 18µm traces the bulk of the total power
of PAH emission in GOALS.
From the sub-sample of GOALS galaxies with AKARI
"observations, 50 objects were selected as test-cases for"
"CAFE-NG (Advanced CAFE; Bonfini et. al., in prep.,"
"Marshall et al. 2007), which simultaneously fits contin-"
"uum and spectral features in the 0.6 − 35µm range.
These galaxies have full spectral model fits to the"
"AKARI+Spitzer data, which explicitly includes silicate"
absorption and 3.05µm ice feature absorption which
are fit independently. Joint fits to IR continuum and
line measurements are important to get accurate line
"fluxes e.g., Smith et al. 2007; Lai et al. 2020), and we"
use these new CAFE fits to estimate extinction-corrected
"3.3µm luminosities, L3.3, for the full AKARI sample."
"In general, the measured PAH intensity depends on how"
the local continuum is estimated. Inami et al. (2018)
"adopt a spline technique (L3.3,spline), which is known to"
under-estimate the extinction-corrected flux of PAH fea-
"tures between 6−17µm by 30−60% (Smith et al. 2007).
From careful fits to the full PAH features (Bonfini et al.,"
"in prep.) we find that L3.3,spline/L3.3 = 0.29 ± 0.07. For
the sample here we use this conversion and the results"
from Inami et al. (2018) to estimate L3.3 for each source
before comparing to the other PAH features.
3.2. Aperture Matching
Galaxies in GOALS vary from extended sources
spatially resolved by Spitzer to unresolved point-like
"sources, which motivates a careful approach to aperture"
matching when comparing Sptizer and Herschel mea-
surements. The effective area of the Spitzer/IRS SL slit
"is 3′′.7×9′′.5 (Stierwalt et al. 2013). To best match this
area, we begin by using [C II] and [O I] line fluxes mea-"
sured through the central spaxel of the PACS/IFU with
"dimensions of ∼ 9′′.4×9′′.4 (See Sect. 3.2 in Dı́az-Santos
et al. 2017). Next, we project the effective SL slit and"
PACS central-spaxel aperture onto the Spitzer/IRAC
"8µm images, assuming that it traces the co-spatial"
PAH and far-IR line emission from star-forming regions
"in LIRGs, which is reasonable for the 2 − 7 kpc-scale
observations in this work (Peeters et al. 2004; Alonso-"
Herrero et al. 2010; Pereira-Santaella et al. 2010; Salgado
et al. 2016; Hughes et al. 2016). Smith et al. (2007) show
the fractional power of PAHs to the IRAC 8µm band
to have a median value of 70% in normal star-forming
"galaxies, which increases only marginally when a more"
careful subtraction of stellar continuum is done using
"the IRAC 3−5µm channels (e.g., Helou et al. 2004). We
use the ratio of the 8µm flux through each aperture to"
"derive a correction, which is then used to scale down the"
PACS measurements to match the IRS aperture. The
median of aperture corrections derived in this manner
is 0.62 with upper and lower quartiles of 0.69 and 0.55
respectively. We note that aperture matching does not
introduce any bias in the slope of trends we explore in
this paper.
The [Si II] 34.8µm emission was measured in the
"Spitzer/IRS LL slit, using an effective extraction aper-"
"ture of ∼ 10′′.6×36′′.6 (Stierwalt et al. 2013). To match
measurements made through the IRS/SL slit, we scale"
the [Si II] line flux down to the normalization of the SL
spectrum using the same multiplicative factors applied
to the 17µm PAH fluxes (Stierwalt et al. 2013). As
"noted in Stierwalt et al. (2014), 15 LIRGs in GOALS"

4. RESULTS
"Following early [C II] surveys of low-redshift, mostly"
"normal star-forming galaxies with ISO, Helou et al."
(2001) measured a constant [C II]/PAH ratio over a
range of far-IR colors that showed significantly less
scatter than [C II]/LIR. This reinforced the link be-
tween PAHs and [C II] emission via photoelectric heat-
ing inside PDRs. We find that the galaxy-integrated
"[C II]/PAH ratio in luminous, infrared, star-forming"
galaxies does not correlate strongly with either far-IR
"color or LIR as shown in Figure 1, although warmer"
LIRGs and ULIRGs tend to have lower [C II]/PAH ra-
"tios compared to galaxies at log LIR/L�. 11. Trends in
PDR gas cooling/heating within the GOALS sample are"
likely to be more clear when measured against quantities
that better reflect the ionizing radiation or luminosity
density surrounding the young stars.
4.1. Line-to-PAH Ratios
The IR surface density is a more direct tracer of
"far-IR fine-structure line properties than color or LIR
(Dı́az-Santos et al. 2013, 2017; Smith et al. 2017), both"
of which exhibit little to no influence on the ratio of
[C II]/PAH (Fig. 1). As ΣIR should scale with the num-
"ber density of massive star-forming regions in the beam,"
we expect ΣIR to be more sensitive to statistical trends
across the sample. The [C II] deficit vs. ΣIR among lu-
minous infrared star-forming galaxies presented in Dı́az-
Santos et al. (2017) is re-created for comparison in Fig-
ure 2 (Left). To test for trends in gas cooling over pho-
"toelectric heating, we calculate the [C II]/PAH ratio as a"
"function of ΣIR, shown in Figure 2 (Right), color coded"
by log G/nH which scales linearly with IR surface den-
"sity above log ΣIR/[L� kpc
−2]∼ 10.7 (Dı́az-Santos et al."
2017). Whereas the [C II]/LIR ratio exhibits a maximum
"deficit of ∼ 2 dex between log ΣIR/[L� kpc−2] = 8 − 13,
the [C II]/PAH ratio falls by a factor of ∼ 0.5 dex over
the same range. LIRGs at low ΣIR exhibit [C II]/LIR
and [C II]/PAH ratios comparable to those found in the"
spatially-resolved regions of NGC 1097 (Beirão et al.
"2012), and the normal star-forming galaxies in Helou"
et al. (2001).
"Following Dı́az-Santos et al. (2017), we fit a second-"
order polynomial function to the [C II]/PAH ratio of the
"log(Lline/LIR) = a0 + a1 log ΣIR + a2 (log ΣIR)
2 (1)"
Note that the function is forced to a constant maximum
at values of ΣIR less than where the turn-over occurs.
While we do not include normal star-forming galaxies
"in the fit, a constant line-to-PAH ratio below the turn-"
over yields the best agreement with observations of low
"ΣIR galaxies (e.g., Helou et al. 2001; Beirão et al. 2012;"
Croxall et al. 2012). The best-fit is shown as a black
"solid line in Fig. 2 (Right), the parameters for which"
are given in Table 1. While the [C II]/PAH ratio is
"not constant, the magnitude of the drop with ΣIR is"
significantly less.
"In addition to [C II], [O I] and [Si II] are important"
PDR cooling lines in terms of their overall contribution
"to the cooling budget (e.g., Rosenberg et al. 2015), and"
their strengths relative to the PAH emission are a di-
agnostic of PDR structure. Large [O I]/PAH ratios
where [C II]/PAH is low could indicate greater gas densi-
"ties, which would preferentially cool through the higher"
"critical density [O I] line. In Figure 3, we show the"
"[C II]/PAH, [O I]/PAH, and [Si II]/PAH ratios in sepa-"
rate panels for LIRGs and ULIRGs as a function of ΣIR.
Because we are comparing different fine-structure cool-
ing lines here and would like to focus on the PDR emis-
"sion alone, we subtract out the non-PDR component of"
"the [C II] emission using fPDR (e.g., Dı́az-Santos et al."
"2017). At low IR surface densities, the line-to-PAH ra-"
tios are consistent with spatially-resolved measurements

4.2. The Photoelectric Efficiency
The photoelectric efficiency (�PE) is the fraction of
energy that photoelectrons from PAHs transfer from
UV photons into the gas relative to the total heating
"of dust. Observationally, �PE can be traced by the ra-"
tio of far-IR line emission to total PAH emission be-
cause photoelectrons from PAHs are one of the dom-
"inant heating mechanisms in PDRs, which cool pre-"
"dominantly via far-IR fine-structure line emission (e.g.,"
Bakes & Tielens 1994; Malhotra et al. 2001; Croxall
"et al. 2012; Beirão et al. 2012). In practice, the cool-"
"ing budget is dominated by [C II], [O I], and [Si II],"
"and LPAH�(L[C II]+L[O I]+L[Si II]). Assuming that the
PAHs and ions are co-spatial such that the energy input"
"into the gas by photoelectric heating powers the [C II],"
"[O I], and [Si II] lines, an empirical tracer of the photo-"
electric efficiency is
"�PE ≈
L[C II] + L[O I] + L[Si II]"
"LPAH
(2)"
where the relative contribution of far-IR lines to �PE can
vary across the PDR (Kaufman et al. 2006). Neverthe-
"less, combined observations of these features capture an"
average �PE of PDRs over a galaxy.
We measure the average �PE for 152 GOALS star-
"forming galaxies including five upper limits, and show"
"the combined sum of neutral [C II], [O I], and [Si II]"
cooling over LPAH in Figure 4. A Kendall’s τ test sup-
"ports an anti-correlation between �PE and ΣIR at ∼ 5σ
(see Table 2). As shown in Fig. 4, LIRGs at low ΣIR
exhibit fairly constant photoelectric efficiencies compa-"
rable to observations of normal star-forming galaxies
"(Beirão et al. 2012; Croxall et al. 2012). At high ΣIR,"
the sum of all cooling lines relative to the PAHs shows a

trends observed in LIRGs and ULIRGs to low ΣIR. While the fraction of cooling-to-heating in [C II] falls in the most compact
systems, [O I]/PAH remains relatively constant over ΣIR in (U)LIRGs. The lack of a positive trend between [O I]/PAH and
ΣIR suggests that [O I] cooling does not compensate for the negative trends observed in the other features."
"decreasing photoelectric efficiency, which suggests that"
the net cooling to photoelectric heating ratio is falling
across the density and temperature structure of PDRs
"in compact objects. The relative contributions of [C II],"
"[O I], and [Si II] to the cooling budget within PDRs"
"(i.e., the numerator of Eq. 2) are on average 32%, 20%,"
"and 48% respectively, and these values do not change"
significantly when splitting the sample above and be-
"low log ΣIR/[L� kpc
−2]= 10.7. Therefore, low photo-"
electric efficiencies are the product of overall less cooling
in PDRs in all channels relative to PAH heating.
The anti-correlation between �PE and ΣIR is robust
"against outliers, as demonstrated by the bootstrap fits"
"on Figure 4. Nevertheless, there exist galaxies devi-"
"ating from the trend by more than ±2σ that warrant
closer inspection. At all IR surface densities, objects"
in this class collectively have higher mean and median
"fAGN,MIR compared to the rest of the sample. Thus, the"
scatter above and below the best-fit trend may be par-
tially due to sources with an excess of hot dust contin-
uum emission in their mid-IR spectra. This may be due
"to a weak, deeply buried AGN, even in sources where"
"LIR is dominated by star formation, which in turn may"
change the ionization structure and the PAH proper-
ties (Voit 1992; Langer & Pineda 2015; Langer et al.
"2017). Alternatively, these objects may harbor heav-"
ily obscured star-forming regions with high levels of line
self-absorption and/or continuum opacities. This ab-
"sorption should appear in the PACS line profiles, but"
only 12 GOALS sources show evidence for absorption
in the [O I] line (Dı́az-Santos et al. 2017). We note
"that the detection of these signatures, presumably due"
"to compact (narrow velocity) foreground clouds, may be"
"limited by the coarse spectral resolution (∼ 85 km s−1)
of Herschel/PACS (Gerin et al. 2015)."
The photoelectric efficiencies we measure represent av-
erages over the local properties of PDRs in the central
"(∼ 2 − 7 kpc) star-forming regions of luminous infrared
galaxies, and the trend in Fig. 4 suggests a departure"
from the typical ISM and PDR conditions at high ΣIR.
"Indeed, galaxies in this domain with low �PE also have"
"the largest ratios of G/nH, which is also sensitive to"
the local physics of PDRs. We fit Equation 1 to the
"data, the parameters of which are given in Table 1,"
and find that the photoelectric efficiency turns over at
"log ΣIR/[L� kpc
−2]∼ 10.5, close to where G/nH scales"
linearly with logΣIR (Dı́az-Santos et al. 2017). Models of
heating and cooling in PDRs predict an anti-correlation
between G/nH and �PE as the size and charge of dust
"grains are modified by the stellar radiation field (e.g.,"
"Bakes & Tielens 1994; Tielens 2008), a trend which we"
"recover in Figure 5 at high (∼ 6σ) significance (see Tab.
2). We find general agreement between modeled and"
"measured �PE for Tgas = 50 − 1000 K, reasonable val-
ues for temperatures across the phase structure of PDRs"
"(e.g., Tielens & Hollenbach 1985; Bakes & Tielens 1994;"
"Draine & Bertoldi 1996), and the two sets of models"
are able to account for the range in �PE we measure in
GOALS. The most extreme ULIRGs at high ΣIR and low
�PE also show the highest values of log (G/nH) & 0.25

5. DISCUSSION
"In this work, we find that the cooling-to-heating ra-"
tios observed in the most compact luminous infrared
"galaxies are low, and are accompanied by an increase in"
the mean energy density per H atom (G/nH) incident
upon the surfaces of PDRs. The IR surface density is
"a global property of a galaxy, and both �PE and G/nH
measure the average physical conditions local to the"
"PDRs. The trends between �PE, G/nH, and ΣIR suggest"
a link between the global properties of a starburst and
the conditions of individual star-forming regions.

only ∼ 75% of the total power in PAHs for GOALS (see Sect.

for this difference. The shaded grey region corresponds to
G/nH typical of the cold, diffuse ISM. Open symbols corre-

PDRs."
contribute to the [C II] and [Si II] line fluxes owing to
their ionization potentials being lower than that of neu-
tral hydrogen. This is unlikely to drive trends in our
"sample, as the photoelectric efficiency does not correlate"
with the fraction of [C II] emission from PDRs (fPDR;
"Tab. 2). Moreover, the neutral PDR fraction of [Si II]"
"would have to be larger at low ΣIR or smaller at high ΣIR

emit more energy per unit dust mass because of the large
UV opacities of grains (Li & Draine 2001). If the PAHs
"and ions (C+, O, and Si+) were de-coupled spatially,"
LPAH could increase with ΣIR without a correspond-
"ing increase in (L[C II]+L[O I]+L[Si II]), lowering the ob-"
"served IR line-to-PAH ratio by Eq. 2. However, this"
spatial decoupling of PAHs and ions is inconsistent with
observations of PDRs in the Milky Way (Okada et al.
"2013; Salgado et al. 2016), the LMC (Lebouteiller et al."
"2012; Chevance et al. 2016), and local galaxies (Croxall"
et al. 2012; Abdullah et al. 2017; Bigiel et al. 2020). (4)
Metallicity may influence the strength of cooling lines
and the PAHs (Cormier et al. 2015; Smith et al. 2017;
Croxall et al. 2017; Cormier et al. 2019; Aniano et al.
"2020). However, direct effects on the PAH grains appear"
most pronounced at metallicities well below those seen
"in GOALS galaxies, which typically have Z/Z� ∼ 1 − 2
(Inami et al. 2013; Dı́az-Santos et al. 2017). Therefore,"
the trends observed in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 likely reflect
variations in the heating and cooling mechanisms on the
scale of individual PDRs.
5.2. Dust Grain Properties and the Photoelectric
Efficiency
The photoelectric efficiency is not only a function of
"G/nH, but also the size and ionization state of PAH"
grains (Bakes & Tielens 1994; Galliano et al. 2008; Tie-
lens 2008). Observations of PDRs in the Milky Way
indicate that �PE falls as the grain charging parameter
"(γ ≡ G0T1/2/ne) rises, and grains become more ionized"
(Tielens 2008; Okada et al. 2013; Salgado et al. 2016).
"Indeed, the models of Bakes & Tielens (1994) shown in"
"Figure 5 predict low �PE at high G/nH, and the data"
falls closer to the model with a grain size distribution
"weighted more towards larger grains. Thus, a link be-"
tween PAH properties and �PE is to be expected if the
decrease in �PE at high ΣIR arises from a change in the
local physics of gas heating in PDRs as mediated by the
charge and size of PAHs.
"Ratios between the 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3µm PAH"
lines are well-established as tracers of grain size and
"ionization (e.g., Draine & Li 2001; Tielens 2008), and"
"local LIRGs exhibit comparable ratios to nearby, nor-"
mal star-forming galaxies and high-z ULIRGs (Stier-
walt et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2007; Pope et al. 2008;
"Wu et al. 2010; Shipley et al. 2013). For example,"
star-forming LIRGs cluster tightly in L6.2µm/L7.7µm vs.
"L11.3µm/L7.7µm, tracing grain size and ionization re-"
"spectively, which show a larger scatter in sources with"
AGN (Stierwalt et al. 2014).
"Figure 6 shows �PE as a function of the L11.3µm/L7.7µm
ratio, a tracer of grain charge, and the L7.7µm/L6.2µm
ratio, a tracer of the average cationic grain size (Draine"
"& Li 2001). We do not detect a correlation between �PE
and the grain ionization state at a significant confidence"
"level (Tab. 2); however, �PE and L7.7µm/L6.2µm are"
"anti-correlated at a ∼ 4σ confidence level, albeit with
large scatter, suggesting that that the average size of"
PAH grains may influence the observed photoelectric
"efficiencies in local (U)LIRGs, consistent with the sen-"
sitivity of theoretical photoelectric efficiencies on the
grain size distribution (Fig. 5).
Smaller PAH grains emit more strongly in the shorter
"wavelength bands, whereas larger grains are brighter at"
longer wavelengths (Allamandola et al. 1989; Schutte
"et al. 1993; Draine & Li 2001). Thus, the diagnostic"
utility of a PAH line ratio as a grain-size indicator is
a function of the separation in wavelength of the two
features. The 7.7/6.2µm ratio has been a wide-spread
tool in the literature as both features are bright in ex-
"tragalactic sources, relatively unaffected by the 9.7µm"
"silicate ice feature, and were observable simultaneously"
with IRS aboard Spitzer (Draine & Li 2001; O’Dowd
et al. 2009; Sandstrom et al. 2012; Stierwalt et al. 2014).
"With the advent of AKARI/IRC, the 3.3µm PAH fea-"
ture became accessible for large numbers of extragalactic
sources while unlocking a longer baseline diagnostic of
grain size.
The ratio of 11.3µm to 3.3µm PAH intensity is one of
the most robust tracers of PAH grain size because of the
large baseline in wavelength (Allamandola et al. 1989;
Jourdain de Muizon et al. 1990; Schutte et al. 1993; Mori
et al. 2012; Ricca et al. 2012; Croiset et al. 2016; Maragk-
oudakis et al. 2020). Using the available AKARI spectra
"in GOALS, we plot �PE vs. L11.3µm/L3.3µm in Figure"
7 to further test if low �PE is associated with larger or
smaller PAHs. We find that galaxies in the AKARI
sub-sample of GOALS with low �PE show systematically
higher values of 11.3/3.3µm PAH emission (Tab. 2).
This trend is not driven by systematic variations in the
"11.3µm feature strength, as the L11.3µm/LPAH ratio is"
"constant over the range in L11.3µm/L3.3µm, and exhibits"
"minimal 1σ scatter of 0.05 dex about the average (Fig. 7,"
"bottom panel). Instead, the strength of the 3.3µm fea-"
tures relative to LPAH decreases dramatically by nearly
"an order of magnitude (Fig. 7, center panel). The anti-"
correlation between �PE and L11.3µm/L3.3µm reinforces
the importance of the mean grain size in dictating the
observed photoelectric efficiency.
5.3. Physical Interpretation
The photoelectric heating efficiency of PAHs falls as
"the number of carbon atoms per particle increases (e.g.,"
"Bakes & Tielens 1994), and small grains are preferen-"
tially destroyed in the presence of harsh radiation fields
"(e.g., Jochims et al. 1994). This provides a simple phys-"
ical interpretation of the data presented so far: PDRs
"in the most compact starbursts (log ΣIR/[L� kpc
−2]&"
"10.7) have, on average, more intense radiation fields per"
"gas density (Dı́az-Santos et al. 2017), which leads to"
"a preferential destruction of the smallest PAH grains,"
raising the average grain size and leaving behind large

PAHs capable of releasing both less and weaker photo-
electrons. This decreases the energy of a typical photo-
"electron available to heat the gas, and results in a lower"
gas heating efficiency.
This scenario is consistent with principles of PDR evo-
lution. The strength of the radiation field impinging
"upon PDRs (i.e., G) is inversely proportional to the dis-"
tance between the ionization front and the ionizing pho-
"ton source (Kaufman et al. 1999). Therefore, higher val-"
ues of G/nH are associated with younger PDR systems
"that have yet to evolve away from their host star, and"
are more likely to be found in galaxies with higher star-
"formation rate surface densities (e.g., Dı́az-Santos et al."
2017). The low photoelectric efficiencies at high ΣIR are
"plausibly linked to higher fractions of young, short-lived,"
"and dust-cocooned star-forming regions, where the high"
"ratios of G/nH destroy small dust grains, hindering the"
coupling between the radiation field strength and PDR
gas temperatures. Such PDRs may be continuously re-
plenished by the compaction of gas and dust during a
major merger (Sanders et al. 1988; Hopkins et al. 2008).
"Indeed, the majority of late-stage mergers (80%) are"
"above log ΣIR/[L� kpc
−2]∼ 10.7 (Stierwalt et al. 2013;"
"Dı́az-Santos et al. 2017), where photoelectric efficiencies"
are low.
"As shown in Figure 8, the L11.3µm/L7.7µm and"
L11.3µm/L3.3µm ratios in LIRGs and ULIRGs are con-
sistent with predominantly ionized PAHs containing on
"average ∼ 60 − 150 C atoms per particle when com-
pared to the modeled PAH spectra of Maragkoudakis"
"et al. (2020)2. PAHs with NC . 40 tend to be photo-
destroyed in PDRs (Jochims et al. 1994), which is close"
to the lower bound on grain sizes we observe for LIRGs
and ULIRGs in Fig. 8. Other mechanisms for grain de-
struction include shock-induced fragmentation and/or
"shattering; however, interstellar shocks tend to destroy"
larger grains which is the opposite effect we see in the
"data (Jones et al. 1996). Therefore, G/nH may be a crit-"
ical factor for determining the photoelectric efficiency
in (U)LIRGs with the grain size distribution acting as
"an intermediary between the radiation field, and gas"
cooling and heating.
5.4. Prospects for Star-Formation at High-Redshift
The rise and fall of the cosmic star-formation rate den-
sity may be accompanied by an increase in the efficiency
"of star-formation at earlier times, although this remains"
"a subject of debate (e.g., Lilly et al. 1996; Madau et al."
"1996; Madau & Dickinson 2014; Tacconi et al. 2010,"

"2013, 2018; Genzel et al. 2015; Scoville et al. 2017b; Liu"
"et al. 2019; Decarli et al. 2019). Nevertheless, starbursts"
above the main-sequence have higher star-formation ef-
ficiencies (star-formation rate per unit molecular gas
"mass) than normal galaxies, independent of redshift"
(Saintonge et al. 2013; Genzel et al. 2015; Scoville et al.
2017b). Can changes in the global star-formation effi-
"ciency of a galaxy, with redshift and/or distance from"
"the main-sequence, be linked to variations in the ISM"
conditions on small scales?
Given that photoelectric heating is the dominant cou-
pling mechanism between gas temperatures and stellar
"radiation fields, �PE could play a role in mediating the"
star-formation efficiency today and in the past by rais-
ing or lowering the energy transfer from stellar photons
"into the gas. When the photoelectric efficiency is low,"
photo-electrons convert a lower fraction of the incident
radiation field into raising the gas temperature. In other
"words, gas may remain cold despite overall less cooling"
relative to photoelectric heating because the mechanism
by which gas heats in the first place is weak at low
"�PE. This may be more common at earlier times, be-"
cause normal star-forming galaxies at high-redshift are
more compact than local galaxies at a given stellar mass
(Buitrago et al. 2008; Conselice 2014; van der Wel et al.
"2014; Mowla et al. 2019), and ΣIR anti-correlates with"
"�PE. In addition, efficient star-formation in the thick"
"disks of high−z dusty, star-forming galaxies could con-
tain a number of star-forming regions that each resem-"
"ble the central regions of local (U)LIRGs (e.g., Tacconi"
et al. 2008; Bothwell et al. 2010; Stacey et al. 2010; Bris-
"bin et al. 2015), in which case high G/nH and low �PE
could be common in PDRs across a high−z starburst.
These conditions may play a more important role at"
high-redshift as the contribution of ULIRGs to the to-
tal star-formation rate density increases from z = 0 to
"z = 2 by a factor of ∼ 21 (Murphy et al. 2011).
Recent efforts to combine mid- and far-IR measure-"
"ments of gas heating and cooling at z ∼ 1 − 2 are
largely limited to handfuls of ULIRGs with archival"
Spitzer/IRS spectra (Brisbin et al. 2015; McKinney
"et al. 2020). Using ALMA, McKinney et al. (2020) com-"
"pared the [C II] and 6.2µm PAH emission for GS IRS20,"
"a luminous, compact starburst galaxy at z = 1.9239 and"
found a low [C II]/6.2µm ratio at high IR surface density
that could indicate a low photoelectric efficiency. This
"galaxy has a L[C II]/L11.3 ratio of 0.11, which would cor-"
"respond to a 11.3/3.3µm ratio of 21.5 if z ∼ 2 galaxies
follow similar scaling relations between the PAH fea-"
tures and [C II] as in local (U)LIRGs. If this is the
"case, then GS IRS20 would have a 3.3µm PAH flux of"
"7 × 10−17 W m−2, which can be easily detected in un-
der 15 minutes by JWST/MIRI. While MIRI will be"
"excellent at measuring bright PAH lines at high−z, our
ability to probe much of the rest-frame mid and far-"
"IR regime at high−z remains limited. Future facilities,
such as the Origins Space Telescope3, a proposed flag-"
ship mission covering the near-far infrared with power-
"ful imaging and spectroscopic capabilities and a large,"
"cold telescope, would be a powerful tool for measuring"
"the full energy budget in distant star-forming galaxies,"
and testing the idea that the star-formation efficiency is
linked to the balance of gas cooling and heating.
6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
We combine observations of PAH emission with mea-
"surements of the far-infrared fine-structure [C II], [O I],"
and [Si II] lines to infer the properties of gas heating and
"cooling in local, star-forming, luminous infrared galax-"
ies. The ratio of IR cooling lines to PAH emission traces
"the photoelectric efficiency, �PE, and measures the cou-"
pling between stellar radiation field and gas tempera-
tures in photodissociation regions (PDRs). Our main
conclusions are:
3 https://origins.ipac.caltech.edu/
"1. In local LIRGs, the ratio of [C II] to PAH emission"
"does not correlate with LIR or far-IR color, both"
of which trace a mix of the diffuse and PDR dust.
2. We find an anti-correlation between [C II]/PAH
and IR surface density (ΣIR) where the most com-
pact ULIRGs have low ratios of [C II] cooling to
PAH emission compared to normal star-forming
"galaxies by ∼ 0.5 dex. The [C II]/PAH ra-
tio exhibits less overall scatter in GOALS than"
"L[C II]/LIR, as well as a lower magnitude of decline"
between low- and high-ΣIR galaxies.
3. [Si II]/PAH and [O I]/PAH exhibit constant ratios
"up to the most compact ULIRGs, were some ob-"
"jects fall below the average value by a factor of ∼ 5
in both line ratios. Notably, [O I]/PAH does not"
increase when [C II]/PAH is low: enhanced cooling
via the [O I] channel is not sufficient to compen-
sate for the deficiencies observed in the [C II] line
when considering the total cooling budget.
"4. We measure the photoelectric efficiency as (L[C II]
+L[O I]+L[Si II])/LPAH, which is a factor of ∼ 3
lower in galaxies with log ΣIR/[L� kpc"
"−2]> 10.7,"
which also have high ratios of UV radiation field
strength to neutral hydrogen density (G/nH).
Compact ULIRGs have low photoelectric efficien-
"cies and more extreme ISM conditions, indicating"
a link between the large-scale energy density of a
starburst and the gas cooling and heating proper-
ties on PDR scales.
5. LIRGs with low photoelectric efficiencies have high
"ratios of 11.3 to 3.3µm PAH emission, a tracer of"
the mean PAH grain size. We estimate typical
"grain sizes of NC ∼ 60− 150 C atoms per grain in
LIRGs, and find that the PAHs are predominantly"
"ionized. Large, ionized grains produce both less"
"and weaker photo-electrons, which may contribute"
to the low photoelectric efficiencies in the most
compact ULIRGs if small grains are preferentially
destroyed. Spectral signatures of grain emission
can be used to understand the role played by dust
in regulating the star-formation of galaxies.
The photoelectric efficiency may be key for regulating
"the evolution of the ISM, and can influence the overall"
star-formation efficiency by mediating the coupling be-
tween stellar radiation fields and gas temperatures. The
"trends between �PE, ΣIR, and G/nH reflect vigorous,"
compact star-formation where dusty and young PDRs
exhibit less efficient gas heating. Low photoelectric
efficiencies may be common in the high-redshift Uni-
"verse where compact star-formation is ubiquitous, and"
https://origins.ipac.caltech.edu/
may also contribute to changes in the star-formation effi-
ciency. The link between the efficiency of star-formation
and the cooling/heating balance will be further tested
"with JWST and ALMA, but ultimately a large space-"
based IR telescope like Origins is needed to measure
the mid and far-infrared emission and track the full en-
ergy budget in star-forming galaxies over a significant
fraction of cosmic time.
