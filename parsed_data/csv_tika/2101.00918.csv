ABSTRACT
"New time-series analysis tools are needed in disciplines as diverse as astronomy, economics
and meteorology. In particular, the increasing rate of data collection at multiple wavelengths
requires new approaches able to handle these data. The panchromatic correlated indices K(s)"
( f i)
"and L(s)
(p f c)"
"are adapted to quantify the smoothness of a phased light-curve resulting in new
period-finding methods applicable to single- and multi-band data. Simulations and observa-
tional data are used to test our approach. The results were used to establish an analytical
equation for the amplitude of the noise in the periodogram for different false alarm proba-
bility values, to determine the dependency on the signal-to-noise ratio, and to calculate the
yield-rate for the different methods. The proposed method has similar efficiency to that found
for the String Length period method. The effectiveness of the panchromatic and flux indepen-
dent period finding methods in single waveband as well as multiple-wavebands that share a
fundamental frequency is also demonstrated in real and simulated data."

1 INTRODUCTION
"If the brightness variations of a variable star are periodic, one can
fold the sparsely sampled light-curve with that period and inspect
the magnitude as a function of phase plot. This will be equiva-
lent to all the measurements of the star brightness taken within
one period. The shape of the phased light-curve and the period al-
low one to determine the physical nature of variability (pulsations,
eclipses, stellar activity, etc.). If the light-curve is folded with a
wrong period, the magnitude measurements will be all over the
place rather than align into a smoothly varying function of the
phase. Other methods figure out the best period fitting a specific
model into the phased light curve, like a sine function. The most
common methods used in astronomy are the following: the Deem-
ing method (Deeming 1975), phase dispersion minimization (PDM
- Stellingwerf 1978; Dupuy & Hoffman 1985), string length mini-
mization (SLM - Lafler & Kinman 1965; Dworetsky 1983; Stetson
1996; Clarke 2002), information entropy (Cincotta et al. 1995), the
analysis of variance (ANOVA - Schwarzenberg-Czerny 1996), and
the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and its extension using error bars
(LS and LSG - Lomb 1976; Scargle 1982; Zechmeister & Kürster
2009). All of these methods require as input the minimum fre-
quency ( fmin), the maximum frequency ( fmax), and the sampling"

"frequency (or the number of frequencies tested - N f req). The in-
put parameters and their constraints to determine reliable variability
detections were addressed by Ferreira Lopes et al. (2018), where a
summary of recommendations on how to determine the sampling
frequency and the characteristic period and amplitude of the de-
tected variations is provided. From these constraints, a good period
finding method should find all periodic features if the time series
has enough measurements covering nearly all variability phases
(Carmo et al. 2020)."
"Light curve shape, non-Gaussianity of noise, non-uniformities
in the data spacing, and multiple periodicities modify the signifi-
cance of the periodogram and to increase completeness and relia-
bility, more than one period finding method is usually applied to
the data (e.g. Angeloni et al. 2012; Ferreira Lopes et al. 2015a,c).
The capability to identify the ""true"" period is increased by using
several methods (see Sect. 4.3). However, this does not prevent the
appearance of spurious results. Therefore, new insights into signal
detection which provide more reliable results are welcome mainly
when the methods provide dissimilar periods. Moreover, the chal-
lenge of big-data analysis would benefit a lot from a single and
reliable detection and characterization method. The present paper
is part of a series of studies performed in the project called New In-
sight into Time Series Analysis (NITSA), where all steps to mining
photometric data on variable stars are being reviewed. The selec-
tion criteria were reviewed and improved (Ferreira Lopes & Cross"

"2016, 2017), optimized parameters to search and analyse periodic
signals were introduced (Ferreira Lopes et al. 2018), and now new
frequency finding methods are proposed to increase our inventory
of tools to create and optimize automatic procedures to analyse
photometric surveys. The outcome of this project is crucial if we are
to efficiently select the most complete and reliable sets of variable
stars in surveys like the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV -
Minniti et al. 2010; Angeloni et al. 2014), Gaia (Perryman 2005),
the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS - Ricker et al.
2015), the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response Sys-
tem (Pan-STARRS - Chambers et al. 2016), a high-cadence All-
sky Survey System (ATLAS - Tonry et al. 2018), Zwicky Transient
Facility (ZTF - Bellm et al. 2019) as well as the next generation of
surveys like PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO -
Rauer et al. 2014) and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST -
Ivezic et al. 2008)."
"Many efforts are being performed to generalize for multi-
band data the period finding methods. Süveges et al. (2012) utilized
the principal component analysis to optimally extract the best pe-
riod using multi-band data. However, the multi-band observations
must be taken simultaneously that impose an important limitation
to the method. On the other hand, VanderPlas & Ivezić (2015) in-
troduces a general extension of the Lomb-Scargle method while
Mondrik et al. (2015) for the ANOVA from single band algorithm
to multiple bands not necessarily taken simultaneously. Indeed,
methods combining the results from two different classes of period-
determination algorithms are also being reached (Saha & Vivas
2017). The current paper adds one piece to this puzzle. Section 2.1
describes the new set of periodic signal detection methods as well
as their limitations and constraints. Next, numerical simulations are
used to test our approach in Sect. 3. From this, the efficiency rate
and the fractional fluctuation of noise (FFN) are determined. Real
data are also used to support our final results (see Sect. 4). Finally,
our conclusions are presented in Sect. 5."
2 PANCHROMATIC AND FLUX INDEPENDENT
FREQUENCY FINDING METHODS
"The Welch-Stetson variability index Stetson (1996) was gener-
alized and new ones were performed by Ferreira Lopes & Cross
(2016). From where the panchromatic and flux independent vari-
ability indices were proposed. These indices are used to discrim-
inate variable stars from noise. To summarise, the panchromatic
index is related to the correlation amplitude (or correlation height)
while the second one computes the correlation sign, i.e. if the cor-
relation value is negative or positive without taking into account the
amplitude. The flux independent index provides correlation infor-
mation that is weakly dependent on the amplitude or the presence
of outliers. These features enable us to reduce the misclassifica-
tion rate and improve the selection criteria. Moreover, this param-
eter is designed to compute correlation values among two or more
observations. The correlation order (s), gives the number of obser-
vations correlated together, i.e., s = 2 means correlation computed
between pairs of observations and s = 3 means that correlations are
computed on triplets. However, these observations must be close in
time, i.e., those observations are taken in an a interval time smaller
much less than the main variability period. Inaccurate or incorrect
outputs will be obtained if this restriction is not enforced. There-
fore, the data sets and sources with observations close in time were
named as correlated-data otherwise non-correlated-data."
The efficiency rate to detect variable stars is maximised using
"the panchromatic and flux independent variability indices when the
number of correlations is increased, i.e when there is a strong vari-
ability between bins, but only slight differences between the mea-
surements in each correlation bin. These variability indices only
use those measurements that are close in time (i.e., a time interval
much smaller than the variability period) and hence this constraint
substantially reduced the number of possible correlations for sparse
data. If we consider a light-curve folded on its true variability pe-
riod, with little noise, we could calculate these indices using stan-
dard correlated observations grouped in time, missing the observa-
tions where too few meet the criteria of having at least s closer than
∆T in time. Alternatively, all measurements can be used to com-
pute the indices if the observations are grouped by phase instead
of time. It is the main idea to support the Panchromatic and flux
independent frequency finding methods."
"For the main variability period, the observations closed in
phase should return strong correlation values. Since many variable
stars show most variation as a function of phase, and little variation
from period to period, recalculating the indices this way should re-
turn indices that are as strong as those grouped by time. On the
other hand, if the light-curve is folded on an incorrect period and
the calculated phase is no longer a useful correlation measure, so
correlations will be weaker, much like adding more noise to the
data. The statistics considered in this paper are unlikely to be useful
for data with multiple periodicities or if noise keeps its autocorre-
lation for phased data. In the next section, we propose an approach
to compute the panchromatic and flux independent indices in phase
and hence provide a new period finding method."
"Be aware that, the definition of expected noise performed by
Ferreira Lopes et al. (2015a) needs to be corrected, as pointed by
the referee of the current paper. The authors provided the cor-
rect theoretical definition of expected noise but the mathematical
expression was incorrect. In the case of statistically independent
events, the probability that a given event will occur is obtained by
dividing the number of events of the given type by the total number
of possible events, according to the authors. There will always be
2 desired permutations (either all positive or all negative) for any s
value. However, the total number of events is 2s, not s2 as defined
by the authors. The correct definition for expected noise value is
then given by,"
"Ps =
2
2s
= 2(1−s) (1)"
"The relative differences between the old and new definition
for s = 2 and s = 4 are zero while for s = 3 is ∼ 11%. However, for
s values larger than 4 these differences increase considerably. The
authors have only used the noise definitions to set the noise level
for s values smaller than 4, so far. Therefore, this mistake has not
provided any significant error in the results of the authors to date."
2.1 New frequency finding methods
"In common to other frequency finding methods, in our approach the
light curve data are folded with a number of trial frequencies (pe-
riods). The trial frequency that produces the smallest scatter in the
phase diagram according to some criteria is taken as the estimate
of the real period of variations. In our approach we combine data
from multiple bands with special transformations and characterize
the phase diagram scatter using variability indices calculated from
correlations of the phases (rather than correlations in the observa-
tion times, as they were used in previous works). The even-statistic"

"(for more details see Paper II- Ferreira Lopes & Cross 2017) was
used to calculate the mean, median and deviation values. It only re-
quires that the data must have even number of measurements (and
if there is an odd number, the median value is not used) while the
equations to compute these parameters are equal to the previous
ones. This statement will be more important when the data has only
a few measurements. On the other hand, these parameters assume
equal values to the previous ones when the data has even number
of measurements and they are quite similar for large data samples
(typically bigger than 100)."
"Consider a generic time series observed in multiple wave-
bands with observations not necessarily taken simultaneously in
each band. This could also mean a time series of the same sources
taken by different instruments in single or multi-wavelength obser-
vations. The sub-index w is used to denote each waveband. Using
this notation, all data are listed in a single table where the ith obser-
vation is"

surements, yi,w is the even-mean computed using those observa-
tions inside of a 3σ clipped absolute even-median deviation (for
more details see Paper II- Ferreira Lopes & Cross 2017), and σi,w
denotes the flux errors of waveband w. One should note that
greater success in searching for signals in multi-band light curves
is found when a penalty and an offset between the bands are used
(for more detail see Long et al. 2014; VanderPlas & Ivezić 2015;
Mondrik et al. 2015). However, these modifications require a more
complex model since more constraints need to be added. For our
purpose, we suppose that all wavebands used are well populated in
order to provide a good estimation of the mean value."
"The vector given by

"values contains data measured
in either a single or multi-wavebands. For instance, w assumes a
single value if a single waveband is used. Therefore the w sub-index
is only useful to discriminate different wavebands and to compute
the δi,w. To simplify, the w subindex is suppressed in the follow-
ing steps. Therefore, the notation regarding all observations (N),
observed in single or multi-wavebands by a single or different tele-
scopes, is given by [(t1, δ1), (t2, δ2), · · · , (tN, δN)]. From which, the
panchromatic (PL(s)) and flux independent (PK(s)) period finding

"One should be aware that δi,w values are strongly dependent on
the average and hence incorrect values can be found for Algol type
variable stars and time-series which have outliers, for example. In
order to more accurately measure the average value only those ob-
servations within three times the absolute even-median deviations
of the even-median were used to do this. Additionally, Λ(s) is a bit
different from that proposed for the flux independent variability in-
dices. The current version assumes Λ(s) = 0 if δi = 0 · · · δi+s−1 = 0.
This would produce PK(s) and PL(s) equal zero in the trivial case of
all observations being exactly equal, e.g. a noiseless non-variable
example, i.e., yi = y j for all i values (see two last panels of Fig. 2)."
2.2 The maximum PK(s) considering different signals
"The maximum value allowed for the PK(s) parameter considering
the true variability frequency (ftrue) of a signal is limited by the
number of measurements which lead to Λ(s) = −1, i.e., the min-
imum number of times that one of the consecutive phase obser-
vations has a value on the opposite side of the even-mean (N(c)).
This restriction limits the maximum value achievable by PK(s)"

"also varies with the order, s, since the num-"
"ber of Λ(s) = −1 corresponding to observations on opposite sides of
the even-mean varies with s. Indeed, N(c) depends on the shape of
the signal. For instance, N(c) = 1 for a line, N(c) = 2 for a sinusoidal
signal, N(c) = 4 for a eclipsing binary light curve. Moreover, if a set
of measurements is given by a line y = ax+ b (a , 0), the number
of negative correlation measurements will be N−(min) = 1 for s = 2,"
"N−(min) = 2 for s = 3, and N
−
(min) = 3 for s = 4. Therefore, N"
"−
(min), and"
"hence the maximum PK(s) value, varies with s. These considera-
tions can be expressed as following N−"

"A similar analytic equation for PL(s) index is not possible
since it depends on the amplitude. On the other hand, two features
of PK(s) can be seen in Eq. 7. First, PK(s)"
"(max)
values computed for"
"two time-series having the same N−

"value but a different number
of observations differ (see Fig. 1). Second, all frequencies close to
ftrue produce PK"
"(s) ≃ PK

", since N >> N−

". These frequen-
cies include the sub-harmonic frequencies of ftrue. Indeed, ftrue will
always return the PK(s)"
"(max)
value for time-series models or signals"
"without noise (see blue lines on Fig. 2). However, when noise is
included, statistical fluctuations can lead to the wrong identifica-
tion of ftrue. This means that the PK"
"(s) and consequently PL(s) pa-
rameters can return a main frequency that implies a smooth phase
diagram but is different to ftrue."
"The values of N(c) and therefore N
−
(min)"
"depend on the arrange-
ment of observations around the even-mean and are intrinsically
related to the signal-to-noise as discussed above (see Fig. 2). For
instance, the detached eclipsing binary (EA) signal looks like noise
if only the measurements outside of the eclipse are observed, e.g.
if the phase fraction of the eclipses is . 2"
"N
. This means that the de-"
"tection of the correct period using the PK(s) and PL(s) parameters
will be extremely dependent on the number of observations at the
eclipses. On the other hand, the RR Lyr (RR) objects show a small
dispersion around the even-mean even if the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) is a bit low. To summarize, the PK(s) power will have a peak
for all frequencies which produce smooth phase diagrams, with the
largest spectrum peak corresponding to the smallest N−"
"(min)
. On the"
"other hand, the PK(s)max results in discrete values and so is more de-
generate for a small number of observations."
"Figure 2 shows the phase diagrams for a Cepheid (Ceph), a RR
Lyrae (RR), a RR Lyrae having the Blazhko effect (RRblz), eclips-
ing binaries (EA and EB), a rotational variable (Rot), and two white
noise light curves generated by uniform and normal distributions
(for more details see Sect. 3). One thousand equally spaced phased
measurements where used to plot each model and to compute the
PK(s) shown in each panel (PK(Model)). For these examples, we
normalize amplitude to allow us to separate out the effects of the
morphology of the light curves on these indices. As already men-
tioned, PK(s) is not directly dependent on the amplitude of the sig-
nal, as opposed to PL(s), which is. As expected, the model crosses
the even-mean twice (N−(min) = 2) for the Ceph, RR, RRblz, and Rot"
"models giving PK(2)max = 0.998. For the eclipsing binaries the model
crosses the even-mean four times, implying a PK(2)max = 0.996. Actu-
ally, the EA and EB models have PK(2)max = 0.994 due to fluctuations
of the model about the even-median. Uniform and normal distri-
butions (i.e., time series mimicking noisy data) PK(2)max = γ+ 2"

those measurements within three times the absolute even-median deviation

"where γ is a positive number related with the maximum fluctua-
tion of positive correlations. However, the PK(s)max = 1 only happens
when δi = 0∀ i values, i.e. noiseless non-variation."
"The PL(s) values for the data are biased by the amplitude,
i.e., signals having different amplitudes will provide distinct values.
Consider the index values computed using the data: the EA and EB
signals have the smallest PL(2) values among all model tested due
to their morphology, since the majority of measurements are near"
"MNRAS 000, 1–14 (2018)"
New Insights into Time Series Analysis IV 5
"to the even-mean and hence the peak power is reduced. The Ceph,
RR, and RRblz signals usually have large amplitudes and hence
large PL(2) values. The highest PL(2) values are found for RR and
Ceph signatures since there are a larger fraction of measurements
distant from the even-mean than for the other models. The PL(2)"
"value for RR stars is about half that found for the Rot model. This
is a property related to the morphology of the phase diagram. Fi-
nally, the smallest values are found for pure-noise signals (normal
and uniform distributions)."
"An examination of Eq. 7 can be used to estimate the theo-
retical expected value for any signal type. However, in real data,
where noise is included, the PK(s)max values are smaller (see Fig. 2)
since the values decrease with the increase in the dispersion of indi-
vidual measurements about the even-mean. Therefore, Rot and EA
models have the largest reduction in PK(s)max. In contrast, the small-
est reduction of PK(s)max is found for Ceph and RR models since
the dispersion about even-mean is small. A detailed analysis of the
weight of signal-to-noise ratio on PK(s) for different signal types is
performed in the Sect. 3."
2.3 The optimal s value

tween PK(s) computed on the phase diagram folded using ftrue

"For high-SNR light curves, i.e. N − N+

is directly propor-"
"tional to the SNR while N(c) is the opposite, i.e. the increase of
SNR increases N+"
"ftrue
and decreases N(c). Therefore, for low-SNR"
"N+
ftrue
→ N/2 and hence s(opt) ≈ 1 + N/2 × N(c). However, at the"
"limit, N(c) also tends to N/2 and hence s(opt) ≈ 2. To summarize,
the choice of s value depends on the signal type and SNR since N(c)
and N+"
"ftrue
vary with both parameters. For instance, a large value of"
"N(c) is expected for EA binary systems whatever its SNR and hence
a small s value is recommended to increase the range of signal type
detected. The choice of s value must take all of these properties into
account."
3 NUMERICAL TESTS AND SIMULATIONS
"Artificial variable stars were simulated using a similar set of
models as those produced in paper III (for more details see"
"Ferreira Lopes et al. 2018). Seven simulated time series were cre-
ated that mimic rotational variables (Y(Rot)), detached eclips-
ing binaries (Y(EA)), eclipsing binaries (Y(EB)), pulsating stars
(Y(Ceph), Y(RR), Y(RRblz)), and white noise (Y(Uni f orm) and Y(Normal)).
The Ceph, RR, RRblz, EA, and Rot models were based on
the CoRoT light curves CoRoT-211626074, CoRoT-101370131,
CoRoT-100689962, CoRoT-102738809, and CoRoT-110843734,
respectively. The variability types were previously identified by
Debosscher et al. (2007); Poretti et al. (2015); Paparó et al. (2009);
Chadid et al. (2010); Maciel et al. (2011); Carone et al. (2012) and
(De Medeiros et al. 2013) while the variability period and ampli-
tudes were reviewed by Ferreira Lopes et al. (2018). The models
of variable stars were found using harmonic fits having 12, 12, 12,
24, 24, and 6 coefficients for Ceph, RR, RRblz, EA, EB, and Rot
variable stars, respectively. The white noise simulations given by
a normal distribution were used to determine the fractional fluctu-
ation of noise (FFN). The Ceph, RR, RRblz, EA, and Rot models
were used to realistically test and illustrate our approach."
"The efficiency rate of any frequency finding method depends
mainly on the signal type, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the number
of observations. Therefore, three sets of simulations having 20, 60,
and 100 measurements for an interval of SNR (see Eq. 11) rang-
ing from ∼ 1 to ∼ 20 were created for the models found in Fig.
2. In particular, 20% of measurements were randomly selected at
the eclipses for EA and EB simulations. This is required because
these simulations look like noise if no measurement is found at the
eclipses, and is justified because any light-curves that are processed
with period-finding algorithms in NITSA must already have been
selected as variables, so eclipsing binaries with few measurements
must have a relatively high fraction at the eclipses. There will be
a selection effect against binaries with narrow eclipses, since the
probability of them being detected as variables is reduced. Values
sorted randomly from a normal distribution were used to add noise
to the simulations and the error-bars were set to be the differences
between the model and simulated data. The error bars are not rel-
evant to compute the PK(s) values. However, they are necessary to
determine PL(s) parameters. The SNR was computed as,"
"S NR =
A"
"2.96× eMAD(δy)
(11)"
"where A is the signal amplitude, δy are the residuals (observed mi-
nus its predicted measurement), and eMAD is the even-median
of the absolute deviations from the even-median. The eMAD is
a slight modification of median absolute deviation from median
(MAD). The 2.96× eMAD(δy) is equivalent to two times the stan-
dard deviation but it is a robust estimate of the standard deviation
when outliers are considered (e.g. Hoaglin et al. 1983). For com-
pleteness, other estimates of the SNR where the model is not re-
quired were tested (e.g. Rimoldini 2013). According to our tests,
the latter usually overestimates the SNR compared with those val-
ues computed by Eq. 11."
3.1 Fractional Fluctuation of Noise (FFN)
"The fractional fluctuation of noise for signal detection is related to
the level for which the figure of merit of the methods (e.g., power,
in the classical periodogram) is not expected to exceed more than
a fraction of times due to stochastic variation (or noise) on the in-
put light curve. Indeed, the FFN mimics a false alarm probability
since it sets the power value above which a certain percentage of
spurious signals are found. Indeed, there are many difficulties of"

"where α and β are real positive numbers. β must be larger than Ps

using a normal distribution were run with the number of measure-
ments ranging from 10 to 1000 in order to compute the free param-
eters for Eq. 12. Figure 3 shows the mean values of PK(s) above
which 1% (orange dots), 5% (grey dots), and 10% (blue dots) of
simulated data are found. The FFN(s) models are shown as dashed
lines and the free parameters of the models are presented in Table 1.
The minimum values of FFN(s) are found when N →∞. For this
condition the FFN(s) estimates have values above the noise (see
Table 1). The scatter found for small numbers of measurements
(typically less than 20) is related to the discrete values allowed for
PK(s) (for more details see Ferreira Lopes & Cross 2016). The re-
sults shown in Fig. 3 are quite similar for all uncorrelated zero-
mean noise distributions."

"signals that lead to random phase variations in any survey, whatever
the wavelength observed. This property is related to the weak de-
pendence of PK(s) on amplitude, error bars, or outliers according to
Ferreira Lopes & Cross (2017). Indeed, spurious periods that lead
to smooth phase diagrams will break this constraint. On the other
hand, the period that produces the main peak in the periodogram
can be related with a phase diagram which has gaps for common
methods like PDM and LSG. This happens because the function
used to measure the periodogram can interpret this arrangement of
measurements as a smooth phase diagram. This result can lead to
the highest periodogram peak when the signal is not well defined
and/or when a small number of epochs are available. On the other
hand, the periods that lead to folded phase diagrams with gaps may
not have many correlated measurements and hence they will not
leads to peaks in the PK(s) and PL(s) periodogram. Indeed, the main
peak of the periodogram will be the arrangement of measurements
that leads to the largest correlation value."
3.2 Dependency on the signal-to-noise ratio
"The Ceph, RR, RRblz, EA, EB, and Rot models (for more details
see Sect. 3) were used to analyze the PK(s) values for the main vari-
ability signal. PK(s) values were computed using 107 Monte Carlo
simulations for SNR ranging from 1 to 20. The simulations were
created for s = 2, s = 3, and s = 4. The results for s = 3 and s = 4
show lower efficiency than those found for s = 2 for lower SNR
values, as expected from Sect. 2.3. The results for larger orders, s,
provide better results than those found for s = 2, for high signal-to-
noise time-series, having large number of measurements (see Sect.
2.3). Therefore, we only show the results for s = 2. Figure 4 shows
the PK(s) as function of SNR for s= 2. The results are displayed us-
ing box plots instead of error bars because PK(s) results in discrete
values and its distribution is not symmetric. A box plot range that
includes 90% of results was used, and the red line sets the middle
of the distribution. The main results can be summarized as follows:"
"• The maximum value achieved by PK(s) is limited by the num-
ber of measurements for all SNR. Moreover, this effect is also ob-
served for higher s orders in agreement with the values estimated
by Eq. 7 (see Fig. 1).
• PK(s) tends to PK(s)"
"(max)
for simulations using 20, 60, and 100"
"measurements and high SNR for Ceph, RR, RRblz, EB, and Rot
models. The same trend having a slower growth is also observed
for EA. Indeed, PK(s) values are improved for EA models when
the number of measurements, mainly at the eclipses, is increased.
About ∼ 50% of PK(s) values for SNR = 3 are found below the
expected noise value when the time-series has 20 measurements.
This number is reduced to less than ∼ 10% when more than 60
measurements are available.
• The dispersion of PK(s) values decreases with the number of"
measurements for all values of SNR. The effect is less noticeable

"for EA models. This happens because the simulated time series
looks like noise when most of the measurements are sorted outside
of eclipses.
• About ∼ 95% of PK(2) values are above P2 values for the"
"whole range of SNR for Ceph, RR, RRblz, EB, and Rot simula-
tions using 60 and 100 measurements. This is also true for the sim-
ulations containing 20 measurements for SNR > 2. On the other
hand, the EA model shows PK(2) values around the noise level for
the whole range of SNR on the simulations containing 20 measure-
ments. The reason for this behaviour is the same as explained in the
last item.
• The time-series like EA and EB models have the lowest PK(s)"
values among all models analysed.
"In summary, the probability of finding PK(s) values above the"
"noise is dependent on the number of measurements, SNR, and sig-
nal type, as expected. For all simulations, when the number of mea-
surements is increased, we can measure reliable periods at lower
SNR. The simulations for higher s order are quite similar to those
found for s = 2."
4 TESTING THE METHOD ON REAL DATA
"A robust numerical simulation is complex because it usually does
not reproduce the correlated nature of the noise intrinsic to the
data as well as variations related to the instrumentation. Many con-
straints are required to provide realistic simulations such as a wide
range of amplitudes, error bars, outliers, and correlated noise, to"

"name a few. However, the simulation of the PK(s) power is facili-
tated because: (a) the amplitude can be a free parameter since PK(s)"
"is only weakly dependent on it; (b) the even mean values (see Eq.
2) are computed using those observations within three times the
absolute even-median deviation, which effectively reduces the out-
liers weight on zero point estimation (yw, see Eqn. 2) but all epochs
are considered to compute the powers; (c) the correlated nature of
successive measurements is reduced since they are computed using
phase diagrams. On the other hand, a robust simulation for PL(s)"
"covering all important aspects of it is difficult because PL(s) has
a strong dependence on amplitude, outliers, and error bars. There-
fore, the discussions in the previous sections only address the con-
straints on PK(s)."
"The PK(s) and PL(s) methods can be tested on real data using
existing variable stars catalogues. The WFCAMCAL variable stars
catalogue (WVSC1) having 280 stars (Ferreira Lopes et al. 2015a)
and the Catalina Survey Periodic Variable star catalogue (CVSC1)
having ∼ 47000 sources (Drake et al. 2014) were used to estimate
the efficiency rate of our new period finding methods. The WVSC1
was created from the analysis of the WFCAM Calibration 08B re-
lease (WFCAMCAL08B - Hodgkin et al. 2009; Cross et al. 2009).
More information about the design, the data reduction, the layout,
and about variability analysis of this database are described in de-
tail in Hambly et al. 2008; Cross et al. 2009; Ferreira Lopes et al.
2015a. The WFCAMCAL database is a useful dataset to test sin-
gle and panchromatic wavelength period finding methods. To sum-
marize, WFCAM database contains panchromatic data (ZY JHK
wavebands) that were observed to calibrate the UKIDSS surveys
Lawrence et al. 2007. A sequence of filters JHK or ZY JHK were
observed within a few minutes during each visit the fields. These
sequences were repeated in a semi-regular way that leads to an un-
even sampling having large seasonal gaps. On the other hand, the
CVSC1 has a huge amount of objects, with seventeen variable stars
types that were visually inspected by the authors."
"In order to perform a straightforward comparison between the
results, the SNR of WVSC1 and CVSC1 stars were also estimated
using Eq. 11. Also, the number of measurements and the PK(2) val-
ues were computed. Figure 5 shows the cumulative histograms of
SNR and number of measurements for WVSC1 and CVSC1 stars."
"The results for each waveband as well as for panchromatic data are
shown by different colours. About ∼ 90% of WVSC1 single wave-
band has S NR >∼ 3 while this number decreases to ∼ 70% for
the CVSC1 and panchromatic data. The WVSC1 single waveband
data have a number of measurements ranging from ∼ 30 to ∼ 150
while CVSC1 stars have a number from ∼ 100 to ∼ 300. When the
panchromatic data is considered, the number of measurements in-
creases considerably by a factor ∼ 5 compared with WVSC1 single
waveband. However, the SNR are smaller than those found for sin-
gle wavebands. In general, the SNR for panchromatic wavebands
are smaller than those found for CVSC1 stars."
"Understanding the peculiarities of the sample tested is crucial
when analysing the efficiency rate of our approach. Therefore we
summarize how the period searches were performed to find periods
for WVSC1 and CVSC1 stars. Ferreira Lopes et al. (2015a) selected
about 6651 targets to which four period finding methods were ap-
plied. Next, the ten best ranked periods in each of the four meth-
ods were selected. For each period a light curve model was created
using harmonics fits. Finally, the very best period was chosen as
that with the smallest χ2 with respect to all ranked periods; On the
other hand, the period search for ∼ 154 thousand CVSC1 sources
was made using the Lomb Scargle method. Next, the main periods
were analysed using the Adaptive Fourier Decomposition (AFD)
method (Torrealba et al. 2015) in order to determine the main vari-
ability period and reduce the number of sources to be visually in-
spected (112 thousand). Additionally, the periods of a large number
of the sources were improved and corrected by the authors. Many of
the variability periods of WVSC1 and CVSC1 were related to sub-
harmonics of their true period and the final results were set after
visual inspection."
"The following sections discuss the WVSC1 and CVSC1 vari-
able stars from the viewpoint of PK(s) and PL(s) parameters. The
periodogram, the efficiency rate, and the peculiarities of our ap-
proach are analysed. For that, we perform the period search using
the SLM, LSG, and PDM methods besides the panchromatic and
flux independent methods. A frequency range of (2/Tmax)d"
"−1 to
30d−1 was explored and we evenly sampled this frequency range
with a frequency step of 1300×Tmax , where Tmax is the total time
span. The frequency sampling constrains a maximum phase shift"

"of 0.1 that allows us to detect the large majority of signal types
(for more detail see Paper III). A quick visual inspection was per-
formed on some of WVSC1 and CVSC1 to test our analysis in the
next sections. The main goal of this work is to propose a new period
finding method instead of checking the reliability of the periods in
the WVSC1 and CVSC1 catalogues."
4.1 Periodogram and efficiency rate
"The PK(2) and PL(2) periodogram were computed for the WVSC1
and CVSC1 stars. For better visualization, the differential panchro-
matic light curve (see Fig. 6) was obtained by subtracting the even-
median from the magnitudes in each light curve. As a result, light
curves with zero mean are produced. The PK(s) and PL(s) param-
eters do not use any kind of transformation to combine measure-
ments at different wavelengths. However, a better way to combine
multi-wavelength data is an open question."
"Figure 6 shows the phase diagrams and their normalized peri-
odogram for some WVSC1 stars. The phase diagrams (left panels)
show the folded panchromatic data while the periodogram consid-
ering single and panchromatic wavebands are displayed in the cen-
tre and right panels respectively. The periodogram for a large part
of CVSC1 stars are quite similar to those found for panchromatic
data, i.e., periodogram for sources having more measurements and
smaller SNR than for the WVSC1 single waveband. The main re-
sults can be summarized as follows:"
"• PK(2) has more than one peak related with the maximum
power for WVSC-239 and WVSC-263, i.e., this means that PK(s)"
"(max)
indicates more than one viable period. The number of such peri-
ods gives the ”degeneracy” of a particular arrangement of measure-
ments in the phase diagram. This number increases as the number
of measurements decreases (see Eq. 7).
• The main period found by PK(2) is not the same as that ob-"
"tained by PL(2). This means that the maximum number of positive
correlations is not the same as the maximum correlation power. Be-
sides, the ”degeneracy” of periods found for PK(2) is not observed
in the PL(2) periodogram.
• PK(2) and PL(2) periodogram for the Z waveband show a scat-"
"ter around the expected noise level. Additionally, the WVSC-054
and WVSC-209 periodogram show an increase in PK(2) for long
periods. Indeed, this behaviour is observed in all wavebands and
hence it is an attribute of the proposed method.
• PK(2) for panchromatic data increases with periods up to a"
"maximum of around 5 days and then levels off and drops slightly
for longer periods for almost all sources. These sources have vari-
ability periods of less than 5 days. This behaviour is not found for
WVSC-209 and WVSC-102. Indeed, WVSC-102 has a variability
period of 589 days and hence the trend observed is different to
the others. On the other hand, WVSC-209 has a low-SNR signal.
Therefore, this trend is related with the variability period and SNR.
Indeed, the phase diagram keeps part of the correlation information
when the light curve is folded using a test period bigger than the
true variability period.
• PK(2) and PL(2) periodogram have peaks at the previous mea-"
"sured (true) variability periods of WVSC1 stars. However, the pe-
riod related with the largest peak is not always the true variability
period.
• The panchromatic data have lower SNR. Indeed, no clear sig-"
"nal can be observed in WVSC-263. This could mean that the signal
shape is very different from one band to another, or a signal or sea-"
"sonal variation is present in a single waveband, or the variability
period is wrong, to name the most likely possibilities."
"To summarize, the PK(s) and PL(s) periodogram indicate the
arrangement of measurements in the phase diagram that maximize
the correlation signal and power, respectively. Therefore, the PK(s)"
"and PL(s) parameters can be used to identify the periods that lead to
a smooth phase diagram from the viewpoint of correlation strength."
4.2 Accuracy
"The accuracy was measured considering the main signal(s) detected
by the PK(2) and PL(2) methods. Indeed, the largest power of PK(s)"
"periodogram can be related to more than one period. Therefore, all
periods related to the largest periodogram peak were considered to
measure the accuracy, i.e., the recovery fraction of variability pe-
riods. Two parameters to measure the accuracy were considered:
E(M) - when the main period is detected; E(MH) - when the main
variability period (PLit), measured in Ferreira Lopes et al. (2015a),
or its sub-harmonic, or overtone is found. Indeed, the processing
time of each method was not taken into account in this discussion.
A new approach to reduce the running time necessary to perform
period searches will be addressed in a forthcoming paper in this
series. Those signals found within ±1% of the variability period
were considered as detected. Table 2 shows the results for indi-
vidual wavebands as well as for the panchromatic data. The main
results can be summarized as:"
"• The accuracy is lower than 100% for all methods and data
tested. However, new estimates of Catalina variability periods have
been produced recently (e.g. Papageorgiou et al. 2018) and the
CVSC1 combines the results found by PDM, LSG, and STR meth-
ods for all wavebands to determine the best variability period.
Therefore, the accuracy for both datasets is larger than that dis-
played in Table 2 if these results are taken into consideration.
• PK(2) has the highest efficiency rate considering only the main"
"period (E(M)) for the Z, Y, J, H, and K wavebands. The efficiency
rate of PK(2) for the V waveband and panchromatic data is similar
to that found for the SLM and PL(2) methods. E(M) decreases form
Z to K wavebands because the first ones have larger SNR.
• The E(MH) values for Z, Y, J, H, and K for PK"
"(2) and SLM are
quite similar and they have the highest accuracy for the Z and Y
wavebands. On the other hand, PDM has the highest E(MH) values
for H, ZYJHK, and V wavebands. Indeed, the E(MH) values for
PDM and LSG are quite similar for the V waveband.
• The E(M) for PL"
(2) is always smaller than that found for PK(2)
"except for V band where it is 4% lower for PK(2).
• The highest E(M) is found for PK"
"(2) method while the high-
est E(MH) is found for the PDM method. The accuracy found for
LSG method is quite similar to that found for PDM method for V
waveband while in other wavebands the PDM method has twice
the accuracy. Indeed, this difference is reduced by a few percent
if a higher relative error is considered. Indeed, the PLit found by
the ZYJHK wavebands are refined using the SLM method (for
more details see Ferreira Lopes et al. 2015a). On the other hand,
the V waveband results were computed using Lomb-Scargle and
refined using reduced χ2 (for more details see Drake et al. 2014).
Therefore, the accuracy can be biased by the approach used to im-
prove the variability period estimation. Indeed, a deep discussion
about how to determine accurately the variability period and its er-
ror is found in the third paper of this series (for more details see
Ferreira Lopes et al. 2018)."

"• The panchromatic data do not significantly increase the ef-
ficiency rate for any method. The panchromatic data provides a
larger number of measurements but a smaller SNR compared with
those found for single wavebands (see Fig. 5).
• The efficiency rate of PK(2), PL(2), and SLM is strongly de-"
"creased for V and panchromatic data. This is related with the
smaller SNR of these data. It indicates a strong dependence of the
PK(2) and PL(2) methods on the SNR."
"The periods detected by PDM are also detected by the LSG
method. Moreover, almost all periods detected using the PK, PL,
and STR methods are also found by the LSG method. The periods
detected using LSG or PDM which are not found by other meth-
ods belong mainly to a few types: W UMa (∼ 61%), EA (∼ 13%),
RR Lyr on first overtone (∼ 10%), and RR Lyr on several modes
(∼ 2%), measured using the ratio of the number of missed sources
to the total number of sources missed. Indeed, the largest miss-rate
is found for the multi-periodic RR Lyr-type when the relative num-
ber of sources are considered, i.e. the fraction of missed sources
divided by the number of sources detected for each variability type.
As expected, the multi-periodic periods have the largest miss-rate
since the current approach is not designed to select these periods.
From quick visual inspection on phased data of the periods found
by methods other than PDM and LSG the following concerns have
been raised: the period found is a higher harmonic or overtone of
that found in the literature; the phase diagram is not always smooth;
the period found sometimes produces a smooth phase diagram but
the period found is different or has a relative difference larger than
1%. This means that STR, PK, and PL methods are more likely to
return spurious periods or higher harmonics of the main variabil-
ity period since the majority of the sources missed belong to these
groups."
"On the other hand, about ∼ 8% of the Catalina periods do not
correspond to our periods. We also made a quick visual inspection
of the phased data using the periods found by Catalina and those
found by us. As a result, we verify that the large majority (more
that ∼ 70%) of phase diagrams of this subsample produce smoother
phase diagrams using our periods than those found using Catalina
periods (see third row of panels of Fig. 7). Indeed, this assumes
that the true or main variability period should be that one which
produces the smoothest phase diagram."
"In summary, the PK(s) and PL(s) methods can be used as a
new tool to find periodic signals. In fact, they are more efficient
than all methods tested if high SNR data are considered. As a rule,
the new approach can be used in the same fashion as other period
finding methods. One should be aware that, the lower efficiency rate
for small SNR, probable bias for longer periods, and the multiple-
periods given by PK(s)must be taken into account."
4.3 Cautionary notes on period searching
"The main variability period is assumed to be that one which pro-
vides the smoothest phase diagram. Indeed, the periodicity of many
signals in oversampled data like CoRoT and Kepler light curves
(e.g. Paz-Chinchón et al. 2015; Ferreira Lopes et al. 2015b) can be
easily identified by looking directly at the light curve. This may not
include low SNR multi-periodic signals. On the other hand, the sig-
nals in undersampled data can only can be identified by eye using
phase diagrams. In both cases, the phase diagram should be smooth
at the main variability period. However, more than one period can
lead to smooth phase diagrams. In fact, due to the nature of the
analysis of big-datasets it is highly likely that some observational
biases exist or that pathological cases arise where the combination
of random or correlated errors, nearby sources, mimic expected
variations. Therefore, additional information must be put together
to solve this puzzle. For instance, photometric colours, amplitudes,
nearby saturated sources, crowded sky regions, distances, and other
information are crucial to confirm the period reliably."
"All configurations that produce smooth phase diagrams return
the peaks in the PK(s) method. The current approach was designed
to find the main variability period from the viewpoint of correla-
tion. Indeed, the harmonic periods also provide peaks in the peri-
odogram since the number of consecutive measurements that cross
the even-mean is only a small increase (see Eq. 7), often smaller
than random crosses due to noise. Actually, other signals not re-
lated to the main variability period also can lead to smooth phase
diagrams and hence they also have peaks close to PK(s)"
"(max)
. More-"
"over, incorrect periods also can be obtained if all configurations that
lead to smoother phase diagrams are not addressed."
"The PK(s) method is a useful tool to find all periods that lead
to smooth phase diagrams. Other methods, e.g. the string length,
or PDM method, or the fitting of truncated Fourier series also lead
to smooth phase diagrams. For completeness, the most prominent
peaks should be examined to evaluate the best candidate for the
main variability signal. The best period can be assumed to be the
one that leads to the smallest χ2 of a model computed from the
phase diagram (e.g. Drake et al. 2014; Ferreira Lopes et al. 2015a;
Torrealba et al. 2015). Figure 7 shows five cases from CVSC1
where topics discussed here are a hindrance. In each row of pan-
els are presented some examples as follows:"
"• First row of panels: stars where the PK(2) method does not
identify the correct variability period. In these cases, an examina-
tion of the phase diagrams for the other peaks in PK(2) may help to
find the correct value.
• Second row of panels: stars for which a smooth phase dia-"
"gram is not clearly defined by either CVSCI or the PK(2) method.
Therefore, both the PLit and PPK estimate may be wrong. Indeed,
Drake et al. 2014 use other criteria to define the period reliably."

"However, this analysis is hindered if other information besides of
light curve are not available.
• Third row of panels: both the PLit and PPK estimates pro-"
"duce smooth phase diagrams. However, they are not sub-harmonics
of one another. This means that both periods are sub-harmonic of
the main variability period or one of them is incorrect. Indeed, these
systems also might be a complex systems with multiple periodici-
ties, e.g. an eclipsing binary where one of component is a pulsating
star. These examples illustrate that the criterion of having a smooth
phase diagram per se is not enough to define the variability period.
• Fourth row of panels: the variability period found by PK(2)"
"method is an overtone (greater than 2) of the variability period.
Therefore, it indicates that the efficiency rate discussed in Sect. 4.2
is better if higher sub-harmonics are considered.
• Last row of panels: stars where PLit is wrong or inaccurate."
"PPK returns smoother phase diagrams than those using PLit . In-
deed, the PK(s) period for CSS_J110010.1+165359 appears to be a
sub-harmonic of the true variability period. The wrong period de-
termination can result in a misclassification since many of parame-
ters used for classification are derived from the variability period."
"The WVSC1 stars have similar features to those discussed us-
ing CVSC1 stars. A quick visual inspection was performed to sup-
port our remarks. A few stars look like those found on the last row
of panels shown in Fig. 7 in both samples. Indeed, the main goal
of this work is to provide a new way to find and analyse variability
time-series."
5 CONCLUSIONS
"Two new ways to search variability periods are proposed. These
methods are not derived from any previous period finding method.
The PK(s) method is characterized by presenting ordinates in the
range 0 to 1, does not have a strong dependence on the amplitude
of the signal, and also has an analytical equation to determine the
FFN. Moreover, the weight of outliers is reduced since the method
only considers the signs of the correlation signal. These are unique
features that allow us to determine a universal false alarm proba-
bility, i.e., the cut-off values that can be applied to any time-series,
where it mainly depends on the SNR of the light curve. In contrast,
the PL(s) method uses the correlation values and provides comple-
mentary information about the variability period."
"The PK(s) and PL(s) methods were compared with the LSG,
PDM, and SLM methods from real and simulated data having sin-
gle and multi-wavelength data. As result, the efficiency rate found
for LSG and PDM methods are better than all other methods for
sub-samples having low (< 3) or high (> 3) SNR data. On the other
hand, PK(s) and PL(s) efficiency is similar to that found for SLM
method for data in both constraints. As expected, the accuracy of
all methods is increased for data having high SNR."
"In fact, the statistics considered in this paper are unlikely
to be useful for data with multiple periodicities. The current
methods were recent applied in the entire data of VVV survey
(Ferreira Lopes et al. 2020) from where the periods estimated from
five period finding method can be found. This paper is the second
of this series about period search methods. Our next paper will pro-
vide our summary of recommendation to reduce running time and
improve the periodicity search on big-data sets."
