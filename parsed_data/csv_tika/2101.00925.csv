"Abstract: A class of bivariate infinite series solutions of the elliptic and hyperbolic Kepler equations is
described, adding to the handful of 1-D series that have been found throughout the centuries. This result
is based on an iterative procedure for the analytical computation of all the higher-order partial derivatives
of the eccentric anomaly with respect to the eccentricity e and mean anomaly M in a given base point
(ec, Mc) of the (e, M) plane. Explicit examples of such bivariate infinite series are provided, corresponding
to different choices of (ec, Mc), and their convergence is studied numerically. In particular, the polynomials
that are obtained by truncating the infinite series up to the fifth degree reach high levels of accuracy in
significantly large regions of the parameter space (e, M). Besides their theoretical interest, these series can
be used for designing 2-D spline numerical algorithms for efficiently solving Kepler’s equations for all
values of the eccentricity and mean anomaly."

1. Introduction
"In the Newtonian approximation, the time dependence of the relative position of two distant or
spherically symmetric bodies that move in each other’s gravitational field can be written with explicit
analytical formulas involving a finite number of terms only when the eccentricity, e, is equal to 0 or 1,
corresponding to circular and parabolic orbits, respectively [1]. For 0 < e < 1 and for e > 1, such evolution
can be obtained by solving for E one of the following two Kepler Equations (KEs) (see e.g. Chapter 4 of
Ref. [1]),"
"M = f (e, E) ="
"{
E− e sin E, for e < 1"
"e sinh E− E, for e > 1
, (1)"
"where M and E are measures of the epoch and the angular position called the mean and the eccentric
anomaly, respectively (for convenience, the same symbols are used here for the elliptic and hyperbolic
anomalies, even though they are defined in different ways)."
"For any given value of e, Equations (1) can be solved numerically for E by using a root-finding
algorithm for the nonlinear equation f (e, E)−M = 0 (see Ref. [2] for an historical overview). In particular,
efficient strategies based on Newton-Raphson iteration method or one its variants have been applied to
the elliptic [3–12] and hyperbolic [13–16] KEs."
"Moreover, a handful of infinite series solutions of Eqs. (1) have also been found throughout the
centuries (see Chapter 3 in Ref. [2]). The solution for 0 < e < 1 has been written as an expansion in
powers of e [17], or as an expansion in the basis functions sin(nM) with coefficients proportional to the"

around (ec, Mc), and can be used to devise 2-D spline algorithms for the numerical computation of the
eccentric anomaly E for every (e, M) [23], generalizing the 1-D spline methods that have been described
recently [24,25]. Since they do not require the evaluation of transcendental functions in the generation
procedure, splines based on polynomial expansions, such as the 1-D cubic spline of Refs. [24,25], or the
2-D quintic spline of Ref. [23], which is based on the solutions presented here, are more convenient for
numerical computations than expansions in terms of trigonometric functions."
2. Methods
Let the unknown exact solution of Equation (1) be
"E = g(e, M). (3)"
"If the analytical expression of the partial derivatives of g(e, M) were known, a bivariate Taylor expansion
could be written for any choice of base values ec, Ec, Mc = f (ec, Ec), so that Equation (2) would be
demonstrated with the coefficients given by"

. (4)"
"To obtain such derivatives, we notice that the definitions in Eqs. (1) and (3) imply the identity,"
"E = g(e, f (e, E)). (5)"
"In this expression, e and E are considered as the independent variables. Therefore, by taking the differential,
we obtain,"

"Since e and E are independent, the coefficients of dE and de must cancel separately. This condition

usual rule for the derivative of the inverse function when e is considered to be a fixed parameter [2,22].

the result of Equation (8) was used in Ref. [19] to derive an expansion in the basis sin nM."
"Eqs. (7) and (8), taken together with Eqs. (1) and (3), can be used for the iterative computation of
all the higher order derivatives entering Equation (2) for e 6= 1. The calculations can be simplified by

"series solutions of the elliptic and hyperbolic KEs, one for any given choice of base values. Three explicit

"The determination of the radius of convergence for the univariate series solutions of KEs has been a
formidable mathematical problem (see Chapter 6 of Ref. [2]). In the case of the bivariate series of Equations"

"(2) and (4), the region of convergence in the (e, M) plane can be estimated numerically as discussed in
section 3."
"3. Examples, Discussion and Results"
"In this section, three examples of bivariate infinite series solutions of KEs are given. They have been
obtained from Eqs. (2) and (4) by applying the methods discussed in Section 2 for the computation of the
derivatives of g, for three different choices of the base values (ec, Mc). All the non-vanishing terms up to
fifth order are shown explicitly. Since g(e,−M) = −g(e, M), it is sufficient to solve KEs only for positive
values of M. Moreover, for e < 1 the M domain can be reduced to the interval 0 ≤ M ≤ π, and then the
solution for every M can be obtained by using the periodicity of f and g."
"In all cases, it is convenient to define approximate solutions Sn obtained by truncating the infinite
series of Equation (2) keeping only the terms with k + q ≤ n, so that"
"Sn(e, M) =
n"
"n−k
∑
q=0"
"ck,q (e− ec)k(M−Mc)q, (18)"
"with coefficients given by Equation (4). The errors En of the approximate solutions Sn can then be evaluated
in a self consistent way,"
"En(e, M) = |Sn(e, M)− Sn(e, f (e, Sn(e, M)))|. (19)"
"From a practical point of view, the convergence of the infinite series for certain values of (e, M) means
that En(e, M) should tend to decrease for increasing n. This idea is used for obtaining an estimate of the
region of convergence in the (e, M) parameter space by comparing the average errors for lower and higher
values of n with the following condition,"
"E1(e, M) + E2(e, M) + E3(e, M) >
3
2
[E4(e, M) + E5(e, M)] . (20)"
"A more refined criterion of convergence can be obtained by studying the scaling behavior of the
solutions. For this purpose, every point of the (e, M) plane is expressed in terms of polar variables ρ, φ,
defined as"
"e = ec + ρ cos φ, M = Mc + ρ sin φ. (21)"
"All the polynomials Sn(e, M) and their errors En(e, M) can then be thought of as functions of ρ and φ.
For a given value of φ, these functions are one dimensional, depending only on ρ, which is a measure
of the distance from the center (ec, Mc) in the (e, M) plane. Thus ρ can play a role similar to that of the
embedding parameter q of the homotopy analysis method [26], with the difference that ρ will not be
assumed to be smaller than 1. Actually, the parameters ρ and φ will only be used in the intermediate steps
and will disappear from the final criteria of convergence."
"If the bivariate series of Equations (2) and (4) converges in a certain point (e, M) along a fixed direction
φ, the error of the Sn approximation can be written as"
"En(ec + ρ cos φ, Mc + ρ sin φ) =
ρn+1"
(n + 1)!
"∣∣∣∣∂n+1g∂ρn+1 (ec + ρ̄ cos φ, Mc + ρ̄ sin φ)
∣∣∣∣ ≡ ρn+1(n + 1)! βn+1(φ, ρ), (22)"
"where the derivative entering the definition of βn+1(φ, ρ) has to be computed for an unknown value
ρ̄ ∈ [0, ρ]. By plotting the actual numerical errors En in a direction φ for a given base point (ec, Mc), it can
be seen that the ρ dependence of βn+1 in the convergence region is usually much milder than that of the
factor ρn+1. As an example, Fig. 1 shows such plots for the series centered around the point (ec, Mc) = (0, 0),"

For almost all values of ρ < 1.21 (vertical magenta line in Fig. 1), corresponding to e < 0.367 and M < 1.15
rad, the errors En decrease as n increases, as expected for a convergent series, except for the occasional
inversion due to cancellations that occur in one of the Sn (S2 around ρ ∼ 1 in the figure). For ρ > 1.21, E1,
E3, and E4 mix, and the series can be expected to diverge."
"Similar results can be obtained for different directions φ and base points (ec, Mc). In general, the linear
behavior of log En in the convergence region corresponds to En ∝ ρn+1 with a very good approximation,
so that En1 and E"

done by summing up different En with the corresponding scale exponent, as in the following combinations:"

"These conditions ensure that the errors not only tend to decrease for increasing n, but they also scale as
expected when the series is convergent. For the solution based in (ec, Mc) = (0, 0) and evaluated along
the diagonal direction M = πe, these conditions give the limiting value ρ = 1.21 shown in Fig. 1. By
inspecting the figure it can be seen that the bounds of Equations (26) produce a reliable result in this case.
Moreover, as shown in subsection 3.1, Equations (26) also reproduce the known radius of convergence
of Lagrange series [2,17] in the limit where it can be compared with our bivariate series. The bounds
of Equations (26) are usually more stringent than those obtained from Equation (20), but there may be
special directions for which the opposite may be true. Hereafter, a conservative definition of the region of
convergence will be used by imposing Equations (26) and Equation (20) at the same time."

"[see Ref. 2, Equation (3.25)]. It is easy to see that the Taylor expansions (up to fifth order) of Equations
(28) and (29) around M = 0 and e = 0, respectively, coincide with the bivariate series of Equation (27). Of
course, their expansions in a neighborhood of (ec, Mc) = (0, 0) have to coincide since all these series solve
the same equation around the same point. However, the complete series are different from one another,
and their numerical values will also be increasingly different for increasing distance from the base point

separates from the magenta line, so that the region of convergence of the bivariate series is different from
that of Lagrange."

4. Conclusions
"I described an analytical procedure for the exact computation of all the higher-order partial derivatives
of the elliptic and hyperbolic eccentric anomalies with respect to both the eccentricity e and the mean
anomaly M. Although such derivatives depend implicitly on the solution of KE, they can be computed
explicitly by choosing a couple of base values ec and Ec for the eccentricity and the eccentric anomaly,
so that the corresponding value Mc of the mean anomaly can be obtained without solving KE. For any
such choice of (ec, Mc), an infinite Taylor series expansion in both M and e can then be written, which is
expected to converge in a suitable neighborhood of (ec, Mc). A procedure for estimating the actual size of
the region of convergence has also been given."
"Three explicit examples of such series were then provided, two for the elliptic and one for the
hyperbolic KE. Each of them, for fixed base point, turns out to converge in large parts of the (e, M) plane."

"For (e, M) close to (ec, Mc) within a range ∆e ∼ ∆M/π = O(10−3), the polynomial obtained by truncating
the infinite series up to the fifth degree reaches an accuracy at the level of machine double precision.
Further away from (ec, Mc), but still within the region of convergence, higher order terms should be
introduced to maintain such an accuracy."
"Since these new solutions converge locally around (ec, Mc), a suitable set of them, centered around
different (ec, Mc) and truncated up to a certain degree, can be used to design an algorithm for the numerical
computation of the function E(e, M) for every value of (e, M). The resulting polynomials will form a 2-D
spline [23], generalizing the 1-D spline that has been proposed in Refs. [24,25] for solving KE for every M
when e is fixed. This bivariate spline may be used for accelerating computations involving the repetitive
solution of Kepler’s equation for several different values of e and M [23], as for exoplanet search [27,28] or
for the implementation of Enke’s method [1]."
