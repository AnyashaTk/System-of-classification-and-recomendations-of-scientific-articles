ABSTRACT
"Aims. We use stellar line-of-sight velocities to constrain the dark matter–density profile of Eridanus 2, an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy
with an absolute V-band magnitude MV = −7.1 corresponding to a stellar mass M∗ ≈ 9 × 104 M�. We furthermore derive constraints
on fundamental properties of self-interacting and fuzzy dark matter scenarios.
Methods. We present new observations of Eridanus 2 from MUSE-Faint, a survey of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies with the Multi Unit
Spectroscopic Explorer on the Very Large Telescope, and determine line-of-sight velocities for stars inside the half-light radius.
Combined with literature data, we have 92 stellar tracers out to twice the half-light radius. We constrain models of cold dark matter,
self-interacting dark matter, and fuzzy dark matter with these tracers, using CJAM and pyGravSphere for the dynamical analysis. The
models of self-interacting and fuzzy dark matter relate the self-interaction coefficient respectively the dark-matter particle mass to the
density profile.
Results. We find substantial evidence (Bayes factor ∼10−0.6) for cold dark matter (a cuspy halo) over self-interacting dark matter (a
cored halo) and weak evidence (Bayes factor ∼10−0.4) for fuzzy dark matter over cold dark matter. We find a virial mass M200 ∼ 108 M�
and astrophysical factors J(αJc ) ∼ 10"

−5 and D(αDc ) ∼ 10"
"2–102.5 M� kpc
−2 (proportional to dark-matter annihilation and decay"
"signals, respectively), the exact values depending on the density profile model. The mass-to-light ratio within the half-light radius is
consistent with the literature. We do not resolve a core (rc < 47 pc, 68-% confidence level) or soliton (rsol < 7.2 pc, 68-% confidence
level). These limits are equivalent to an effective self-interaction coefficient f Γ < 2.2 × 10−29 cm3 s−1 eV−1 c2 and a fuzzy-dark-matter
particle mass ma > 4.0 × 10−20 eV c−2. The constraint on self-interaction is complementary to those from gamma-ray searches. The
constraint on fuzzy-dark-matter particle mass is inconsistent with those obtained for larger dwarf galaxies, suggesting that the flattened
density profiles of those galaxies are not caused by fuzzy dark matter."

1. Introduction
"Over time the astrophysical community has come to realize that
baryonic matter and the established laws of physics are unable
to explain our observations of the Universe. The discrepancy be-
tween baryonic and measured mass is almost universally inter-
preted as evidence for dark matter. The current paradigm, cold
dark matter (CDM), has so far been able to explain our observa-
tions, albeit with a few open questions. Various departures from
the paradigm have been proposed with varying success, seeking
to address a perceived shortcoming of CDM or to explain the
properties of dark matter as a consequence of a more physically
motivated theory. The proposed alternatives to CDM span a wide
range of masses and interactions, including weakly interacting
massive particles (WIMPs; Steigman & Turner 1985), massive
astrophysical compact halo objects (MACHOs; Griest 1991),
axions (Weinberg 1978; Wilczek 1978; Preskill et al. 1983),"
"? Based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla

"warm dark matter (WDM) such as sterile neutrinos (Dodelson
& Widrow 1994), and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM; Carl-
son et al. 1992; Spergel & Steinhardt 2000). Another option,
which has enjoyed less support, to solve the problem of ‘missing
mass’ is to modify the laws of gravity instead of adding extra
mass to the Universe. Examples of these modifications are mod-
ified Newtonian dynamics (Milgrom 1983) and emergent grav-
ity (Verlinde 2017). In this paper we will limit ourselves to a few
different forms of dark matter."
"The alternatives to CDM have different microphysical prop-
erties that lead to changes on astrophysical scales, making it in
principle possible to distinguish between the individual alterna-
tives and CDM through astronomical observations. One way of
doing this is by investigating the gravitational interaction be-
tween the invisible dark matter and luminous objects. Different
dark-matter theories often predict different spatial distributions
of dark matter, which can be inferred from the kinematics of
baryonic tracers. This kinematic approach is indirect, but is com-
plementary to the direct and indirect approaches that search for
signatures like annihilation and decay products. A complicating"

"factor for astronomical observations is the complexity of astro-
physical processes taking place in astronomical structures at the
same time or in the past, which might also affect the measured
spatial distribution of dark matter or the kinematics of the trac-
ers."
"Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are perhaps the most
promising class of objects for constraining dark matter on the
basis of the density profile, because these galaxies are the most
dark matter–dominated galaxies known (see e.g. McConnachie
2012) and also in an absolute sense contain very little baryonic
matter that might interfere with the interpretation of the results
(MV > −7.7; Simon 2019). Baryonic effects are expected to be
able to create significant cores in larger dwarf galaxies (Brooks
& Zolotov 2014; Di Cintio et al. 2014b). Simulations of isolated
galaxies show that the baryonic effects at play include bursty
star formation, supernova feedback, and gas in- and outflows, or
gravitational potential fluctuations in general (e.g., Read et al.
2016; El-Zant et al. 2016; Freundlich et al. 2020). Observational
evidence that this process takes place in classical dwarf galaxies
is found by Read et al. (2019), who measure an anti-correlation
between the dark-matter density at a radius of 150 pc and the
stellar-mass–to–halo-mass ratio. In the case of UFDs, the bary-
onic content is so low that it is not expected to significantly alter
the density profile from cuspy to cored (Peñarrubia et al. 2012;
Oñorbe et al. 2015; Wheeler et al. 2019). However, other ef-
fects such as tides (Genina et al. 2020a) can also create cores in
a CDM universe, and non-circular motions can bias kinematic
analyses to make cusps appear as cores (Oman et al. 2019)."
"This paper is the second part of a series of papers on MUSE-
Faint, a survey of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies with the Multi Unit
Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE; Bacon et al. 2010) at the Very
Large Telescope (VLT). Previously (Zoutendijk et al. 2020, here-
after Paper I) we have presented 4.5 h of observations on the cen-
tral square arcminute of Eridanus 2 (Eri 2), a relatively bright
UFD with absolute V-band magnitude MV = −7.1 (Crnoje-
vić et al. 2016). We found an intrinsic velocity dispersion of
10.3+3.9"
"−3.2 km s
−1 for the bulk of the stars in the centre of Eri 2,"
"whereas the central stellar overdensity was found to have an in-
trinsic velocity dispersion < 7.6 km s−1 (68-% confidence level),
supporting the earlier photometric classification as a star clus-
ter (Crnojević et al. 2016)."
"The kinematics of larger dwarf galaxies are well studied.
Fornax, Sculptor, and Draco, for example, have large sets of stel-
lar line-of-sight velocities (Walker et al. 2009, 2015) and the lat-
ter two even have internal proper motion measurements (Massari
et al. 2018, 2020). The profile of Fornax has been established
as cored (e.g., Goerdt et al. 2006; Walker & Peñarrubia 2011;
Amorisco et al. 2013), whereas Draco is generally regarded as
having a cuspy density profile (e.g., Jardel et al. 2013; Read
et al. 2018; Massari et al. 2020). There is no consensus about the
density profile of Sculptor, with some authors preferring cores
(e.g., Battaglia et al. 2008; Walker & Peñarrubia 2011), some
cusps (Richardson & Fairbairn 2014; Massari et al. 2018), and
others claim either fits the data (e.g., Breddels et al. 2013; Stri-
gari et al. 2018). However, Read et al. (2019) note that the en-
closed mass estimates for Sculptor are in agreement, the largest
tension being ∼2σ."
"Far fewer kinematic data are available for UFDs. The first
UFD for which a velocity dispersion was determined was Ursa
Major I (Kleyna et al. 2005). Currently, velocity dispersions are
known for over half of the confirmed and candidate UFDs (Si-
mon 2019). These measurements can be converted to mass es-
timates, for example using the estimators by Wolf et al. (2010).
Constraining a density profile for a UFD has so far not been pos-"
"sible due to the small sizes of the kinematic data sets and the
limited radial ranges covered. However, the presence of the star
cluster in Eri 2 has been used to argue for its hosting of a cored
profile (Amorisco 2017; Contenta et al. 2018)."
"Even without knowing the full density profile, classical and
ultra-faint dwarf galaxies can be used to constrain dark-matter
properties. If dark matter annihilates or decays, dark-matter
haloes will emit radiation. Dwarf galaxies are promising targets
because of their high dark-matter density and low radiation of
baryonic origin. The annihilation and decay signals are propor-
tional to the astrophysical J and D factors, which are integrated
measures of the density profile. These factors are necessary to
convert observed fluxes or flux limits to dark-matter properties.
A number of studies have determined one or both of the astro-
physical factors for dwarf galaxies (e.g., Bonnivard et al. 2015a;
Fermi-LAT Collaboration 2014; Alvarez et al. 2020)."
"Here we present additional observations from MUSE-Faint
on four new pointings surrounding the centre, roughly covering
the half-light radius of Eri 2, R1/2/D = 2.31 ± 0.12 arcmin at
distance D = 366 ± 17 kpc, or R1/2 = 277 ± 14 pc (Crnojević
et al. 2016). With these new fields, in combination with our cen-
tral field and results from another study (Li et al. 2017) at larger
distances from the centre, we can study the kinematics of stars in
Eri 2 over a wide range of radii. Using different kinematical anal-
ysis techniques, we put constraints on the dark matter–density
profile of Eri 2, specifically whether the profile is cuspy or cored
and to what degree, and translate these to constraints on the prop-
erties of dark-matter candidates: the self-interaction coefficient
of self-interacting dark matter and the dark-matter particle mass
of fuzzy dark matter. Furthermore, we compare different models
to each other using the Bayesian evidence, in an attempt to con-
strain which kinds of dark matter fit the data better. In the figures
in this paper we consistently assign a colour to each model of the
density profile to facilitate recognition and association."
"In Sect. 2 we describe our data and its reduction (Sect. 2.1),
the dark matter–density profile models (Sect. 2.2), and the analy-
sis methods (Sects. 2.3 and 2.4). We continue in Sect. 3 with our
results on dark-matter parameter constraints (Sect. 3.1), density-
profile recovery and derived halo properties (Sect. 3.2), and a
comparison of the evidence for the different dark-matter models
(Sect. 3.3). We end with a discussion in Sect. 4 and our conclu-
sions in Sect. 5."
2. Methods
"We begin by describing our observations of Eri 2 from the
MUSE-Faint survey, the data reduction, and the extraction of
kinematics in Sect. 2.1. This is followed in Sect. 2.2 by the pre-
sentation of the three main dark-matter models tested in this
paper. The parameters of the density profiles associated with
these models are linked to microphysical properties of dark mat-
ter. To constrain the profiles and thereby these properties, we
use two analysis tools, CJAM and pyGravSphere, introduced in
Sects. 2.3 and 2.4."
2.1. Observations and data reduction
"The data were taken with VLT/MUSE during five guaranteed-
time observing runs between October 2017 and December 2019.
The estimated natural seeing varied between 0.6 and 1.0 arcsec,
with adaptive optics reducing the seeing by 0.1–0.2 arcsec un-
der good conditions. In Paper I we described the data reduc-
tion and source selection for Field 1, our central pointing on"

"Eri 2. We used the same procedure independently on Fields 2
through 5, presented here for the first time (see Fig 1). In brief,
we mostly followed the standard procedure of reducing MUSE
data with the MUSE Data Reduction Software (DRS; version 2.4
for Field 1 and version 2.6 for Fields 2 through 5; Weilbacher
et al. 2020), the exceptions being the use of the bad-pixel table
from Bacon et al. (2017) and an autocalibration step on a source-
masked version of the cube. The DRS-produced data cubes were
post-processed with the Zurich Atmosphere Purge (ZAP; ver-
sion 2.0; Soto et al. 2016) to remove residual sky signatures. We
extracted spectra from these data cubes using PampelMuse (Ka-
mann et al. 2013) and measured seeing full widths at half-
maximum between 0.53 and 0.66 arcsec at 7000 Å for the five
data cubes, using public Hubble Space Telescope data1 to con-
struct a source catalogue. We used spexxy (version 2.5; Husser
2012) with the PHOENIX library of synthetic stellar spectra
to determine line-of-sight velocities and made a catalogue of
the results for each field. To ensure reliable velocity measure-
ments and to limit contamination from background galaxies and
Milky-Way stars, we imposed a set of selection criteria: we re-
moved catalogue entries that have a clearly extra-galactic spatial
or spectral appearance, a spectral signal-to-noise ratio below 5,
an unsuccessful velocity fit, a parallax measurement from Gaia
Data Release 2 (Gaia Collaboration 2016, 2018; Lindegren et al.
2018) inconsistent with zero, and photometry inconsistent with a
broadened MIST isochrone (Dotter 2016; Choi et al. 2016; Pax-
ton et al. 2011, 2013, 2015). We had 95 entries that passed these
criteria in the five catalogues. To this we added another catalogue
with 47 observations of 28 member stars identified by Li et al.
(2017), bringing the total number of entries to 142."

J. D. Simon, presented by Simon et al. (2020)."
"Since the six catalogues have some overlap on the sky, some
sources occur in multiple catalogues. While merging the six
source catalogues, we took into account the presence of these
duplicate entries, which share their identifier, by replacing them
with a single entry in the final catalogue, where we took the mean
values of the right ascensions and declinations, the uncertainty-
weighted mean values of the line-of-sight velocities, the sum in
quadrature of the inverse uncertainties on the line-of-sight veloc-
ities, and the sum in quadrature of the signal-to-noise ratios. Af-
ter this removal of duplicates, we were left with 109 unique stars.
As in Paper I, we checked for possible remaining contamination
of our sample by Milky-Way stars by computing the membership
probabilities of the selected sources. This we did by calculating
the likelihood of observing the measured stellar velocities given
two distribution functions, a Gaussian representing Eri 2 and a
contaminating distribution based on the Besançon model of the
Milky Way (Robin et al. 2003, 2004), and a membership proba-
bility for each star weighting the contributions of both distribu-
tion functions. The membership probabilities were determined
by optimizing the likelihood while marginalizing over the mean
velocity and dispersion of Eri 2. We found that 10 of our sources
have significantly lower membership probabilities than the oth-
ers, leading to their exclusion from our sample, leaving 99 stars."
"In Paper I we found that the Eri 2 cluster seen at the centre
of this galaxy has a different kinematic distribution than the bulk
of Eri 2. Moreover, it is still not completely clear how far this
cluster is located from the centre of Eri 2, as we can only see
the projected location. This leads to the question of whether the
kinematics of the stars that make up the cluster are good tracers
of the potential of Eri 2, or whether they trace mainly the prop-
erties of the star cluster itself. To avoid a possible bias in our
results, we excluded the seven cluster member stars identified in
Paper I from our sample, bringing our final selection to 92 stars.
We present the positions and kinematics of the final selection in
Table A.1. Of the final selection, 64 stars have only MUSE-Faint
measurements, 20 stars have only measurements from Li et al.
(2017), and eight stars have measurements from both sources."
2.2. Models of dark matter–density profiles
"With the goal to place constraints on the nature of dark mat-
ter, we will compare our kinematic data to several models of
dark matter–density profiles, each based on a different type of
dark matter. As a null hypothesis, we will use a Navarro–Frenk–
White (NFW; Navarro et al. 1996) profile to represent cold dark
matter (CDM):"
"ρCDM(r; ρ0, rs) =
ρ0"
"(r/rs)(1 + r/rs)2
, (1)"
"where ρ0 is known as the characteristic density and rs is the
scale radius. We will compare this with two other models: self-
interacting dark matter (SIDM) and fuzzy dark matter (FDM).
The latter two models behave like an NFW profile on large
scales, but deviate on smaller scales, depending on the effective
self-interaction coefficient and the mass of the dark-matter par-
ticle, respectively. We can therefore, for both the SIDM and the
FDM model, not only compare one dark-matter theory to the
other, but also place constraints on the properties of dark-matter
particles under the assumption of the particular theory."
"SIDM describes a form of dark matter that interacts with it-
self more strongly than with other particles (Spergel & Stein-
hardt 2000). Interactions that remove dark-matter particles from
the halo according to the relation"

file"
"ρSIDM(r; ρc, rc, rs) =
ρc"
"(r/rc)(1 + r/rs)2 + 1
, (3)"
"where ρc is the core density and rc is the core radius (Lin & Loeb
2016). We will discuss how Γ and our constraints thereon relate
to the cross section σ in Section 4. The self-interaction described
covers scattering and annihilation, but has been designed with
mainly the latter in mind. The profile can also be written as"
"ρSIDM(r; ρ0, rc, rs) =
ρ0"
"rc/rs + (r/rs)(1 + r/rs)2
(4)"
"with characteristic density ρ0 = ρc(rc/rs). The SIDM profile is
equal to the CDM/NFW profile for rc = 0, but for rc > 0 it ex-
hibits a core instead of a cusp. Evidence in favour of the SIDM
profile over the CDM profile would indicate that the density pro-
file of Eri 2 is cored. If the density profile of Eri 2 is cuspy, both
the CDM and SIDM model should be able to describe it, but we
should in this case find evidence in favour of the CDM profile,
as it is the simpler of the two. At large radii the SIDM profile
always asymptotes to the NFW profile. There is a relation tying
the self-interaction coefficient Γ of the dark matter to the obser-
vational properties of the profile (Lin & Loeb 2016):"
"f Γ =
rc/rs
tρ0"
"where t is the time elapsed since the start of the self-interaction,
at the virialization of the dark-matter halo. However, this relation
is degenerate with the fudge factor f that compensates for the
unknown gravitational back-reaction. As dark-matter particles
interact according to Equation (2), the dark-matter halo moves
out of dynamical equilibrium. The gravitational back-reaction is
the process of the halo re-adjusting to the new dynamical equilib-
rium, thereby altering the profile to a larger extent than described
by Γ alone. The value of f is estimated to be ∼10 for dwarf
galaxies (Kaplinghat et al. 2000), but is not precisely known. We
will therefore try to constrain the product f Γ, which we will call
the effective self-interaction coefficient. The time t is not known,
so we assume it is equal to the age of the stellar population. This
was estimated to be 8 Gyr in Paper I, but in a more rigorous anal-
ysis Simon et al. (2020) find the oldest stars are ∼13.5 Gyr old,
therefore we adopt the latter. Should a better estimate of the time
since virialization become available in the future, our constraints
of f Γ can simply be rescaled."
"FDM consists of ultra-light spinless bosons that form a
Bose–Einstein condensate, exhibiting quantum-mechanical be-
haviour at astronomical scales (Hu et al. 2000). Axions are
a possible and well-motivated class of particles that can form
FDM, but are not the only possibility, nor does FDM require
an electromagnetic interaction like axions have (see e.g. Ferreira
2020). The wave-like properties of FDM result in a density pro-
file (Schive et al. 2014a,b; Marsh & Pop 2015)"
"ρFDM(r; ρsol,0, rsol, ρCDM,0, rs) =

"ρsol(r; ρsol,0, rsol) =

"At large radii FDM follows the NFW profile, but with decreasing
radius the density first rises steeply and then flattens to a constant"
"value. This inner part of the profile deviating from the NFW is
known as the soliton solution to the wave equations governing
the ultra-light dark-matter particles, with central density ρsol,0
and soliton radius rsol. We note that this soliton radius rsol, de-
fined by Marsh & Pop (2015), differs from the soliton radius rc as
defined by Schive et al. (2014a). The central soliton density and
soliton radius are related to the mass of the dark-matter particle

"where MPl is the reduced Planck mass, α ≈ 0.230, and c is the
speed of light (Marsh & Pop 2015). There is a sharp transition, at
the transition radius rt, to an NFW profile. The profile has to be
continuous (i.e., the two parts need to be equal at the transition
radius), but the transition is so sharp that it is usually modelled
with a sudden transition, leading to a discontinuous first deriva-
tive. Our method, however, necessitates a smooth modelling of
the transition and is introduced in Sect. 2.3 and detailed in Ap-
pendix B. The transition radius can be expressed in terms of the
fraction ε of the density at the transition relative to the central
soliton density ρsol,0:"
"rt = (ε
−1/8
− 1)1/2rsol. (9)"
"Simulations show that ε does not exceed 1/2 (Schive et al.
2014a; Marsh & Pop 2015)."
"To be able to test the different dark matter–density pro-
files against our data, we need to make predictions for mea-
surements given a set of parameters. This is not an easy task,
considering that we only measure the projected positions of
stars and their line-of-sight velocities. Converting between the
three-dimensional models and the two-dimensional measure-
ments leads to a dependence on the velocity anisotropy. This has
long been a source of uncertainty for density profile determina-
tion, because it leads to a mass–anisotropy degeneracy when the
enclosed mass is determined from the three-dimensional velocity
dispersion through Jeans analysis. Fortunately, several methods
exist that attempt to break this degeneracy by exploiting addi-
tional information available in the data. We will use two differ-
ent codes in this paper, which take different approaches to the
problem, each with its own merits and shortcomings."
2.3. CJAM
"The light and dark matter distributions can be approximated with
a multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE; Emsellem et al. 1994). This
approximation makes it possible to calculate integrals over the
profiles analytically instead of numerically and leads to faster
performance. The first method, CJAM (Watkins et al. 2013) is
an implementation of the Jeans Anisotropic MGE method (JAM;
Cappellari 2008). CJAM calculates the first and second moments
of the velocities for every tracer, allowing for non-spherical
light and matter distributions and a non-zero, constant veloc-
ity anisotropy. In general, the first moments form a three-
dimensional expectation value of the velocity of a tracer given a
model and the nine second moments make up the covariance. As
we only have line-of-sight information, we are limited to the first
and second moments along the line of sight, though CJAM can
also calculate moments in the plane of the sky, which could be
compared to proper-motion data. Because of the limited number
of available tracers, we also assume the dark-matter component"

"of Eri 2 is spherically symmetric. The use of MGEs in CJAM al-
lows us to implement our own density profiles. We describe the
expansion of our profiles into MGEs in Appendix B."
"There are several parametrizations in which we can ex-
press the different dark-matter profiles. We define the astrophys-
ical parametrizations as those using astrophysical measurements
such as characteristics densities and scale radii. These are the
same as the canonical forms of the profiles, as given in Equa-
tions (1)–(7). For SIDM and FDM we can transform the as-
trophysical parametrization into a microphysical parametriza-
tion. These parametrizations contain parameters that character-
ize dark-matter physics: the effective self-interaction coefficient
and the dark matter–particle mass. However, we find that we get
the best constraints by parametrizing the profiles using quantities
that are as close as possible to our measurements. We will refer
to these last parametrizations as computational. We constrain the
computational parametrizations directly and compute the con-
straints on the astrophysical and microphysical parametrizations
from them."
"For the SIDM profile, we found a computational
parametrization in terms of the base-10 logarithm of dark-
matter density at three fixed radii: log10 ρ1 at r1 = 50 pc, log10 ρ2
at r2 = 100 pc, and log10 ρ3 at r3 = 150 pc. These radii are
chosen to be near the peak in observed line-of-sight velocities.
The astrophysical parameters can be recovered through"

"The consequence of this choice of parametrization is that it
is harder to set a prior that will limit the astrophysical parame-
ters to reasonable values. One could try to find a prior volume on
the computational parameters that translates to the desired prior
volume on the astrophysical parameters, but given the complex-
ity of Equations (10)–(12), this is difficult and would introduce
a non-trivial prior distribution. Instead, we choose to simply re-
ject the points that translate to values outside the desired astro-
physical priors by assigning them a probability of zero. We ac-
cept combinations of parameters that lead to values of rs and rc
such that 10−2 rs ≤ rc ≤ rs and 10−3 rs ≤ Ri ≤ 103 rs, where Ri
is the projected radius of a tracer, for all tracers. These ranges
are those over which the MGEs were fitted and should be suffi-
ciently large to encompass all reasonable models for Eri 2. These
cuts of unphysical and unreasonable parameter combinations are
performed after sampling from the prior distribution, during the
evaluation of the likelihood function."
"For the FDM profile, which is more complex due to the vari-
able transition radius between the two different regimes, we were
not able to find a similar parametrization in densities only. We
therefore use a computational parametrization in the following
parameters: the logarithm log10 ρCDM,100 B log10 ρCDM(100 pc)
of the outer density profile at 100 pc, the logarithmic slope
αCDM,100 B (d ln ρCDM/d ln r)(100 pc) of the outer density pro-
file at 100 pc, the logarithm log10(rsol/rs) of the ratio between
the soliton radius and scale radius, and the logarithm log10 ε ="

"We use MultiNest (Feroz & Hobson 2008; Feroz et al. 2009,
2019) through the PyMultiNest interface (Buchner et al. 2014)
to find the posterior likelihood distribution for the parameters of
each model, which consist of the aforementioned profile param-
eters and the systemic velocity v0 against which the kinematics
are offset, using uniform priors over large ranges of values, listed
in Table 1. MultiNest also calculates the Bayesian evidence for
each model, allowing us to compare the models with each other.
The wide priors do not significantly impact the Bayesian evi-
dence calculation because they extend to regions of parameter
space with very low likelihoods. Since we exclude some models
from consideration, one might be concerned that this compro-
mises the Bayesian evidence calculation of MultiNest. We per-
formed a few mock runs of MultiNest with a simple likelihood
function to test whether our forcing of likelihoods to zero would
affect the evidence calculation, as opposed to limiting the prior
volume. We found that some of the evidence estimators are in-
deed biased, but not the nested sampling global log-evidence.
We will therefore use this estimator to evaluate the Bayesian ev-
idence of the models."
2.4. pyGravSphere
"The second method we use to determine density profiles is Grav-
Sphere (Read & Steger 2017). Like the classical Jeans analysis,
the GravSphere method directly calculates the dispersion of the
measured line-of-sight velocities in bins at different radii, as op-
posed to the non-binned treatment of velocity expectation val-
ues done in JAM. What GravSphere adds, is that it can work
with non-constant velocity anisotropies and that it calculates two
higher-order moments in the radial bins, the virial shape pa-
rameters (VSPs; Merrifield & Kent 1990). These should par-
tially break the degeneracy between mass and anisotropy that
is present when only using the dispersion. A drawback is that"

"Notes. The radii of the bins correspond to the average projected radius

"GravSphere only allows for spherical symmetry, whereas JAM
can handle axisymmetric distributions."
"We use the pyGravSphere implementation (Genina et al.
2020b) of the GravSphere method. We provide it with the same
kinematic information as CJAM. To determine the tracer profile,
we make a mock photometric catalogue drawing stars from the
same exponential distribution as assumed for CJAM. We modify
pyGravSphere to make the bin size configurable and to add re-
maining sources to the last (outer) bin. We divide the 92 sources
with line-of-sight velocities into bins of 11, making eight bins,
with four extra stars in the last bin. We also implement new esti-
mators of the velocity moments and their uncertainties, designed
to minimize the biases present in cases with large measurement
uncertainties and few data. These unbiased estimators and their
derivation are introduced in Appendix C. The estimators return a
negative result for the velocity dispersion in bins 3 and 6. These
bins are therefore discarded by pyGravSphere, leaving six bins
in the analysis. We do not use the VSPs because there are too
few stars per bin to accurately estimate their uncertainties. We
explain this in more detail in Appendix C. Lastly, we modify
pyGravSphere to place the estimators at the average projected
radius of the stars in the corresponding bins, instead of at the
maximum radius. The modified pyGravSphere binning code is
made publicly available2 as a stand-alone program called hkbin.
We show the binned data that pyGravSphere uses in Table 2. It is
these binned dispersion measurements to which pyGravSphere
fits, while CJAM fits directly to the unbinned velocity data in
Table A.1."
"There are a number of models built into pyGravSphere to
represent the density profiles of dark matter and stellar tracers
and the velocity anisotropy profile. We choose to model the ve-
locity anisotropy with the model of Baes & Van Hese (2007),"

Hernquist–Zhao profile, we also look at the NFW profile with
(α, β, γ) = (1, 3, 1), which is the same profile as for the CJAM
CDM model. The broken power-law profile and Hernquist–
Zhao profile allow for steeper slopes at large radii than the
NFW/CDM, SIDM, and FDM models. Steep outer slopes can
be a sign of stripping or truncation of the halo, for example due
to tidal interactions with the Milky Way. The broken power-law
profile should be especially suited for modelling truncated pro-
files because of its segmented nature."
"The pyGravSphere code uses emcee (Foreman-Mackey et al.
2013) to constrain the parameter space. The use of this package,
as well as the efficient implementations of the profile functions,
makes pyGravSphere a fast code despite the high number of pa-
rameters it tries to constrain. Unfortunately, the use of an MCMC
method makes comparison between models harder, as it does not
readily provide Bayesian evidence. We remedy this by comput-
ing an approximation of the Bayesian evidence on the Markov
chains with MCEvidence (Heavens et al. 2017), using the esti-
mator based on the nearest neighbours."
"Due to the limited quantity of data and the degeneracies be-
tween some of the parameters, we have extended some of the
default pyGravSphere priors on the dark-matter parameters. We
set the minimum value of rs to the projected radius of the inner-
most datum, rounded to the nearest decade, because we are not
able to probe any smaller scales than the minimum radius. The
maximum characteristic density is adjusted accordingly to not
be a limiting bound. Conversely, we increase the maximum scale
radius and decrease the minimum characteristic density. We in-
crease the maximum allowed values of the Hernquist–Zhao β
parameter and power-law γi to allow for steeper declines in den-
sity. For the same reason, we effectively remove the restriction
on the difference between consecutive power-law slopes by set-
ting the maximum difference between consecutive slopes equal
to the difference between the prior minimum and maximum.
Thus we effectively require only that the steepness of the broken"

ina et al. (2020b): 103 walkers, making 2 × 104 steps, of which
the first half is discarded as burn-in, and using 100 integration
points. Similarly, we analyse the resulting chains by first dis-
carding samples with a χ2 more than ten times the minimum χ2
and then drawing 105 samples from the remaining samples. The
best-fitting combination of parameters have a minimum χ2 less
than 2 for all three models, or a minimum reduced χ2 less than
1/3, which indicates all models are good fits to the data."
3. Results
"Using the two analysis methods presented above, we sample the
parameter spaces of our dark matter–density profiles given the
kinematical measurements of Eri 2. We break down the presen-
tation of the results in several parts. In Sect. 3.1 we show the
constraints on the density profiles and dark-matter models. This
is followed by the presentation of the recovered density profiles
in Sect. 3.2, together with derived halo masses, concentrations,
mass-to-light ratios, and astrophysical J and D factors. We then
compare different dark-matter models using Bayesian evidence
(Sect. 3.3). We remind the reader that each model is represented
by the same colour in every figure."
3.1. Parameter estimation
"We show the constraints in the astrophysical parametrization of
the CJAM CDM model in Figure 2 and the constraints in the
microphysical parametrization of the SIDM and FDM models
in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. The constraints in the computa-
tional parametrizations for all three models and the astrophysical
parametrizations for the SIDM and FDM models are displayed in
Appendix D. Below we present and compare the constraints on
the most important profile parameters. Quantities derived from
the profiles, such as virial mass and concentration, will be pre-
sented in Section 3.2 together with the recovered profiles."

The shape of the Hernquist–Zhao profile is thus consistent with
the NFW profile, albeit with large uncertainty, while the shape of
the broken power-law profile deviates at large radii by over 2σ.
The constraints on the velocity anisotropies are in general very
weak, with an apparent trend for positive (radial) anisotropy in
the case of the Hernquist–Zhao profile and for the centre in the
case of the NFW profile. At large radii the NFW profile seems
to prefer isotropy. The broken power-law model profile, on the
other hand, prefers isotropy for the centre and negative (tangen-
tial) anisotropy for the outer radii. The transition between these
possibly different regimes of inner and outer velocity anisotropy
is essentially unconstrained."

"The two methods, CJAM and pyGravSphere, that we use to con-
strain the density profile of Eri 2 have one profile model in com-
mon: the CDM/NFW profile. By comparing the constraints on
this profile model obtained with the two methods, we can gauge
the influence of the different assumptions that go into the meth-
ods. In Figure 8 we show the recovered CDM/NFW density pro-
files as a function of radius in the form of the median density and
68-% confidence interval at every radius. Although there are dif-
ferences, most noticeably that pyGravSphere prefers lower cen-
tral densities and higher outer densities than CJAM, the overall"

J and D factors are generally consistent within their uncertain-
ties, though there is some tension for the D factor between the
SIDM and broken-power law models."
3.3. Model comparison
"We have so far placed constraints on astrophysical and micro-
physical parameters assuming different models and informally
compared the different models based on the recovered profiles.
The next question to ask, is which model provides the best fit to
the data, which may indicate a preference for one form of dark
matter over another. In Tables 6 and 7 we present the Bayesian
evidence Z for the CJAM and pyGravSphere models, respec-
tively. The use of Bayesian evidence ensures that the different
models employed with the same method can be fairly compared,"

freedom. We assume the prior probabilities of the models are
equal. Models are compared by taking the ratio of their Bayesian
evidence Z or equivalently the difference of their log10(Z), with
the model with the largest Z being favoured. The ratios or dif-
ferences are interpreted using a scale; we will use the scale of
Jeffreys (1961, their Appendix B). According to this scale, a ra-
tio of 100 or ∆ log10(Z) = 2 is required for a decisive result. It
is not possible to compare a model from one table to one from
the other table because of the differences in the method of CJAM
and pyGravSphere."
"In all cases, the differences between the models are small.
Among the CJAM models, the FDM profile has the largest
Bayesian evidence. The Bayes factors indicate that the prefer-"
"Article number, page 13 of 24"

"ence of FDM over SIDM is strong, but by no means significant,
while FDM is only barely preferred over CDM. The preference
for CDM over SIDM is substantial. It is therefore not possible
to rule out any of the three dark-matter theories with the cur-
rent data. For the pyGravSphere models, the broken power-law
model is substantially preferred over the NFW model and the
Hernquist–Zhao model. The modest strength of the evidence for
the broken power-law model indicates that moving away from
an NFW-like profile with a logarithmic slope of −3 at large radii
is not required at present. Thus we find no conclusive evidence
for tidal stripping or truncation at the probed radii. Further data
at larger radii will help constrain the effect of tidal stripping."
4. Discussion
"The mass–concentration relation between the virial mass M200
and the concentration parameter c200 B r200/rs of Dutton &
Macciò (2014) predicts log10 c200 ≈ 1.3 for an NFW halo with
a virial mass equal to that of Eri 2 at redshift zero, with a scat-
ter of 0.11 dex, but was calibrated on a simulation with signif-
icantly higher virial masses (M200 & 1012 h−1 M�). Using the
semi-analytical relation of COMMAH (Correa et al. 2015a,b,c)
we calculate a predicted concentration log10 c200 ≈ 1.2. Our de-
terminations of log10 c200 for the CJAM models are more than
one standard deviation higher. As M200 and c200 are among our
less well constrained parameters, we also perform a compari-
son in the space of two better constrained parameters for the
CDM/NFW profile of CJAM. Given the recovered rs, we pre-
dict the density at 100 pc assuming the Dutton & Macciò (2014)
mass–concentration relation, ρ(100 pc) = 107.95"
"+0.34

"−3.
Compared to the recovered ρ2 = 108.92"
"+0.29
−0.26 M� kpc"
"−3, this pre-
diction is over two combined standard deviations lower, indicat-
ing the tension between M200 and c200 is even larger than sug-
gested at face value. Satellite dwarf galaxies are biased towards
larger concentrations because higher-concentration dwarf galax-
ies are more likely to survive accretion by a Milky Way–mass
galaxy (Nadler et al. 2018). This bias might explain (part of) the
tension we see."
"Using the stellar mass–to–halo mass relation of Behroozi
et al. (2013) with the stellar mass-to-light ratio of 1.56 de-
rived in Paper I, we expect a virial mass-to-light ratio Υ200 ≈
102.9 M� L−1� for Eri 2. Most of our models agree with this value,
but there is a substantial tension for the SIDM and broken power-
law models. Our half-light mass-to-light ratios Υ1/2 are all con-
sistent with the value 420+210"
"−140 M� L
−1
� found by Li et al. (2017)."
"The values that we find for the astrophysical factors are typ-
ical for dwarf spheroidal and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (Bon-
nivard et al. 2015a; Alvarez et al. 2020). Eri 2 is therefore not the
most interesting single target for observations concerning anni-
hilation and decay signals, but it may be useful in a joint analysis
of dwarf galaxies. Bonnivard et al. (2015b) have shown that the
astrophysical factors can be biased by a factor of a few when an
incorrect light profile model or halo triaxiality is assumed. We
have assumed the light profile is exponential and the dark-matter
halo is spherical, therefore this bias may be present."
"The self-interaction coefficient Γ can be described in terms
of more conventional parameters by examining Equation (2) and
considering that the mass change is −2m per annihilation event,
with m being the mass of the dark-matter particle. Assuming a
cross-section σ and a typical velocity v, we derive"
"Γ =
2σv
m"
. (23)
"Our constraints on the effective self-interaction co-
efficients therefore translate to σ/m < 1.1 ×
10−36 ( f /10)−1(v/10 km s−1)−1 cm2 eV−1 c2 at the
68-% confidence level and σ/m < 4.1 ×
10−36 ( f /10)−1(v/10 km s−1)−1 cm2 eV−1 c2 at the 95-%
confidence level, where f = 10 and v = 10 km s−1
are of the right order of magnitude for ultra-faint dwarf
galaxies. Much stronger constraints exist from com-
bined observations of dwarf galaxies with the Fermi/LAT
and MAGIC gamma-ray telescopes (MAGIC collabo-
ration et al. 2016), equivalent to upper limits as low as
∼10−43 (v/10 km s−1) cm2 eV−1 c2. These constraints, however,
are only valid for 101 GeV c−2 ≤ m ≤ 105 GeV c−2 and depend
on the annihilation products, while our constraint is valid for
all masses and annihilation products. The results from density
profiles and gamma-ray searches are therefore complementary."
"Lin & Loeb (2016) remarked that Γ can also represent self-
interaction through scattering. Dark-matter particles can be scat-
tered from the dense inner regions, where interactions are most
likely, to the outer regions, where their contribution to the lo-
cal density is negligible due to the much larger area. This is ef-
fectively equivalent to annihilation of dark-matter particles, but
the strength of the effect depends on how frequent a scattering
event leads to particles leaving the centre of the dark-matter halo.
This frequency is currently unknown, therefore it is not possi-
ble to convert Γ to a scattering cross section. Other profiles for
SIDM exist that are designed specifically for a scattering self-
interaction, such as the profiles of Kaplinghat et al. (2014) and
Kaplinghat et al. (2016), but these are outside the scope of this
paper. Hayashi et al. (2020) used the latter profile on 23 UFDs
using literature kinematics and found no evidence for a non-zero
self-interaction in these galaxies."
"Our lower limit on the FDM-particle mass of ma > 4.0 ×
10−21 eV c−2 at the 95-% confidence level is incompatible with
some results for other dwarf galaxies. Chen et al. (2017) find

"−22 eV c−2 for the ultra-
diffuse galaxy Antlia II and ma = 1.07±0.08×10−22 eV c−2 when
combined with four classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies. This dis-
crepancy might indicate that the cores in the literature galaxies,
which have higher masses than Eri 2, are formed by baryonic
processes (Brooks & Zolotov 2014; Di Cintio et al. 2014b) and
not (entirely) by FDM. Other constraints on FDM from Eri 2
have been derived from the survival of its star cluster (Marsh &
Niemeyer 2019; El-Zant et al. 2020). These constraints rule out
at least the mass range between ∼10−20 eV c−2 and ∼10−19 eV c−2
and can likely be extended further, with some caveats."
"In simulations of spherically symmetric and relaxed FDM
haloes a scaling relation between the size of the soliton, the mass
of the FDM particle, and the virial mass of the halo is found

density profile is larger than ∼0.2–0.25, a cluster in a tight orbit
would be tidally destroyed, while it would be unlikely to observe
a cluster in a wide orbit so close in projection to the centre of
Eri 2. The cluster could survive if it is stationary at the centre of
the dark-matter halo of Eri 2, but that would mean that the pho-
tometric and gravitational centre of Eri 2 do not coincide. Our
estimates of the inner slope are inconclusive in this respect: on
the one hand, the broken power-law profile prefers a core, while
on the other, the Hernquist–Zhao profile disagrees by nearly 2σ."
"We have performed our pyGravSphere analysis with differ-
ent numbers of stars per kinematic bin: 9 (the default of pyGrav-
Sphere for 92 stars in total), 11 (our fiducial analysis presented
in this paper), 15, and 23. The recovered profiles for 11 and 15
stars per bin were consistent; we chose to use 11 stars per bin as
it has more bins and could therefore potentially better capture the
behaviour at small radii. The pyGravSphere profiles for 9 stars
per bin had a much larger scale radius and lower characteristic
density, inconsistent with both the 11 and 15 bin profiles and the
CJAM profiles. Binning the stars by 23 yielded only two bins
with a positive intrinsic velocity dispersion, which is too few for
pyGravSphere to run. Therefore, as far as we can test, the pro-
files recovered by pyGravSphere seem stable with respect to the
number of stars per bin, as long as a minimum number of stars
per bin is met. We meet this requirement for our fiducial analysis
with 11 stars per bin."
"Dynamical mass estimates are only correct if the system is
in dynamical equilibrium. As we argued in Paper I, given that
Eri 2 is currently close to its pericentre (Fritz et al. 2018) yet
still 366 kpc removed from us (Crnojević et al. 2016), it has
not closely approached the Milky Way. Neither have any tidal
features been detected in deep imaging (Crnojević et al. 2016).
Furthermore, the stars in Eri 2 are dominated by an old popula-
tion (Simon et al. 2020). Therefore we do not expect a significant
departure from dynamical equilibrium due to either tidal interac-
tions with the Milky Way or stellar feedback."
"Another issue that can affect dynamical mass estimates is the
presence of binary stars. Due to its orbital motion, the line-of-
sight velocity of a binary star can change over time. Instead of
the systemic velocity of the binary system, one sees another con-
tribution on top of that, which may inflate measurements of ve-
locity dispersion. We have observed our fields at multiple epochs
for over a year. By combining the exposures before the data
reduction, the velocity variation of short-period binary stars is
blended into broadened spectral features. These should have the
same centroid as the binary-systemic line-of-sight velocities and
should therefore not impact our measurements. Longer-period
binary systems typically have lower line-of-sight velocity devia-
tions, so they are not expected to be a significant problem. Nev-
ertheless, there remains much to be studied regarding the binary-
star populations of UFDs."
"We have assumed that the dark-matter halo of Eri 2 is spher-
ical, even though the stellar distribution is not. This could poten-
tially bias the dark matter–density profiles. Read & Steger (2017)
have shown that GravSphere can become slightly biased for tri-
axial haloes, but the bias on the density profile is within the 95-%
confidence interval in most cases, and so is the mass within the
half-light radius. This test was done with mock data resembling
classical dwarf galaxies; as we have less data and larger mea-
surement uncertainties, we expect any bias on the pyGravSphere
density profiles due to triaxiality to be even smaller relative to the
confidence intervals than for the mock classical dwarfs. As we"
"obtain similar results with CJAM and pyGravSphere, the CJAM
density profiles should also not be significantly biased."
"There is some uncertainty in the position of the centre of
Eri 2. Mis-centring the spatial coordinates can affect the derived
density profile, because the density measured at the centre of
the coordinate system will be lower than the density at the true
centre of the galaxy. This effect can lead to cored density profiles
being measured for cuspy dark-matter haloes, or to core radii
being biased to larger values for cored haloes. We do not detect
a core or soliton for Eri 2 and provide upper limits for the core
and soliton radii. Our upper limits on core and soliton radii could
therefore be biased high, but this would strengthen rather than
weaken the confidence level of these limits."
5. Conclusions
"We have presented new data from the MUSE-Faint survey of
the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Eridanus 2 (MV = −7.1, M∗ ≈
9× 104 M�). Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies have the lowest baryonic
fractions of all known galaxies; it is expected that the baryonic
contents have not altered the dark matter–density profiles. We
have modelled the dark matter–density profile of Eridanus 2 us-
ing stellar kinematics from MUSE-Faint and from the literature
(92 stars in total) to constrain the properties of self-interacting
and fuzzy dark matter and to compare these dark-matter mod-
els against each other and against cold dark matter. For mod-
elling the density profiles we have used both CJAM and pyGrav-
Sphere, two codes that use different methods and assumptions,
to test whether the recovery of the density profile is sensitive to
the approach that is used."
"We constrained the core radius of the self-interacting
dark-matter profile to rc < 47 pc (68-% confidence level)
or rc < 117 pc (95-% confidence level). This translates
into a constraint on the effective self-interaction coefficient:
f Γ < 2.2 × 10−29 cm3 s−1 eV−1 c2 (68-% confidence level)
or f Γ < 8.1 × 10−29 cm3 s−1 eV−1 c2 (95-% confidence
level). These effective self-interaction coefficients are equiva-
lent to the specific annihilation cross sections σ/m < 1.1 ×
10−36 ( f /10)−1(v/10 km s−1)−1 cm2 eV−1 c2 (68-% confidence
level) or σ/m < 4.1×10−36 ( f /10)−1(v/10 km s−1)−1 cm2 eV−1 c2
(95-% confidence level). These constraints apply for all dark
matter–particle masses and are therefore complementary to the
results from gamma-ray searches for annihilation signatures,
which provide stronger constraints in a limited mass range."
"We constrained the soliton radius of the fuzzy dark-matter
profile to rsol < 7.2 pc (68-% confidence level) or rsol < 102 pc
(95-% confidence level). The equivalent constraint on the mass
of the ultra-light dark-matter particle is ma > 5.9×−20 eV c−2 (68-
% confidence level) or ma > 4.0×10−21 eV c−2 (95-% confidence
level). These constraints are inconsistent with particle masses
for larger dwarf galaxies, which may indicate the cores in these
larger dwarf galaxies are not caused by fuzzy dark matter."
"We could not consistently constrain the velocity anisotropy
of Eridanus 2. CJAM and pyGravSphere prefer different values
for the inner and outer slope of the density profile when these are
free parameters of the profile, therefore we cannot draw conclu-
sions about the survival or location of the star cluster."
"We found that CJAM and pyGravSphere recover similar dark
matter–density profiles for Eridanus 2 when a cold dark matter /
Navarro–Frenk–White profile is assumed in both cases. All pro-
files of CJAM and pyGravSphere are consistent within their un-
certainties. The uncertainty on the profile and the difference be-
tween the profiles become larger near the centre of Eridanus 2,
where the kinematic data are sparse."

a galaxy of this virial mass, but this may be because Eridanus 2
is a satellite of the Milky Way."
"We found a weak preference for fuzzy dark matter over cold
dark matter and substantial evidence for cold dark matter over
self-interacting dark matter. The evidence to prefer fuzzy dark
matter over self-interacting dark matter is strong. This indicates
a preference for a cusp above a core, but also for a soliton above
a cusp. None of the models are preferred decisively over any
other, therefore it is not possible to rule out cold dark matter,
self-interacting dark matter, or fuzzy dark matter."
"With MUSE-Faint we have been able to significantly in-
crease the number of stars with spectroscopy inside the half-
light radius of Eridanus 2 and have extended the available data
to smaller radii. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to obtain
a large sample of stellar line-of-sight velocities in such a faint
and far-away system. Improvements of the constraints on the
inner dark matter–density profile of Eridanus 2 and its impli-
cations for the nature and properties of dark matter would re-
quire deeper observations or observations at a higher spectral
resolution. Deeper observations could improve the line-of-sight
velocity measurements and could provide access to fainter stars,
but would be a costly undertaking. A higher spectral resolution
could significantly decrease the velocity uncertainties, but cur-
rent high-resolution spectrographs are not able to reach the spa-
tial resolution required for these crowded systems. It would also
be valuable to extend the current study to multiple ultra-faint
dwarf galaxies and test whether our conclusions also hold for
other systems."

"Appendix B: Multi-Gaussian expansions of the
density profiles"
"The JAM method uses MGEs of the density profiles to speed
up its calculations. The MGE itself is expensive, but for simple
profiles it has to be computed only once. Some of our profiles,
however, have parameters that modify their shape, which neces-
sitates a different MGE for each combination of values of these
parameters. Because fitting the MGE separately for every Monte
Carlo sample would be prohibitively expensive, we instead in-
terpolate between MGEs fitted at a limited number of points in
the parameter space. In this appendix we describe the fitting and
interpolation procedures to obtain MGEs of our profiles."
"For a scale-invariant profile like the NFW profile, the MGE
can be done only once, and the amplitude and standard devia-
tions of the Gaussians can be rescaled to fit the NFW profile
for any combination of characteristic density and scale radius.
We perform the MGE on the NFW profile with 16 Gaussians,
by least-squares fitting at 64 logarithmically spaced points from
10−3 rs to 102 rs, weighting the residuals with the value of the
NFW profile. The range of points chosen for fitting is deliber-
ately broad, in order to be sure that the observations are con-
tained within the limits of this range for any reasonable choice
of rs. In addition, the projection of the profile on the sky has as
a result that any radius larger than the projected radius is ob-
served along the line of sight, and therefore the MGE needs to
also reproduce the profile at radii larger than the largest projected
radius. The resulting MGE is an accurate reproduction over the
fitting range with deviations on the order of at most 1 % in both
density and cumulative mass."
"The distribution of tracers is fit with the same number of
Gaussians to the exponential profile found by Crnojević et al.
(2016), which has an effective radius of 2.31 arcmin and a cen-
tral surface brightness of 27.2 mag. We also adopt their position
angle of 72.6 deg and use their ellipticity � = 0.48 to calculate
a flattening of q = 1 − � = 0.52. To reduce the computational
complexity we fix the inclination to the default value of 90◦, cor-
responding to an edge-on system. The exponential drop-off is
hard to reproduce over large orders of magnitude in radius, so
we limit the fit to the range of 10−3 Re to 10 Re. A smaller range
suffices here as we know the value of Re from photometry. The
accuracy of the MGE is sub-percent over the fitting range for
the density and for at least an extra magnitude of larger radii for
the cumulative mass. The resulting fit is valid for all dark-matter
models and does not need to be rescaled for different dark-matter
parameters."
"Unfortunately, a single MGE is not possible for the SIDM
and FDM profiles. The computational expense of redoing the
MGE for each combination of profile parameters is prohibitively
large, therefore we need to approximate the MGE with a faster
method. For the SIDM profile, we perform the same procedure
as for the NFW profile for 101 logarithmically spaced values
of the core radius, from 10−2 rs to rs. We exclude models with
a core radius larger than the NFW scale radius, because such
large cores are not expected giving existing work on dark matter–
density profiles in dwarf galaxies (see e.g. the high-resolution
simulations analysed by Lazar et al. 2020). The amplitudes and
standard deviations of the 16 Gaussians vary smoothly with the
core size, so we interpolate over these 101 results, supplemented
with the NFW profile corresponding to a core size of zero, with
quadratic splines. The 16 Gaussians returned by supplying the
interpolator with a core radius can be rescaled with the charac-
teristic density and scale radius, as for the NFW profile. We find
that the resulting interpolated MGE is sufficiently close to a real"
"MGE: the deviation from the original profile is still less than one
percent. The interpolated MGE is also sufficiently fast for our
purposes."
"The FDM profile has the largest number of parameters of all
our models and is therefore the most complex to expand into
Gaussians. In addition to this, the profile proposed by Marsh
& Pop (2015) has a sharp transition from the soliton part to
the NFW part, which is very hard to approximate with a sum
of Gaussians. Since this sharp transition was assumed for sake
of simplicity and the lack of detailed knowledge about the true
transition, we find it justified to make a different simplifying as-
sumption that suits our needs better. We approximate the FDM
profile with the sum of a soliton and a cored NFW profile, the
latter being the same profile that we use to model SIDM:"
"ρ̃FDM(r; ρ̃sol,0, rsol, ρ0, rc, rs) =
ρsol(r; ρ̃sol,0, rsol) + ρSIDM(r; ρ0, rc, rs), (B.1)"
"with ρ̃sol,0 = ρsol,0−ρSIDM(0; ρ0, rc, rs) to ensure the characteristic
density is correct. We find this is a good approximation of ρFDM
for a certain value of rc, depending on the values of the other pa-
rameters. Minimizing the difference between the two profiles at
64 logarithmically spaced points from 10−3 rsol to 102 rsol while
varying rsol/rs over 101 logarithmically spaced values between
10−2 and 1, and ε over 101 logarithmically spaced values be-
tween 10−5 and 1/2, yields values of rc roughly following the
relation"
"rc = C0rsolε
C1 , (B.2)"
"where C0 and C1 are constants. Enforcing this relation and re-
peating the minimization gives C0 ≈ 0.281 and C1 ≈ −0.0923.
By construction the profiles are identical at the centre and to-
wards infinity. The largest deviation is at the transition radius,
but is very localized, and considering the original profile is only
an approximation at this point as well, this is not a problem. We
then approximate the soliton profile with 16 Gaussians by fit-
ting to 64 logarithmically spaced points from 10−3 rsol to 2rsol,
at which point the soliton density has declined so far that it is
negligible compared to the NFW part of the FDM profile. The
soliton and SIDM fits can be individually rescaled depending on
the parameters of the profile, and are then appended to form a
MGE for the FDM profile. With this result we can approximate
the original ρFDM with the MGE of ρ̃FDM. At the transition radius
the deviation can be very large, but elsewhere the accuracy is on
the level of a few percent’s deviation from the original density
profile."
"Appendix C: Unbiased estimators of intrinsic
velocity moments"
"With a small number of stars and relatively high uncertainties
on their velocities, careful estimation of the observed velocity
moments and the correction term for measurement uncertainties
is needed for a reliable dynamical analysis of ultra-faint dwarf
galaxies. In this appendix we derive unbiased estimators of the
second and fourth intrinsic velocity moments as well as an es-
timator for the uncertainty on the second intrinsic velocity mo-
ment. The estimators are exact when each velocity measurement
has the same measurement uncertainty and are approximations
when the measurement uncertainties are different."
"Suppose we have N velocity measurements v1, v2, . . . , vN
with measurement uncertainties ε1, ε2, . . . , εN . The veloc-
ities can be divided into bins with n measurements:"

"v j+1, v j+2, . . . , v j+n. We assume the intrinsic – as opposed to the
observed – velocities in each bin are drawn from the same dis-
tribution, and that the distributions of each bin have the same
mean: the systemic velocity. Furthermore, we also assume the
measurement errors are normally distributed around zero with
a standard deviation equal to the measurement uncertainty. We
are prevented from straightforwardly calculating the moments of
the observed velocities by two effects: the measurement errors
inflate the observed velocity moments, leading to a difference
between the intrinsic and observed distributions, and the sam-
ple moments are biased estimators of the true moments of the
observed distributions."
"In the case of equal uncertainties on all measured velocities,
the unbiased estimators of the intrinsic velocity moments can be
determined exactly. For now we will further assume that all mea-

from a single distribution, the expected values of the second and
fourth moments of this distribution are the averages of the same

bution. These are unknown, but we can approximate them with
the h statistics:"
"µ2(h2,int) ≈
(n − 1)h4 − (n − 3)h22"
"n(n − 1)
. (C.21)"
"Even though the h statistics are symmetrically unbiased estima-
tors of the true central moments, the above approximation will
have a bias because it is not a linear transformation. A further
bias will be introduced by taking the square root to arrive at an
estimate for the uncertainty:"
"ε(h2,int) ≈
√
µ2(h2,int). (C.22)"
"In a similar way, we can estimate the uncertainty on the
fourth intrinsic moment. This calculation depends, however, on
even higher moments, up to the eighth. With the small number
of stars per bin in this paper, it is not feasible to calculate this
uncertainty to a good accuracy. As the virial shape parameters
depend on the fourth velocity moments, the uncertainty on the
virial shape parameters will also be challenging to constrain. We
therefore opt not to use the virial shape parameters in this paper."
"Calculating the above estimators and uncertainty on mock
data drawn from known generalized normal distributions repre-
senting the intrinsic velocity distributions and normal distribu-
tions representing the measurement uncertainties, both similar
to the properties of the observed data, shows that the intrinsic
moments and the uncertainty on the second moment can on aver-
age be recovered with at most a few percent bias, which is much
smaller than the statistical uncertainties. However, it is possi-
ble that by the subtraction of the cumulant correction the esti-
mated moments become negative, whereas from equation (C.12)
it is clear that even moments of real-valued distributions must
be non-negative. This is unavoidable when the statistical uncer-
tainty of a moment is similar to or larger than the moment itself."
"Appendix D: Supplementary figures of CJAM
parameter constraints"
"In this appendix we show the CJAM constraints on the dark
matter–density profile of Eri 2 in additional parametrizations.
Fig. D.1 shows constraints for the CDM model in the compu-
tational parametrization. Figs. D.2 and D.3 show constraints for
SIDM and FDM, respectively, in the computational and astro-
physical parametrizations."

parison between models and data-derived estimates. In Fig. E.1"

the median and 68-% confidence interval."
"we display this comparison. In addition to the CJAM mod-
els with isotropic velocities and the pyGravSphere models with
anisotropic velocities, used in the main body of this paper, we
also display pyGravSphere models with isotropic velocities for
comparison. The assumption on the velocity distribution has a
large effect on the uncertainty in the intrinsic velocity dispersion
at small radii, but the profiles are in all cases consistent with each
other within their uncertainties. To compare the recovered pro-
files to the measured data, we show the estimated intrinsic veloc-
ity dispersion and its uncertainty in each pyGravSphere bin. For
pyGravSphere we do not display bins with negative estimates
(which are unphysical). We remind the reader that CJAM does
not bin the velocity data; CJAM does not directly fit to the esti-
mates displayed here. For CJAM we indicate the negative esti-
mates as well."
"The intrinsic velocity dispersion profiles clarify the origin of
some of the differences in the density profiles. The difference in
the scale radius, with CJAM preferring smaller values than py-
GravSphere, seems to be driven by the outer bins. The unbinned
analysis of CJAM recovers an intrinsic dispersion profile that
is lower at large radii, while pyGravSphere prefers models that
are flatter. The higher density of the broken power-law profile
around 100 pc is also visible in the dispersion profile and seems
to be the result of overfitting to the estimators."
