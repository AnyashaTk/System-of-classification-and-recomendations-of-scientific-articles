"ABSTRACT
We present a first 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of convective oxygen and neon shell burning in a non-rotating
18ùëÄÔøΩ star shortly before core collapse to study the generation of magnetic fields in supernova progenitors. We also run a purely
hydrodynamic control simulation to gauge the impact of the magnetic fields on the convective flow and on convective boundary
mixing. After about 17 convective turnover times, the magnetic field is approaching saturation levels in the oxygen shell with
an average field strength of ‚àº1010 G, and does not reach kinetic equipartition. The field remains dominated by small to medium
scales, and the dipole field strength at the base of the oxygen shell is only 109 G. The angle-averaged diagonal components of the
Maxwell stress tensor mirror those of the Reynolds stress tensor, but are about one order of magnitude smaller. The shear flow
at the oxygen-neon shell interface creates relatively strong fields parallel to the convective boundary, which noticeably inhibit
the turbulent entrainment of neon into the oxygen shell. The reduced ingestion of neon lowers the nuclear energy generation rate
in the oxygen shell and thereby slightly slows down the convective flow. Aside from this indirect effect, we find that magnetic
fields do not appreciably alter the flow inside the oxygen shell. We discuss the implications of our results for the subsequent
core-collapse supernova and stress the need for longer simulations, resolution studies, and an investigation of non-ideal effects
for a better understanding of magnetic fields in supernova progenitors."

1 INTRODUCTION
"Rigorous three-dimensional (3D) simulations of neutrino-driven
core-collapse supernovae have become highly successful in recent
years (e.g., Melson et al. 2015; Lentz et al. 2015; Takiwaki et al.
2014; Burrows et al. 2019), and have made clear headway in explain-
ing the properties of supernova explosions and the compact objects
born in these events (M√ºller et al. 2017; M√ºller et al. 2019; Burrows
et al. 2020; Powell & M√ºller 2020; Bollig et al. 2020; M√ºller 2020).
The latest 3D models are able to reproduce a range of explosion en-
ergies up to 1051erg (Bollig et al. 2020), and yield neutron star birth
masses, kicks, and spins largely compatible with the population of
observed young pulsars (M√ºller et al. 2019; Burrows et al. 2020).
A number of ingredients have contributed, or have the potential"
"to contribute, to make modern neutrino-driven explosion models
more robust. Various microphysical effects such as reduced neutrino
scattering opacities due to nucleon strangeness (Melson et al. 2015)
and nucleon correlations at high densities (Horowitz et al. 2017;
Bollig et al. 2017; Burrows et al. 2018), muonisation (Bollig et al.
2017), and large effective nucleon masses (Yasin et al. 2020) can be
conducive to neutrino-driven shock revival.
In addition, a particularly important turning point has been the"
"advent of 3D progenitor models and the recognition that aspheric-
ities seeded prior to collapse can precipitate ‚Äúperturbation-aided‚Äù
neutrino-driven explosions (Couch & Ott 2013; Couch et al. 2015;"

"M√ºller & Janka 2015; M√ºller 2016; M√ºller et al. 2017; M√ºller 2020;
Bollig et al. 2020). In perturbation-aided explosions, the moderately
subsonic solenoidal velocity perturbation in active convective shells
at the pre-collapse stage with Mach numbers of order ‚àº0.1 (Collins
et al. 2018) are transformed into strong density and pressure pertur-
bations at the shock (M√ºller & Janka 2015; Takahashi & Yamada
2014; Takahashi et al. 2016; Abdikamalov & Foglizzo 2020), and ef-
fectively strengthen the violent non-radial flow behind the shock that
develops due to convective instability (Herant et al. 1994; Burrows
et al. 1995; Janka & M√ºller 1995, 1996) and the standing accretion
shock instability (Blondin et al. 2003; Foglizzo et al. 2007), thereby
supporting neutrino-driven shock revival."
"The discovery of perturbation-aided explosions has greatly en-
hanced interest in multi-dimensional models of late convective burn-
ing stages in massive stars. Several studies have by now followed the
immediate pre-collapse phase of silicon and/or oxygen shell burning
to collapse in 3D (Couch et al. 2015;M√ºller 2016;M√ºller et al. 2016;
M√ºller et al. 2019; Yoshida et al. 2019; Yadav et al. 2020; McNeill
& M√ºller 2020; Yoshida et al. 2020). In addition, there has been a
long-standing strand of research since the 1990s (e.g., Bazan & Ar-
nett 1994; Baz√°n & Arnett 1997; Meakin & Arnett 2006, 2007b,a;
M√ºller et al. 2016; Jones et al. 2017; Cristini et al. 2017, 2019) into
the detailed behaviour of stellar convection during advanced burning
stages with a view to the secular impact of 3D effects not captured
by spherically symmetric stellar evolution models based on mixing-
length theory (Biermann 1932; B√∂hm-Vitense 1958). The details of
convective boundarymixing by processes such as quasi-steady turbu-
lent entrainment (Fernando 1991; Strang & Fernando 2001; Meakin"
¬© 2020 The Authors

"& Arnett 2007b) or violent shell mergers (Moc√°k et al. 2018; Ya-
dav et al. 2020) have received particular attention for their potential
to alter the core structure of massive stars and hence affect the dy-
namics and final nucleosynthesis yields of the subsequent supernova
explosion.
Three-dimensional simulations of convection during advanced"
"burning stages have so far largely disregarded two important aspects
of real stars ‚Äì rotation and magnetic fields. The effects of rotation
have been touched upon by the seminal work of Kuhlen et al. (2003),
but more recent studies (Arnett & Meakin 2010; Chatzopoulos et al.
2016) have been limited to axisymmetry (2D). Magnetohydrody-
namic (MHD) simulations of convection, while common and mature
in the context of the Sun (for a review see, e.g., Charbonneau 2014)
have yet to be performed for advanced burning stages of massive
stars.
Simulations of magnetoconvection during the late burning stages,"
"both in rotating and non-rotating stars, are a big desideratum for sev-
eral reasons. Even in slowly rotating massive stars, magnetic fields
may have a non-negligible impact on the dynamics of neutrino-driven
explosions (Obergaulinger et al. 2014; M√ºller & Varma 2020), and
although efficient field amplification processes operate in the super-
nova core (Endeve et al. 2012; M√ºller & Varma 2020), it stands to
reason that memory of the initial fields may not be lost entirely, es-
pecially for strong fields in the progenitor and early explosions. A
better understanding of the interplay between convection, rotation,
and magnetic fields in supernova progenitors is even more critical
for the magnetorotational explosion scenario (e.g., Burrows et al.
2007; Winteler et al. 2012; M√∂sta et al. 2014; M√∂sta et al. 2018;
Obergaulinger & Aloy 2020a,b; Kuroda et al. 2020; Aloy & Ober-
gaulinger 2020), which probably explains rare, unusually energetic
‚Äúhypernovae‚Äù with energies of up to ‚àº1052 erg. Again, even though
the requisite strongmagnetic fieldsmay be generated after collapse by
amplification processes like the magnetorotational insstability (Bal-
bus & Hawley 1991; Akiyama et al. 2003) or an ùõº-Œ© dynamo in the
proto-neutron star (Duncan&Thompson 1992; Thompson&Duncan
1993; Raynaud et al. 2020), a robust understanding of magnetic fields
during late burning is indispensable for reliable hypernovamodels on
several heads. For sufficiently strong seed fields in the progenitor, the
initial field strengths and geometry could have a significant impact
on the development of magnetorotational explosions after collapse
(Bugli et al. 2020; Aloy & Obergaulinger 2020). Furthermore, our
understanding of evolutionary pathways towards hypernova explo-
sions (Woosley & Heger 2006; Yoon & Langer 2005; Yoon et al.
2010; Cantiello et al. 2007; Aguilera-Dena et al. 2018, 2020) is in-
timately connected with the effects of magnetic fields on angular
momentum transport in stellar interiors (Spruit 2002; Heger et al.
2005; Fuller et al. 2019; Takahashi & Langer 2020).
Beyond the impact of magnetic fields on the pre-supernova evo-"
"lution and the supernova itself, the interplay of convection, rotation,
and magnetic fields is obviously relevant to the origin of neutron
star magnetic fields as well. It still remains to be explained what
shapes the distribution of magnetic fields among young pulsars, and
why some neutron stars are born as magnetars with extraordinarily
strong dipole fields of up to 1015 G (Olausen & Kaspi 2014; Tau-
ris et al. 2015; Kaspi & Beloborodov 2017; Enoto et al. 2019). Are
these strong fields of fossil origin (Ferrario &Wickramasinghe 2005;
Ferrario et al. 2009; Schneider et al. 2020) or generated by dynamo
action during or after the supernova (Duncan & Thompson 1992;
Thompson & Duncan 1993)? Naturally, 3D MHD simulations of the
late burning stages cannot comprehensively answer all of these ques-
tions. In order to connect to observable magnetic fields of neutron
stars, an integrated approach is required that combines stellar evolu-"
"tion over secular time scales, 3D stellar hydrodynamics, supernova
modelling, and local simulations, and also addresses aspects like field
burial (Vigan√≤ et al. 2013; Torres-Forn√© et al. 2016) and the long-
time evolution of magnetic fields (Aguilera et al. 2008; De Grandis
et al. 2020). Significant obstacles need to be overcome until one can
construct a pipeline from 3D progenitor models to 3D supernova sim-
ulations and beyond. However, 3D MHD simulations of convective
burning can already address meaningful questions despite the com-
plexity of the overall problem. As in the purely hydrodynamic case,
the first step must be to understand the principles governing mag-
netohydrodynamic convection during the late burning stages based
on somewhat idealised simulations that are broadly representative of
the conditions in convective cores and shells of massive stars.
In this study, we present a first simulation of magnetoconvection"
"during the final phase of oxygen shell burning using the ideal MHD
approximation. In the tradition of semi-idealised models of late-stage
convection, we use a setup that falls within the typical range of con-
ditions in the interiors of massive stars in terms of convective Mach
number and shell geometry (for an overview see Collins et al. 2018)
and is not designed as a fully self-consistent model of any one partic-
ular star. This simulation constitutes a first step beyond effective 1D
prescriptions in stellar evolution models to predict the magnetic field
strength and geometry encountered in the inner shells ofmassive stars
at the pre-supernova stage. We also compare to a corresponding non-
magnetic model of oxygen shell convection to gauge the feedback
of magnetic fields on the convective flow with a particular view to
two important issues. First, the efficiency of the ‚Äúperturbation-aided‚Äù
neutrino-driven mechanism depends critically on the magnitude of
the convective velocities during shell burning, and it is important
to determine whether magnetic fields can significantly slow down
convective motions as suggested by some recent simulations of solar
convection (Hotta et al. 2015). Second, magnetic fields could quanti-
tatively or qualitatively affect shell growth by turbulent entrainment,
which has been consistently seen in all recent 3D hydrodynamics
simulations of late-stage convection in massive stars.
Our paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe the"
"numerical methods, progenitor model, and initial conditions used in
our study and discuss the potential role of non-ideal effects . The
results of the simulations are presented in Section 3. We first focus
on the strength and geometry of the emergingmagnetic field and then
analyse the impact of magnetic fields on the flow, and in particular
on entrainment at shell boundaries. We summarize our results and
discuss their implications in Section 4."
2 NUMERICAL METHODS AND SIMULATION SETUP
"We simulate oxygen and neon shell burning with and without mag-
netic fields in a non-rotating 18ùëÄÔøΩ solar-metallicity star calculated
using the stellar evolution codeKepler (Weaver et al. 1978;Woosley
et al. 2002; Heger &Woosley 2010). The same progenitor model has
previously been used in the shell convection simulation of M√ºller
et al. (2016). The structure of the stellar evolution model at the time
of mapping to 3D is illustrated in Figure 1. The model contains
two active convective shells with sufficiently short turnover times to
make time-explicit simulations feasible. The oxygen shell extends
from 1.75ùëÄÔøΩ to 2.25ùëÄÔøΩ in enclosed mass and from 3, 400 km to
7, 900 km in radius, immediately followed further out by the neon
shell out to 3.53ùëÄÔøΩ in mass and 27, 000 km in radius.
For our 3D simulations we employ the Newtonian magnetohy-"
"drodynamic (MHD) version of the CoCoNuT code as described
in M√ºller & Varma (2020). The MHD equations are solved in"

with the flow unlike in their smoothed particle hydrodynamics ap-
proach. If translated to the Eulerian form of the MHD equations, the
approach of Tricco et al. (2016) would give rise to an extra advection
term in the evolution equation for ùúì, which then requires an addi-
tional term in the energy equation to ensure energy conservation. In
our Eulerian approach, these extra terms are not needed.
Viscosity and resistivity are not included explicitly in the ideal"
"MHD approximation, and only enter through the discretisation of the
MHD equations, specifically the spatial reconstruction, the computa-
tion of the Riemann fluxes, and the update of the conserved quantities
in the case of reconstruct-solve-average schemes. 1 While this ‚Äúim-
plicit large-eddy simulation‚Äù (ILES) approach is well-established for
hydrodynamic turbulence (Grinstein et al. 2007), the magnetohy-
drodynamic case is more complicated because the behaviour in the
relevant astrophysical regime of low (kinematic) viscosity a and resis-
tivity [ may still depend on the magnetic Prandtl number Pm = a/[.
Different from the regime later encountered in the supernova core
where Pm ÔøΩ 1, oxygen shell burning is characterised by magnetic
Prandtl numbers slightly below unity (Pm ‚àº 0.2). With an effective
Prandtl number of Pm ‚àº 1 in the ILES approach (Federrath et al.
2011), there is a potential concern that spurious small-scale dynamo
amplification might arise due to the overestimation of the magnetic
Prandtl number, or that saturation field strengths might be too high.
The debate about the magnetic Prandtl number dependence in MHD
turbulence is ongoing with insights from theory and simulations
(e.g., Schekochihin et al. 2004, 2007; Iskakov et al. 2007; Branden-
burg 2011; Pietarila Graham et al. 2010; Sahoo et al. 2011; Thaler &
Spruit 2015; Seshasayanan et al. 2017), astrophysical observations
(e.g., Christensen et al. 2009), and laboratory experiments (P√©tr√©lis
et al. 2007;Monchaux et al. 2007). There is, at the very least, the pos-
sibility of robust small-scale dynamo action and saturation governed
by balance between the inertial terms and Lorentz force terms down
to the low values of Pm ‚àº 5 √ó 10‚àí6 in liquid sodium experiments
(P√©tr√©lis et al. 2007;Monchaux et al. 2007), provided that both the hy-
drodynamic and magnetic Reynolds number are sufficiently high. An
ILES approach that places the simulation into a ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù, strongly
magnetised regime (Beresnyak 2019) thus appears plausible. More-
over, even if the ILES approach were only to provide upper limits for
magnetic fields and their effects on the flow, meaningful conclusions
can still be drawn in the context of shell convection simulations."
"1 For an attempt to quantify the numerical diffusivities, see, e.g., Rembi-
asz et al. (2017). One should emphasise, however, that that the concepts of
numerical and physical viscosity/resistivity must be carefully distinguished.
For one thing, the numerical viscosity and resistivity are problem-dependent
as stressed by Rembiasz et al. (2017). In the case of higher-order recon-
struction schemes, they are also scale-dependent (and hence more akin to
higher-order hyperdiffusivities), and they are affected by discrete switches in
the reconstruction scheme and Riemann solver. Because of these subtleties,
the determination of the effective (magnetic) Reynolds number of a simulation
is non-trivial (see Section 2.1.2 of M√ºller 2020)."

"The nuclear source terms are calculated with the 19-species nu-
clear reaction network of Weaver et al. (1978). Neutrino cooling is
ignored, since it becomes subdominant in the late pre-collapse phase
as the contraction of the shells speeds up nuclear burning.
The simulations are conducted on a grid with 400 √ó 128 √ó 256"
"zones in radius ùëü, colatitude \, and longitude ùúë with an exponential
grid in ùëü and uniform spacing in \ and ùúë. To reduce computational
costs, we excise the non-convective inner core up to 3000 km and
replace the excised core with a point mass. The grid extends to a
radius of 50, 000 km and includes a small part of the silicon shell, the
entire convective oxygen and neon shells, the non-convective carbon
shell, and parts of the helium shell. Simulations that include the entire
iron core and silicon shell are of course desirable in future, but the
treatment of nuclear quasi-equilibrium in these regions is delicate and
motivates simulations in a shellular domain instead, with a sufficient
‚Äúbuffer‚Äù region between the convectively active shells and the inner
boundary of the grid. Due to the significant buoyancy jump between
the silicon shell and the oxygen shell, the flow in the convective shell
is largely decoupled from that in the non-convective buffer region.
Hydrodynamic waves excited at the convective boundary and Alfv√©n
waves along field lines threading both regions can introduce some
coupling, but these are excited by the active convective shell and not
in the convectively quiet buffer region. No physical flux of waves
into the oxygen region from below is expected. Moreover, there is
no strong excitation of waves at the convective boundary in the first
place because of the low convective Mach number of the flow. It
turns out that coupling by Alfv√©n waves can be neglected even more
safely than coupling by internal gravity waves because of the Alfv√©n
number of the flow; as we shall see the Alfv√©n number always stays
well below unity.
In order to investigate the impact of magnetic fields on late-"
"stage oxygen shell convection, we run a purely hydrodynamic, non-
magnetic simulation and an MHD simulation. In the MHD simu-
lation, we impose a homogeneous magnetic field with ùêµùëß = 108 G
parallel to the grid axis as initial conditions. We implement reflect-
ing and periodic boundary conditions in \ and ùúë, respectively. For
the hydrodynamic variables we use hydrostatic extrapolation (M√ºller
2020) at the inner and outer boundary, and impose strictly vanish-
ing advective fluxes at the inner boundary. Different from M√ºller
et al. (2016), we do not contract the inner boundary to follow the
contraction and collapse of the core. This means that our models
will not (and are not intended to) provide an accurate representa-
tion of the pre-collapse state of the particular 18ùëÄÔøΩ star that we
are simulating. We would expect, e.g., that for the particular 18ùëÄÔøΩ
model, the burning rate and hence the convective velocities would
increase until the onset of collapse (M√ºller et al. 2016) due to the
contraction of the convective oxygen shell. As a consequence of ac-
celerating convection and flux compression, the magnetic fields will
likely also be somewhat higher at the onset of collapse. The model
is rather meant to reveal the physical principles governing late-stage
magnetoconvection in massive stars, and to be representative of the
typical conditions in oxygen burning shells with the understanding
that there are significant variations in convective Mach number and
shell geometry at the onset of collapse (Collins et al. 2018), which
will also be reflected in the magnetic field strengths in the interiors
of supernova progenitors.
The inner and outer boundary conditions for the magnetic fields"
"are less trivial. In simulations of magnetoconvection in the Sun,
various choices such as vertical boundary conditions (ùêµùë• = ùêµùë¶ = 0),
radial boundary conditions (ùêµ\ = ùêµùúë = 0), vanishing tangential
electric fields or currents, perfect-conductor boundary conditions,
or extrapolation to a potential solution have been employed (e.g.,"

"Thelen & Cattaneo 2000; Rempel 2014; K√§pyl√§ et al. 2020). Since
our domain boundaries are separated from the convective regions
by shell interfaces with significant buoyancy jumps, we opt for the
simplest choice of boundary conditions and merely fix the magnetic
fields in the ghost zones to their initial values for a homogeneous
vertical magnetic field. We argue that due to the buffer regions at
our radial boundaries, and the lack of rotational shear, our choice of
magnetic boundary conditions should not have a significant impact
on the dynamically relevant regions of the star."
3 RESULTS
3.1 Evolution of the Magnetic Field
"Both the magnetised and non-magnetised model were run for over 12
minutes of physical time, which corresponds to about 17 convective
turnover times. Very soon after convection develops in the oxygen
shell, the turbulent convective flow starts to rapidly amplify the mag-
netic fields in this region. To illustrate the growth of themagnetic field
we show the root-mean-square (RMS) average and maximum value
of the magnetic field in the oxygen shell in Figure 2.The magnetic
field, which we initialised at 108 G, is amplified by over two orders
of magnitude to over 1010 G on average within the shell due to con-
vective and turbulent motions. The average magnetic field strength
in the shell is still increasing at the end of the simulation, but the
growth rate has slowed down, likely indicating that the model is ap-
proaching some level of magnetic field saturation. While we cannot
with certainty extrapolate the growth dynamics without simulating
longer, it appears likely that RMS saturation field strength will settle
somewhere around ‚âà2 √ó 1010 G.
A closer look reveals that the magnetic field is not amplified ho-"
"mogeneously throughout the convective region. The convective ed-
dies push the magnetic field lines against the convective boundaries,
where the fields are then more strongly amplified by shear flows. This
is visualised in Figures 3a and 3b, where both magnetic pressure and
magnetic field strengths appear concentrated at the convective bound-
ary. Themaximummagnetic field strength shown in Figure 2 (dashed
line) therefore essentially mirrors the field at the inner boundary of
the oxygen shell (not to be confused with the inner grid boundary)."

convective flow is fully developed. The rate of growth of the max-

the magnetic field would use a poloidal-toroidal decomposition B = ‚àá√ó [‚àá√ó

and toroidal parts of the field, and consider all components ùêµùëü , ùêµ\ , and ùêµùúë

from the first radial zone of our grid, where the dipole component
is comparable to the total radial magnetic field. This behaviour at
the grid boundary is likely an artefact of our choice of homogeneous
magnetic fields at the inner boundary. In general, however, the mag-
netic fields in the convective zones appear dominated by higher-order
multipoles. Disregarding the dipole fields at the inner boundary, the
dipole magnetic field of ‚âà109G or below lies in the upper range
of observed dipole magnetic fields of white dwarfs (Ferrario et al.
2015), which have often been taken as best estimates for the dipole
fields in the cores of massive stars."
"toroidal decomposition cannot be reduced to a straightforward projection onto
vector spherical harmonics, this analysis is left to future papers."

exhibit a Kazantsev spectrum with power-law index ùëò‚àí3/2 on large

standard picture of turbulent dynamo amplification.
This is borne out by a closer look at the magnetic field distribu-"
"tion within the convective region. Somewhat similar to our recent
simulation of field amplification by neutrino-driven convection in
core-collapse supernovae (M√ºller & Varma 2020), field amplifica-
tion does not happen homogeneously throughout the convective re-
gion and appears to be predominantly driven by shear flows at the

"about one order of magnitude below, although longer simulations
will be required to confirm this. The non-radial diagonal compo-
nents ùëÖ\ \ + ùëÖùúëùúë and ùëÄ\ \ + ùëÄùúëùúë are generally higher than the
respective radial components ùëÖùëüùëü and ùëÄùëüùëü . Throughout most of
the domain, the Maxwell stresses are considerably smaller than the
Reynolds stresses, but it is noteworthy that the profile of the non-
radial components of ùëÄùëñ ùëó runs largely parallel to those of ùëÖùëñ ùëó , just
with a difference of slightly more than an order of magnitude. Peaks
of the magnetic stresses at the shell interfaces suggest that field
amplification is driven by shear flow at the convective boundaries.
Convective motions then transport the magnetic field into the interior
of the convective regions and also generate radial field components.
The humps of ùëÄùëüùëü within the convection zones are less pronounced
than in ùëÖùëüùëü , which indicates that little amplification by convective
updrafts and downdrafts takes place within the convection region.
At the outer boundaries of the oxygen and neon shell, we ob-"
"serve rough equipartition between ùëÖùëüùëü and ùëÄ\ \ + ùëÄùúëùúë . The fact
that the growth of the field slows down once the model approaches
ùëÄ\ \ +ùëÄùúëùúë ‚âà ùëÖùëüùëü suggests that this ‚Äúpartial equipartition‚Äù may de-
termine the saturation field strength, but the very different behaviour
at the inner boundary withùëÄ\ \ +ùëÄùúëùúë ÔøΩ ùëÖùëüùëü argues against this. It
is plausible, though, that the saturation field strength is (or rather will
be) determined at the boundary. Linear stability analysis of the mag-
netised Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (e.g. Chandrasekhar 1961; Sen
1963; Fejer 1964; Miura & Pritchett 1982; Frank et al. 1996; Kep-
pens et al. 1999; Ryu et al. 2000; Obergaulinger, M. et al. 2010; Liu
et al. 2018) shows that shear instability, which is critical for efficiently
generating small-scale fields, are suppressed by magnetic fields par-
allel to the direction of the shear flow as long as the Alfv√©n number
is smaller than two. With kinetic fields well below equipartition
(cp. Figure 6), our models fall into the regime of low Alfv√©n number;
hence the generation of non-radial fields at the boundaries may be
self-limiting as a result of the stabilising impact of magnetic fields on
the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. A naive application of the principle
of marginal stability would suggest saturation occurs once the Alfv√©n
velocity at the boundary equals the shear velocity jump across the
shell interface, which would imply ùëÄ\ \ +ùëÄùúëùúë ‚âà ùëÖ\ \ + ùëÖùúëùúë . Our
simulation suggests that saturation probably occurs at significantly
smaller values, and a more quantitative analysis of the saturation
mechanism will clearly be required in future to elucidate the relation
between the shear velocity (and possibly the width of the shear layer)
and the saturation field strength."
3.2 Impact of Magnetic Fields on Convective Boundary Mixing
"The slowing growth of the magnetic field indicates that feedback
effects on the flow should become important during the later phase
of the simulation. It is particularly interesting to consider the effect
of the strong fields tangential to the oxygen-neon shell interface
on convective boundary mixing, though we also consider potential
effects on the flow in the interior of the convective regions.
To this end, we compare theMHDmodel to a purely hydrodynamic"
"simulation of oxygen and neon shell convection. Figure 7 compares
the total kinetic energy in convective motions in the oxygen shell
between the models. The radial and non-radial components ùê∏ùëü and

"where ùëü‚àí and ùëü+ are the inner and outer radii of the oxygen shell. We
compute the inner and outer shell radii ùëü‚àí and ùëü+ as the midpoints of
the steep, entropy slope between the oxygen shell and the silicon and
neon shells below and above. Due to shell growth by entrainment, ùëü‚àí
and ùëü+ are time-dependent (Figure 8a).
For both models most of the turbulent kinetic energy is in the"
"non-radial direction. This is different from the rough equipartition
ùê∏ùëü ‚âà ùê∏\,ùúë seen in many simulations of buoyancy-driven convection
(Arnett et al. 2009). There is, however, no firm physical principle
that dictates such equipartition; indeed a shell burning simulation of
the same 18ùëÄÔøΩ progenitor with the Prometheus code also showed
significantly more kinetic energy in non-radial motions (M√ºller et al.
2016). Ultimately, the high ratio ùê∏\,ùúë/ùê∏ùëü merely indicates that the
fully developed flow happens to predominantly select eddies with
larger extent in the horizontal than in the vertical direction. 4
Discounting stochastic variations, the radial component ùê∏ùëü of the"
"turbulent kinetic energy for both the hydrodynamic and MHDmodel
are similar until the final ‚âà300 s, at which point they start to devi-
ate more significantly. Clearer differences appear in the non-radial
component ùê∏\,ùúë , with the hydro model showing irregular episodic
bursts in kinetic energy which are not mirrored in the MHD model.
Since the only difference in the setup of the two runs is the presence
or absence of magnetic fields, this points to feedback of the magnetic
field on the flow as the underlying reason, unless the variations are
purely stochastic. Closer examination suggests that feedback of the
magnetic field on the flow is the more likely explanation, and the
nature of this feedback will become more apparent as we analyse
convective boundary mixing in the models.
To this end, we first consider the evolution of the boundaries ùëü‚àí"
"and ùëü+ of the oxygen shell and the total oxygen shell mass ùëÄO. For
computing the oxygen shell mass, we take the (small) deviation of the
boundaries from spherical symmetry into account more accurately
than when computing ùëü‚àí and ùëü+, and integrate the mass contained
in cells within the entropy range 3.8-5.2 ùëòB/nucleon. As shown by"
"4 In the low-Mach number regime, the anelastic condition ‚àá ¬∑ (ùúåv) ‚âà 0 im-
plies a relation between the aspect ratio of convective cells and the horizontal
and vertical kinetic energy of any mode."

nuclear energy generation rate throughout the shell.."
"Figure 8 (panels a and b), the oxygen shell in the non-magnetic model
grows slightly, but perceptibly faster without magnetic fields than in
the MHD model, starting at a simulation time of about 300 s. The
presence of relatively strong magnetic fields in the boundary layer
apparently reduces entrainment in line with the inhibiting effect of
magnetic fields parallel to the flow on shear instabilities discussed in
Section 3.1."
"The entrainment rate ¬§ùëÄ = dùëÄO/dùë° (Figure 8c) is only slightly
higher in the purely hydrodynamic model most of the time, but the
entrainment rate exhibits occasional spikes, which do not occur in
the MHD model. We note that these spikes in ¬§ùëÄ occur at around
the same times as the bursts in non-radial kinetic energy (Figure 7).
It appears that the stabilisation of the boundary by magnetic fields
mostly suppresses rarer, but more powerful entrainment events that
mix bigger lumps of material into the oxygen shell. A comparison
with the shell burning simulations of M√ºller et al. (2016) provides
confidence that this effect is robust. Because M√ºller et al. (2016)
contract the inner boundary condition, convection grows more vig-
orous with time and their entrainment rates are higher, adding about
0.05ùëÄÔøΩ to the oxygen shell within 300 s. Their resolution test (Fig-
ure 20 in M√ºller et al. 2016) only showed variations of 0.004ùëÄÔøΩ
in the entrained mass between different runs of the same progeni-
tor model. In our simulations, the oxygen shell only grows by about
0.03ùëÄÔøΩ from 300 s to 700 s (i.e, when the magnetic field does not
grow substantially any more), yet we find a difference in shell growth
of about 0.01ùëÄÔøΩ between the magnetic and non-magnetic model. It
therefore seems likely that there is indeed an appreciable systematic"
"effect of magnetic fields on entrainment. Our simulations qualita-
tively illustrate such an effect, but models at higher resolution are
of course desirable to more reliably quantify the impact of magnetic
fields on turbulent entrainment. The resolution requirements for ac-
curate entrainment rates are hard to quantify. Findings from extant
numerical studies of the magnetised Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
(e.g., Keppens et al. 1999) cannot be easily transferred because of
important physical differences (e.g., the lack of buoyant stabilisation
of the boundary). In purely hydrodynamic simulations of entrain-
ment during oxygen shell burning, resolving the shear layer between
the oxygen and neon shell with ‚âà15-22 radial zones as in our model
was found to be sufficient for quantitatively credible, but not fully
converged results (M√ºller et al. 2016)."
"The different entrainment rate also explains long-term, time-
averaged differences in convective kinetic energy between the two
simulations. The convective kinetic energy is determined by the total
nuclear energy generation rate, which is shown in Figure 8d. Both
models show an overall trend downwards over time in nuclear energy
generation, which can be ascribed to a slight thermal expansion of the
shell and the depletion of fuel. After about 200 s, the purely hydrody-
namicsmodel exhibits a higher energy generation rate, which persists
until the end of the simulations and becomes more pronounced. The
higher energy generation rate in the non-magnetic model is indeed
mirrored by a stronger decrease in the neon mass on the grid (Fig-
ure 9) of about the right amount to explain the average difference in
energy generation rate at late times.We note, however, that the strong
episodic entrainment events in the purely hydrodynamic model are"

"not associated with an immediate increase in nuclear energy gen-
eration rate. This is mainly because the energy release from the
dissociation of the entrained neon is delayed and spread out in time
as the entrained material is diluted and eventually mixed down to
regions of sufficiently high temperature.
The overall effect of magnetic fields on the bulk flow is rather"
"modest. We do not see a similarly strong quenching of the convective
flow by magnetic fields as in recent MHD simulations of the solar
convection zone (Hotta et al. 2015), who reported a reduction of
convective velocities by up to 50% at the base of the convection zone.
Such an effect is not expected as long as the magnetic fields stay well
below kinetic equipartition in the interior of convective shells as in
our MHD simulation. Longer simulations will be required to confirm
that magnetic fields during late shell burning stages indeed remain
‚Äúweak‚Äù by comparison and do not appreciably influence the bulk
dynamics of convection."
4 CONCLUSIONS
"We investigated the amplification and saturation of magnetic fields
during convective oxygen shell burning and the backreaction of the
field on the convective flow by conducting a 3DMHD simulation and
a purely hydrodynamic simulation of an 18ùëÄÔøΩ progenitor shortly be-
fore core collapse. The simulations were run for about 12 minutes of
physical time (corresponding to about 17 convective turnover times),
at which point field amplification has slowed down considerably,
though a quasi-stationary state has not yet been fully established.
The magnetic field in the oxygen shell is amplified to ‚àº1010 G"
"and dominated by small-to-medium-scale structures with angular
wavenumber ‚Ñì ‚àº 7. The dipole component is considerably smaller
with ‚àº109 G near the inner boundary of the oxygen shell and less fur-
ther outside. The profiles of the radial and non-radial diagonal com-
ponents ùëÄùëüùëü and ùëÄ\ \ + ùëÄùúëùúë of the Maxwell stress tensor mirror
the corresponding components ùëÖùëüùëü and ùëÖ\ \ + ùëÖùúëùúë of the Reynolds
stress tensor, but remain about an order of magnitude smaller, i.e.,
kinetic equipartition is not reached. However, ùëÄ\ \ + ùëÄùúëùúë can ap-
proach or exceed the radial component ùëÖùëüùëü at the convective bound-
aries. The saturation mechanism for field amplification needs to be
studied in more detail, but we speculate that saturation is mediated"
"by the inhibiting effect of non-radial magnetic fields on shear insta-
bilities at shell boundaries, which appear to be the primary driver of
field amplification.
We find that magnetic fields do not have an appreciable effect"
"on the interior flow inside the oxygen shell, but observe a moderate
reduction of turbulent entrainment at the oxygen-neon shell bound-
ary in the presence of magnetic fields. Magnetic fields appear to
suppress stronger episodic entrainment events, although they do not
quench entrainment completely. Through the reduced entrainment
rate, magnetic fields also indirectly affect the dynamics inside the
convective region slightly because they reduce the energy release
through the dissociation of ingested neon, which results in slightly
smaller convective velocities in the MHD model.
Our findings have important implications for core-collapse su-"
"pernova modelling. We predict initial fields in the oxygen shell of
non-rotating progenitors that are significantly stronger than assumed
in our recent simulation of a neutrino-driven explosion aided by
dynamo-generatedmagnetic fields (M√ºller &Varma 2020).With rel-
atively strong seed-fields, there is likely less of a delay until magnetic
fields can contribute the additional ‚Äúboost‚Äù to neutrino heating and
purely hydrodynamic instabilities seen in M√ºller & Varma (2020).
This should further contribute to the robustness of the neutrino-
drivenmechanism for non-rotating and slowly-rotatingmassive stars.
Our simulations also suggest that the perturbation-aided mechanism
(Couch & Ott 2013; M√ºller & Janka 2015) will not be substantially
affected by the inclusion of magnetic fields. Since magnetic fields do
not become strong enough to substantially alter the bulk flow inside
the convective region, the convective velocities and eddy scales as
the key parameters for perturbation-aided explosions remain largely
unchanged.
The implications of our results for neutron star magnetic fields"
"are more difficult to evaluate since the observable fields will, to a
large degree, be set by processes during and after the supernova and
cannot be simply extrapolated from the progenitor stage by magnetic
flux conservation. That said, dipole fields of order 109 G at the base
of the oxygen shell ‚Äì which is likely to end up as the neutron star
surface region ‚Äì are not in overt conflict with dipole fields of order
1013 G in many young pulsars inside supernova remnants (Enoto
et al. 2019). However, considering the relatively strong small-scale
fields of ‚àº1010 G with peak values over 1011 G, it may prove diffi-
cult to produce neutron stars without strong small-scale fields at the
surface. There is a clear need for an integrated approach towards the
evolution of magnetic fields from the progenitor phase through the
supernova and into the compact remnant phase in order to fully grasp
the implications of the current simulations.
Evidently, further follow-up studies are also needed on the final"
"evolutionary phases of supernova progenitors. Longer simulations
and resolution studies will be required to better address issues like
the saturation field strength, the saturationmechanism, and the impact
of magnetic fields on turbulent entrainment. Full models that include
the core and self-consistently follow the evolution of the star to
collapse will be required to generate accurate 3D initial conditions
for supernova simulations. The critical issue of non-ideal effects and
the behaviour of turbulent magnetoconvection for magnetic Prandtl
numbers slightly smaller than one at very high Reynolds numbers
deserves particular consideration. Some findings of our ‚Äúoptimistic‚Äù
approach based on the ideal MHD approximation should, however,
prove robust, such as the modest effect of magnetic fields on the
convective bulk flowandhence the reliability of purely hydrodynamic
models (Couch et al. 2015; M√ºller et al. 2016; Yadav et al. 2020;
M√ºller 2020; Fields & Couch 2020) and even 1D mixing-length

"It is evident that rescaling the cleaning field does not alter the charac-
teristic structure of the system, but the more symmetric formulation
of Equations (A9) and (A10) with identical dimensions for ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ and B
allows us to explicitly cast the energy equation in conservation form.
The term ùëêh‚àá ¬∑B in Equation (A10) gives a contribution (denoted by
a subscript ‚Äúh‚Äù) to the time derivative of the energy associated with
the cleaning field,(
ùúï (ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ2/2)"
")
h
= ‚àíùëêhÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ‚àá ¬∑ B. (A11)"
"Because of the rescaling of the cleaning field, no time derivative of
the cleaning speed ùëêh appears, which is critical for writing the energy
equation in a manifestly conservative form. Adding Equations (A8)
and (A11) yields"

"where ùëí = ùúå(ùúñ + ùë£2/2) + (ùêµ2 + ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ2)/(8ùúã). The cleaning terms on the
right-hand side can be written as a divergence and hence absorbed
in the energy flux,"

"As noted by Tricco et al. (2016), the damping term for the cleaning
field will effectively add to dissipation into thermal energy in such
an approach, but they found the additional dissipation insignificant
in practice compared to other sources of numerical dissipation."
