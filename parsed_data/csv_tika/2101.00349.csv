"Equations of motion for excited states of weakly self-interacting bosons forming fuzzy dark matter
are solved using the WKB approximation. The contribution of self-interactions are neglected in the
equations of motion. Wave functions of excited states are expressed in terms of a yet undetermined
gravitational potential. At equilibrium, the contributions of states to the density distribution are
summed using Bose-Einstein statistics. Combined with the Poisson equation, a differential equation
is obtained for the gravitational potential, which has physically acceptable solutions only if the
energy spectrum of excited states has a finite gap, corresponding to a finite virial radius. Such a
gap could be created by decay processes, in first order perturbation of the self-interaction potential.
The obtained density profile is found to be similar to the Burkert profile."
INTRODUCTION
"The structure of galaxies and the rotation curves of stars
in galaxies cannot be explained without the assumption
that most of galactic matter is composed of presently
unknown particles, termed dark matter (DM), which in-
teract very weakly with particles of the Standard Model.
One of the most popular variants of DM is the WIMP,
consisting of massive, non-relativistic particles, heavier
than neutrinos [1–3]. Since no such particles, in the ap-
propriate mass range, have been discovered yet, other
alternatives for DM have also been considered. Among
others, prominent candidates are ultralight bosons, with
Compton wavelengths of cosmic size [4–8]."
"Simulations of collapsing systems of ultralight bosons,
interacting only through gravity, were performed recently
by [9–14]. Bosonic systems were shown to collapse to a
condensed core, surrounded by a virialized halo of non-
relativistic bosons. In a subsequent work [15], numeri-
cal solutions of excited states of the Schrödinger-Poisson
(SP) equations were calculated self-consistently. The au-
thors showed that there is a viable description of galac-
tic DM consisting of a condensed core surrounded by
a halo composed of excited eigenstates. The relative
weight of excited states in the system was fixed, using
several parameters, including the effective inverse tem-
perature, β, chemical potential, µ, cutoff in the binding
energy, Ec, or other scale parameters. Recently, simula-
tions have also been performed for ultralight bosons with
self-interactions [16]."
"The purpose of this work is to construct DM from self-
adjoint or complex ultralight bosons with attractive or
repulsive self-interactions. We ignore self-interactions in
solving the equations of motion, but consider the effect
of 2 → 2 interactions on the stability of excited eigen-
states. We emphasize that, because only this particular
interaction is relevant, our model can be used for real, or
just as easily for complex, scalar fields. For the sake of
simplicity, we focus on a real scalar field giving rise to an
axion-like particle (ALP) subject to a Φ4 self-interaction."
For the range of the total mass of DM in a galaxy con-
"sidered here, the contribution of self-interaction terms to
the equations of motion is negligible compared to that of
the gravitational interaction. The ratio of self-interaction
to gravitational interactions scales as"

"where MP = G
−1/2 is the Planck mass and G is Newton’s"
"constant, fa is the axion decay constant, rs is the radial
scale of the system and ma is the mass of the axion."
"Self-interactions of bosons may be important for ex-
tremely large galaxies. In fact, based on studies of axion
stars [17–19] they can possibly generate a cutoff in the
mass spectrum of stable, extremely large galaxies with
very large densities. That possibility will be investigated
in future publications."
WKB APPROXIMATION TO EXCITED STATES
"The main purpose of this letter is to find an equa-
tion for the gravitational potential, Vg, of an FDM halo.
Therefore, radial wave functions, ψnl, and the total den-
sity of dark matter, ρ, will be calculated as functions of
the yet unknown Vg. Radial wave functions of excited
states, labeled by principal quantum number n and an-
gular quantum number l, satisfy the Schrödinger (Gross-
Pitaevskii) equation"

decay of bound axions into relativistic axions or other
elementary particles, is negligible during the lifetime of
the universe for so called “dilute” axion stars. However,
it has recently been shown that this assumption is only
valid for particles with relatively small decay constants
compared to the Planck scale [23]"

DECAY OF WEAKLY BOUND STATES
"Though the contribution of the self-interaction term
is neglected here, because we consider the region of
M where it is negligible compared to the gravitational
term, it cannot be neglected considering an important
decay process. Denoting particles in bound states, with
quantum numbers n and l, and energies Enl < 0, by
〈nl|, and scattering states by |Ek〉, where Ek > 0, the
self-interaction operator (assuming a standard φ4 self-"
"interaction for FDM) has nonzero transition matrix ele-

Ek = En1l1 + En2l2 − En3l3 > 0.
"Then, it is easy to see that every state having energy
Enl > E10/2, where E10 is the ground state energy,
is unstable. On the other hand, states having energy
Enl < E10/2 are completely stable. The question arises,
however, whether sufficient time passes between the cre-
ation of the galaxy, such that all unstable states decay
by the time of observation. The detailed investigation of
the time dependence of the decay of FDM systems and
the formation of the gap is left to a future work [27]."
"SOLUTION OF THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION
FOR THE GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL"
"Assuming that the energy and particle number of the
FDM system are conserved in good approximation, and
the decay processes occur sufficiently slowly, through
equilibrium states, Bose-Einstein statistics allows the
calculation of the occupation number in states labeled
by quantum numbers n and l. The occupation num-
bers are enormous, so Bose-Einstein statistics reduces to
Rayleigh-Jeans statistics with occupation numbers"

"Here, β and µ are introduced to ensure energy and par-

that the density profile for systems considered here can

v(z) = 1/z if r > rvir. If α > 0 then FDM is compact.
The maximal energy parameter (for the ground state) is
close to the maximum of v(z), which is v(0) = 1. Thus,
the FDM system is stable if α = 1/2, which we consider
to be the maximal value."

THE PROFILE OF FUZZY DARK MATTER
"We chose integration constants w(0) and w′(0) for solv-
ing (9). Notice that the solution of the equation is real
only if w(0) satisfies the constraint 0 < w(0) ≤ 1. No
matter our choice for w(0), we must choose the second
integration constant as w′(0) = 0, otherwise, due to the
singularity of the Laplacian w′′(x) + 2w′(x)/x at x = 0,
the solution for w(x) is singular. Consequently, the sin-
gle parameter w(0) defines a unique solution. Fixing w(0)
determines the chemical potential µ̃, as well, because us-
ing v(0) = 1, (8) implies"
"µ̃ = −α

≤ −2α."
"Then unless 1 − w(0) � 1 all occupancies are of similar
magnitude,"
Nnl = O
"The alternative is that 1−w(0)� 1, implying −µ̃−2α�
1, as well. Then low lying states, along with the ground
state, have occupation numbers much larger than other
stable states, with smaller binding energy parameters."
"There is reason to believe that the second alternative
is realized in FDM systems. No matter what chemical
potential is reached in the collapse forming FDM, the de-
cay process strongly skews the distribution of occupancy
numbers towards deeply bound states. Consider that in
a decay process two axions in unstable states, with bind-
ing energy parameters α < �1 < 1/2 and α < �2 < 1/2
are annihilated while a stable axion with 1 > �3 > 1/2
and a scattering state axion are created. The question
is how the transition probability depends on �3. There"

"are two reasons why transitions into stable states with
larger binding energy have higher probability: (1) the
number of decay channels, or in other words, the range
of unstable states that can take part in the decay process,
�1+�2 < �3 increases with increasing �3, and (2) the tran-
sition probability is also proportional to the phase space
of the emitted scattering state axion, which, in turn, is
proportional to �3 − �1 − �2, which also increases with
�3. The net result is that the occupancy number of a
stable state becomes an increasing function of its bind-
ing energy. If the decay process proceeds slow enough,
then the system of stable states can be considered to be
in near equilibrium during the process. Then the decays
will lead to a monotonic increase of µ̃, as the ratio of
occupancies of states of different energies depends only
on µ̃. Considering the upper bound µ̃ ≤ −2α, it is rea-
sonable to expect that −µ̃ − 2α � 1, which will be the
main focus of further discussions. However, we will also
consider briefly the case when −µ̃− 2α = O(1)."
"One may wonder how the effective temperature, β̃,
varies during the decay process, in which the total mass
of stable states and µ̃ both increase. Since the mass is
expected to increase slowly, as its total possible increase
is just half of the total mass of unstable states, it is likely
that β̃ is forced to increase, as well. Then the decay pro-
cess is just a quantum evaporation cooling process, sim-
ilar to those in atomic physics, creating Bose-Einstein
condensates. The difference is that FDM systems con-
sidered here contain a lot of stable excited states, in ad-
dition to the condensate. The time dependence of the
decay process will be investigated in a forthcoming pub-
lication [27]."

For those states, the higher derivatives of w can be ne-
glected as they are suppressed by orders of S−1/2."
"Consider now that v(z) decreases monotonically from
v(0) = 1 to v(zvir) = α. Then, it follows from (8) and (7)
that w(zvir) = 0 and ρ̃(zvir) = 0. Expanding ρ(z) with

in [15]. Consider now that at z > zvir gravity is Newto-
nian, v(z) = 1/z, Then continuity of v(z) and v(zvir) = α
implies that zvir = 1/α."
"There is no solution when α = 0, corresponding to in-
finite virial radius. To see that consider that (9) has a
unique solution for every choice of the initial condition,
w(0), which has a finite range, vanishing at a finite value,
x = xvir. Then it follows from (10) that zvir = xvir/α,
implying that the scaling factor between x and z is given
by z = x/α → ∞. The only possible solution is then
w(z) ≡ 0, which is the solution of (9) with initial condi-
tions w(0) = 0."
"There is no analytic solution of (9) in terms of known
transcendental functions. However, numerical solutions
for every choice of w(0) are easily obtained. Choosing
w(0) = 1, corresponding to µ̃ = −α, the numerical solu-
tion vanishes at xvir = 5.536, showing that the physical
range of x is 0 ≤ x ≤ 5.536, corresponding to the phys-
ical range of 0 ≤ z ≤ 1/α . This provides the scaling
factor of x/z = α5.536. Decreasing w(0) increases xvir,
as discussed later."
"Comparing profile (11) with phenomenological profiles
of dark matter, obtained from fitting to rotation curves
of stars, we must consider that the scaling factor, rs,
is arbitrary. Since our profile does not have a singular
cusp near the origin, comparison with the Navarro-Frenk-
White (NFW) profile [29] at low values of z is difficult.
However, comparison with the phenomenological Burkert
profile [30], which has a finite cusp only,"
"ρ(z) =
ρ(0)["
"1 + r

is possible. Observe now that profile (13) is associated
with a specific definition of the scaling radius, called core
radius, rc. Our scaling radius, rs, is defined in (3). Using
the Burkert profile (13), the core radius, rc, does not sat-
isfy (3). Therefore, to compare the two profiles we must"
"introduce an extra rescaling factor. Using two different
rescaling factors κ ≡ rs/rc = 1.4 and 1.75 we compare
profiles (11) and (13) in Fig. 1."
"Just like the NFW profile, the Burkert profile also re-
quires a finite cutoff, so that the integral for the expres-
sion of the total mass would be finite. The choices for
rescaling factor κ = 1.4 and 1.75 correspond to setting
the virial radius of the Burkert profile at zvir ∼ 4."
"The NFW profile, having a cusp at the origin, can-
not be fitted very well. We note that adding effects due
to a central black hole and standard matter will change
the gravitational potential and, subsequently, the density
profile (11). We leave such an analysis for future studies."
"Finally, we will investigate solutions for initial condi-
tion w(0) < 1. Numerical solutions for w(x) are obtained
again solving (9), while Fig. 2 shows the density profile
for three different values of µ̃. Note that ρ′(0) = 0 for
solutions with initial conditions v(0) < 1. Data for most
galaxies do not have such profiles, indicating that in gen-
eral 0 < −µ̃− 1� 1."
SUMMARY
"Assuming that galactic dark matter is fuzzy dark mat-
ter in excited states of the equations of motion, the equa-
tions can be solved using the WKB approximation. The
approximation improves with the increase of the size of
the galaxy, but it is expected that the leading order WKB
approximation gives reasonably good energy eigenvalues
and eigenfunctions even for smaller galaxies."
"Axions are expected to have four-particle self-
interactions, Lint ∼ λΦ4 as part of an instanton poten-
tial [8]. In the Born approximation of the self-interaction
potential, excited states with binding energy E < E10/2,
where E10 is the binding energy of the ground state, de-
cay in an energy conserving process, which is possibly
similar to quantum radiation cooling. The decay is ac-
companied by the emission of scattering state particles
from the galaxy, generating a gap in the energy spec-
trum. As a result, after, or possibly simultanously with
the creation of the galaxy, the energy spectrum cuts off
at half of the binding energy of the ground state. The
relative timing of the collapse of the overdensity of axions
into fuzzy dark matter and of the decay process is yet to
be determined. The emitted particles may serve as seeds
of future galaxies."
"The WKB method has been used to calculate ap-
proximate wave functions (in the large S limit), as an-
alytic functions of the gravitational potential. The den-
sity function of dark matter was built from the WKB
wave-functions, using Bose-Einstein statistics at equilib-
rium. Combined with the Poisson equation, a differential
equation is found for the rescaled gravitational potential.
Though there are no undetermined constants in the equa-
tion, one integration constant, restricted to a finite phys-"
"ical range must be fixed. The decay process likely drives
the constant close to the end of the physical range, re-
sulting in a well determined density profile for fuzzy dark
matter, which contains only the usual two free parame-
ters, the central density and the core radius. Having an
energy gap results in a well-defined cutoff of the density
profile. With appropriately chosen scale parameters the
density distribution is close to that of the Burkert pro-
file [30]."
