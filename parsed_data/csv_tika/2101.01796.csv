"Processes of particle production during inflation can increase the amplitude of the scalar metric
perturbations. We show that such a mechanism can naturally arise in supergravity models where
an axion-like field, whose potential is generated by monodromy, drives large field inflation. In this
class of models one generally expects instanton-like corrections to the superpotential. We show, by
deriving the equations of motion in models of supergravity with a stabilizer, that such corrections
generate an interaction between the inflaton and its superpartner. This inflaton-inflatino interaction
term is rapidly oscillating, and can lead to copious production of fermions during inflation, filling the
Fermi sphere up to momenta much larger than the Hubble parameter. In their turn, those fermions
source inflaton fluctuations, increasing their amplitude, and effectively lowering the tensor-to-scalar
ratio for the model, as discussed in [1, 2]. This allows, in particular, to bring the model where the
inflaton potential is quadratic (plus negligibly small instanton corrections) to agree with all existing
observations."
I. INTRODUCTION
"Cosmological observations restrict the space of viable inflationary models in various directions. The measurement
of the spectral index gives ns − 1 ' −1/30 with a ∼ 10% uncertainty, with no appreciable running. This, together
with constraints on nongaussianities (the parameter fNL is about four orders of magnitude smaller than its value
in a fully nongaussian distribution), and with the fact that isocurvature modes are below the 5% level [3], severely
constrains non-vanilla models of inflation. However, the class of models of inflation that arguably taste the most like
vanilla, those described by a monomial potential V ∝ ϕn, are either ruled out or under significant pressure from the
constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r <∼ .06 [4]. In particular, the simplest choice for a monomial, the chaotic
inflation with quadratic potential, is ruled out at the ∼ 4σ level."
"Scenarios where particle production occurs during inflation can allow to decouple inflationary observables from
the shape of the potential. In these scenarios, the rolling inflaton provides the energy necessary for the generation
of quanta of a secondary field whose presence can affect the spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations. While a
single event of particle production [5] can lead to features in the power spectra, a continuous process can generate
an additional quasi-scale invariant component for the spectrum of scalar perturbations, or even provide a channel for
the dissipation of the inflaton’s energy that can lead to inflation even if the potential does not satisfy the slow-roll
conditions [1, 6–8]."
"In this paper we will argue that particle production can bring the model of chaotic inflation V (ϕ) = µ
2"
"2
ϕ2 (plus,"
"as we will see, corrections that we will require to be negligible) to agree with all constraints from observations. This
possibility was already considered in [9, 10], that discussed a system where an auxiliary scalar χ gets an oscillating
mass-squared through a coupling to the inflaton, leading to periodic production of quanta of χ. Remarkably, in our
work we will see that one can resurrect chaotic inflation by simply embedding it in a supersymmetric setting, and
including a small, instanton like correction to the superpotential. These ingredients - monomial inflation with small
instanton corrections in supersymmetry - are expected in supersymmetric models where the inflaton is an axion-like
degree of freedom whose potential is generated by monodromy [11, 12], see [13] for a review. In particular, the
quadratic form of the inflaton potential is generated in the axion–four-form system of [14–17]. Note also that [18, 19]
have shown that this axion-four form system can be brought to agree with observations by the inclusion of higher
dimensional operators that flatten the potential at large field values, similarly to the effect [11, 12, 20, 21] observed
in string theory constructions. In this work we will assume, however, that such flattening does not occur for the
observationally relevant range of field values."
"Going into the specifics of our scenario, we will consider a supersymmetric model where Φ is a superfield whose
imaginary component ϕ gives the axion-like inflaton, whose potential is generated by monodromy. We will show"

"that the addition of an instanton-like ∼ e−Φ/F component to the superpotential, where F � MP is the axion
constant, leads to a coupling of the inflaton to its fermionic partner, the inflatino, that can be written in the form
∼ 1"
"F

")
ψ. The rolling inflaton thus provides a time-dependent contribution to the fermionic Lagrangian,"
"leading to the generation of quanta of ψ [22, 23] with momenta up to ∼ φ̇/F , that can be much larger than the
Hubble parameter, leading to a large density � H3 of fermions during inflation. The quanta of ψ, in their turn,
source fluctuations of the inflaton. The phenomenology associated to this fermion-inflaton system has been studied
in [1, 2]. In the first of those papers it was shown that there is a regime where the inflaton fluctuations sourced by
the produced fermions dominate over the standard ones originating from the amplification of the inflaton’s vacuum
fluctuations. Remarkably, and in contrast with the case in which gauge fields are amplified by the rolling axion-like
inflaton [24], the statistics of the inflaton perturbations is quasi-gaussian, and in agreement with observations. Also,
as we will see, the spectral index in this model turns out to be the same as in standard chaotic inflation, and therefore
agrees with observations."
"The existence of an additional component of scalar perturbations increases, for fixed values of the parameters, the
amplitude of the power spectrum Pζ . If such a component is sizable, therefore, we must lower the energy scale of
inflation in order to fit the observed value of Pζ . This has the consequence of lowering the amplitude of the tensor
perturbations (in [2] it was shown that the fermions do not source significantly the tensor modes), and of bringing
the model to agree with the current constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. This is one of the main results of our
paper."
"As a warm-up, in Section III we will consider a globally supersymmetric model, with a superpotential W ∝ Φ2,
that can lead to chaotic inflation, with a small contribution ∼ e−Φ/F . While we work directly in the regime of
supersymmetry with a single chiral superfield, it is worth noticing that this same construction can be realized [25]
by supersymmetrizing the axion–four-form system of [14–16]. Mapping the resulting fermionic Lagrangian to that
studied in [1], and imposing theoretical as well as observational constraints, we find that this scenario can agree with
observations, leading in particular to a tensor-to-scalar ratio that can be as small as r ' .007, about a factor 8 below
the current bound."
"Given that the inflaton has Planckian excursions, however, the assumption of global supersymmetry is not ap-
propriate, and one has to go to the full supergravity description. We perform such an analysis in Section IV. We
consider models that are free from the η-problem [26] by choosing a Kähler potential that depends only on the com-
bination [27, 28] Φ + Φ̄. In order to design a potential that is dominated by the quadratic term and whose flatness
at large values of the inflaton is not spoiled by the supergravity correction, we consider models of inflation with a
stabilizer [28–30] superfield S. Since this system features two superfields Φ and S, we must diagonalize the dynamics
of two fermions, the inflatino and the stabilizerino, that is given in general terms in [31]. We do so by generalizing
the analysis of [32, 33] to the case where the system contains a pseudoscalar component, but with the simplifying
assumption that, thanks to the presence of the stabilizer, the superpotential vanishes on shell. To our knowledge,
such a calculation is new in the literature, and is our other main result."
"After diagonalizing the fermions, and in the regime where the inflaton potential has small oscillations superimposed
to a large monomial component, we find that the dynamics of this system is identical – up to simple redefinitions of
parameters – to the globally supersymmetric one. Thus the parameter space contains a viable region where the scalar
potential is essentially quadratic, but r can be as small as a factor ∼ 8 below the current constraints, also in the case
in which the model is embedded in supergravity."
"II. FERMION PRODUCTION DURING INFLATION, AND THE AMPLITUDE OF
TENSOR-TO-SCALAR RATIO"
"Let us start by reviewing the results of [1, 2]. Those papers contain the study of a system consisting of a pseudoscalar
inflaton ϕ with arbitrary potential V (ϕ) generated by the breaking of the shift symmetry ϕ → ϕ+constant, along
with a fermion Y of mass mψ. Including the shift symmetric coupling of lowest dimensionality of the inflaton to Y ,
the fermionic component of the Lagrangian takes the form"
"LY = Ȳ

"where f is a constant with the dimensions of a mass. It is convenient to define a new fermion field ψ, related to Y by"

")]}

"The expression (3) shows that, in the limit mψ → 0, the fermionic degree of freedom decouples from the inflaton. On
the other hand, the form (1) of the fermionic Lagrangian emphasizes the shift-symmetric nature of the fermion-inflaton
coupling."
"As shown in [1], the interaction described above, in a quasi-de Sitter background with Hubble parameter H,
leads to the generation of chiral quanta of ψ with an occupation number that is constant, and given approxi-
mately by .1 (mψ/H)"

� H3, and can affect the dynamics of the inflaton background and of its perturbations. In this"
"paper we will be interested in the regime in which the fermions do not affect significantly the background dynamics,
but provide the main source of inflaton perturbations."
"An especially interesting result of [1] is that, even in the regime in which the component sourced by the fermions
dominates the inflaton perturbations, the statistics of those perturbations is very close to gaussian, and in agreement
with the constraints from Planck [34]. This is due to the fact that, even if the process ψ̄ ψ → δϕ is a 2 → 1 process
that would naturally lead to non gaussian statistics, fermions from a broad set of momenta participate to the process,
and gaussianity is re-obtained as an effect of the central limit theorem. The bottom line is that the model of [1, 2]
can lead to a regime where the perturbations are sourced by the fermions, and still their properties are in agreement
with observations."
"Since the amplitude of the sourced perturbations has a functional dependence on the parameters of the system that
is different from the standard case, this set up has the potential of reviving models of inflation whose potential would
be otherwise ruled out by CMB constraints."
"We will focus here on the model of inflation where the potential has the simplest functional form: a quadratic
potential. In the standard case in which the perturbations are from the vacuum, this model’s prediction for the
spectral index is in agreement with data, but is ruled out by the amplitude of the tensor modes, since it predicts
r = 8/N , where N is the number of efoldings, that for N <∼ 60 requires r > .13, whereas Planck/Keck constrains
r < .06."
"The presence of fermions in the dynamics in the system naturally calls for a supersymmetric construction. In the
next section we will construct a globally supersymmetric model where we obtain the desired features, before moving
on to a construction in supergravity that is more complicated, but more appropriate, since we are discussing large
field inflation."

"1 This is by no means a consistent assumption, and we will make it in this section that has only illustrative purposes. In Section IV
below, on the other hand, we will consistently minimize the full potential of the model."
"The fermionic part of this Lagrangian is analogous, with the identifications F = f/2 and mψ = 2 Λ
3/F 2, to the"
"Lagrangian (3), with the addition of a mass term µ for the fermions (that, as we will see below, can be neglected),
while, neglecting the cosmological constant ∼ Λ6/F 2 that we assume to be renormalized to its observed value by some
mechanism, the scalar potential is that of chaotic inflation with oscillating corrections."
"We thus see that the simple superpotential eq. (4) can already lead to the kind of system outlined in Section II
above: a model of quadratic inflation (with small corrections) with a sizable coupling of fermions to the inflaton, where
the power spectrum of scalar perturbations may be dominated, in some region of parameter space, by the fermion
production and might thus be in agreement with Planck constraints. To make sure that this is the case, however, we
must explore the constraints on the parameter space available to the system."
"We will assume that the potential is dominated by its quadratic part, and that fermions give a negligible contribution
to the background dynamics, so that all the results from chaotic inflation will carry over. In particular, we will have
the approximate slow-roll relations"

"where N ' 60 is the number of efoldings until the end of inflation.
The strength of fermion production is measured by the dimensionless parameter ξ, that takes the value"
"ξ ≡
|ϕ̇|"
"We will assume, as is expected to be the case in UV-complete theories of gravity [35, 36], that the parameter F is
sub-Planckian, and small enough that ξ >∼ 1."
"Due to the presence of the term proportional to µ in the fermionic sector of the Lagrangian, the present system is
different, as discussed above, from that of [1, 2]. As shown in [1], however, fermion production happens for momenta
up to kcutoff ' 2Hξ. As a consequence, since slow roll requires µ� H while kcutoff >∼ H, the effect of the parameter
µ does not affect the dynamics of fermions to any significant level, and we can safely neglect it."
Let us now list the constraints on our parameter space.
"• Monotonicity of potential. In order for the oscillating term in the potential not to spoil the monotonicity of the
quadratic part during inflation we require"
"F 2µ

condition m2ψ ξ � 3π F"
"2 is satisfied [1]. In our model, this corresponds to the condition"
"3π

"Λ6MP

<∼ 1 . (10)
"• Validity of effective field theory. The term proportional to sin(ϕ/F ) in the scalar potential generates oscillations
of frequency ω = ϕ̇/F in the Hubble parameter. By requiring that physics occurs at scales below the cutoff 4πF
of the axionic effective field theory, we obtain the constraint ω <∼ 4πF , that translates into"
"µMP <∼ 2
√"
6πF 2 . (11)
"• Small mψ approximation. The results of [1, 2] have been obtained assuming mψ � H, that in terms of our
parameters reads"
"F 2
� µ"
"6
, (12)"
"that is identically satisfied when the condition of monotonicity of the potential, eq. (9) is satisfied. Also, eq. (12),
along with the requirement ξ � 1, implies that a second condition of perturbativity required in [1, 2], namely
that mψ � H"
"√
ξ, is identically satisfied."
Monotonicity
"FIG. 1: The parameter space for the model (6). The shaded region marked by an “r” is excluded by the observational bound
r < .06 on the amplitude of the tensor modes. The region labelled “EFT” is excluded by the constraint (11), and the region
labeled “Monotonicity” is excluded by the constraint (9)."
"• Tensor modes. The Planck-Keck constraint [4] r < .06 rules out standard quadratic inflation. As discussed
in [2], the amplitude of tensor modes in our model has essentially the same expression as in the standard case,
which gives a constraint"
"3π2
µ2"
"M2P
N < .06Pζ , (13)"
where Pζ is the scalar power spectrum.
"• No oscillations in scalar perturbations. Oscillations in the potential will induce oscillations in the power spectrum
of scalar perturbations. This phenomenon has been studied in detail in the case in which the scalar spectrum is
generated by the standard mechanism of amplification of vacuum fluctuations of the inflaton. The constraint on
the amplitude of those oscillations, δns, can be approximately written as δns <∼ 10"
"−3

"our model δns ' 6

"2πN1/4 Λ

"√
F/MP [38], which would provide a strong additional constraint on our model."
"However, these constraints do not hold in the regime we will be interested in, where the scalar perturbations
are sourced by the fermion field. As a consequence, we will not consider them in our analysis."
"• Nongaussianities. There are two potential sources of nongaussianities. First, those induced by the presence of
the fermion bath in interaction with the inflaton, that have been shown in [1] to be negligible. Second, there
is a possibility of resonant nongaussianities [38] induced by the small oscillations in the inflaton potential. As
in the point above, however, the existing estimates of the amplitude of this effect do not hold in the regime of
sourced perturbations we are interested in, and we will ignore them here."
"Once we fix the number of efoldings to N = 60, our theory has three parameters, namely Λ, µ and F . We can
eliminate one of them by imposing that the power spectrum takes its observed value Pζ = 2.2 × 10−9, using the
expression, obtained in [1],"

"In particular, it is convenient to use the normalization of the power spectrum to eliminate Λ. Once we do this, we
can plot the constraints enumerated above on a two-dimensional plot, see Figure 1. As one can see, there is a portion
of parameter space that satisfies all the constraints above, and that extends from F ' 3× 10−4MP to F ' 10−3MP
and where µ can be as small as 1.3 × 10−6MP . This implies, using eq. (13), that the tensor-to-scalar ratio in this
model of quadratic inflation with corrections can be as small as ∼ .007, i.e. about an order of magnitude below the
present bounds."
"Another well-constrained quantity we have not talked about is the spectral index, .961 <∼ ns <∼ .969 [39]. Its expres-
sion for this specific model is essentially the same as the standard chaotic inflation scenario, ns−1 = d logPζ/dN ' 2/N
so that by assuming the standard value N = 60 the spectral index is automatically in agreement with observations."
"To summarize this section, the globally supersymmetric model with superpotential (4), with the assumption that
the real component of the inflaton is stabilized, leads to a model of quadratic inflation that, thanks to inflaton-inflatino
interactions, is compatible with all the existing phenomenological constraints."
"Of course, this model with global supersymmetry is not quite suitable for chaotic inflation, where the fields can get
Planckian values. In the next section we will thus turn our attention to the more appropriate construction of a model
of supergravity where fermions can source the spectrum of scalar perturbations."
IV. THE FULL CONSTRUCTION IN SUPERGRAVITY
"Even before worrying about the role of fermions, the construction of models of inflation in supergravity is fa-
mously [26] a nontrivial task. In this paper we will consider models with a stabilizer [28–30], that allow to design
essentially any potential. The down side of these models is that they need at least two superfields – the inflaton and
the stabilizer, which makes the analysis of the fermionic sector quite cumbersome."
"In Section IV A below, we will study in general terms the equations of motion for the fermionic degrees of freedom
in models with an inflaton and a stabilizer superfields. Then, in Section IV B, we will specialize our equations to the
case of a superpotential leading to quadratic inflation with small oscillations, and we will show that the analysis of
parameter space performed in the globally supersymmetric model of Section III above can be directly applied to the
full supergravity construction."
A. Equations for fermions in models of supergravity with a stabilizer
"We start from a theory of two chiral multiplets coupling to the supergravity multiplet. Of the two spin-1/2 matter
fields, one is the goldstino and can be gauged away. We are thus left with two helicity-1/2 fermions, the transverse
component of the gravitino, θ = γiψi [40–42], and the fermion Υ [31], a linear combination of the fermions in the
matter multiplets. The longitudinal, helicity-3/2 component of the gravitino will play no significant role (it gets a
mass proportional to the superpotential [40–42], which vanishes in the models with stabilizer we are interested in),
and we will ignore it here. The derivation of the equations of motions for fermions in general supergravity models can
be found in [31], whose convention we adopt. In particular, eq. (9.20) in that paper provides the equations of motion
for the fermions:"

of function f(Φ) and Kähler potential, K(Φ, Φ̄). This allows a great deal of freedom in constructing a model with

the term proportional to µ in the first line of eq. (6)) is slow-roll suppressed, and we can neglect it here as we did in
Section III."
"To conclude, with the redefinition (41) the plot in Figure 1 applies also to the supergravity model. In particular,
this shows that the supergravity model defined by eqs. (17), (18) and (38) there is a regime of parameter space where
the data can be in agreement with all CMB constraints while the inflaton potential is, up to corrections that we want
to be negligible, simply quadratic."
V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
"Standard chaotic inflation is ruled out by experiment. It predicts too large a value for the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The
tensor spectrum is determined by the energy scale of inflation, which in the simple model of quadratic inflation is fixed
by the normalization of the scalar spectrum. We have shown in this paper that a source-dominated scalar spectrum
can allow to lower the energy scale of inflation, thereby bringing chaotic inflation back into the observationally allowed
regime."
"In the papers [1, 2] it was shown that fermions coupled to an axion inflaton can lead to a source-dominated scalar
spectrum and a vacuum-dominated tensor spectrum. More specifically, since the vacuum perturbations and sourced
perturbations of the scalar modes are statistically independent, the power spectrum is the sum, Pζ = Pvacuumζ +
Psourcedζ , and similarly for the tensor spectrum. Therefore, the fermion-sourced model with 2.2× 10"
"−9 ' Psourcedζ �
Pvacuumζ ∝ V ∝ Pt, allows one to lower the energy scale of inflation. With Pt dominated by the vacuum perturbations
one can then lower the value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio."
"This work contains two main results. First, we have shown that the model of [1, 2] can be effectively constructed
from a globally supersymmetric model with superpotential (4). This superpotential generates a quadratic scalar
potential, plus small oscillations. The fermion sector produces the inflaton-fermion coupling studied in [1, 2] with a
negligible additional fermion mass term. In particular, this applies naturally to the model of [14–16], that naturally
leads to a quadratic inflaton potential using monodromy. Thus, the analysis from [1, 2] applies, allowing for the
lowering of r while maintaining ns unaffected and without generating large non-Gaussianities. While the model is
subject to a number of constraints, there is a region, in white in Figure 1, where those constraints are all satisfied."
"Second, we have examined supergravity with two chiral multiplets with one of the scalars acting as a stabilizer.
In Section IV A we have written down the general equations of motions for the fermions in this class of models."
"Remarkably, the two helicity-1/2 states in the theory behave identically, as fermions with mass M1 + iM2γ
5, where"
"the generally time dependent terms M1 and M2 are given in eq. (36). Specializing to the case where the superpotential
consists of a slowly varying component and quickly oscillating term, we have shown in Section IV B that the equations
for the fermions in the full supergravity theory reduce to those obtained in the case of the globally supersymmetric
model, in agreement with the intuition from the equivalence theorem [45–47]. It would be interesting to see whether
these results extend to more general classes, beyond those with a stabilizer, of models of axion inflation in supergravity.
It is also worth stressing that, while we have focused on quadratic potential, our construction can be extended to
general models of monomial inflation. The bottom line is that, in a class of relatively simple models of inflation in
supergravity, the potential can be essentially quadratic while the theory is compatible with all existing observations."
