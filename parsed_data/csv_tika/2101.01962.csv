ABSTRACT
A highly important aspect of solar activity is the coupling between eruptions and the surrounding
"coronal magnetic-field topology, which determines the trajectory and morphology of the event and can"
"even lead to sympathetic eruptions from multiple sources. In this paper, we report on a numerical"
"simulation of a new type of coupled eruption, in which a coronal jet initiated by a large pseudostreamer"
filament eruption triggers a streamer-blowout coronal mass ejection (CME) from the neighboring hel-
met streamer. Our configuration has a large opposite-polarity region positioned between the polar
"coronal hole and a small equatorial coronal hole, forming a pseudostreamer flanked by the coronal"
"holes and the helmet streamer. Further out, the pseudostreamer stalk takes the shape of an extended"
arc in the heliosphere. We energize the system by applying photospheric shear along a section of
the polarity inversion line within the pseudostreamer. The resulting sheared-arcade filament channel
"develops a flux rope that eventually erupts as a classic coronal-hole-type jet. However, the enhanced"
breakout reconnection above the channel as the jet is launched progresses into the neighboring hel-
"met streamer, partially launching the jet along closed helmet streamer field lines and blowing out the"
streamer top to produce a classic bubble-like CME. This CME is strongly deflected from the jet’s initial
trajectory and contains a mixture of open and closed magnetic field lines. We present the detailed
"dynamics of this new type of coupled eruption, its underlying mechanisms and the implications of this"
work for the interpretation of in-situ and remote-sensing observations.

The solar corona hosts a tremendous amount of erup-
tive activity and flare energy release that plays out

across a vast range of sizes and time scales. At the
"largest scales, eruptive active-region flares produce sub-"
stantial bubble-like coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that
can strongly influence near-Earth space weather (e.g.
Webb & Howard 2012). At the smallest end of the spec-
"trum, tiny filament-channel eruptions form coronal jets"
(e.g. Sterling et al. 2015). The ultimate unifying feature
"of all these eruptions are filament channels, consisting of"
strongly sheared magnetic field lines that follow polar-
ity inversion lines (PILs) of the normal magnetic field
component on the solar surface (Martin 1998). Fila-
ment channels provide the free magnetic energy for the
"eruption, but it is the interaction between the filament"
channel and the surrounding magnetic field that dictates

how the eruption is triggered and its eventual morphol-
A prime example of this variety is the array of erup-
tion morphologies that result from filament channels
formed within multipolar magnetic topologies. At the
"largest scales, these eruptions can be triggered by the"
systematic removal of strapping flux by reconnection at
"a coronal null point, magnetic breakout (Antiochos et al."
"1999). Such events ultimately lead to fast, large-scale,"
"bubble-like CMEs (e.g., Lynch et al. 2008, 2009, 2016;"
"Karpen et al. 2012; Masson et al. 2013, 2019; Chen et al."
"2016; Dahlin et al. 2019). At much smaller scales, both"
observations (e.g. Sterling et al. 2015; Moore et al. 2018;
"Kumar et al. 2018, 2019) and simulations (e.g. Wyper"
"et al. 2017, 2018, 2019) have shown that the same erup-"
tion mechanism is at work in the mini-filament eruptions
that form many coronal jets. The key difference deter-
mining the eruption morphology is how the erupting flux
rope that forms from the filament channel interacts with
"the surrounding magnetic field. In jets, the flux rope re-"
"connects at the null point low in the corona, transferring"
magnetic twist and filament plasma to the surrounding
open field and creating a narrow plasma ejection that
adds no new open flux to the heliosphere. In eruptions
"at active-region scales, on the other hand, the erupt-"
ing flux rope remains connected to the surface at both
"ends, opening new flux into the heliosphere as part of"
the bubble-shaped CME. The local magnetic environ-
ment around the filament channel clearly plays a crucial
role in its eventual eruptive morphology.
"Perhaps the most definitive, and certainly the most"
"striking, example of the interaction between the filament"
channel and its surrounding is the phenomenon of sym-
pathetic eruptions. That flares can be sympathetic has
"been known for many decades (e.g. Richardson 1951),"
but sympathetic eruptions have attracted much atten-
"tion recently due to the high-cadence, full-Sun coronal"
"observations of STEREO and SDO (e.g., Schrijver &"
Title 2011; Titov et al. 2012; Jin et al. 2016). By exam-
ining a series of eruptions that included filament ejec-
"tions, flares, and CMEs, and whose locations covered"
"a large fraction of the solar surface, Schrijver & Title"
(2011) presented compelling observational evidence that
the sympathetic nature was due to the reconnection in
"the corona of neighboring magnetic flux systems, as oc-"
curs in the breakout model. Subsequent numerical mod-
eling by Török et al. (2011) and Lynch & Edmondson
(2013) demonstrated that null-point reconnection in the
"corona, as in breakout, naturally couples different flux"
systems and leads to the sympathetic eruptions. A key
"feature of these and other studies, both observational"
"and theoretical, is that each eruption has its own fila-"
"ment channel. Consequently, each flux system is primed"
to erupt and one simply destabilizes the next. Our new
"work presented here, in contrast, shows that a coupled"
eruption of multiple flux systems can be driven by a sin-
"gle filament channel. Furthermore, it shows that break-"
"out reconnection can energize, as well as destabilize, cou-"
pled eruptions.
The vast difference in scales and energies between
"eruptions that produce large-scale, bubble-like CMEs"
"versus small-scale, collimated coronal jets implies that"
"there is a continuum of eruption scenarios in between,"
unified by the role of breakout reconnection in dictating
the eruption morphology. One scenario in this middle
"ground is a filament eruption from a pseudostreamer. At
first glance, pseudostreamers have the same topology as"
"coronal jets, simply on a much larger scale. Figure 1"
shows a SWAP image of a pseudostreamer harbouring
"a small filament observed on the limb. In profile, the"
pseudostreamer topology resembles that of a single null
"point above two coronal arcades, which sit between coro-"
nal holes of like polarity. The presence of this multipo-
"lar topology assures that, like mini-filament coronal-hole"
"jets, pseudostreamers can host filament eruptions that"
occur via magnetic breakout.
"In general, however, the large-scale nature of pseu-"
dostreamers leads to a much richer variety of mag-
netic structure than those that underlie jets. The clos-
est to jets are small pseudostreamers associated with
newly emerged active regions within low-latitude coro-
nal holes. These pseudostreamers have a quasi-circular

"base, anemone-like when view from above, with a sin-"
gle magnetic null (Shibata et al. 1994; Asai et al. 2008;
Kumar et al. 2021) in the “embedded bipole” topology
(Antiochos 1990). More complex are the pseudostream-
ers that form above the long tails of minority polar-
"ity, stretched out by differential rotation and meridional"
"flow, that are associated with decaying active regions."
These often involve multiple nulls and/or bald patches
"along the length of the pseudostreamer, and they are so"
large that their proximity to the nearby helmet-streamer
boundary also must be taken into account (Titov et al.
"2011, 2012; Scott et al. 2018, 2019; Masson et al. 2019)."
Large pseudostreamers are key contributors to the
"complexity of the S-Web (Antiochos et al. 2011), in"
which the outer spines and/or fan planes of the nulls sep-
arating the magnetic flux of neighbouring coronal holes
form broad arcs that extend far out into the heliosphere.
Pseudostreamers bordering equatorial coronal holes and
their associated S-Web arcs are common features of the
corona throughout the sunspot cycle (Scott et al. 2019).
"Yet to date, no simulation studies that we have seen"
model a large-scale pseudostreamer eruption and exam-
ine its effects on the global helmet streamer and the
S-Web.
"In this work, we present a simulation that addresses"
"both of these interactions, along with the specifics of the"
pseudostreamer eruption itself. We constructed a large
pseudostreamer that has multiple null points and sepa-
"rator lines (Fig. 2(a)), is bounded north and south by"
"the polar and an equatorial coronal hole, and that par-"
tially underlies the global helmet streamer that forms
the polar coronal-hole boundary to the east and west of
the pseudostreamer (Fig. 2(c)). The pseudostreamer is
"rooted in a large, elliptical region of minority polarity"
that represents a decayed active region. There are sev-
eral important differences between this simulation and
"our previous studies of jets and CMEs. First, the “over-"
lying” coronal field consists of both open (coronal-hole)
"and closed (helmet-streamer) flux. In earlier work, the"
overlying field was either entirely open (jets) or entirely
closed (CMEs). The separatrix dome of the minority
polarity forms a section of the open/closed flux bound-
ary and connects the polar and equatorial coronal holes.
"In addition, the dome connects the pseudostreamer to"
"the neighboring helmet streamer, so that reconnection"
between the pseudostreamer and helmet-streamer fluxes
"is possible. As we shall see, the breakout reconnection"
indeed involves both the usual open/closed interchange
reconnection of jets (Wyper et al. 2018) and the usual
"closed/closed reconnection of CMEs (e.g., Masson et al."
"2019; Dahlin et al. 2019). Second, the reconnection in"
the corona can occur at multiple null points and along
"the separator line. Consequently, it could be expected"
to be much more efficient than single-null-point recon-
"nection, but the effect this should have on the eruption"
is not clear. Highly efficient breakout reconnection may
limit the amount of free energy that can be built up in
the filament channel; but it also may allow more of the
"stored free energy to be released. Third, as will be shown"
"below, the filament channel that we formed extends over"
a rather small fraction (< 25%) of the PIL of the mi-
"nority polarity. For a single null point, it is not obvious"
that an explosive eruption could be obtained with such
"a small filament channel. Highly efficient, multiple null-"
point breakout reconnection could play a critical role in
the vigor of an eruption from our pseudostreamer.
The results presented below show that the low-coronal
evolution of our pseudostreamer eruption is quite simi-
"lar to that of a mini-filament jet, and that breakout re-"
connection plays a similarly central role in dictating the
"eruption morphology. However, rather than producing a"
"collimated jet-like expulsion of mass in the outer corona,"
our simulated eruption generates a bubble-like CME by
blowing out the top of the adjacent helmet streamer.
The ejected magnetic flux is comprised of a mixture of
open and closed field lines that broadly follow the S-Web
arc. This result has important implications for in-situ
"observations, as we briefly discuss. In §2 we give the
simulation details. §§3, 4, and 5 describe, respectively,
the pre-eruptive changes to the magnetic field, the low-"
"coronal evolution of the eruption, and the energy re-"
"lease. §§6 and 7 examine the subsequent blowing out
of the nearby helmet streamer. §§8 and 9 describe the
CME and the potential associated impulsive solar ener-"
"getic particle (SEP) signatures, respectively. We discuss"
our findings and present our conclusions in §10.
2. MODEL DESCRIPTION
2.1. Equations and Initial Condition
The simulation was performed using the Adaptively
"Refined Magnetohydrodynamics Solver (ARMS), which"
uses a Flux-Corrected Transport algorithm to capture
shocks and minimize numerical diffusion (DeVore 1991).
The following ideal MHD equations were solved in spher-
ical coordinates:
"∂t
+ ∇ · (ρu) = 0, (1)"
"∂t
+ ∇ · (ρuu) ="
"4π
(∇×B)×B−∇P + ρg, (2)"
"∂t
−∇× (u×B) = 0, (3)"
"where ρ is the plasma mass density, u the plasma ve-"
"locity, B the magnetic field, P the plasma pressure, and"
"g = −GM�r/r3 the gravitational acceleration. Mag-
netic reconnection in the model occurs due to numer-"
ical diffusion associated with the algorithm. We as-
"sume a fully ionised hydrogen plasma, so that P ="
2(ρ/mp)kBT . The temperature is further assumed to
be constant and uniform throughout the volume with
T = 1 MK.
"The simulation volume is given by φ ∈ [−180◦, 180◦]
in longitude, θ ∈ [−81◦,+81◦] in latitude, and r ∈
[1Rs, 30Rs] in radius. The domain is periodic in φ."
"At the inner radial boundary, mass is allowed to flow"
"into, but not out of, the volume. The three radial guard"
cells below the inner boundary are fixed at their initial
"densities, with their velocity components set to zero."
These cells act as a reservoir of mass sustaining the
wind solution described below. The magnetic field at
"the radial inner boundary is line-tied, with the tangen-"
tial velocity components set to zero except where pre-
scribed otherwise by the driving flow given below. At
"the outer radial boundary, flow-through (zero-gradient"
extrapolated) conditions are applied to the radial ve-
locity component and half-slip (zero-value outside) con-
ditions are applied to the tangential components. On
"the θ boundaries, the normal velocity is reflecting and"
the tangential components are free-slip (zero-gradient).
"Altogether, these boundary conditions maintain a quasi-"
"steady, isothermal solar wind throughout the open field"
in the domain.
The initial magnetic field is given by a potential-field
"source-surface (PFSS) solution, with the source surface"
at 3Rs. The magnetic field at the radial inner boundary
is defined analytically by combining sub-surface mag-
netic dipoles with a Sun-centered dipole that defines
the global dipolar magnetic field. The global dipole
"is chosen so that |Br| = 10 G at the poles. The sub-
surface dipoles are placed so as to create a strip of neg-"
"ative polarity in the northern hemisphere, bordering a"
"strong equatorial bipolar active region, Fig. 3(a). The"
equatorial active region acts to pull the helmet streamer
southward whilst the strip of negative polarity cuts off
"a section of northern polar coronal hole, forming a dis-"
connected coronal hole separated from the north-pole
hole by a pseudostreamer (Titov et al. 2011; Scott et al.

"polarity flux is a common feature in magnetograms, typ-"
ically forming as active regions decay and their trailing
polarity “rushes” to the pole due to meridional flow (e.g.
Howard & Labonte 1981; Wang et al. 1989).

"Here v(r) is the radial velocity, cs = (2kBT0/mp)

2 is"
"the isothermal sound speed, and rs = GM�mp/4kBT0
is the radius of the sonic point. With T0 = 1 × 106 K,
v = cs = 128 km/s at r = rs = 5.8R�. The plasma"
number density at the base of the atmosphere is a free
"parameter that we set to 7.2×109 cm−3. This value gives
a minimum plasma β (ratio of thermal to magnetic pres-"
"sure) in the vicinity of the pseudostreamer of about 10%,"
so the dynamics is properly field-dominated. The den-
sity and the resultant Alfvén speed are intended to be
more typical of closed-field regions below pseudostream-
"ers and helmet streamers, where our eruption occurs,"
than of open-field regions in the neighboring coronal
holes.
The magnetic field defined by the PFSS solution and
"the plasma wind solution are not initially in equilibrium,"
so before the surface driving was applied the simula-
tion was first run out through a long relaxation phase
(> 1×106 s) until the plasma and magnetic field evolved
to near pressure balance. Figure 3(b) shows the plasma
velocity in a plane of constant longitude after the relax-
"ation. Away from the heliospheric current sheet, the so-"
"lar wind reaches ≈ 350 km/s at 30Rs. This wind speed,
more typical of slow rather than fast wind, is due to the"
low temperature T and our simplifying isothermal ap-
"proximation. However, our main goals of tracking with"
high fidelity the low-coronal evolution of the eruption
and its interaction with the helmet streamer are not af-
fected significantly by the asymptotic wind speed.
The base grid is uniformly spaced in φ and θ and is
stretched exponentially in radius. Four levels of grid re-
finement were allowed in the simulation. A fixed region
of maximal resolution was included that encompassed
the pseudostreamer. Figure 3(a) shows the grid blocks
on the surface in this region. Each grid block consists of
"8×8×8 grid cells. The minimum angular grid spacing is
≈ 0.28◦ in both φ and θ, corresponding to a maximum
grid resolution (at the finest grid level) on the inner ra-"
"dial boundary of ≈ 3.4 Mm. In the rest of the volume,
the grid was adapted dynamically based on local gra-"
dients in the magnetic field (see Karpen et al. (2012)
for details of the method). The parameters were cho-
sen to maximally resolve the heliospheric current sheet
"(Fig. 3(b)), as well as the shocks and current sheets as-"
sociated with the CME once underway. To make the
calculation more tractable and reduce the overall grid
"size, the maximal resolution on the back side of the Sun"
"(φ ∈ [−180,−90] ∪ [+90,+180]) was limited to three,
rather than four, levels of refinement."
2.2. Topology of the Relaxed State
The magnetic topology of the pseudostreamer after
"the relaxation is shown in Figure 2(a). The surface Br
distribution was chosen such that there were two local"
"minima of Br within the negative-polarity strip, Fig-"
ure 3(a). This naturally creates a system of at least
"three nulls, one associated with each minimum (NP1"
and NP3) and another that resides between them (NP2).
Two separators connect the three nulls along the top of
the separatrix surface dome. In the PFSS solution only
"these three nulls were present. However, during the re-"
laxation currents naturally developed around the nulls
and along the separators. Combined with changes in the
field around the pseudostreamer as the helmet streamer
"relaxed, this led to a bifurcation of NP3 and the for-"
"mation of two further nulls, labeled NP4 and NP5, con-"
nected by an additional two separators. Due to where we
"store the magnetic free energy in our simulation, these"
additional nulls are not involved in the eruption.
The key elements of the pseudostreamer topology can
"be understood by considering NP1, NP2, and NP3 (with"
NP4 and NP5 understood by extension). The fan planes
of NP1 and NP3 form the main sections of the sepa-
ratrix surface that divide the closed field beneath the
pseudostreamer from the surrounding open (or distantly
closing) field in the rest of the corona (blue and red field
"lines, Fig. 2(a)). The inner spines of each null connect"
to the strip of negative Br beneath the pseudostreamer;
the outer spines connect to negative Br in the southern
hemisphere. Both nulls therefore reside in the closed
field beneath the helmet streamer.
NP2 sits at the intersection of the fan planes of NP1
and NP3. The spines and fan of NP2 are oppositely ori-
"ented to those of NP1 and NP3, so that the spines of"
NP2 sit on the separatrix surface of the pseudostreamer
"and its fan plane is aligned radially (yellow field lines,"
Fig. 2(a)). The spines of adjacent nulls actually bound
"the fan plane of the other, so the radial partially open"
fan plane of NP2 is bounded on either side by the closed
"spines of NP1 and NP3. As a consequence, the fan of"
NP2 must straddle the open-closed separatrix of the
helmet streamer (note the closed yellow field lines ad-
"jacent to NP1 and NP3, Fig. 2(a)). Therefore, there"
must be two separators connecting the base of the helio-
"spheric current sheet with NP2 (shown in magenta, Fig."
2(a)). A similar alternation of null orientation occurs
"for NP3, NP4, and NP5, although the fan plane of NP4"
lies entirely within the closed field beneath the helmet
streamer.
The surface connectivity of the relaxed state is shown
"in Figure 2(c). Yellow regions show open field, high-"
lighting the triangular low-latitude corona hole cut off
by the pseudostreamer. The logarithm of the squashing
factor (Q; Titov 2007) is shown in gray scale. Strips
of high Q show regions where the field-line connectiv-
"ity varies rapidly between adjacent footpoints, and Q"
is formally infinite at separatrix surfaces. The foot-
"print of the global helmet streamer is evident, along"
with a closed curve of high Q showing the footprint of
the pseudostreamer separatrix dome. The footpoints of
the spines of each null and the strips of high Q asso-
ciated with fan planes of NP2 and NP4 are also high-
"lighted (F2 and F4, respectively). The fan plane of NP2"
"is truly global, in that it connects to the surface be-"
"neath the pseudostreamer, to distant positions in the"
"southern hemisphere, and also out into the solar wind,"
where it forms an S-web arc (Antiochos et al. 2011) di-
viding the open fluxes of the equatorial and northern
polar coronal holes. Field lines within the arc and the
associated high-Q arc at 30Rs are shown in Figure 2(b)
"and (d). Given such global connectivity, one should ex-"
"pect a global influence of the eruption, which indeed"
is what we find. Figure 2(d) also shows several small
regions of disconnected magnetic flux that are associ-
ated with concave-up field lines (“U-loops”) that enter
and leave the domain through the outer radial boundary
and localised bundles of spiral field lines and compressed
plasma (“plasmoids”) within the heliospheric current
sheet. These features are formed and expelled period-
ically as part of the dynamic quasi-steady state of the
magnetic structure (Higginson et al. 2017; Titov et al.
2017).
2.3. Filament Channel Formation
"In the classic 2D picture of a pseudostreamer, fil-"
ament channels can form at the PILs beneath either
or both of the two closed field regions associated with
"the null point. In 3D, these two separate PILs join"
"to form a closed loop. Theoretically, filament channels"
"can form along any section of this PIL, but the most"
energetic would be expected to form between strong
concentrations of Br associated with stronger strapping
"field. That is, these sections of PIL are able to sup-"
port higher energy density (higher magnetic pressure)
because of their increased strapping field. Due to the
"distribution of Br on the solar surface, chosen so as to"
"generate the pseudostreamer topology described above,"
there are four sections of PIL bordered by local peaks in
"|Br| as shown in green in Figure 4(a). These various lo-
cations for energetic filament-channel formation would"
be expected to stress different nulls and separators in

"the pseudostreamer topology, with associated differences"
in the connectivity changes occurring during eruption.
"Furthermore, combinations of filament channels in dif-"
ferent locations can produce sympathetic eruptions (e.g.
Török et al. 2011; Lynch & Edmondson 2013).
We performed several simulations in which filament
channels formed along each of the highlighted sections.
"In this paper, we focus on the case where a filament"
"channel is formed at PIL1, leaving the exploration of"
eruption morphologies and coupling behaviour of fila-
ment channels formed along the other sections to future
"studies. To create the filament channel, a tangential ve-"
locity field was imposed on the lower boundary. The
"velocity profile, a generalisation of one used by Higgin-"
"son et al. (2017), is an elliptical flow pattern, tilted with"
"respect to the θ, φ coordinates, that preserves Br on the"
surface throughout the evolution. It is shown in Figure
4(b). In order to satisfy

"By construction, streamlines of the driving flow follow"
the contours of ψ over a compact surface region where
"ψ 6= 0. The function g(ξ) defines a simple tilted ellipse
that depends upon the spatial coordinates (θ, φ); h(η)"
depends solely upon Br and serves to keep the boundary

latter is not distorted by the flow. We choose

"further restricted to the region where Br < B2, whence"
"h(η) 6= 0. We chose constants B1 = −50, B2 = −1,

the northern hemisphere (e.g. Martin 1998).
The driving speed peaks at about 30 km s−1 in a strip
"along the PIL, but drops to ≈ 2 km s−1 in the return-
flow region away from the PIL. The peak speed is highly"
"sub-Alfvénic and subsonic, so free energy is injected"
quasi-statically. The time profile for f(t) is chosen so
that the driving is ramped up to its maximum speed
"over 500 s, held constant for a time, and then is ramped"
down to zero over another 500 s once the eruption is
"underway. For convenience, henceforth we will define"
t = 0 as corresponding to the start of the driving. Rela-
"tive to this, the driving is stopped at t = 98, 000 s (27 hrs"
13 min).
Figure 4(d) and (e) show field lines in the filament
channel 15 hrs 50 min into the driving. The magenta
field lines in the filament channel form a classic sigmoid
shape. Blue field lines show the approximate position of
"the spines of NP1, the outer spine of which has opened"
"by this time (see §7). It also shows the slightly inflated
shape of the separatrix. At this time, NP1 sits at 1.29 Rs
(203 Mm above the surface), although it rises further"
as the filament channel continues to form. Figure 4(c)
"shows that two hooked, J-shaped, high-Q lines form in"
association with the sigmoidal field lines (e.g. Démoulin
et al. 1996; Janvier et al. 2013). It also shows a slight
"shift in the pseudostreamer separatrix dome footprint,"
indicating that a small amount of strapping field has re-
"connected, along with a retreat of the adjacent helmet-"
"streamer boundary, which now has a snub-nosed rather"
than tapered appearance. The snub-nosed shape is a sig-
nature that the helmet streamer is no longer connected
"to NP2 on this side. Moreover, an extremely thin cor-"
ridor of open flux has formed to connect the equatorial
and polar coronal holes: the widening of the thin cor-
"ridor at its ends, where the open flux of the corridor"
"meets the open flux of the coronal hole, is responsible"
for the shape of the boundary. Corridor formation also
is consistent with the observed shift of the outer spine of
NP1 into the open field. A similar switch from tapered
to snub-nosed shape can be seen in the helmet-streamer
boundary footprint of Titov et al. (2011) (see their Fig-
"ures 5 and 6), although not explicitly noted by them in"
"text, when a singularly thin corridor formed during an"
identical topological evolution.
3. PRE-ERUPTION CHANGES
"Throughout the slow driving phase prior to erup-
tion initiation, the magnetic shear continually increases"
within the filament channel. The strong gradient in the
driving profile adjacent to the PIL forms a concentrated
volumetric current distribution along the PIL within the
filament channel. Slow tether-cutting (or slipping) re-
connection (Moore et al. 2001; Aulanier et al. 2012) in-
side this current distribution gradually converts some
"of the sigmoid-shaped, sheared-arcade field lines into a"
"small flux rope suspended above the PIL. For simplicity,"
we refer to this current concentration as the flare cur-
"rent sheet, although the flare reconnection begins much"
"later in the evolution, during the explosive eruption and"
occurs in the lower corona below the growing flux rope.
"We emphasize that, at this early stage, the evolution is"
quasi-static and the current concentration forms entirely
due to the driving profile. The flux rope begins to form
about 21 hrs into the driving.

Concurrent with the formation of the flux rope is
the continued expansion of the strapping field above
the filament channel. This expansion stresses the pseu-
"dostreamer topology, lengthening the weak current sheet"
already present around NP1 following the relaxation.
"About t = 23 hrs 30 min into this gradual phase, sys-"
tematic reconnection of the strapping field begins and
feeds back upon the expansion of the filament chan-
"nel, allowing the channel and embedded flux rope to"
rise faster. We designate this time as the onset of the
"breakout reconnection phase, and we denote the current"
sheet around NP1 as the breakout current sheet from
this point onward.
Figure 5(a) shows relevant field lines within and
around the filament channel and the two current sheets
"at 24 hrs 10 min into the driving, shortly after break-"
out reconnection begins. The open lobe and the exter-
nal field lines reside in the polar and equatorial coronal
"holes, respectively. The volumetric current distribution"
within the filament channel shows that the formation of
the flux rope has transformed the channel flux surfaces
from semi-circular to inverse-teardrop shaped. Mean-
"while, the strengthening of the overlying breakout cur-"
rent sheet creates the characteristic cusp shape at the
top of the closed-lobe region (e.g. Kumar et al. 2021;
Wang & Hess 2018).
"Recently, Kumar et al. (2021) identified observed EUV"
dimmings above the breakout current sheet as a new di-
agnostic signaling the onset of breakout reconnection.
The dimming occurs due to depletion of plasma in the
surrounding volume as external field sweeps into the
"breakout sheet, reconnects, and flows out along the"
sheet as reconnection exhaust. Figure 5(b) shows a syn-
thetic EUV base-difference image of our simulation at
"this time, revealing this dimming as well as the en-"
hanced density in the reconnection outflow along the
pseudostreamer spire. The subtracted base image is
"taken from time t = 22 hrs 30 min, about an hour before"
breakout-reconnection onset.
The presence of the flux rope makes it difficult to be
unambiguous about the precise mechanism that triggers
the continued rise of the flux rope towards eruption from
this time onward. Breakout reconnection certainly is key
to maintaining the eruption once the flux rope is rising
"rapidly. However, it is possible that an ideal rise of the"
flux rope due to torus instability couples to the breakout
"reconnection, to tip the evolution into a self-sustaining"
feedback. A similar coupling associated with ideal kink
instability recently was shown to occur in simulations of
active-region periphery jets (Wyper et al. 2019). Com-
parisons of our results with those from a perfectly ideal-
MHD model (e.g. Pariat et al. 2009; Rachmeler et al.
"2010), which is well beyond the scope of the current"
"investigation, would be required to address this issue"
"definitively. However, it is clear from the fast evolu-"
tion following onset of reconnection of the flux rope and
from the energy plots (both described in detail below)
that ideal instability of the flux rope is not the dominant
process once the eruption is underway.
4. LOW-CORONAL EVOLUTION
4.1. Eruption Kinematics
"Initially, the pseudostreamer eruption closely follows"
"the evolution of a mini-filament jet, but on a much larger"
"scale. Once the breakout reconnection gets underway,"
the strapping field above the flux rope begins to be re-
"moved and the flux rope continues its rise, slowly at"
first. Figure 6(a) shows the same field lines from Figure
5 2 hrs 13 min later. The field lines are traced from fixed
(un-driven) points on the surface. The closing down of
the red external field lines and the opening up of the
cyan strapping field lines show the progression of the
breakout reconnection.
"As the reconnection continues, the breakout current"
sheet moves southward as the external field (red field
lines) sequentially reconnects. This orients the current
sheet radially and positions it directly above the now-
expanded (with reconnected flux) south lobe of the pseu-

"dostreamer, Figure 6(b). As the last of the strapping"
"flux is exhausted, the rising flux rope becomes bent to-"
wards the breakout current sheet over the top of the
"south lobe, Figure 6(b). This bending of the filament-"
"channel field, with or without filament/prominence ma-"
"terial, is a typical feature of pseudostreamer eruptions"
"(e.g. Panasenco et al. 2011; Kumar et al. 2018, 2021)."
"In addition to bending, the flux rope accumulates more"
"flux, as the reconnection in the flare current sheet is en-"
hanced by the stretching of the sheet as the flux rope
rises.
When the flux rope reaches the breakout current
"sheet, the system departs from its previously quasi-2D"
"evolution and enters a fully 3D phase, described below,"
in which the flux rope reconnects and a large fraction
of the twist within the flux rope is liberated. Exactly
"analogous to mini-filament jets, this transfer of twist"
launches an untwisting plasma jet characterised by a fast
radial velocity component (Fig. 6(f)) and oppositely di-
"rected line-of-sight velocity components on either side of,"
"and extended along, the jet axis; see Figure 6(i). This"
shows that the low-coronal evolution of our simulated
eruption is essentially that of a large-scale coronal jet.
4.2. Flux-Rope Reconnection
The reconnection of the flux rope is inherently three-
"dimensional, and cannot be described adequately by"
two-dimensional models. Figure 7 shows field lines in the
"flux rope before, during, and after the reconnection. Ma-"
genta field lines are traced from positive-polarity foot-

"points, whilst silver field lines are traced from the con-"
jugate footpoints in the negative polarity. As the flux
"rope begins to reconnect, some of the magenta field lines"
open up whilst their counterpart silver field lines be-
"come part of the southern lobe of the pseudostreamer,"
Figure 7(b). Figure 8 shows the current density mag-
"nitude at this time, shaded by the radial component of"
"the current density vector. At this crucial moment, the"
breakout current sheet curving around the outer edge of
the flux rope and the flare current sheet following be-
"hind it combine, forming one long current sheet. The"
direction of the current is indicated in Figure 8(b) by
the green arrows. This marks the instant when the null
point within the breakout layer (NP1) begins to slide

"behind the flux rope (§7). It is exactly the same topol-
ogy change as occurs in our mini-filament jets (Wyper"
et al. 2018).
"Once the null has shifted to the flare current sheet,"
the flare reconnection transitions from quasi-separatrix
"layer reconnection to null-point reconnection, and the"
positive-polarity footpoint of the flux rope opens com-
"pletely, Figure 7(c). The breakout current sheet is car-"
"ried upwards with the eruption, forming the interface"
between the outwardly propagating twisted field and
the untwisted ambient field surrounding it. The over-
pressure of the magnetic flux built up in the southern
lobe during the breakout phase drives fast flare recon-
"nection at the null, opening flux from the southern lobe"
"whilst closing new flux into the northern lobe, the flare"
arcades. The flare reconnection acts to reverse much
of the flux transfer that occurred during the breakout
"phase, re-opening external field lines (red) and re-closing"
strapping field lines (cyan); see Figure 7(d). Impor-
"tantly for the connectivity of the CME, some of the field"
lines (magenta) from the positive-polarity footpoint of
the flux rope get swept into the flare current sheet and
"also re-close, becoming part of the flare loops. That is,"
they become disconnected from the CME (§6).
5. ENERGETICS
The evolution of the total kinetic and magnetic ener-
gies of the system further confirm the jet-like nature of
the eruption. We define the free magnetic and kinetic
energies as

where t = 0 corresponds to the start of the driving. Al-
though some residual fluctuations occur in the relaxed

"state, they are small compared to the energy stored and"
"released by the eruption. Therefore, the above quan-"
tities provide a reasonable approximation to the ac-
tual magnetic energy stored and kinetic energy liber-
ated by the eruption. Both curves are shown in Figure
9. The timing of the different phases of the eruption
are marked with dashed lines. The kink in Em shortly
after t = 27 hrs coincides with the time the driving is
stopped. Once the breakout reconnection is initiated
"(t ≈ 23 hrs 30 min), there is a gradual rise in kinetic en-
ergy, accompanied by a gradual reduction in the mag-"
"netic energy after the driving ceases. However, the ma-"
jor magnetic energy release occurs when the flux rope
reaches the breakout current sheet and reconnects at
"t ≈ 30 hrs 30 min, whereupon the kinetic energy rapidly
increases as the eruption is launched. The rapid changes"
in both energies are short-lived and slow down after
"about an hour, thereafter entering a more gradual relax-"
ation phase. We found an almost identical qualitative
behaviour in our previous jet simulations (Wyper et al.
"2017, 2018), although the kinetic energy continues to"
rise once the CME is launched in the present case with
solar wind.
6. COUPLED HELMET-STREAMER BLOWOUT
We have seen that the low-coronal behaviour of the
pseudostreamer eruption resembles that of a large-scale
"jet; however, the dynamics of the global topology results"
"in a clear CME, which we now show is bubble-like. The"
pseudostreamer is in sufficiently close proximity to the
open-closed separatrix of the helmet streamer that the
helmet streamer participates in the ejection of the flux
"rope, as discussed further in §7. Consequently, rather
than transferring twist entirely onto open field lines as"
"in a simple coronal-hole jet, a significant portion is in-"
jected into the closed field beneath the adjacent helmet
streamer. This twist blows out the top of the streamer
when it reaches the streamer apex.
Figure 10(a) shows three representative sets of field
lines prior to the eruption. The positive footpoint of
"the erupting flux rope is shown in magenta, as in Fig-"
ure 6. A bundle of cyan field lines that initially form
"part of the strapping field, traced from positive foot-"
points slightly north of the magenta field lines. Yellow
field lines with footpoints in the southern hemisphere
that form high-reaching arches that pass both near the
top of the helmet streamer and close to the edge of the
pseudostreamer. Figure 10(b) shows the twist gained
"by the high-reaching yellow field lines, which are in the"
process of lifting off from the top of the helmet streamer
(see also the accompanying animation). The figure also
shows that the CME has three footpoint regions. The
"first, labeled FP1, is near the positive footpoint of the"
"erupting flux rope. The second, labeled FP2, is south"
of the pseudostreamer and forms when field lines within
the CME connecting to FP1 are drawn into the flare
current sheet. The resulting interchange-like flare recon-
nection shifts these CME footpoints from FP1 to FP2.
"The final footpoint region is FP3, consisting of the re-"
mote footpoints of the flux blown out from the helmet
streamer.
Figure 10(c) shows the completely blown-out top of
the helmet streamer several hours later. Several hours
"later still, Figure 10(d) shows the reformation of the"
helmet streamer. The helmet streamer reforms as a
new section of heliospheric current sheet forms following
the upward stretching of the blown-out helmet streamer
flux. This is exactly analogous to the process by which
"slow streamer-puff, or stealth, CMEs are thought to"
form except that in this case the magnetic stress was
injected into the helmet streamer flux completely in the
corona rather than at the photosphere (e.g. Lynch et al.
2016).
7. SURFACE CONNECTIVITY AND NULL
EVOLUTION
A great deal of insight into this event can be gained by
"studying the surface connectivity of the magnetic field,"
which essentially maps the complex 3D evolution of the
eruption onto a 2D plane. All the key changes of the
global magnetic evolution are captured thereby. At the
"same time, the connectivity maps are not always in-"
"tuitive to work with and require some interpretation,"
which we now provide.
In Figure 11(a) we show the connectivity prior to
"breakout initiation. As before, the open-field coronal"
"holes are shown in yellow, magnetically closed regions"
"in white, and log(Q) in grey scale. In addition to the"
"connectivity, we also located the null points in the low"
corona (below 3 Rs) using the tri-linear method (Haynes
& Parnell 2007; Wyper & DeVore 2016). The positions
of the nulls identified at each time are projected radially
onto the surface and shown with diamonds.
"As mentioned previously in §2.3, during the early
driving phase NP1 migrates towards the center of the"
"pseudostreamer (see the accompanying animation), evi-"
dently due to the changing shape of the pseudostreamer
separatrix as it expands. NP1 resides near NP2 and is in
"the open field prior to the breakout phase, Figure 11(a)."
This is confirmed by the snub-nosed shape of the nearby
"helmet-streamer boundary, indicating that a very nar-"
row corridor of flux is present between the two coronal
"holes. In fact, NP1 and NP2 (or the localised clusters of"
nulls that sometimes form from them) actually annihi-
"late each other both before and after the eruption, then"
"finally return via bifurcation. Nulls NP3, NP4, and NP5"
are far removed from the filament channel (on the right)
"and are not involved in the eruption, although they also"
interact with each other over time. Four curves of high
Q are highlighted (Q1 to Q4) that are associated with
the fan separatrix footprint of NP1 (Q1 and Q3) and the
"inner and outer fan of NP2 (Q2 and Q4, respectively)."
Figure 11(b) shows the connectivity well into the
"breakout phase. In 2D, the progression of breakout re-"
connection is followed by the motion of the footpoints
of separatrices on either side of the filament channel to-
wards each other as strapping field is removed. Mean-
"while, the footpoints outlining the lobe regions move"
apart as strapping field is added (e.g. Lynch et al. 2008).
The same progression is evident here in 3D: Q1 and Q2
move towards one another as Q2 and Q3 move apart. At
"this time, NP1 has migrated back towards the left flank"
"of the pseudostreamer. This shift of the null, which is"
a natural consequence of the round trip it makes as it
moves from the breakout to flare current sheets and back
"to the center of the pseudostreamer, is the crucial ingre-"
dient that leads to the blowout of the helmet streamer.
"As NP1 moves to the flank, the helmet streamer be-"

comes draped over the pseudostreamer once more and
connects to the middle null (NP2). This manifests in
"the connectivity plot as a return to a tapered, rather"
"than snub-nosed, end to the northern helmet-streamer"
boundary. The twist liberated by the reconnection of
the flux rope is now able to access closed field beneath
the helmet streamer.
Figure 11(c) shows the connectivity as the flux rope
reconnects. The northern footpoint of the flux rope has
now moved outside the pseudostreamer separatrix and
connects to a mixture of open coronal-hole field and
closed helmet-streamer flux that was draped over the
"pseudostreamer. At the moment of flux-rope opening,"
a burst of explosive reconnection is initiated at NP1.
Bright local and remote ribbons would be expected to
"form near the inner and outer spines at Q2 and Q4,"
as well as along the semi-circular ribbon where the fan
"plane meets the surface, highlighted in Figure 11(c)."
The ribbon is semi-circular rather than a closed loop in
this case due to the multiple nulls in the pseudostreamer
topology. Similar ribbon structures have been observed
"by, e.g., Kumar et al. (2021). Immediately after the"
flux rope opens and fast flare reconnection is under-
"way, Q1 and Q2 then outline the positions of the main"
"parallel flare ribbons. Subsequently, Q1 and Q2 move"
apart as NP1 moves back towards the center of the pseu-
"dostreamer and into the open-field region, Figure 11(c)"
and (d).
The above description reveals that the two key in-
gredients that lead to the sympathetic blowout of the
helmet streamer are (1) the proximity of the edge of
the helmet streamer to the edge of the pseudostreamer

and (2) the round-trip evolution of the null point as the
flux rope reconnects. The shift of NP1 into and back
out of the closed field under the helmet streamer seems
"to be a consequence of both reconnection at the null,"
"as described by Edmondson et al. (2009), and a shift"
of the helmet streamer itself driven by interchange re-
"connection along its flank, similar to that shown by e.g."
Higginson et al. (2017).
"Finally, the connectivity map also highlights the three"
"CME footpoints, Figure 11(d). This makes it immedi-"
ately clear that the southern footpoint FP3 forms next
to the original footpoint of the outer spine of NP1. As
was highlighted by the field-line evolution in Figs. 6
"and 10, the northern footpoint of the flux rope discon-"
nects from the CME as it is swept up by the flare re-
"connection, to reside back in the closed field beneath"
the pseudostreamer. As can be seen in the animation
"accompanying Figure 11, FP2 forms when the northern"
flare ribbon (Q1) sweeps over the positive footpoint of
the pre-eruption flux rope. This is the surface signature
"Figure 13. (a)-(c) Base-difference images (from t = 0) of scattered white light. (d) Height-time plot using running difference
images. The dashed line in (a) shows the slit for the height-time plot. An animation of this figure is available online showing

of the interchange-like flare reconnection that occurs
"above, shifting some of the CME field-line footpoints"
from FP1 to FP2. The remaining sheared strapping
field adjacent to the pre-eruption flux rope also opens
"but is not swept over by Q1, thereby forming FP1 at"
"later times (see also Fig. 10, cyan field lines)."
8. CORONAL MASS EJECTION
The CME that results is a mixture of twisted/kinked
open field lines from the coronal holes and closed field
lines blown out from the helmet streamer. They are
combined within two main propagating magnetic struc-
tures that form the CME. The first is the blown-out
"helmet-streamer flux, which has footpoints predomi-"
nantly at FP1 and FP3. Figure 12(a) shows that field
lines traced from FP3 (yellow) and FP1 (cyan) wrap
around one another producing what normally would be
identified as the CME flux rope; we will designate it as
"such from now on. However, the analysis of the pre-"
vious sections has shown that this flux rope is not the
"same flux rope that originally erupted, but rather forms"
later in the evolution. The original flux rope due to the
filament channel was ejected as the pseudostreamer jet;
this later flux rope forms from the coupling with the hel-
met streamer field and erupts as a CME. When viewed
"from the side, this CME flux rope appears circular de-"
spite being composed of a mixture of open and closed
"field lines, Figure 12(b). This circular feature is embed-"

"rectly compare the structure to observations, a synthetic"
white-light base-difference image produced at the same
viewing angle as the simulation cut is shown in Figure
12(c). A bubble-like circular feature is indeed embedded
within the broader body of the CME; see also the movie
accompanying Figure 13.
Kumar et al. (2021) reported a series of observations
"showing that, ahead of the CMEs produced by pseu-"
"dostreamer eruptions, a small jet-like puff first appears,"
associated with the opening of the strapping field by
breakout reconnection shortly before the eruption. In
Figure 13(a)-(c) we show a series of synthetic corona-
"graph images from the same viewpoint, just prior to"
the CME and as it propagates outward. As in the ob-
"servations, a puff formed by the breakout reconnection"
outflow and the opening of the strapping flux precedes
the main CME.
"Aside from the shock, the CME has a relatively nar-"
"row angular extent of about 40◦. Additionally, the CME"
is deflected towards the heliospheric current sheet as it
"propagates outward, as shown by the curved shape of"
the CME in Figure 13(b). Such a deflection is to be
"expected, given that the jet straddles the open-closed"
"helmet-streamer boundary and, therefore, is guided to-"
wards its apex. We note that this deflection is not the re-
sult of magnetic pressure gradients acting on the erupt-
"ing structure in the low corona, as has been proposed"
to account for CME deflections in some observed events
(e.g. Shen et al. 2011; Kay et al. 2013). In that sce-
nario the erupting magnetic structure is presumed to be
a flux rope connected at both ends to the photosphere
with an axis at its apex that is roughly perpendicular
to the ambient field it encounters. Here the erupting
structure propagates along field lines in the low corona.
The circular feature in the synthetic white-light images
appears only after the disturbance reaches the helmet
streamer apex; when the CME flux rope forms and the
helmet streamer blows out. Prior to this the evolution
is more jet-like. Based on the location of the circular
feature in Figure 13(c) compared with the initial radial
"trajectory of the jet, we estimate an apparent deflection"
of around 30◦.
Figure 13(d) shows a time/distance plot (J-map) cre-
ated from running different images evaluated along the
line shown in Figure 13(a). We chose this non-radial
line to capture both the puff and nose of the CME once
it is deflected. The pre-eruption puff is simply advected
by the ambient wind and follows a slowly accelerating
"profile. The CME, once launched, quickly overtakes the"
puff before stabilizing at a roughly constant speed of
about 600 km s−1. Similar CME speeds and accelera-
tion profiles have been measured for CMEs from pseu-
dostreamers (e.g. Wang & Hess 2018).
9. S-WEB CONNECTIVITY & IMPULSIVE SEPS
The mixture of open and closed flux within the CME
provides a natural avenue of escape for impulsive SEPs
produced by the flare. Although a full investigation of
the expected SEP signatures of this simulation is well
"beyond the scope of this investigation, we can still make"
some preliminary remarks based on the connectivity of
the CME. There are two potential scenarios where we
might expect SEPs to be impulsively accelerated and re-
leased in this eruption. The first is the scenario explored
"by Masson et al. (2013, 2019), whereby flare reconnec-"
tion prior to reconnection of the filament channel flux
rope stores high energy particles within the flux rope.
These are then promptly released when the flux rope
"is opened by reconnection with external field, in this"
case when the flux rope reaches the breakout current
layer. The second is that once the flux rope opens the
flare reconnection transitions to interchange-like recon-
"nection at NP1, directly accessing open field lines along"
which SEPs could escape in a manner similar to a jet.
These two scenarios overlap at the moment the flux rope
"opens, but the latter would continue beyond the initial"
flux rope reconnection making them potentially distin-
guishable observationally.
Figure 14 shows log(Q) at 30Rs at various stages
throughout the eruption. The times are matched to
those in Figure 11 for comparison. Regions of discon-
nected flux within the heliospheric current layer are
"shown in yellow. Broadly speaking, the open field af-"
fected by the eruption is localised around the left half
"of the S-Web arc, the section which resided above the"
filament channel. This is a useful result in itself and
provides a predictive tool for where impulsively accel-
erated particles and subsequently the CME itself could
be measured in-situ for CMEs originating from pseu-
dostreamers.
"More specifically, throughout the breakout phase the"
affected section of S-Web arc moves steadily southward
"as strapping field is opened, Figure 14(b). The opening"
of the flux rope is shown in Figure 14(c) by the complex
"region of high Q, which stretches almost to the middle"
of the arc. Both SEP scenarios would be expected to
launch SEPs into this region. This shows that impulsive
SEPs could potentially reach far from the heliospheric
"current sheet, in this case reaching around 30◦ from it in"
"latitude and covering a range of around 70◦ in longitude,"
due to the rapidly varying connectivity along the arc.
Future work using for example test particles would be
required to test this claim definitively.
"Finally, for completeness Figure 14(d) shows the con-"
nectivity once the helmet streamer has blown out and
the CME is fully developed. The circular region corre-
sponds to the open field lines that wrap into the CME
"flux rope (cyan field lines, Fig. 12). This is bordered on"
one side by disconnected field (yellow) within the helio-
"spheric current sheet, and a semi-circular sheath of open"
field corresponding to the rest of the kinked field lines
"within the CME (red field lines, Fig. 12)."
10. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
"In addition to observations of SEPs, our results"
presented here on coupled pseudostreamer/helmet-
streamer eruptions have clear implications for under-
"standing solar eruptions. First, we emphasize that the"
assumed magnetic configuration of a pseudostreamer
"close to the helmet streamer, Figure 3, is quite com-"
mon on the Sun. The coronal hole pattern of Figure
2 in which a small coronal hole extension is separated
from the main coronal hole by a large parasitic polar-
ity region can be seen frequently in source surface maps
and is reflected in S-Web maps (e.g. Antiochos et al.
2011; Wang et al. 2012; Crooker et al. 2012; Titov et al.
"2012). Furthermore, filament channels are very often"
"observed to form over the PIL of the parasitic region,"
"leading to a jet-like eruption (e.g. Filippov et al. 2013,"
2015; Yang et al. 2015; Wang & Hess 2018; Kumar et al.
"2021), so the scenario described in this paper should"
be readily observed. We note that our scenario shares
some general features with streamer blowouts driven by
"eruptions beneath the streamer, but near its edge (e.g."
Moore & Sterling 2007; Lugaz et al. 2011; Panesar et al.
2016). The key difference is that in our scenario the
pseudostreamer has a substantial presence outside the
"streamer, within the coronal hole."
Another key point is that our jet eruption is some-
what special from a theoretical viewpoint in that it oc-
curs in a 3D system with multiple nulls and separator
lines. There have been many simulations of jets and
"CMEs in the ubiquitous topology of a single null, but"
"to our knowledge, this is the first simulation of a fila-"
ment channel driven eruption in a multi-null/separator
topology. This topology allows for more copious recon-
"nection, because the breakout current sheet now corre-"
sponds to a deformed line segment rather than a de-
"formed point. As argued in Antiochos et al. (1999),"
the breakout mechanism requires reconnection to oper-
"ate, but the reconnection must not be too “easy” if the"
system is to be explosive. Our simulation verifies that
breakout can produce explosive eruption even in a gen-
eral pseudostreamer topology.
"The eruption from the actual pseudostreamer, how-"
"ever, is clearly a jet rather than a CME. We do not see"
closed pseudostreamer flux expanding outward into the
heliosphere. This results holds even though the pseu-
"dostreamer of Figure 2 is quite large and, as discussed"
"above, the breakout reconnection is extended, more eas-"
"ily allowing a flux rope to escape. Instead, the pseu-"
dostreamer flux rope is completely destroyed by inter-
change reconnection either with the open field or the
"helmet streamer field. We conjecture that this, in fact,"
is the general result for an eruption from a unipolar
background as in a pseudostreamer or jet. The reasons
"for this are that first, a plasmoid in a unipolar back-"
ground must have its twist component anti-parallel to
"the background field on one side or the other, so that"
"reconnection is inevitable. Second, the amount of flux"
in the pseudostreamer rope is limited by the flux of the
"parasitic polarity, which is generally small compared to"
"the background. However, if the flux rope can survive"
"out to the Alfvén radius ∼ 10Rs, then any interchange
beyond this point has no effect on the amount of escap-"
"ing flux, because a closed field line will still not retract"
back down to the corona. Depending on the balance
"between gas dynamic pressure and magnetic tension,"
"this result may hold even at somewhat lower radii, say"
5Rs or so. These arguments imply that in order for a
pseudostreamer eruption to produce a CME when the
"pseudostreamer is deep within a coronal hole, the para-"
sitic polarity must have an exceptionally large amount
of flux and the eruption must develop a high speed early
"on, which requires that the filament channel be highly"
sheared. Further simulations are required in order to
quantify the fluxes and speeds required for an isolated
"pseudostreamer CME, if even possible, and observations"
of pseudostreamer eruptions far from helmet streamers
are needed to test the conclusions.
The situation is very different for a helmet-streamer
eruption. In this case the background field is bidirec-
tional and parallel to the plasmoid on both sides. As
"a result, interchange reconnection does not occur and a"
plasmoid is free to propagate outward so that even small
plasmoids can survive indefinitely in the heliospheric
current sheet (Higginson & Lynch 2018). Evidence for
this behavior can be gleaned from our simulation in Fig-
"ures 10 and 12 and their associated animations, in which"
"twisted, closed helmet-streamer field lines are swept up"
in the CME and expand outwards within or adjacent
to the field reversal that defines the heliospheric current
sheet. A key conclusion from these figures and anima-
tions is that not only does the field of the CME consist of
"a mixture of closed and open flux, but the plasma as well"
consists of a mixture of material that was in the large
outer loops of the helmet streamer and the small inner
loops of the parasitic polarity. This result has important
consequences for in-situ measurements of plasma com-
position. Even in the outer layers of a streamer-blowout
"event, the plasma may have originated from the small"
"closed loops of a decayed active region, with a differ-"
ent FIP bias and freeze-in temperature from the helmet
"streamer. Again, this result requires definitive testing"
against data.
This work also has important implications for under-
standing S-web dynamics. The bulk of the S-Web con-
sists of high-Q arcs that start and end on the helio-
"spheric current sheet, as in Figure 14. All these arcs"
are due to large parasitic polarity regions that produce
narrow or singular connections between coronal holes
(Antiochos et al. 2011; Titov et al. 2012; Scott et al.
"2018, 2019). These polarity regions have PILs, which"
"will invariably become sheared with time; consequently,"
the type of eruption that we calculated above is bound
to be a frequent driver of the S-Web. Our results show
"that the S-web is intrinsically coupled, in that strong"
dynamics at one location are likely to lead to dynam-
ics elsewhere with the subsequent mixing of plasma and
field lines. This conclusion may help explain the long-
standing puzzle of flare SEPs with large longitudinal
extent (e.g. Dresing et al. 2012; Richardson et al. 2014)
although further work is required to confirm this.
Perhaps the most important and far-reaching conclu-
sions from this new type of coupled eruption are for un-
derstanding the interplay between solar eruptions and
the global coronal magnetic field. Taken alongside pre-
"vious work, our results suggest that CMEs originating"
"nearby the helmet streamer separatrix, be it beneath"
"the helmet streamer or adjacent to it in a coronal hole,"
"should be expected to be deflected, have a more com-"
plex morphology and to involve a mixture of open and
closed magnetic field lines. Whereas eruptions from deep
within the closed field will form classic CMEs and if our
conjecture is correct those from pseudostreamers deep
within coronal holes will form jets. Accurate global field
"modeling, supported by further simulation studies of the"
"coupling between eruptions and the global coronal field,"
is clearly then crucial to predicting and interpreting the
in-situ and remote-sensing observations being made by
current and future solar missions.
