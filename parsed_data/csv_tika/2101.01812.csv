ABSTRACT
"Context. Class II methanol masers are signposts of massive young stellar objects (MYSOs). Recent evidence shows that flares of these masers
are driven by MYSO accretion bursts. Thus, maser monitoring can be used to identify such bursts which are hard to discover otherwise. Infrared
observations reveal burst-induced changes in the spectral energy distribution - first and foremost a luminosity increase - which provide valuable
information on a very intense phase of high-mass star formation.
Aims. In mid-January 2019, flaring of the 6.7 GHz CH3OH maser (hereafter maser) of the MYSO G358.93-0.03 (hereafter G358) was reported.
The international maser community (M2O) initiated an extensive observational campaign which revealed extraordinary maser activity and yielded
the detection of numerous new masering transitions. Interferometric imaging with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
and the Submillimeter Array (SMA) resolved the maser emitting core of the star forming region and proved the association of the masers with
the brightest continuum source (MM1), which hosts a hot molecular core. These observations, however, failed to detect a significant rise in the
(sub)millimeter dust continuum emission. Therefore, we performed near-infrared (NIR) and far-infrared (FIR) observations to prove or disprove
whether the CH3OH flare was driven by an accretion burst.
Methods. NIR imaging with the Gamma-Ray Burst Optical/Near-infrared Detector (GROND) has been acquired and integral-field spectroscopy
with the Field-Imaging Far-Infrared Line Spectrometer (FIFI-LS) aboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) was
carried out on two occasions to detect possible counterparts to the (sub)millimeter sources and compare their photometry to archival measurements.
The comparison of pre-burst and burst spectral energy distributions is of crucial importance to judge whether a substantial luminosity increase,
caused by an accretion burst, is present and if it triggered the maser flare. Radiative transfer modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
the dust continuum emission at multiple epochs provides valuable information on the bursting MYSO.
Results. The FIR fluxes of MM1 measured with FIFI-LS exceed those from Herschel significantly, which clearly confirms the presence of an
accretion burst. The second epoch data, taken about 16 months later, still show increased fluxes. Our radiative transfer modeling yielded major
burst parameters and suggests that the MYSO features a circumstellar disk which might be transient. From the pre-burst, burst, and post-burst
SEDs, conclusions on heating and cooling time-scales could be drawn. Circumstances of the burst-induced maser relocation have been explored.
Conclusions. The verification of the accretion burst from G358 is another confirmation that Class II methanol maser flares represent an alert for
such events. Thus, monitoring of these masers greatly enhances the chances of identifying MYSOs during periods of intense growth. The few
events known to date already indicate that there is a broad range in burst strength and duration as well as environmental characteristics. The G358
event is the shortest and least luminous accretion burst known to date. According to models, bursts of this kind occur most often."

1. Introduction
"The collapse of dense molecular cloud cores gives rise to the
birth of stars, a process which was thought to proceed in a
smooth and continuous fashion. However, the first piece of evi-
dence for the unsteady growth of forming stars emerged by rec-
ognizing that the outburst of FU Orionis, which was thought
to be a rare phase of early stellar evolution (Herbig 1966),
was instead an episode of enhanced disk accretion Hartmann &
Kenyon 1985. Since then, it has been realized that episodic ac-
cretion is an intrinsic feature of forming young stars (Hartmann
& Kenyon 1996; Audard et al. 2014). While this knowledge"

tion for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere under
ESO program 0103.C-9033(A). Based on observations made with

"had been established exclusively from observations of low-mass
stars, which become optically visible while still accreting, it
was unknown until recently whether high-mass stars (M?&8 M�)
show the same behavior during their formation. Their scarcity
and fast formation timescales imply that they are still deeply em-
bedded in their parental core while reaching the main sequence.
This suggests that similar outbursts during high-mass star for-
mation, if present at all, might be difficult to detect."
"A candidate young massive eruptive variable, V723 Car, was
identified by Tapia et al. (2015). The object brightened in the
K band by 3.7 mag between 1993 and 2003. Since the outburst
was found a posteriori, no information on the possible accre-
tion luminosity is available. The post-burst luminosities range
from 2.5× 103 L� (Povich et al. 2011) to ∼ 4× 103 L� (Tapia
et al. 2015) which correspond to a mass of 8 – 9 M� (Tout et al.
1996) for a zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) object. In the con-
text of the forthcoming discussion, it has to be emphasized that"

"this source is not associated with masers. So, while the V723
Car event might be considered to be an accretion burst from a
massive young stellar object (MYSO), the lack of observational
coverage before and at the time of its incidence precludes major
conclusions with regard to high-mass star formation."
"Recently the situation concerning MYSO accretion bursts
abruptly changed following the discoveries of the almost co-
incident events from the MYSOs S255IR-NIRS3 (Stecklum
et al. 2016; Caratti o Garatti et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2018)
and NGC6334I-MM1 (Hunter et al. 2017, 2018). The lumi-
nosity increase, seen at infrared (IR) and (sub)mm wavelengths
for S255IR-NIRS3 and in the (sub)mm regime for NGC6334I-
MM1, provided direct evidence for enhanced accretion rates.
Most notably, these outbursts were accompanied by flares of
Class II methanol masers (hereafter methanol masers; Fujisawa
et al. 2015; Szymczak et al. 2018b; MacLeod et al. 2018).
This confirmed a radiative pumping mechanism of this kind of
methanol masers (Menten 1991a; Sobolev et al. 1997; Cragg
et al. 2005), which is consistent with variability studies of the
maser emission (Szymczak et al. 2018a; Durjasz et al. 2019).
Since methanol masers trace the very early stages of massive star
formation (for example Breen et al. 2013), maser flares might be
taken as a proxy for accretion variability of the protostellar host.
Keeping this in mind, the international maser community estab-
lished the Maser Monitoring Organization (M2O)1 to coordinate
single-dish monitoring of masers and interferometric follow-up
measurements."
"G358.93-0.03 (hereafter G358, RA: 17h43m10.s02,
DEC: −29◦51′′45′′.8, J2000) is a hitherto little explored
massive star forming site as evident from just eight SIMBAD
(Wenger et al. 2000) entries until 2018. The kinematic distance
amounts to 6.75 +−"
"0.37
0.68 kpc (Brogan et al. 2019) which implies"
"a galactocentric one of 1.6 kpc. It is consistent with Gaia
distances of visible stars in the G358 region of . 5 kpc which
impose a lower limit to the distance of the molecular cloud
hosting G358 (Burns et al. 2020). In mid-January 2019, flaring
of the 6.7 GHz CH3OH maser line (Menten 1991b) in G358 was
announced (Sugiyama et al. 2019). Thus, for the first time, M2O
orchestrated an extensive observing campaign which became
extremely successful."
"Thanks to the immediate response, an unprecedented wealth
of masering lines, including numerous new transitions, could
be observed (Breen et al. 2019; Brogan et al. 2019; MacLeod
et al. 2019) and new maser species were discovered (Chen et al.
2020a,b). Interferometric imaging in the (sub)millimeter spectral
range using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA) dissected the star
forming region and pinpointed the MYSO which hosts the flar-
ing masers (Brogan et al. 2019). In all likelihood, the brightest
continuum source MM1, which turned out to be a hot molecular
core, experienced an accretion burst. For the first time, a spectac-
ular confirmation of the event was achieved by high-resolution,
multi-epoch observations of the 6.7-GHz methanol maser emis-
sion which revealed outward maser spot propagation, tracing the
spread of the thermal radiation emanating from the burst (Burns
et al. 2020). However, without evidence for a significant rise in
(sub)millimeter dust continuum emission from MM1 (Brogan
et al. 2019), the energetics of the burst remained an open issue.
Therefore, we aimed for observations to identify the IR counter-
part of MM1 and to verify its luminosity increase, thus indepen-
dently confirming the third MYSO accretion burst witnessed so
far."
1 See M2O website at http://MaserMonitoring.org
"At present, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared As-
tronomy (SOFIA, Erickson & Davidson 1993; Young et al.
2012) is the only facility which offers the capability to trace the
far-infrared (FIR) flux increase caused by such an event. Conse-
quently, an attempt was made for observing G358 with SOFIA
which turned out to be successful. The observational results in
context with supplementary data, the analysis and interpretation
are the subjects of the present paper and will be outlined in the
following."
"The paper is organized as follows. At the beginning the ob-
servational foundation will be explained. The next part deals
with deriving constraints on the spectral energy distribution
(SED) of the bursting source. The estimation of the luminosity
increase, the central quantity for assessing the accretion burst, is
performed in two steps. First, a simplified treatment using gray-
body functions is applied. Then, a more thorough analysis is per-
formed, utilizing dust continuum radiative transfer. The discus-
sion section concludes the paper in which results of the present
investigation are put in context with regard to previous observa-
tional and theoretical findings."
"We note that the term “luminosity”, if not declared other-
wise, refers to the bolometric luminosity throughout the paper.
Similarly, the term or value “error” always implies the 1σ er-
ror or standard deviation unless noted otherwise. Magnitudes are
based on the Vega system."
2. Observations
2.1. Archival data
"Archival data is essential for establishing the presence of an ac-
cretion burst since it constrains the source luminosity during the
pre-burst state. Because G358 is located in the Galactic cen-
ter region it has been covered by a wealth of surveys. For the
present study, fluxes in the near-IR (NIR), mid-IR (MIR), and
far-IR (FIR) as well as positions and images have been retrieved
from the surveys listed in Tab.1"
"The comparison of the HI-GAL photometry (Molinari et al.
2016) with that performed by the ATLASGAL team (Contr-
eras et al. 2013) revealed inconsistencies at longer wavelengths
and with regard to the error estimates. Therefore, we per-
formed photometry on our own on the corresponding PACS and
SPIRE images (epoch 2010 September 07), retrieved from the
NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA)2, using the MP-
Fit2DPeak function from the IDL Astronomy library (Landsman
1995). The point spread function was chosen to be a 2D Gaus-
sian which yielded the best fit over other representations (Moffat,
Lorentzian profiles). The background was estimated on a fixed
annulus for all wavelengths to ensure consistency of sky esti-
mates."
"The target is not included in the AKARI Bright Source Cata-
log (Yamamura et al. 2010) but can be identified in Far-Infrared
Surveyor images (FIS, Doi et al. 2015) taken with the N60
(λcentral = 65 µm) and WIDE-S (λcentral = 90 µm) filters (epoch
2007 January). Correspondingly, photometry was performed on
those frames in the same way as described above. Since the
WIDE-S image suffers from severe striping, the resulting flux
has a substantial uncertainty and will therefore be neglected."

2.2. Near-infrared imaging
"Optical and near-infrared (NIR) imaging of G358 was performed
using the seven-channel Gamma-Ray Burst Optical/Near-
infrared Detector GROND (Greiner et al. 2008), using director’s
discretionary time (DDT) at the MPG/ESO 2.2-m telescope at
La Silla (Chile) on 2019 February 8. GROND obtains images
in seven bands (optical: Sloan g’ r’ i’ z’, NIR: JHKs) simultane-
ously. The total integration time amounts to 38 minutes. Data
processing was performed by means of the GROND pipeline
(Krühler et al. 2008)."
2.3. Far-infrared integral-field spectroscopy
"The Field-Imaging Far-Infrared Line Spectrometer (FIFI-LS,
Looney et al. 2000; Fischer et al. 2018; Colditz et al. 2018) is a
far-infrared integral field spectrograph aboard SOFIA. FIFI-LS
features a blue and red channel in parallel. Each channel has a
field of view (FOV) consisting of five by five spatial pixels with
a plate scale of 6′′/pixel in the blue channel and 12′′/pixel in the
red channel. They provide an overall wavelength coverage from
51 µm to 203 µm. This matches very well the range of the SED,
where MYSOs emit the bulk of their energy by dust continuum
radiation, and where the relative flux increase due to an accre-
tion burst is highest (MacFarlane et al. 2019). Thus, instruments
like FIFI-LS provide the best prospects to detect the luminosity
increase due to accretion bursts."
"A DDT proposal to perform spectro-photometry of the FIR
dust emission of G358 using FIFI-LS was submitted in mid-
February 2019. One hour of observing time was awarded by the
Director of SOFIA Science Mission Operations. The measure-
ments were performed on 2019 May 1, when the maser flare
was still strong but already decaying (MacLeod et al., in prep.;
Yonekura et al., in prep.). Several spectral bands (see Table 2)
were chosen to sample the full spectral range of FIFI-LS and,
at the same time, cover high rotational transitions of the CO
molecule. The spectral scan length per sub-band ranged from
0.3 to 1.0 µm. A regular follow-up proposal for SOFIA Cycle 8
was submitted and accepted as well. Due to the flight suspen-
sion induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, the observations were
delayed and eventually performed on 2020 August 28. The same
settings and amount of observing time as for the first epoch mea-
surements were used. However, because of a technical issue, no
data could be obtained in the blue channel. Yet, drawing conclu-
sions on the flux evolution from the two epochs became possible."
3. Data analysis and results
"As evidenced by the ALMA/SMA observations, G358 is a star
forming complex harboring several massive protostars (Brogan
et al. 2019). Because of its considerable distance and the large
beam sizes of observing facilities at MIR and FIR wavelengths,
the photometry obtained by the latter represents the total flux.
The following considerations aim at identifying and character-
izing the IR counterpart of MM1. This includes an approach to
account for flux contributions of all other components. Eventu-
ally, conclusions on the nature of MM1 will be drawn based on
radiative transfer (RT) modeling of its pre-burst and burst SEDs."
3.1. NIR imaging and source identification
"As shown in Fig. 1, a NIR source is situated close to the po-
sition of G358. It is listed as 2MASS J17431001−2951460 in
the 2MASS All-Sky Catalog of Point Sources (Cutri et al. 2003)
but was detected only in the Ks band at 11.5± 0.07 mag. The
deeper VISTA Variables in Via Lactea Survey (VVV), Min-
niti et al. 2017) which imaged the Galactic bulge and the ad-
jacent southern plane from 2010 to 2016 yielded an H-band
detection as well. The VVV Ks and H catalog magnitudes
of 11.87± 0.01 and 15.54± 0.06 mag imply a color index of
H − Ks = 3.67± 0.06 mag which indicates a very red object. In
the VVV catalog, the object is flagged as variable as it has shown
rapid brightness changes within a 3σ range of 0.4 mag, and a
peak-to-peak variation of 0.79 mag, during five years of VVV
Ks-band monitoring. Its mean brightness during the VVV moni-
toring amounts to Ks = 12.23 mag."
"Our GROND imaging detected it in the J,H and Ks bands,
but not at shorter wavelengths. The GROND Ks magnitude of
11.9± 0.02 indicates a brightness, increased by 0.34 mag with
respect to the VVV mean, which is consistent with the source
variability. Its position, within 0′′.2, is consistent with the sec-
ondary hot molecular core and dust continuum source MM3 de-
tected by ALMA, which is located 1′′.09 to the southwest of the
main hot molecular core MM1 (cf. Brogan et al. 2019). There-
fore, the NIR source represents the IR counterpart of MM3 and
is, thus, unrelated to the outburst."
"The VVV and GROND NIR color composite images are
shown for comparison in Fig. 1. The Ks image of the difference
GROND−VVV, obtained after flux scaling and convolving to
the same spatial resolution, does not provide evidence for the
presence of a light echo from an accretion outburst, unlike for
the case of S255IR-NIRS3 (Caratti o Garatti et al. 2017). This
may be another sign for the high extinction toward the bursting
source."

3.2. WISE/(NEO)WISE photometry
"Due to its orbit, the WISE IR space telescope (Wright et al.
2010) visits a region in the sky twice a year. For G358 the 2019
visits occurred on March 17 and August 27. The first one al-
most coincided with the peak of the maser flare (MacLeod et al.,
in prep.; Yonekura et al., in prep.) which maximized chances
for a possible MIR detection. Photometry for G358 from the
WISE and subsequent (NEO)WISE (Mainzer et al. 2014) mis-
sions were retrieved from IRSA, covering observations until end
of 2019. A saturation correction has been applied3 to account
for a photometric bias due to warm-up of the detector which
amounts to +0.02 (W1) and +0.33 (W2) magnitudes, respec-
tively."
"The (NEO)WISE W1 (3.4 µm) and W2 (4.6 µm) light curves
are shown in Fig. 2. Because of its brightness in both filters
bands, G358 led to small (W1) or mild (W2) detector satura-
tion. In this case, the derivation of the brightness from the wings
of the point spread function (c.f. section IV.4.c.iii of the WISE
All-Sky Explanatory Supplement, Cutri et al. 2012) leads to en-
hanced scatter. Nevertheless, the discovery of an obvious bright-
ening which usually accompanies enhanced accretion should
have been possible. However, there is no clear-cut evidence in
both light curves for a flux increase at the burst epoch or later on.
From the scatter of the photometric values, a possible increase
due to the burst can be constrained. Assuming a 2σ detection
limit for W1 and W2 of ∼ 0.5 mag, that is a joint 2.8σ limit, up-
per bounds for a possible flux contribution caused by the burst
can be derived as 0.10 Jy and 0.45 Jy, respectively. The failure
of the burst detection suggests that, at any time, MM3 provided"

neowise/expsup/sec2_1civa.html"
"by far most, if not all, emission seen in the (NEO)WISE bands.
Further details on the (NEO)WISE astrometry are outlined in
Sect. 3.3.2."
3.3. Infrared photo-astrometry
"In case of imaging an unresolved crowded region a shift of the
emission centroid may be caused by differing object SEDs which
would introduce a wavelength dependence and/or by variability
leading to a temporal displacement. By placing upper limits on a
possible centroid shift, constraints on the contribution of a single
source with known position, MM1 in the present case, to the
overall emission can be established. In the following this will be
done using the present infrared data."
3.3.1. VVV and GROND
"An upper limit to the MM1 pre-burst 2.18 µm flux can be derived
from the stacked VVV Ks image. It is based on 131 exposures
of 4 s each, that is a total integration time of 8.7 min. Confusion
noise due to the high surface density of objects in the Galactic
center neighborhood limits the detection of a possible faint NIR
counterpart of MM1. It has to be brighter than Ks ∼ 15.5 mag to
be recognized next to 2MASS J17431001−2951460. This corre-
sponds to a flux density of 0.42 mJy (Cohen et al. 2003). Sim-
ilarly, the burst Ks magnitude can be constrained by the corre-
sponding GROND image. Given the aperture sizes of the 2.2-m
and VISTA telescopes as well as the total integration times, the
GROND image should almost reach the sensitivity of the stacked
VVV frame. However, inferior seeing and slightly elliptical im-
ages reduce its depth by about half a magnitude, resulting in a
burst 2.15 µm upper limit of 0.66 mJy."
3.3.2. (NEO)WISE
"For the following analysis, (NEO)WISE positions were re-
trieved within 5′′ of the MM1 location from IRSA, based on
frames with the photometric quality flag A in both bands, a
signal-to-noise ratio ≥ 20 and a frame quality rating of 10. The
measurement quality and source reliability information flags
of all frames, however, indicate contamination by the nearby
2MASS J17430939−2951517 which is situated 9′′.9 southwest
of the MM3 and brighter in both (NEO)WISE bands. This re-
sults from the image full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
6′′.1 in the W1 band4."
"The offsets of the individual positions of the IR source with
regard to MM1 are shown in Fig. 3 where the data was divided
into three groups. The pre-burst one includes all positions un-
til the last visit before the burst (2018 August, blue), the burst
group comprises those of the 2019 March visit (red) and the
post-burst group represents the 2019 August visit (green). The
quantitative analysis confirms the visual impression for the mean
positions that both, burst and post-burst, are consistent with the
pre-burst location, situated close to MM3. So most of the emis-
sion seen by (NEO)WISE arises from the MM3 NIR counterpart
2MASS J17431001−2951460, with some contamination from
the nearby IR source to the southwest which causes the elon-
gated distribution of positions. While the mean (NEO)WISE
post-burst position (green) is in between MM1 and MM3, its
large position error precludes drawing any conclusions from this
fact on whether or not this is a late sign of the burst. These"

3.3.3. Spitzer MIPS
"As indicated by Fig. 1 (top) the positions of the IR counterparts
at wavelengths up to 24 µm are almost coincident with ALMA
source MM3. Supposing about equal flux densities of MM1 and
MM3 at this wavelength, the centroid of the MIPSGAL image of
G358 should be located halfway between both sources. This is
clearly not the case. Thus we conclude that the pre-burst MIPS"
"24 µm flux of MM1 was considerably smaller than the joint flux
of MM1 and MM3 (4.58± 0.02 Jy, Hinz et al. 2009). An up-
per flux limit for MM1 can be derived by assuming that it leads
to a detectable centroid shift of three times the positional error
of 0′′.02 (Hinz et al. 2009). Since such a shift has not been de-
tected, the contribution of MM1 to the total flux must be less than
0.42 Jy. The upper limit is valuable to constrain the pre-burst lu-
minosity."

the SOFIA Data Cycle System. The observations yielded a clear
detection of continuum emission from the target in all bands.
G358 is the only object in the FOV. In several bands CO line
emission has been detected as well which will be discussed else-
where."
"The continuum fluxes were derived from an image consisting
of the pixel-wise median of a spectral data cube along the wave-
length dimension, thus free from emission-line flux. For both
epochs, central wavelengths and derived flux densities together
with an error measure are given in Table 2. We note that our
observations revealed the need for an empirical correction of the
118.9 µm flux. It was derived from SED fits of other MYSOs of
our FIFI-LS data set which show a similar flux deficit as well in
this band. This was also confirmed by looking at data from the
flux calibrators Mars and Uranus."
"The measurement errors derived from the error images pro-
vided by the FIFI_LS_REDUX pipeline do not include the cal-
ibration uncertainty. Therefore, we adopted a conservative ap-
proach by using an uncertainty of 10%, cf. Fadda et al. (2019).
Since a narrow dust emission feature at 69 µm (Sturm et al. 2013)
- not covered by our FIFI-LS bands - is the only one in this wave-
length region, a low-order polynomial fit seems to be represen-
tative for the actual SED at the time of the observing epoch. The
residuals from these fits listed in Table 2 correspond to a mean
relative error which indeed equals the above uncertainty."
"With the SOFIA flux densities at hand, the change of the
SED due to the burst and its temporal evolution can be evaluated
from Fig. 4 which shows, among others, the pre-burst SED (blue
symbols), based on MIPS, AKARI, and Herschel data as well as
the emission-line corrected ATLASGAL 870 µm flux from Bro-
gan et al. (2019). The SED based on our first-epoch FIFI-LS"

"observations (epoch 2019 May 1) and the ALMA 870 µm inte-
grated G358 flux from Brogan et al. (2019) (epoch 2019 April
12) is shown in red. The burst SED features flux densities larger
than a factor of & 2 when compared to the pre-burst ones and a
possible change of the SED shape. Thus, a luminosity increase
- the prime signature of an accretion burst - has been witnessed
with SOFIA. It represents the second confirmation of such an
event after the S255IR-NIRS3 burst (Caratti o Garatti et al. 2017)
using this unique facility. Given the non-detection in the NIR and
MIR as well as the non-significant flux increase in the (sub)mm
(Brogan et al. 2019) this promotes the G358 event to be the first
NIR-, MIR- and (sub)mm-dark but FIR-loud MYSO accretion
burst."
"While the second epoch SOFIA observations suffer from the
lack of the blue FIFI-LS bands, which sampled the flux density
at wavelengths short-ward of the SED peak, the red channel data
(green symbols in Fig. 4) nevertheless unambiguously indicate
elevated flux levels during the post-burst stage compared to pre-
burst and depressed compared to the bursting stages."
3.5. FIFI-LS image analysis
"The angular distance of 1′′.09 between MM3 and MM1 at a
position angle (PA) of 247◦ warrants to investigate whether
both sources could be marginally resolved at the shortest FIFI-
LS wavelengths, provided they have similar flux contributions.
The diffraction limit for the 2.5-m mirror of SOFIA at 52.2 µm
amounts to 5′′.3. However, due to various reasons (Graf et al.
2017), the FWHM of the actual point spread function (PSF) ex-
ceeds that value."
"In order to address this point, we cannot rely on the abso-
lute pointing accuracy of SOFIA but have to analyze the image
morphology. So the median continuum images of the blue chan-
nel were fit by a bivariate (2D) Gaussian. If MM3 contributes a
substantial flux contribution to the image, the major axis of the
fit should clearly exceed the smaller one and be aligned to that
direction. The corresponding quantities, axis ratio, position an-
gle and respective errors, are given in Table 3. When judging
these results, it has to be kept in mind that the FIR observations
were performed in chop-nod mode. Thus, deviations from a per-
fect image superposition may lead to an elongated image as well.
The position angle (PA) of the major axis for the 52.2 µm band
is closer to that of MM3 compared to the other ones. However,
the PAs of all bands are more aligned with the chopping angle of
293◦. Given this fact, it remains open whether the result for the"

3.6. PACS image analysis
"We checked the Herschel-PACS images at 70 µm for potential
signs of source multiplicity or source elongation. Unfortunately,
the only existing data toward this region (from Hi-GAL, see
Molinari et al. 2010) was obtained in the so-called fast-scan
parallel-mode which comes with a quite peculiar PSF that is
elongated along the two almost orthogonal scan directions. Its
equivalent FWHM is typically 8′′.8× 9′′.6 and is thus larger than
the SOFIA PSF at the same wavelength. This impedes a study
of small elongations due to source multiplicity. We nevertheless
attempted a PSF photometry using the Starfinder IDL tool (Di-
olaiti et al. 2000), Version 1.8.2a, by using the adequate PACS
PSFs (version 2.2) for the fast-scan parallel mode, provided by
the instrument team5. The algorithm can in principle find mul-
tiple sources blended within one FWHM. While we varied sev-
eral parameters for background subtraction and treatment of sub-
pixel offsets, the program consistently identified just one strong
source, showing a very good correlation coefficient of 0.977 with
regard to the input PSF. This source is formally 1′′.1 away from
the ALMA position of component MM1, and 0′′.7 away from
ALMA component MM3. The absolute astrometry of the Her-
schel Spacecraft at the end of the mission came with a 3σ uncer-
tainty of 2′′.7 (cf. Sánchez-Portal et al. 2014). Therefore, based
on the Herschel astrometry alone, it is not possible to decide
whether the revealed Herschel compact source is coincident with
the location of MM1 or MM3, or somewhere in between. Based
on the SED modeling, we think that the Herschel 70 µm emis-
sion is dominated by MM1. Given our PSF fitting experiments
we conclude that a potential minor contribution at 70 µm from
MM3 must be more than 70 times weaker than the one from
MM1."
4. Graybody fits and burst parameters
4.1. Graybody fits to SEDs based on FIR and (sub)mm data
"Since the observed SEDs of G358 based on FIR and (sub)mm
data do not strongly differ from a Planck function, the most sim-
ple approach to approximate them is using a modified blackbody,
in other words a graybody (for instance Elia & Pezzuto 2016). It
comprises three parameters: dust temperature, emissivity index,
and solid angle of the emission. Before performing the fits the
fluxes were dereddened to account for interstellar extinction. A
value of AV = 60 mag was assumed which seems to be justified
(see Sec. 5.2.2). For flux dereddening, the RV = 5.5 dust model
of Draine (2003) has been used. The fits, reddened to match the
observations, are shown as solid lines in Fig. 4."

the corresponding (sub)mm fluxes from Brogan et al. (2019). The upper
24 µm MIPS limit is indicated as well. The solid lines represent the red-
dened graybody fits (cf. 4.1). The second epoch FIFI-LS data and the
corresponding fit appear bf in green."
"The corresponding fit to the pre-burst SED yielded a dust
temperature of T pred = 26.4± 0.5 K which is slightly lower than
the pre-burst value of 28.5± 1.5 K by Brogan et al. (2019). The
dust emissivity index amounts to β= 1.83± 0.06 which is consis-
tent with the emissivity index close to the center of spiral galax-
ies in the Local Group (Mattsson et al. 2014; Tabatabaei et al.
2014) and appropriate for temperature reasons (Boudet et al.
2005)."
"Since it seems plausible that the dust properties remain un-
changed during the burst, except for the innermost region where
modifications may have occurred (for example Ábrahám et al.
2009), the pre-burst emissivity index was used for the burst- and
post-burst fits."
"As expected, the dust temperature for the burst SED is
marginally higher T burstd = 30.1± 0.5 K as well as the solid an-
gle of the emission which increased by a factor of 1.20± 0.14.
However, the χ2 of the burst fit is 2.5 times as large as that of
the pre-burst one. This is caused by the lack of a pronounced
peak in the burst SED. Since our assessment of the FIFI-LS data
did not reveal any issue other than that for 118.9 µm flux, which
has been corrected by our recalibration, the flat FIR burst spec-
trum is probably real. Future time-dependent RT modeling may
show whether such a feature can be produced by a burst of short
duration."
"An attempt was made to come up with a graybody fit for the
second FIFI-LS epoch data as well. Because of the sparse data,
the pre-burst emissivity and the mean solid angle from the pre-
and burst fits were adopted and only the temperature was varied.
The resulting temperature amounts to T postd = 28.9± 0.6 K."
4.2. Empirical burst parameters
"The FIR/(sub)mm luminosity increase due to the MM1 accre-
tion burst can be determined by integrating the above graybody
SED fits and taking source distance given in Sec. 1 as well as in-"
"terstellar extinction into account. Here we assume that all other
sources which contribute to the total G358 flux stayed constant
during the pre-, burst- and post-burst epochs. The weak variabil-
ity of MM3 in the NIR and MIR is of no concern here since its
FIR emission is far below that of MM1 (see Sec. 5). Since the
bulk of the energy is emitted in the FIR, the FIR/(sub)mm lumi-
nosity estimates only weakly depend on AV. The impact of the
distance ambiguity is considered in the following analysis."
"Integration of the graybody fits yields the following
FIR/(sub)mm luminosities: Pre-burst LpreFIR = 7600"
"800
1400 L�, first"
"FIFI-LS epoch LburstFIR = 19 300

"1500

"terstellar extinction, these values shrink but only by 9%. The lu-
minosity increase due to the accretion burst at the dates of the

"2300
3900 L� and"
"∆LpostFIR = 5100
+
−"
"1700
2900 L�. The presence of a substantial luminos-"
"ity increase during the second FIFI-LS epoch, meaning about 18
months after the peak of the maser flare, is remarkable."
"For deriving major parameters of the burst, we follow the
approach of Caratti o Garatti et al. (2017). In addition, for what
concerns the estimate of the burst energy, the two epochs of FIFI-
LS observations provide the opportunity to account for the tem-
poral evolution of the luminosity. The simplest, yet plausible, ap-
proach is to assume a linear decrease which holds from the flare
peak date to the date when the pre-burst level will be reached
again. The linear flux decay approximation yields a duration ∆t
of 869± 303 days, with a pre-burst-level return date of 2021 July
31."
"The FIR/(sub)mm burst energy is EaccFIR =<∆L
acc
FIR>×∆t,"
"where <∆LaccFIR> is the average luminosity increase which equals
to half of the peak increase for a linear drop to zero. It amounts
to EaccFIR = 1.9× 10"
"38 J. Its upper and lower bounds from the un-
certainties in both duration and luminosity are 1.0× 1038 J and
2.6× 1038 J, respectively."
"We emphasize that these values represent lower limits to the
luminosity increase and the corresponding energy release since
they are based on the FIR/(sub)mm emission only. The ultimate
quantities will be derived from the results of the RT analysis be-
low. Accretion related quantities require the knowledge of pro-
tostellar mass and radius and will be considered in Sec. 6."
5. Analysis of SEDs
5.1. SED decomposition
"In order to derive representative parameters of the bursting
MYSO MM1 from RT modeling, the underlying SED should be
as free as possible from contributions from other objects. Thanks
to the availability of NIR, MIR, and (sub)mm photometry for
MM3, the contamination from this source to the overall flux can
be removed by using predicted flux densities from its best RT
model (see Sec. 5.2.1), assuming that its SED has not changed.
This approach has been proven successful in a similar, yet less
sophisticated fashion, for a study of FIR emission from W3(OH)
and the neighboring W3(H2O) (Stecklum et al. 2002)."
"Here we extend it by also taking into account the presumed
contributions from the remaining sources detected at (sub)mm
wavelengths. Since none of these has an IR counterpart we as-
sume that they are in an early evolutionary stage similar to MM1,
with SEDs that resemble the overall pre-burst SED. So for MM1
and each of those (MM2, MM4-8), the (sub)mm fluxes from
Brogan et al. (2019) were fit by a graybody, using the temper-"

"ature and emissivity index derived from the pre-burst SED, to
obtain the individual solid angles of the emission."
"For the pre-burst epoch, the following steps were performed
to obtain the MM1 fluxes. First, the predicted MM3 fluxes were
subtracted from the G358 total fluxes. Second, the ratio between
the MM1 solid angle and the sum of all solid angles was calcu-
lated which amounts to 0.50± 0.05. It corresponds to the relative
contribution of MM1 to the MM3-subtracted fluxes. So, by mul-
tiplying the latter with this ratio the pre-burst fluxes of MM1
were obtained."
"Similarly, for the wavelengths of the burst as well as post-
burst observations, the pre-burst fluxes were predicted from the
MM3 model as well as the pre-burst graybody fit. Then, the
MM3 contribution was removed. Finally, the contribution of
MM2+MM4-8 to the MM3-subtracted pre-burst fluxes had to be
taken out from the observed burst as well as post-burst fluxes to
yield those for MM1. These are listed in Table A.2, A.3 and A.4
(for MM1 pre-burst, burst, and post-burst respectively). They
represent the best possible approximation of the intrinsic ones
of MM1. We emphasize that the procedure to derive the MM1
fluxes is tailored in order to reproduce the total flux. Therefore,
the MM1 (sub)mm fluxes exceed those given in Tab. 2 of Brogan
et al. (2019) by a factor of about two."
5.2. Radiative transfer analysis
"Characteristic properties of YSOs, namely their luminosities as
well as mass, geometry and extent of the surrounding dust, can
be derived by modeling their dust continuum radiation to match
the observed SEDs (for instance Wolf et al. 2012; Whitney et al.
2013). For G358 this has been done by Brogan et al. (2019) to
infer the pre-burst luminosity Lpre, using the YSO model grid of
Robitaille (2017)."
"Utilizing the same model pool, we performed an RT analysis
of the SEDs of MM1 and MM3 using the Python implementa-
tion “sedfitter”6 of the SED fitter (Robitaille et al. 2007) which
is described below. We did not fit the G358 total flux (black sym-"
6 https://zenodo.org/record/235786
"bols in Fig. 5), since models with multiple sources, which would
be appropriate for massive star forming regions and clearly for
G358, are not included in the Robitaille (2017) model grid. In-
stead, we extracted the fluxes of MM1 from the total ones as
described above. From the ten best fits (per epoch/source), mean
values and uncertainties for all “free” parameters of the mod-
els are derived (see Appendix A). By using a weighting with
the respective χ2 values, we ensure that the best fits determine
the corresponding mean values. For the parameters which are
log-spaced in the Robitaille model pool (rmin, rmax, Mdustdisk , L via
R?, T?), we use the geometric mean, while for all other parame-
ters, we use the arithmetic mean. Since each model is comprised
in the pool with nine different inclinations from 0◦ to 90◦ to ac-
count for the inclination dependence of the SED, the ten best fits
are not necessarily composed by ten different models. Instead,
some models might be included more than once, but with differ-
ent inclinations."
"We note that these models incorporate passive disks. While
this may seem inappropriate in the context of accretion bursts
where active disks are often invoked, it is justified by the fact that
we are primarily interested in reproducing the FIR and (sub)mm
emission. Due to the strong radial dependence of their viscosity,
for instance Pringle (1981), active disks differ from passive ones
primarily in the very innermost region where the bulk of the dis-
sipated energy is being released. The details of this process are
not relevant for the highly reprocessed emission in the FIR and
(sub)mm range, which is dominated by dust radiation from the
outer regions."
"Before describing the actual modeling, we emphasize that
additional data and results are provided in the Appendix A.
These comprise the flux tables which were used to establish the
SEDs, a summary of the RT models which have been used in the
analysis, tables listing the parameters of the ten best RT models
for each of considered cases, and a table providing optical depths
for the ten best pre-burst RT models of MM1."

5.2.1. Modeling of the dust continuum radiation of MM3
"For the fitting of the MM3 SED, the combined “spubhmi” +
“spubsmi” data sets from Robitaille (2017) have been used. They
comprise 120 000 YSO models with nine inclinations for each
model (leading to a set of 1 080 000 SEDs in total). All models
employ Milky Way dust with RV = 5.5 and a grain size distribu-
tion from Weingartner & Draine (2001)."
"Their designations are based on the respective model com-
ponents. Each model (in both data sets) comprises the follow-
ing components: star, passive circumstellar disk, bipolar cav-
ity, Ulrich-type envelope (Ulrich 1976), and ambient medium.
The “spubhmi”-setting features an inner hole in between star
and disk, whereas for “spubsmi” the inner radius is governed
by the dust sublimation radius (assuming Tsub = 1600 K, in ac-
cordance with Robitaille et al. 2006). We note that the Robitaille
model pool includes other data sets, that are composed of less
(or different) components and are thus less suited to represent
the structure of a YSO at a very early evolutionary stage. For
further details, we refer the reader to Robitaille (2017). A syn-
thetic aperture size of 3′′ has been used for fitting the SED. The
fluxes of the MM3 SED are listed in Tab. A.1."
"We adopt the same distance range as for MM1 but allow for
a smaller interstellar extinction. Figure 5 shows the SED (green)
together with the total pre-burst SED (black symbols) and the
pre-burst flux attributed to MM1 (blue), where the contribution
of the other sources has been removed as described in Sec. 5.1.
The ten best fits for each SED are shown with solid lines. The
best fit is dark, whereas the other are slightly transparent. Our
models suggest that the contribution of MM3 to the total flux
at wavelengths beyond λ≥ 40 µm is marginal. Nevertheless we
take the best MM3 fit into consideration when refining the MM1
fluxes in the following analysis."
"As indicated by its moderate obscuration in the NIR already:
MM3 is likely the most evolved object of the G358 complex. It
features a disk with a dust mass of Mdustdisk = 0.068"
"0.11
0.043 M�. This"

(γ) of 100 in mind. However, the latter is not applicable since
γ depends on the galactocentric distance RGC (Giannetti et al.
2017, Eq. 2,) because of the Galactic metallicity gradient. For
G358, RGC=1.6 kpc implies a value of γ= 38± 4 which yields a

"and an inclination of i = 51± 9◦. The inner radius of the disk

of the ten best models . The mean value of the disk outer ra-
dius amounts to 510 +−"

3130 L� corresponds to"
"a ZAMS star of 11 M� and 4.2 R� (Tout et al. 1996). While most
of the models have luminosities below 10 000 L�, one has a lu-
minosity of 43 000 L�. Such a high effective temperature would
imply the presence of a compact Hii region. However, MM3 es-
caped the detection in the radio continuum at a sensitivity level
of ∼ 50 µJy beam−1 in the survey of Hu et al. (2016) which prob-
ably rules out this model. Recently, Bayandina et al. (in prep.)
succeeded to detect faint radio continuum emission from MM3.
The whole parameter set for the ten best models (including their
respective χ2 values) can be found (together with the weighted
means and standard deviation σ) in Table A.5."
"As described in Sec. 5.1 the MM3 SED fit is used for the
SED decomposition. In order to check the robustness of the FIR
part of the best models, two more fits were performed with re-
duced data sets. At first, the ALMA fluxes were omitted which
yielded slightly lower FIR fluxes compared to the nominal fit de-
scribed above. Then, also the WISE W4 and MIPS 24 µm fluxes"
"were dropped. The best model for this SED shows fluxes exceed-
ing those of the nominal fit (cf. Fig. A.2). Thus, we conclude that
the FIR part of the nominal MM3 SED fit is well constrained by
the incorporated fluxes longward of 20 µm."
5.2.2. Modeling of the dust continuum radiation of MM1
"With the refined MM1 SEDs at hand, a comparison of the re-
sults from RT modeling for the pre-burst, post- and burst-states
becomes possible. Before describing this analysis, a remark must
be made concerning the interstellar extinction AV which is a
free parameter of the SED fitter. Because of the wavelength de-
pendence of the dust optical properties, extinction is most pro-
nounced at short wavelengths. Thus, for SEDs like that of MM3
it can be well constrained by the best models. However, for the
SED of MM1 which is almost exclusively defined by FIR and
(sub)mm measurements, interstellar extinction is less influen-
tial and, therefore, harder to derive. Since higher AV implies
larger source luminosities to reproduce the observed fluxes, an
upper limit needs to be established to constrain L. The recali-
bration of a Galactic dust-reddening model based on IRAS and
COBE/DIRBE results by Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011) suggests
a value of AV = 115± 4.2 mag along the sight line toward G358.
Since this holds for the whole path across the Galaxy, while
G358 is in front of the Galactic center region, the actual AV will
in fact be lower. Therefore, we assumed an interstellar extinction
range of AV = 30− 70 mag."
"To begin with, we fit the pre-burst MM1 SED which repre-
sents the stationary state using the distance and interstellar ex-
tinction ranges given above. This established the ten best pre-
burst fits. For this purpose, the “spubsmi” data set from Ro-
bitaille (2017) has been used which includes 40 000 models at
nine inclinations (360 000 SEDs in total). For these models, the
inner radius of the dust disk corresponds to the sublimation ra-
dius Rsub. This constraint seems to be justified given the high ac-
cretion rates at which massive stars form (for example Zinnecker
& Yorke 2007; Kuiper et al. 2016), and in particular before and
during an accretion burst. It requires a few remarks concerning
the understanding of “heating” and “cooling” in this case, since
the dust disk cannot get any hotter than the sublimation tempera-
ture. What happens due to a luminosity increase is that enhanced
dust sublimation at the inner rim Rsub pushes the latter outward.
This is accompanied by an adjustment of the temperature profile
T (r) via absorption and re-emission such that, for a given radius
(beyond the actual Rsub), the temperature exceeds the previous
value. Conversely, for a given temperature, the growth in radius
implies a larger radiating area and, therefore, leads to a flux in-
crease. The reverse process happens once the burst ceased. Rsub
will shift back inward, allowing the dust replenishment by ac-
cretion and/or dust reformation. This will lead to a flux decrease
and might be considered as “cooling” but, yet, the inner rim is
still at the dust sublimation temperature."
"The next step was to establish a new model pool from the
ten best pre-burst-SEDs which serves to fit the post-/burst SEDs.
This pool contains 100 SEDs in total, where we reuse the best
10 models, with a source luminosity increasing in nine linearly
spaced steps from 2 to 6 Lpre, respectively. Inclination, interstel-
lar extinction and the distance were set to the values of the un-
derlying model from the pre-burst-fit since none of these param-
eters is expected to change during the burst. Additionally, the
original pre-burst-SEDs are included. Since the inner disk radius

weighted mean-model (see text) is shown in
black. It is shown three times but with different
source luminosities for the respective observing
epochs. Since the 870 (pre-) and 889 µm (post-
and burst) fluxes are very similar, their symbols
cannot easily be distinguished."
"this ignores possible changes of the disk due to the burst, for
instance in the density structure, it is the simplest approach to
model the dust continuum emission due to the accretion burst,
and feasible to be treated using common RT codes which are
generally static. While a proper burst modeling requires time de-
pendent RT, possibly coupled to hydrodynamics for utmost con-
sistency, our simplified treatment nevertheless allows us to draw
major conclusions."
"For computing the burst models, the Hyperion code (Ro-
bitaille 2011) has been used. The so obtained database is the
foundation to fit the SEDs of burst and post-burst epochs. We
note that by constraining the model pool, we ensure consistency
of the results, which means the best fits for pre-burst, burst, and
post-burst SEDs are based on the same models. A sketch of all
SEDs that are included in burst model database, can be found in
the Appendix (Fig. A.1.) The range of the observed fluxes from
the burst- and post-burst-epoch is well covered by the models.
Only the burst observations at λ= 163 and 186 µm are outside of
the flux range covered by the models. Only one model out of the
ten best burst fits has the maximal luminosity increase included
in the pool. Therefore, it is not necessary to include models with
higher source luminosities."
"Before presenting the results, a few remarks have to be made
concerning the fitting. We exclude the sub-mm observations at
λ> 890 µm from the SED-fit of the burst since their deviation
from the stationary models is biggest at those wavelengths (see
Sec. 9.1). The post-burst is observed only at wavelengths greater
than 118 µm, meaning that there are no constraints in the MIR.
Since the maser flux did not fall below its pre-burst level until
now (MacLeod et al., in prep.; Yonekura et al., in prep.), we as-
sume that the post-burst flux in the MIR is also not below the
pre-burst level. Therefore, models from the post-burst fits that
have MIR fluxes below those of the mean pre-burst model were
excluded. An aperture size of 3′′ has been applied in for the fits.
With this choice the χ2-value of the pre-burst fit becomes small-
est. All obtained parameters are stable against a variation of the
aperture size (they agree within their respective errors)."
"The results of the RT modeling of the MM1 SEDs are vi-
sualized in Fig. 6, which shows the ten best fits to the pre-burst"
"(blue), burst (red) and post-burst SED (green). The best model
is shown with the darkest line, while the nine other ones are
slightly transparent. In addition to the ten best fits, the so called
“mean”-model is shown in black. This model is computed us-
ing the weighted mean parameters from the combination of pre-
burst, post-burst and burst fits (see below). The stellar param-
eters, which are obviously changing during the burst, are de-
fined by the pre-burst models alone. The mean model is not only
shown for the pre-burst, but also for source luminosities corre-
sponding to the mean values during burst and post-burst. As ex-
pected, the mean model lies within the range, spanned by the ten
best models at each epoch. The results are summarized in Table
A.6."

"A comparison of the RT results to those obtained from gray-
body fits in Sec. 4.1 shows that the luminosity increase and en-
ergy release from the RT models are indeed higher, although the
luminosities at burst and post-burst epochs agree within their re-
spective errors. The main reasons are the inclusion of more ener-
getic emission from hotter regions in the models which lacks in
the graybody fits and the correction of the flux contribution from
the other G358 sources as outlined in Sec. 5.1."
"The estimated parameters from the RT modeling are given

considerable scatter in the derived disk properties. The derived
outer radii are between 140 and 3800 au, with a mean value of
950 +−"
"1500
580 au. The favored dust mass of the circumstellar disk is"
"as low as 8.4× 10−5 M�, where the 1σ-confidence interval ex-
tends from 1.1× 10−6 to 6.1× 10−3 M�. Using the appropriate
gas-to-dust mass ratio (see Sec. 5.2.1) this corresponds to a most
probable total disk mass of 3.2× 10−3 M� within an uncertainty
range of 4.4× 10−5 to 0.24 M�. Remarkably, the corresponding
total disk masses are lower, and mostly much smaller, than those
derived for MYSOs from SED fitting (for example Kraus et al.
2010; Johnston et al. 2015). Among the best models there is only
one (90Yt0exl_03) with a total disk mass of 1.4 M� which is
not that much below present estimates. In contrast to MM3, the
much higher scatter of the disk mass of MM1 compared to the
other log-spaced parameters indicates that it cannot be reliably
estimated by the fitter. In other words, a substantial flux contri-
bution from a disk is not necessarily required to reproduce the
SEDs. Thus, while we cannot reliably estimate its mass, we may
conclude that the disk is quite likely lightweight."
"We note that during the burst the disk dust mass might de-
crease due to dust sublimation. The total mass will be unaffected,
assuming that all sublimated dust just increases the gas mass.
The whole parameter set for the ten best models for each of the
three epochs (including their respective χ2 values) can be found
(together with the weighted means and standard deviation σ) in
Table A.6."
"The above given properties have been derived from the re-
sults of all MM1 SED-fits, pre-burst, post-burst and burst. The
respective χ2-values were used to weight the obtained parame-
ters, similar to what has been done for MM3. We normalized the
sum of the respective weighting factors to unity, split up to 0.5
for the pre-burst and 0.25 for the other two epochs. With this
we ensure an equal contribution of the fit to the “stationary”-
(pre-burst) and “non-stationary”-system (burst and post-burst),
where the “non stationary”-contribution is obtained taking into
account burst and post-burst epoch equally. The χ2-values of the
burst models are about 5 times higher than for the pre-burst. This
might be related to the scatter in the FIFI-LS data, to a coarser
sampling of the model-parameters (because of the fact that we
only consider models that fit the pre-burst SED pretty well), and
to differences in comparison to the static case (whereas the pre-
burst-system most probably is stationary, this does not hold for
the post-/bursting stage). We note, that in the burst case the rel-
ative weights of the models are on the same order, whereas in
the pre-burst case they differ by a factor of 1.5 at most (for the
post-burst it is 1.3)."
6. Stellar-dependent burst parameters
"The RT modeling of the MM1 SEDs aimed at determining the
luminosities of the MYSO for the various epochs to infer the
total energy released by the accretion burst. For deriving the ac-
creted mass and the mass accretion rate, protostellar mass and
radius have to be known. For YSOs approaching the ZAMS, the
corresponding values which match the luminosity are a good ap-
proximation. At first, we use this approach to obtain mass and
radius estimates which reproduce the MM1 pre-burst luminosity,"
"Fig. 7. Dependence of the derived accretion rate on the average lumi-
nosity increase <∆Lacc> and assumed ZAMS stellar mass for the param-
eter range bracketing MM1. The horizontal dashed line corresponds to
<∆Lacc> and the light gray region marks its 1σ uncertainty while the
vertical dashed line and the darker gray region indicate the stellar mass

where G is the gravitational constant, M∗ is the stellar mass, Macc
is the accreted mass, and Eacc the released energy derived in the
previous section. Here it is implicitly assumed that the potential
energy is released as well when the matter eventually reaches the
protostar."
"Finally, the mass accretion rate will be obtained from
Ṁacc=Macc/∆tacc. We have to emphasize here that, generally, the
duration of the enhanced accretion ∆tacc will be shorter than that
of the elevated emission ∆t which has to be used to come up with
an overall burst energy estimate. Since the maser excitation is
due to MIR dust emission, the total maser flux can be taken as a
proxy for the accretion strength (see Sec. 9.4). From the rise and
fall of the maser light curve (MacLeod et al., in prep.; Yonekura
et al., in prep.), an effective duration ∆tacc of about two months
can be derived with a presumed uncertainty range of ±5 days.
With the above quantities we obtain Macc = 3.1 +−"

nated by the error of ∆tacc and Eacc. Using the ZAMS mass-
radius relation the range of the accretion rate for a given average
luminosity increase is shown in Fig. 7."
"However, since MM1 is likely in an earlier evolutionary
stage, preceding the ZAMS, the above assumption may not hold.
A different and presumably more realistic approach is possible
using the stellar radius from the RT modeling of the pre-burst
SED together with the stellar mass of 12±3 M� derived from
the kinematic model of the spiral-arm accretion flows (Chen
et al. 2020b). This leads to Macc = 5.3 +−"

"the small disk mass, the accreted fraction represents 16% of the
total. This raises the question whether the lightweight disk is a
stable or transient feature."
7. Methanol maser relocation
"It has been emphasized that methanol masers play a crucial role
in identifying accretion bursts from MYSOs. The maser activity
of G358 during its burst was extraordinary and unique in sev-
eral aspects (Breen et al. 2019; Brogan et al. 2019; MacLeod
et al. 2019). The excitation of new maser spots at larger distance
has been observed for the first time during the accretion burst
of S255IR-NIRS3 (Moscadelli et al. 2017). Notably, for G358 a
ring-like propagation of maser spots, likely excited by the heat
wave due to the burst, has been witnessed (Burns et al. 2020).
Further evidence for spatial changes of the G358 maser distribu-
tion during and after the burst has been gained (Bayandina et al.,
in prep.)."
"Both methanol in the gas phase and the proper IR radia-
tion are two of the major requirements for maser excitation.
While cosmic ray sputtering of dust grain mantles can also re-
lease methanol to the gas phase (Dartois et al. 2020), thermal
desorption due to grain heating will be the dominant process
near the MYSO. It requires temperatures of at least 94 K (Luna
et al. 2018) while the maximum desorption rate is reached at
about 120-125 K (Collings et al. 2004). For such temperatures,
the peak flux of the thermal IR radiation from the warm dust is
in the proper wavelength range needed to excite these masers
(Ostrovskii & Sobolev 2002; Cragg et al. 2005). The RT mod-
els of MM1 during the pre-burst, burst, and post-burst epochs
described in Sec. 5.2.2 yielded spatial dust temperature distri-
butions which can be used to address which regions of the cir-
cumstellar environment are potential sites of Class II 6.7 GHz
methanol masers, and how they change due to the burst."
"Figure 8 shows the central part of temperature distribu-
tion of the mean model in the first quadrant of the x-z plane
for the pre-burst (left), burst (middle) and post-burst (right)
epochs. The white lines mark the following gas densities
nH2 = [1, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2]× 10"
"8 cm−3 (density decreases with z). To
transform the dust densities from the RT-simulation to the above
given gas densities, we use the relation ρ= mH2 N"
"−1
A × nH2γ"
"−1,
where mH2 is the molar mass of H2, NA is the Avogadro constant
and γ is the dust to gas ratio introduced in Sec. 5.2.1. Because of
its low mass, the disk, which is embedded in the rotationally flat-
tened envelope, cannot be easily recognized. The vertical solid
black line indicates the outer radius of the disk."
"For gas densities exceeding 108 cm−3, the maser brightness
drops rapidly due to collisional de-excitation (Cragg et al. 2005,
Fig. 2). Therefore, within the densest regions (innermost contour
- disk mid-plane, envelope at the centrifugal radius) the excita-
tion of Class II methanol masers is basically ruled out."
"The orange and red lines of Fig. 8 indicate temperatures
of 94 K (orange, minimum temperature for thermal methanol
desorption to occur) and 120 K (red, optimum temperature for
methanol desorption) during the pre-burst, burst, and post-burst,
respectively. At each epoch the temperatures right of the solid
orange line are too low for desorption of methanol, which means
that it remains bound within icy dust grain mantles. Thus, these
lines represent the methanol snow line beyond which masers
cannot occur. Due to the heating by the burst, it will be shifted
outward and move inward again once the disk started to cool
after the burst ceased."
"During the pre-burst stage (Fig. 8 left), possible maser sites
are likely confined to a region which originates in the disk"
"around ∼ 300 au and stretches along the surface of the cavity
wall. The situation is different for the burst epoch (Fig. 8 cen-
ter). As expected, the methanol snow line moved outward and is
located at about 1000 au. At the same time the region below the
disk/envelope surface has become warmer and presumably got
enriched with gaseous methanol. These conclusions from the RT
modeling can be compared to the multi-epoch VLBI observa-
tions of the expanding maser ring (Burns et al. 2020; Burns et
al., in prep.). The vertical dashed black lines mark the circum-
ference of the maser ring from the first and 4th VLBI epoch. The
first epoch observations were obtained already two weeks after
the flare started. It is reasonable to assume that during the very
early flare rise the excitation conditions were not too far off the
pre-burst case. In fact the location of the maser circumference
during the first epoch is within the region where phase transi-
tion from the solid to the gaseous methanol seems to occur in
the pre-burst state. The data of the fourth VLBI epoch was taken
about three weeks after the first FIFI-LS observations (”burst”
epoch). The maser circumference at that time is confined to the
desorption temperature interval for regions not too far off the
disk plane. The fact that the extent of the maser ring matches the
expected maser positions for both epochs suggests that our RT
modeling, although static, nevertheless describes major changes
of the circumstellar environment due to the burst properly."
"Moreover, Fig. 8 seems to indicate that at the first VLBI
epoch, the maser sites were likely close to the interface between
the outflow lobe and the disk/envelope, that is in a region of
relatively low optical depth. The subliminal maser propagation
speed reported by Burns et al. (2020) implies substantial optical
depths. This suggests that the masers likely propagated into the
disk rather than on its surface. If so it could be expected that the
ring expansion slowed down over time. This conclusion is fairly
speculative and its verification requires time-dependent RT sim-
ulations."
"The right panel of Fig. 8 indicates the readjustment of tem-
perature distribution after the burst. Thus, the desorption range
moved inward and is basically in between those for both pre-
burst and burst."
"Another important parameter for the maser excitation is the
specific column density, NM∆V"
"−1, where NM is the methanol col-
umn density along the line of sight and ∆V the velocity range
of the molecules. The low inclination i obtained from our RT
modeling and by Chen et al. (2020b) implies that ∆V is only
slightly larger than thermal line-width since the radial velocity
component of the orbital motion will be small. This increases
the prospects for maser to occur."
"When assessing these results it should be kept in mind that
the circumstellar environment of G358 is almost certainly more
structured than our RT model. Thus, sight lines of lower optical
depth as well as density fluctuations may leave an imprint on the
actual distribution of the maser spots."
"8. Wavelength and time dependence of the flux
variation"
"The RT results for G358 can be used to address the question
which wavelength range is suited best to detect the flux increase
induced by a MYSO burst. For this purpose, the mean model
SEDs for burst and post-burst were normalized by the pre-burst
model SED. It has to be kept in mind that dividing the flux val-
ues cancels the extinction correction. The result is shown in the
upper panel of Fig. 9. It can be seen that the peak values of the
relative flux m exceed the luminosity gains derived in the pre-
vious section. For our MYSO models, the largest relative flux"

"increase occurs around 10 µm. This agrees with the results of
MacFarlane et al. (2019) for similar luminosity gains. For their
low-mass YSO models, the maximum flux ratio shifts toward the
FIR for stronger accretion bursts. The least relative flux increase
occurs in the (sub)mm. This is because the emission in this part
of the spectrum arises from the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the Planck
function, where the spectral radiance only linearly depends on
temperature. Since the temperature increase of the outer circum-
stellar regions is lower than for the inner ones, their flux increase
is accordingly smaller."
"The wavelength dependence of the relative flux increase
agrees qualitatively with that of the outburst of OO Serpentis
(OO Ser), as found by the first YSO outburst monitoring which
covered the full wavelength range from NIR to FIR (Kóspál et al.
2007). These observations also revealed a wavelength-dependent
time shift of the peak brightness which had not been witnessed
for other eruptive YSOs before."
"A recent study by Contreras Peña et al. (2020), based on MIR
(NEOWISE W2, 4.6 µm) and (sub)mm (SCUBA-2, 850 µm)
variability of deeply embedded protostars, shed more light on
the wavelength dependence of the rise/drop speed of the relative
flux m. From our SED fits, we can assess this issue in a “semi-
empirical” manner for the whole wavelength range of the SED.
The relative rise/drop speeds are obtained for the pre-burst to
the burst (Pr→B) and the burst to post-burst (B→Po) epochs, re-
spectively. The results are presented in the lower panel of Fig. 9.
The two curves show m(λ) = | log(Fx(λ)/Fy(λ))×∆t"
"−1
| for each"
"wavelength of the modeled SEDs. The indices x, y denote the
respective epoch pairs and ∆t is the corresponding epoch differ-
ence (in years). The upper curve holds for the flux rise while the
lower one for the flux decrease. Since we do not know exactly
when the rise started, the upper curve may be shifted while its
slope is unaffected from the actual date."
"With only two wavelengths at hand, Contreras Peña et al.
(2020) were not able to infer the functional form of m(λ) and had
to assume a proportionality such that m(4.6µm) = ηm(850µm).
From objects with the most significant variability at both wave-
lengths, they derived η= 5.53± 0.29. This can be compared to
the η values based on m at 4.6 and 850 µm from our results (black
dots in Fig. 9). These amount to ηPr→B = 4.48 and ηB→Po = 5.88
for rise and drop, respectively. The values from our models are
similar, although ηPr→B is somewhat lower."
"More importantly, our approach allowed us to derive m(λ)
for the whole range of the SED. The corresponding curves show
that beyond λ& 10 µm, log(m) depends approximately linear on"

"log(λ). Thus, the wavelength dependence m(λ) actually resem-
bles a power law. The black lines show the respective fits to
both epoch pairs. They yielded the following relations for m(λ):

"0.04
0.03) × λ"
"−0.43±0.01, for the
rise and drop, respectively. The spectral indices of both relations
agree within the errors, suggesting that the sense of the flux vari-
ability does not affect the speed of the relative flux change. These
results indicate that a) burst induced flux variations are quicker
at shorter wavelengths and b) the rise and fall of the fluxes take
equal times."
"Article number, page 13 of 22"
A&A proofs: manuscript no. G358-SOFIA
"Yet, a cautionary note is required here. First of all, our as-
sessment of the correlated flux variability is based on YSO mod-
els with passive disks. The viscous energy release in an active
disk leads to a temperature distribution that differs from the pas-
sive case in particular in the innermost region. This will lead to
a higher value of η as shown by Contreras Peña et al. (2020).
Moreover, we have to mention that the models used by these au-
thors and us are based on static RT. Time-dependent RT shall be
used to verify the above considerations. Moreover, it has to be
emphasized that the wavelength dependence of the fading rate
as obtained by Contreras Peña et al. (2020) and in the present
paper has not been found for the OO Ser event (Kóspál et al.
2007). In that case, the fading rate is only time-dependent and
slows down over time. The reason for the different behavior still
needs to be understood."
9. Discussion
"In the following, particular results are evaluated with regard
to their credibility and impact concerning our understanding of
MYSO accretion bursts. The G358 event is compared to the pre-
vious cases. Before we address individual topics, we note for
completeness, that our investigation only covers the surplus dust
continuum emission caused by the accretion burst. While the
fraction of the energy consumed by phase transitions (sublima-
tion of grain ice mantles, dust evaporation and dissociation of
molecules) is negligible in the present context, it nevertheless se-
riously affects the chemistry of the YSO (Rab et al. 2017; Wiebe
et al. 2019)."
9.1. Misfit of the (sub)mm fluxes
"Figure 6 shows that the best burst and post-burst fits predict
(sub)mm fluxes that exceed the measured values. The observed
values, indicated by the red and green symbols at λ= 889 µm
amount to 60-70% of the respective mean burst and post-burst
model. Since attempts to solve this discrepancy failed or required
non-plausible assumptions, for instance on grain properties or
geometry, we conclude that this mismatch indicates a deviation
of the temperature distribution of the circumstellar environment
from the static case. The accretion burst causes an additional
inside-out heating of the circumstellar environment where in-
ner regions try to reach a new thermal equilibrium while outer
ones are still in the previous steady-state. Time-dependent RT
simulations suggest that the heating timescales strongly increase
with wavelength (Harries 2011; Johnstone et al. 2013). Since the
MM1 SEDs are dominated by the increased FIR fluxes, their fits
will, therefore, yield over-predicted (sub)mm fluxes."
"For deeply embedded YSOs, the contribution of the enve-
lope to the thermal FIR/(sub)mm emission may be significant
(or even dominant), for example Contreras Peña et al. (2020).
For about half of the best MM1 pre-burst models, the overall
optical depth of the envelope exceeds by far that of the disk (see
Table A.7). In these cases the envelope produces the overwhelm-
ing fraction of the (sub)mm emission. Furthermore, the heating
of parts of the envelope, which are in the shadow of the disk,
will be suppressed or (strongly) delayed. This effect will be es-
pecially important for systems with strongly flared disks."
"Not only the heating time scales have an influence on
the burst-SED, but also the characteristics of the burst itself.
Short/weak bursts might be not strong or long enough to heat the
whole circumstellar environment which is probably the case for
G358. This will lead to an overestimation of the sub-mm fluxes
when using stationary models as well. Because of that, fluxes"
"beyond 889 µm were not included to fit the MM1 burst SED in
order to avoid their systematic overestimation induced by our
method."
9.2. Uncertainty of the accretion parameters
"It was mentioned above that the ZAMS values for R∗ might
not apply since the high accretion rates during the growth of a
massive protostar will temporarily bloat its radius which could
then be many times larger than that of a main sequence star
(Hosokawa & Omukai 2009; Hosokawa et al. 2010). Recent sim-
ulations suggest that bloating is even intensified by accretion
bursts (Meyer et al. 2019a). As a consequence of bloating, more
mass needs to be accreted to produce the observed luminosity
increase. In the cold disk accretion model of Hosokawa et al.
(2010), the protostellar swelling occurs in the mass range be-
tween 5-9 M�. Since the mass of MM1 is likely of that order, the
supposition of being bloated is perhaps valid. If so, the accretion
rate may be elevated as it is proportional to the stellar radius.
Unfortunately, due to the high extinction of deeply embedded
protostars, it is hard to derive their surface gravity from photo-
spheric absorption lines because of strong veiling. Only recently
this has been achieved for the first time. The MYSO G015.1288–
00.6717 shows an A-type spectrum with a relatively low surface
gravity, pointing to a bloated protostar (Pomohaci et al. 2017)."
"For that reason, caution is required for what concerns the
comparison of stellar-related burst properties. For a MYSO in
a relatively evolved stage, like S255IR-NIRS3 which shows a
flat pre-burst SED, the derivation of an accretion rate using the
ZAMS approach seems to be justified. However, its application
to MYSOs in earlier stages, like G358 or NGC6334I-MM1, is
questionable. In addition, the ZAMS approach has its own chal-
lenges because, unlike low-mass stars, massive stars arrive on
the ZAMS while accreting. Therefore, their pre-burst luminosity
includes a likely small but unknown fraction of accretion lumi-
nosity. For low- and intermediate mass-stars, accretion rates can
be derived from emission-line tracers (for example Mendigutía
et al. 2011) which, however, might be only exceptionally seen in
scattered light from MYSOs (Neckel & Staude 1995)."
"In any case the burst energy Eacc provides a good proxy on
the energetics of the event. In this regard, the values for G358-
MM1, S255IR-NIRS3, and NGC6334I-MM1 of 2.9+−"
"1.1
0.8 × 10"
"38 J
(see Sec. 5.2.2), 1.2 ± 0.4× 1039 J (Caratti o Garatti et al. 2017),
and 8× 1038 J (Hunter et al. 2017) already indicate a range of
about an order of magnitude. Since the luminosities of S255IR-
NIRS3 and NGC6334I-MM1 were still elevated when the afore-
mentioned papers appeared, their final numbers will be even
higher."
9.3. Burst strength bias
"It is well established that young massive stars have a high stellar
multiplicity (Zinnecker & Yorke 2007; Pomohaci et al. 2019).
Given their distances, high spatial resolution obtained by in-
terferometric observations is required to resolve the individual
components of MYSOs like G358 or to prove their single nature.
For less embedded objects, this can be achieved with the VLTI
in the thermal IR, while for deeply embedded sources (sub)mm
interferometers like NOEMA or ALMA have to be used. FIR in-
terferometry, which requires groups of satellites in space, does
not yet exist, although it has been envisaged (Linz et al. 2020).
Keeping in mind that MYSOs emit the bulk of their energy in
the FIR, the coarse spatial resolution in the FIR implies that in"
"Article number, page 14 of 22"
B. Stecklum et al.: Infrared observations of the flaring maser source G358.93−0.03
"most if not all cases, their luminosities consist of individual con-
tributions. Thus, relating the luminosity increase caused by an
accretion burst of single source to the total pre-burst luminosity
only yields a lower limit to the burst strength. In case of G358
the luminosity gain derived from the graybody fits of pre- and
burst total fluxes amounts to 2.5 while the RT results based on
the SED decomposition (see Sec. 5.1) yielded a value of 4.7 for
MM1."
9.4. Burst duration and temporal evolution of the IR emission
"Class II methanol masers are excited by MIR thermal emission
from warm dust grains with temperatures exceeding 100 K (Os-
trovskii & Sobolev 2002; Cragg et al. 2005). Regardless of the
details of the enhanced accretion, the increase of released en-
ergy will in all likelihood cause the evaporation of dust grains
at the inner boundary of the disk and thus shift its rim outward.
Since the radiative transfer will adjust the temperature profile
accordingly, the MIR-emitting region moves toward a larger ra-
dius. Due to its larger surface area the emission increases and
that of the masers as well. Thus, the rise and fall of the maser
emission is coupled to the accretion variability through the dust
MIR continuum emission. First direct evidence for this relation
has been found by us for the S255IR-NIRS3 burst (Stecklum
et al. 2018a), see Durjasz et al. (2019) and Olech et al. (2020)
for other cases."
"Since the maser flare of G358 lasted only for a few months
(MacLeod et al., in prep.; Yonekura et al., in prep.), it can be
concluded that the increased accretion rate dropped shortly be-
fore the end of the flare. So the question arises how does it come
that elevated FIR emission is still present after 18 months past
the flare peak? The current notion is that dust cooling should be
quick because of the low optical depth at those wavelengths. The
bulk of the FIR/(sub)mm emission comes from outer regions of
the circumstellar environment. Thus, their optical depth toward
the observer is low indeed. However, this is not necessarily the
case for the optical depth toward the protostar where the energy
is being released. An effective optical depth of a few will slow
down the heating of the outer YSO environment and “trap” burst
energy in the dusty medium. The latter will be radiated away
and cause elevated FIR emission for quite some time after the
burst terminated. Evidence of post-burst elevated FIR emission
has been found for the OO Ser event (Kóspál et al. 2007) and by
us for S255IR-NIRS3 (Stecklum et al., in prep.). G358 is another
example which shows this behavior as well."
"The projected linear separations between nearest neighbors
of the G358 complex of up to 104 au (Brogan et al. 2019) imply
individual object sizes with corresponding light travel times of
up to two months. These can easily stretch to one year or more
for moderate efficient optical depths. Furthermore, it has to be
kept in mind that there is a variety of sight lines with different
optical depths along which outer regions will be heated. The dif-
ferent propagation speeds along those lines incur a broadening of
the heating duration. A subluminal speed (0.04. . . 0.08 c) of the
heat wave during the burst has been witnessed in G358 by trac-
ing, for the first time, the outward motion of maser spots (Burns
et al. 2020). Subluminal speed for the relocation of maser spots
was found for S255IR-NIRS3 (Stecklum et al. 2018b) as well.
This illustrates the imprint of the optical depth on the radiative
transfer of the burst energy throughout the YSO."
9.5. Accretion burst drivers
"YSO accretion bursts are thought to be caused by enhanced
mass transfer through the circumstellar disk, triggered by vari-
ous reasons, which may drive the inner disk to become active and
self-luminous (Hartmann & Kenyon 1996). Among the possible
causes, erratic infall from a protostellar envelope (cf. Vorobyov
& Basu 2015; Meyer et al. 2017) seems to be favorable for a
MYSO in an evolutionary stage as early as G358. Interestingly,
recent high-resolution radio imaging of MM1 suggests the pres-
ence of two spiral-arm accretion flows, winding toward the pro-
tostar as traced by methanol masers (Brogan et al. 2019; Chen
et al. 2020b). This is in line with very high-resolution ALMA
imaging of high-mass protostars that provided evidence for fil-
amentary streamers pointing onto the central sources (Goddi
et al. 2018; Johnston et al. 2020). These might represent multi-
directional accretion channels which possibly inhibit the forma-
tion of a large, steady disk at the very early stages of massive
star formation. Thus, the small disk mass suggested by our best
RT SED fits may be seen as a hint for the extreme youth of
MM1. Possibly, its environment is not relaxed enough to allow
the formation of a larger sustainable circumstellar disk. Such a
disk might be prone to gravitational instability, considered to be
another cause for episodic accretion (Vorobyov & Basu 2015).
Faint radio continuum emission from MM1 has been detected
during the burst as well (Bayandina et al., in prep.). Whether it
is variable and perhaps related to an active disk needs to be ex-
plored."
9.6. G358 in the accretion burst context
"The G358 burst is the second one from a MYSO for which the
accretion luminosity could be measured from the SED changes.
This allows us to compare the derived quantities with the results
obtained for S255IR-NIRS3 (Caratti o Garatti et al. 2017), which
is the first step toward a statistics of MYSO burst properties. As-
suming a ZAMS star, an accreted mass of ∼ 3.4× 10−3 M� has
been estimated for S255IR-NIRS3. The corresponding accretion
rate amounts to 5± 2× 10−3 M� yr−1. While these values will
likely be revised once the comprehensive monitoring data set has
been analyzed, we can assume that their order of magnitude is
correct. The accretion rate of the G358 burst almost corresponds
to that of the S255IR-NIRS3 event. However, the accreted mass
is about one order of magnitude smaller due to the shorter dura-
tion of the burst. Thus, compared to S255IR-NIRS3, the G358
burst was a minor one. Simulations of MYSO accretion (Meyer
et al. 2019b) suggest that minor bursts similar to that of G358
are much more frequent compared to major ones, and occur pre-
dominantly at very early stages of protostellar evolution. We em-
phasize that the above-mentioned disk accretion rates during the
burst are at least an order of magnitude larger than those derived
from SED modeling of non-bursting high-mass protostellar ob-
jects (Fazal et al. 2008; Grave & Kumar 2009)."
"While the MYSO accretion burst sample is still small, it will
grow in the mid-term by following up methanol maser alerts on
a regular basis. Recently, the suggestion by Proven-Adzri et al.
(2019) that the periodicity of methanol masers in G323.46–0.08
could be due to an accretion burst was confirmed (Wolf et al., in
prep.) using (NEO)WISE and VVV data. While this is another
event which was identified a posteriori, it raised the total number
of known MYSO bursts to five, including V723 Car. So a thor-
ough comparison of MYSO burst properties with corresponding
models (for example Meyer et al. 2019b), should become possi-
ble in the foreseeable future."

10. Conclusions
"The SOFIA FIFI-LS observations of G358 during two epochs,
supplemented by NIR imaging and supplementary archival data,
and their RT analysis yield the following major results:"
"– Increased FIR fluxes measured with FIFI-LS confirmed the
accretion burst of G358 which was alerted by the maser flare.
Since no excess emission associated with the burst was de-
tected in NIR, MIR or (sub)mm observations, it represents
the first NIR-, FIR- and (sub)mm-dark but FIR-loud MYSO
accretion burst."
"– By means of the SED decomposition approach actual lumi-
nosity estimates of the driving source of the accretion burst
could be obtained which yielded more representative burst
parameters."
"– From the change of the luminosities at the two FIFI-LS
epochs the decay-time time of the FIR excess emission
could be determined. This yielded more reliable estimates
of the burst energy and the derived parameters. Moreover,
wavelength-dependent rates for the rise and fall of the rela-
tive fluxes could be obtained."
"– The circumstellar disk of MM1 is less massive than those
found for other MYSOs and possibly transient. This may be
an indication of the extreme youth of the source."
"– A comparison with previous MYSO bursts indicates a con-
siderable range of burst characteristics. The burst of G358 is
the least energetic of the small sample."
"– The RT modeling allowed us to draw conclusions on the pos-
sible sites of maser excitation and their relocation due to the
burst which seem to be supported by VLBI radio observa-
tions."
"– As already demonstrated for the S255IR-NIRS3 event, the
G358 results underline once more that the observational ca-
pabilities of SOFIA in the FIR are of utmost importance to
study the erratic growth of stars."
"As soon as a maser parallax for G358 becomes available, a
reanalysis should be performed to narrow down the uncertainties
of the derived parameters which will increase their credibility."

"Table A.1. MM3-SED. The fluxes at λ≥ 889 µm, are MM3-fluxes,
whereas the fluxes at λ≤ 24 µm are total fluxes. The contribution of
all the other sources, which are less evolved than MM3 at NIR wave-
lengths, can be neglected (as indicated in Fig. 5). For the fit of MM3 (see
Sec. 5.2.1), we use the total fluxes at short wavelengths. Only in the FIR
and (sub)mm regimes, where the contribution of the other sources is not
negligible, we use the MM3-fluxes. Facilities and instruments are given

"Fig. A.1. Model pool (in gray) showing all
SEDs, used to fit burst and post-burst epochs.
The observed fluxes from both epochs are plot-
ted in red (burst) and green (post-burst). They
are well covered by the model SEDs (except
for the burst data points at 163 and 186 µm, as
discussed when introducing the model pool in
Sec. 5.2.2). The dashed black line indicates the
mean model, as obtained from the pre-burst fit
alone. The NIR/MIR fluxes of that model have
been used to set a lower limit to the post-burst,
which was only observed in the red channel of
FIFI (at λ≥ 118 µm)."
"Fig. A.2. MM3 RT models illustrating con-
straints on the FIR emission. Filled circles in-
dicate measured fluxes. The model shown in
green is the best one (cf. Fig. 5). The best
fit with the (sub)mm fluxes (green) omitted is
shown in red. When also omitting the WISE
W4 and MIPS 24 µm measurements (yellow),
the best fit (blue) lies above the nominal one.
This confirms that the FIR emission of MM3
and, thus, its contribution to the total FIR
fluxes, is well constrained by the WISE, MIPS
and ALMA measurements."

"Table A.7. Optical depth in the V-band for the ten best MM1 pre-burst

ter. The intrinsic extinction dominates the total extinction (including the
interstellar extinction) by far, as indicated by the huge values in the V-

some models, τdisk almost covers the total extinction (along the line of
