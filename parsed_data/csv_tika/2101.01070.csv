"Abstract: We present a short review of possible applications of the Wheeler-De Witt equation to
cosmological models based on the low-energy string effective action, and characterised by an initial
regime of asymptotically flat, low energy, weak coupling evolution. Considering in particular a class of
duality-related (but classically disconnected) background solutions, we shall discuss the possibility of
quantum transitions between the phases of pre-big bang and post-big bang evolution. We will show that
it is possible, in such a context, to represent the birth of our Universe as a quantum process of tunneling
or “anti-tunneling” from an initial state asymptotically approaching the string perturbative vacuum."

1. Introduction
"In the standard cosmological context the Universe is expected to emerge from the big bang singularity
and to evolve initially through a phase of very high curvature and density, well inside the quantum gravity
regime. Quantum cosmology, in that context, turns out to be a quite appropriate formalism to describe the
“birth of our Universe”, possibly in a state approaching the de Sitter geometric configuration typical of
inflation (see, e.g., [1] for a review)."
"In the context of string cosmology, in contrast, there are scenarios where the Universe emerges from a
state satisfying the postulate of “asymptotic past triviality” [2] (see [3] for a recent discussion): in that case
the initial phase is classical, with a curvature and a density very small in string (or Planck) units. Even in
that case, however, the transition to the decelerated radiation-dominated evolution, typical of standard
cosmology, is expected to occur after crossing a regime of very high-curvature and strong coupling. The
birth of our Universe, regarded as the beginning of the standard cosmological state, corresponds in that
case to the transition (or “bounce”) from the phase of growing to decreasing curvature, and even in that
case can be described by using quantum cosmology methods, like for a Universe emerging from an initial
singularity."
"There is, however, a crucial difference between a quantum description of the “big bang” and of the
“big bounce”: indeed, the bounce is preceded by a long period of low-energy, classical evolution, while the
standard big bang picture implies that the space-time dynamics suddenly ends at the singularity, with no
classical description at previous epochs (actually, there are no “previous” epochs, as the time coordinate
itself ends at the singularity). In that context the initial state of the Universe is unknown, and has to be
fixed through some ad hoc prescription: hence, different choices for the initial boundary conditions are in
principle allowed [4–9], leading in general to different quantum pictures for the very early cosmological
evolution. Such an approach, based in particular on “no-boundary” initial conditions, has been recently
applied also to the ekpyrotic scenario [10], leading to the production of ekpyrotic instantons [11,12]. In
the class of string cosmology models considered in this paper, in contrast, the initial state is uniquely
determined by a fixed choice of pre-big bang (or pre-bounce) evolution (see, e.g., [13–17]), which starts
asymptotically from the string perturbative vacuum and which, in this way, unambiguously determines
the initial “wave function” of the Universe and the subsequent transition probabilities."
"In this paper we report the results of previous works, based on the study of the Wheeler–De Witt
(WDW) equation [18,19] in the “minisuperspace” associated with a class of cosmological backgrounds
compatible with the dynamics the low-energy string effective action [20–26]. It is possible, in such a context,
to obtain a non-vanishing transition probability between two different geometrical configurations—in
particular, from a pre-big bang to a post-big bang state—even if they are classically disconnected by a
space-time singularity. There is no need, to this purpose, of adding higher-order string-theory contributions
(like α′ and loop corrections) to the WDW equation, except those possibly encoded into an effective
(non-local) dilaton potential (but see [27,28] for high-curvature contributions to the WDW equation). It
will be shown, also, that there are no problems of operator ordering in the WDW equation, as the ordering
is automatically fixed by the duality symmetry of the effective action. Other possible problems—of
conceptual nature and typical of the WDW approach to quantum cosmology—however, remain, like
the the validity of a probabilistic interpretation of the wave function [29], the existence and the possible
meaning of a semiclassical limit [30], the unambiguous identification of a time-like coordinate in superspace
(see however [23], and see [31] for a recent discussion)."
"Let us stress that this review is dedicated in particular to string cosmology backgrounds of the
pre-big bang type, and limited to a class of spatially homogeneous geometries. It should be recalled,
however, that there are other important works in a quantum cosmology context which are also directly
(or indirectly) related to the string effective action, and which are applied to more general classes of"
"Version January 15, 2021 submitted to Universe 3 of 16"
"background geometries not necessarily characterised by spatial Abelian isometries, and not necessarily
emerging from the string vacuum."
"We should mention, in particular, the quantum cosmology results for the bosonic sector of the heterotic
string with Bianchi-type IX geometry [32] and Bianchi class A geometry [33]; solutions for the WDW
wave function with quadratic and cubic curvature corrections [34] (typical of f (R) models of gravity),
describing a phase of conventional inflation; two-dimensional models of dilaton quantum cosmology and
their supersymmetric extension [35]; WDW equation for a class of scalar-tensor theories of gravity with a
generalised form of scale-factor duality invariance [36,37]. We think that discussing those (and related)
works should deserve by itself a separate review paper."
"This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the explicit form of the WDW equation
following from the low-energy string effective action, for homogeneous backgrounds with d Abelian
spatial isometries, and show that it is free from operator-ordering ambiguities thanks to its intrinsic O(d, d)
symmetry. In Section 3, working in the simple two-dimensional minisuperspace associated with a class of
exact gravi-dilaton solutions of the string cosmology equations, we discuss the scattering of the WDW
wave function induced by the presence of a generic dilaton potential. In Section 4 we show that an
appropriate quantum reflection of the wave function can be physically interpreted as representing the birth
of our Universe as a process of tunnelling from the string perturbative vacuum. Similarly, in Section 5, we
show that the parametric amplification of the WDW wave function can describe the birth of our Universe
as a process of “anti-tunnelling” from the string perturbative vacuum. Section 6 is finally devoted to a few
conclusive remarks."
2. The Wheeler-De Witt equation for the low-energy string effective action
"In a quantum cosmology context the Universe is described by a wave function evolving in the
so-called superspace and governed by the WDW equation [18,19], in much the same way as in ordinary
quantum mechanics a particle is described by a wave function evolving in Hilbert space [38], governed by
the Schrodinger equation. Each point of superspace corresponds to a possible geometric configuration of
the space-like sections of our cosmological space-time, and the propagation of the WDW wave function
through this manifold describes the quantum dynamics of the cosmological geometry (thus providing, in
particular, the transition probabilities between different geometric states)."
"The WDW equation, which implements the Hamiltonian constraint H = 0 in the superspace of the
chosen cosmological scenario, has to be obtained, in our context, from the appropriate string effective
action. Let us consider, to this purpose, the low-energy, tree-level, (d + 1)-dimensional (super)string
effective action, which can be written as [39–41]"

"For an elementary discussion of this topic, and for the particular applications we have in mind –
namely, a quantum description of the “birth"" of our present cosmological state from the string perturbative
vacuum – we shall consider the homogeneous, isotropic and spatially flat class of (d + 1)-dimensional
backgrounds already introduced in the previous section, with Bµν = 0, g00 = 1 and scale factor a(t). We
shall thus work in a two-dimensional minisuperspace, spanned by the convenient coordinates (φ, β) where

"Let us now recall that, for V = 0, the equations following from the effective Lagrangian (3.1) admit a
class of exact solution describing four (physically different) cosmological phases, two expanding and two
contracting, parametrized by [13,15–17]:"

"They are defined on the disconnected time ranges [−∞, 0[ and ]0,+∞], and are related by duality
transformations a → a−1, φ → φ and time-reversal transformation, t → −t. They may represent
the four asymptotic branches of the low-energy string cosmology solutions even in the presence of a
non-vanishing dilaton potential, provided the effective contribution of the potential is localized in a region
of finite extension of the (φ, β) plane, and goes (rapidly enough) to zero as φ, β→ ±∞."

is characterized by growing curvature and growing dilaton [15,16] (namely, φ̇ > 0, Πφ < 0), while the
curvature and the dilaton are decreasing in the (expanding or contracting) post-big bang phase (where
φ̇ < 0, Πφ > 0), we can conclude, according to Eqs. (3.2), (3.6), that the classical solutions (3.7) of the string

a phase of expanding pre-big bang evolution, asymptotically emerging from the string perturbative
vacuum (identified with the limit β→ −∞, φ→ −∞). It follows that the initial state Ψin must represent a
configuration with β̇ > 0 and φ̇ > 0, namely a state with positive eigenvalue of Πβ and negative (opposite)
eigenvalue of Πφ, i.e. Ψin ∼ ψ"

In such a context, a quantum transition from the pre- to the post-big bang regime can be described as"
"a process of scattering of the initial wave function induced by the presence of some appropriate dilaton
potential, which we shall assume to have non-negligible dynamical effects only in a finite region localized
around the origin of the minusuperspace spanned by the (φ, β) coordinates. In other words, we shall
assume that the contributions of V(φ) to the WDW equation tend to disappear not only in the initial
but also in the final asymptotic regime where β → +∞, φ → +∞. As a consequence, also the final
asymptotic configuration Ψout, emerging from the scattering process, can be represented in terms of the
free momentum eigenstates ψ±"

"However, unlike the initial state fixed by the chosen boundary conditions – and selected to represent
a configuration with Πβ > 0 and Πφ < 0 – the final state is not constrained by such a restriction and can
describe in general different configurations. In particular, the scattering process may lead to configurations
asymptotically described by a wave function Ψout which is a superposition of different momentum
eigenstates: for instance, waves with the same Πβ > 0 and opposite values of Πφ, i.e. Ψout ∼ ψ"

illustrated in this figure."
"It may be interesting to note that those different configurations may be interpreted as different possible
“decay channels"" of the string perturbative vacuum [24]. Also, it should be stressed (as clearly illustrated in
Fig. 1) that one of the two components of the outgoing wave function Ψout must always correspond to the

"interpretations, also depending on the chosen identification of the time-like coordinate in minisuperspace
[23,25]: the β axis for the cases (a) and (d), the φ axis for the case (b) and (c)."
"It turns out that only the cases (a) and (c) of Fig. 1 represent a true process of reflection of the
incident wave along a spacelike coordinate (the axes φ and β, respectively). In case (a), in particular,
the evolution along β is monotonic, the Universe always keeps expanding, and the incident wave Ψin
is partially transmitted towards the pre-big bang singularity (with unbounded growth of the curvature"
"Version January 15, 2021 submitted to Universe 9 of 16"
"and of the dilaton, β→ +∞, φ→ +∞), and partially reflected back towards the expanding, low-energy,
post-big bang regime (β→ +∞, φ→ −∞). As we shall show in Sect. 4, this type of quantum reflection
can also be interpreted as a process of “tunnelling"" from the string perturbative vacuum."
"The cases (b) and (d) of Fig. 1 are qualitatively different, as the final state is a superposition of
modes of positive and negative frequency with respect to the chosen timelike coordinate (the axes φ
and β, respectively). Namely, Ψout is a superposition of positive and negative energy eigenstates, and
this represents a quantum process of “parametric amplification"" of the wave function [48,49] or, in the
language of third quantization [50–54] – i.e. second quantization of the WDW wave function – a process of
“Bogoliubov mixing"" of the energy modes (see e.g. [55,56]), associated with the production of “pairs of
universes"" from the vacuum. For that process, the mode “moving backwards"" with respect to the chosen
time coordinate has to be “reinterpreted"": as an anti-particle in the usual quantum field theory context, as
an “anti-universe"" in a quantum cosmology context."
"Such a re-interpretation principle produces, as usual, states of positive energy and opposite
momentum. It turns out, in particular, that the case (d) of Fig. 1 describes – after the correct re-interpretation
– the production of universe/anti-universe pairs in which both members of the pair have positive energy
and positive momentum along the β axis. Hence, they are both expanding: one falls inside the pre-big bang
singularity (φ → +∞), but the other expands towards the low-energy post-big bang regime (φ → −∞).
As we shall show in Sect. 5, this quantum effect of pair production can also be interpreted as a process of
“anti-tunnelling"" from the string perturbative vacuum."
4. Birth of the Universe as a tunnelling from the string perturbative vacuum
"To illustrate the process of quantum transition from the pre- to the post-big bang regime as a wave
reflection in superspace we shall consider here the simplest (almost trivial) case of constant dilaton
potential, V = V0 = const (see e.g. [20] for more general dynamical configurations). With this potential the

"defined respectively over the disconnected time ranges t < 0 and t > 0, and classically separated by a
singularity of the curvature and of the effective string coupling (exp φ) at t = 0. For t→ ±∞ they approach,
asymptotically, the free vacuum solution (3.7) obtained for V = 0. It is important to note, also, that each
branch of the above solution can describe either expanding or contracting geometric configurations, which

"It may be observed, finally, that an exponential dependence of the transition probability is also typical
of tunnelling processes (induced by the presence of a cosmological constant Λ) occurring in the context of
standard quantum cosmology, where the tunnelling probability can be estimated as [6,29,59,60]"

"(λP is the Planck length). That scenario is different because, in that case, the Universe emerges from the
quantum era in a classical inflationary configuration, while, in the string scenario, the Universe is expected
to exit (and not to enter) the phase of inflation thanks to quantum cosmology effects."
"In spite of such important differences, it turns out that the string cosmology result (4.9) is formally
very similar to the result concerning the probability that the birth of our Universe may be described as
a quantum process of “tunneling from nothing"" [6,29,59,60]. The explanation of this formal coincidence
is simple, and based on the fact that the choice of the string perturbative vacuum as initial boundary
condition implies – as previously stressed – that the are only outgoing (right-moving) waves approaching
the singularity at φ→ +∞. This is exactly equivalent to imposing tunneling boundary conditions, that
select “... only outgoing modes at the singular space-time boundary"" [29,60]. In this sense, the process illustrated
in this Section can also be interpreted as a tunneling process, not “from nothing"" but “from the string
perturbative vacuum""."
5. Birth of the Universe as anti-tunnelling from the string perturbative vacuum
"In this Section we shall illustrate the possible transition from the pre- to the post-big bang regime as a
process of parametric amplification of the WDW wave function, also equivalent – as previously stressed –
to a quantum process of pair production from the vacuum. We shall consider, in particular, an example in
which both the initial and final configurations are expanding, like in the case (d) of Fig. 1."
"What we need, to this purpose, is a WDW equation with the appropriate dilaton potential, able
to produce an outgoing configuration which is a superposition of states with positive and negative
eigenvalues of the momentum Πβ (see Fig. 1). Since we are starting from an initial expanding (pre-big
bang) regime, it follows that the contribution of the potential has to break the translational invariance
of the effective Hamiltonian (3.3) along the β axis (i.e. [Πβ, H] 6= 0), otherwise the final configuration
described in case (d) of Fig. 1 would be forbidden by momentum conservation."
"Version January 15, 2021 submitted to Universe 12 of 16"
"We shall work here with the simple two-loop dilaton potential already introduced in [26], possibly
induced by an effective cosmological constant Λ > 0, appropriately suppressed in the low-energy, classical
regime, and given explicitly by"
"V(β, φ) = Λ θ(−β) e2φ = Λ θ(−β) e2φ+2

"The Heaviside step function θ has been inserted to mimic an efficient damping of the potential outside the
interaction region (in particular, in the large radius limit β→ +∞ of the expanding post-bb configuration).
The explicit form and mechanism of the damping, however, is not at all a crucial ingredient of our
discussion, and other, different forms of damping would be equally appropriate."
"With the given potential (5.1) the effective Hamiltonian is no longer translational invariant along the
β direction, but we still have [Πφ, H] = 0, so that we can conveniently separate the variables in the WDW
equation (3.4) by factorizing the eigenstates (3.6) of the canonical momentum Πφ, and we are lead to"

"and the numerical coefficients A±(k) can be fixed by the two matching conditions imposing the continuity

"Let us now recall that the so-called Bogoliubov coefficients |c±(k)|2 = |A±(k)|2/|Nk|2, determining
the mixing of positive and negative energy modes in the asymptotic outgoing solution [55,56], also play
the role of destruction and creation operators in the context of the third quantization formalism [50–54],
thus controlling the “number of universes"" nk = |c−(k)|2 produced from the vacuum, for each mode
k. It turns out, in particular, that such a transition from the initial vacuum to the final standard regime,
represented as a quantum scattering of the initial wave function, is an efficient process only when the
final wave function is not damped but, on the contrary, turns out to be “parametrically amplified"" by the
interaction with the effective potential barrier [48,49]. This is indeed what happens for the solutions of"

"In order to illustrate this effect we have numerically integrated Eq. (5.2), with the boundary conditions

in superspace of the real part of the WDW wave function, for different values of k (the behavior of the
imaginary part is qualitatively similar). We have used units where λ2s Λ = 1, so that the effective potential
barrier of Eq. (5.2) is non-negligible only for very small (negative) values of β (the grey shaded region
of Fig. 2). Also, we have imposed on all modes the same formal normalization |Ψk|2 = 1 at β→ −∞, to
emphasize that the amplification is more effective at lower frequency."

"It implies that the birth of our present, expanding, post-big bang phase can be efficiently described as
a process of anti-tunnelling – or, in other words, as a forced production of pairs of universes – from the
string perturbative vacuum, in the following cases: initial configurations of small enough volume in string
units, and/or large enough coupling gs, and/or large enough cosmological constant in string units. Quite
similar conclusions were obtained also in the case discussed in the previous section."
"In view of the above results, we may conclude that, for an appropriate initial configuration, and if
triggered by the appropriate dilaton potential, the decay of the initial string perturbative vacuum can
efficiently proceed via parametric amplification of the WDW wave function in superspace, and can be
described as a forced production of pairs of universes from the quantum fluctuations. One member of
the pair disappears into the pre-big bang singularity, the other bounces back towards the low-energy
regime. The resulting effect is a net flux of universes that may escape to infinity in the post-big bang
regime (as qualitatively illustrated in Fig. 3), with a process which can describe the birth of our Universe
as “anti-tunnelling from the string perturbative vacuum""."

6. Conclusion
"The quantum cosmology scenarios reported in this review are based on the low-energy, tree-level
string effective action, which is physically appropriate to describe early enough and late enough
cosmological phases, approaching, respectively, the initial perturbative vacuum and the present
cosmological epoch."
"Such an action cannot used to classically describe the high-curvature, strong coupling regime without
the inclusion of higher-order corrections. However, when at least some of these corrections and of possible
non-perturbative effects are accounted for by an appropriate dilaton potential, the WDW equation obtained
from the low-energy action action permits a quantum analysis of the background evolution, and points
out new possible interesting ways for a Universe born from the string vacuum to reach more standard
configurations, and evolve towards the present cosmological regime. In such a context, the possible (future)
detection of a stochastic background of cosmic gravitons with the typical imprints of the pre-big bang
dynamics (see, e.g., [61]) might thus represent also an “indirect” indication that some quantum cosmology
mechanism has been effective to trigger the transition to the cosmological state in which we are living."
