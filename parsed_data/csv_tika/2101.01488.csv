"Abstract: The fundamental difference between accretion around black holes and neutron stars is the inner
boundary condition, which affects the behavior of matter very close to the compact objects. This leads to
formation of additional shocks and boundary layers for neutron stars. Previous studies on the formation
of such boundary layers focused on Keplerian flows that reached the surface of the star, either directly or
through the formation of a transition layer. However, behavior of sub-Keplerian matter near the surface
of a neutron star has not been studied in detail. Here, we study the effect of viscosity, in presence of
cooling, on the sub-Keplerian flows around neutron stars, using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. Our
time-dependent study shows that multiple shocks, transition and boundary layers form in such type of
accretion, when viscosity is significant, and one or more layers are absent when the viscosity is moderate.
These flows are particularly of interest for the wind dominated systems such as Cir X-1. We also report
the formation of a generalized flow configuration, Two-Component Advective Flow, for the first time."

1. INTRODUCTION
"The problem of accretion of rotating matter onto weakly
magnetic neutron stars can be divided into three broad
approaches. In Titarchuk, Lapidus and Muslimov
(1998), the formation of a transition layer around a
neutron star was studied in detail. The authors showed
that if matter has to reach the star from a Keplerian
disk, it has to match the angular velocity of the star at
the inner boundary. As the rotation of the star is al-
ways sub-Keplerian in nature, it meant that a Keplerian
to sub-Keplerian ‘transition’ layer is formed to accom-
modate that effect, in the presence of viscosity. Study
of spreading boundary layers on the surface assumed
that the flow remains Keplerian till it reaches the sur-
face and undergoes readjustment on the surface itself
through a thin boundary layer (Inogamov and Sunyaev
1999). Both approaches provide valuable insight onto
Keplerian to sub-Keplerian angular momentum transi-
tions at or near the surface, but assume that the inflow
is Keplerian to begin with, which is still used in re-
cent studies of spreading layers (Abolmasov, Nättilä,
& Poutanen 2020). The third approach allows read-
justment of the angular momentum of the flow and the
spin of star at the surface of the star in the accretion
phase, but also assumes the inflow to be a Keplerian
disk (Bhattacharyya and Chakrabarty 2017). In this
paper, we look into the common assumption of all three
above-mentioned approaches, i.e. a Keplerian inflow,
and change it by starting with sub-Keplerian flows. For
such flows with small but non-zero angular momenta,
in presence of cooling, we study the effect of viscos-
ity in the creation of different types of disks, transition
and boundary layers. In Bhattacharjee & Chakrabarti"

"2019 (hereafter Paper I), the study of accretion flows
around weakly magnetic neutron stars is divided into
two broad classes: 1. The flow is inviscid, advective
and has a low efficiency of radiation. It also comprises
of winds from the companion star. 2. The flow has
a significant viscosity to redistribute the specific angu-
lar momenta. The authors discussed the Class 1 flows
in Paper I, i.e., the effects of angular momentum of
a sub-Keplerian flow in absence of significant dynamic
viscosity. The less-explored domain of sub-Eddington,
inviscid accretion around neutron stars (NSs) was stud-
ied in detail using hydrodynamic simulations. Paper
I also argues why a Two-Component Advective Flow
or TCAF (Chakrabarti 1995, 1997; Chakrabarti and
Titarchuk 1995) solution is most likely the generalized
solution for accreting matter around a weakly mag-
netic neutron star as well. For a detailed review of
the studies, refer to Bhattacharjee 2018, and the refer-
ences of Paper I. The TCAF solution has been proved
to be a stable configuration through numerical simula-
tions (Giri and Chakrabarti 2013) and have been used
to explain the spectral and timing properties of stellar
mass black holes in a self-consistent manner for multi-
ple sources (Debnath et al. 2014, Bhattacharjee et al.
2017, Banerjee et al. 2019, Banerjee et al. 2020). The
paradigm can also be applied to NSs with some modi-
fications (Bhattacharjee & Chakrabarti 2017, hereafter
BC17; Bhattacharjee and Chakrabarti 2020). For invis-
cid flows with sub-Keplerian angular momentum, two
axi-symmetric shocks are present in an accretion flow.
The outer shock is the so-called CENtrifugal pressure
dominated BOundary Layer or CENBOL (Chakrabarti
1995, 1997) and the inner one is the Normal BOundary
Layer (NBOL; BC17, Chakrabarti 2017, Bhattacharjee
2018, Paper I). In the present paper, we focus on the"

"effects of the introduction of viscosity and its gradual
enhancement on the flow configuration from a theoret-
ical point-of-view."
2. METHOD
"The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method
was introduced by Monaghan (1992). We use the
SPH code used in Paper I (based on the original
code of Molteni, Sponholtz and Chakrabarti 1996) to
solve for the conservation of mass, momentum and en-
ergy. All the equations, notations and boundary con-
ditions (inner and outer) are kept the same. We add
the α-viscosity prescription for the system following
Lanzafame, Molteni and Chakrabarti (1998; hereafter,
LMC98), which modifies the following."

Equations 1 and 2 are identical to the Eq. 15 and 6 of
Paper I, apart from the last terms which introduce the
viscous effects in the flow (in Paper I, µ was 0). The
flow was injected from rinj = 30rS with v = 0.1211,
a = 0.0590 and λinj = 1.7 (similar to case C2 of Paper
I)."
3. RESULTS
3.1. Formation of Boundary and Transition Layers
"We increased the viscosity parameter from 0.075 (C1) to
0.15 (C2) to 0.3 (C3) and kept injected λinj = 1.7 (see,
Table 1). We also define the RAdiative KEplerian Disk
as the equivalent of a standard Keplerian Disk following
the prescription of Chakrabarti & Sahu 1997 (hereafter,
CS97), when the effect of the radiative pressure term
due to the emission from NBOL is included. If the
average repulsive radiative force is Frad ="
"<C>
2(R−1)2"
", then"
"the effective gravitational force reduces to Fg =
1−<C>
2(R−1)2"
"(CS97, Paper I).
Case C1: In presence of lower viscosity (α ="
"0.075), the sub-Keplerian flow adjusted its angular mo-
mentum very close to RNS . The layer where most of
this transition took place was the previously identified
NBOL. In a very small region (5 − 7 rS), a RAdiative
KEplerian Disk (RAKED) appears and disappears from
time to time. Figure 4 shows one such instance when
the RAKED is formed. Rest of the outer flow remained"
"sub-Keplerian in nature. This is similar to the cases re-
ported in Paper I. We also see that the turbulent nature
of the inner flow, which shows multiple bending insta-
bilities, is very similar to the cases reported in Paper
I. Furthermore, matter is ejected from both CENBOL
and NBOL in the upper quadrant and only from CEN-
BOL in the lower quadrant. The outflowing matter
from NBOL undergoes multiple shock transitions (one
before merging with CENBOL-outflow, one after), be-
fore becoming transonic near the outer edge. A part
of the ejected matter falls back to CENBOL and an-
other part is accreted onto the NS through more radial
shocks. This fallback onto the star is primarily achieved
due to the lowered angular momentum near the surface."

number in the colour bar, for the flow configuration C1 at time
t = 0.2800s and (b) corresponding contours of constant Mach
number range showing the outer and inner shocks."
"Case C2: When the viscosity parameter is in-
creased from 0.075 to 0.15, the size of the NBOL is
increased from ∼ 2rS to ∼ 5.5rS . The size of RAKED
is also increased from ∼ 2.5rS in C1 to ∼ 3.5rS here,
though it has relatively weaker oscillations. The outer
part of the flow remained sub-Keplerian throughout the
simulation. This case is of particular interest as all the
layers are present simultaneously. When the velocity
vectors and Mach numbers are compared with those in
C1, we notice that the flow has become more stable due
to introduction of viscosity and consequent decrease of
specific angular momentum in the inner regions. The
outer shock is moved at a larger distance from the star
boundary. The NBOL did not eject any matter due to
the lack of centrifugal drive by low angular momentum
and only the CENBOL ejected matter. A part of the
outflowing matter is seen to move towards the NS sur-
face transonically. The flow interacts with a larger area
on the NS surface due to the further reduction of angu-
lar momentum near the star. The inner shock location
moves closer to the NS and is narrower."
"Case C3: Further increase of viscosity parame-
ter from 0.15 to 0.3 leads to increase of NBOL size to
∼ 11.5rS. Furthermore, the RAKED kept growing in
size as its outer boundary started to increase with in-
creasing time. The inner edge of RAKED (outer edge
of NBOL) remained fairly constant. We also show the"

is ejected in both quadrants from CENBOL. NBOL is
almost symmetric about z = 0 and did not produce any

3.2. Formation of Two-Component Advective Flows
"We introduce a vertical variation in the viscosity pa-
rameter α ∼ α0exp(−|z|), where α0 = 0.3. This en-
sures that the viscosity is highest at the equatorial plane
and sharply falls off with distance from the equatorial
plane. When such a differential viscosity is introduced,
a viscous disk appears to form on the equatorial plane
and the matter away from it continues to advect with
sub-Keplerian angular momentum. In Fig. 5(b), the
contours show the formation of outer shock near 20 rS
on both quadrants. The inflow undergoes another set
of shocks near the surface of the star between 3− 5 rS .
The region along the equatorial plane has low mach
number (0.3 − 0.6) and interacts with the outer shock.
Near the inner region, both flows undergo some mixing,
which leads to a fluctuation in the angular momentum
distribution as seen in Fig. 5(a)."

4. CONCLUSIONS
"In this paper, we report the formation of a normal
boundary layer and a radiative Keplerian disk out of a
sub-Keplerian injected flow around a weakly magnetic
neutron star. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed
study of viscous flows around a weakly magnetized neu-
tron star. We carried out a qualitative study of the
behaviour of three regions formed in the inflowing mat-
ter as the flow viscosity is gradually increased. When
viscosity is low, resembling an inviscid flow, matter ad-
justs its angular momenta only very close to the NS
surface and forms the NBOL out of the sub-Keplerian
flow. RAKED is transient in nature for these cases. We
believe this happens in HMXBs, such as, Cir X-1. We
notice that two regions, one on the inner edge of CEN-
BOL and the other near NBOL, eject matter along the
z-direction. A part of these two matter merge and a
part actually falls back to these regions. For higher vis-
cosity, the RAKED is formed in between NBOL and
the sub-Keplerian flow. Here, the RAKED is small and
steadily oscillate. These would be the most general type
of inflow in presence of viscosity. We also notice that
the redistribution of angular momentum helps in eject-
ing more matter out of the equatorial plane, even more
compared to inviscid cases. For even higher viscosity, a
clear RAKED is formed and increased in size towards
larger radial distance. This suggests that these cases are
possible in the super-critical range of viscosity. Within
25 dynamical timescales at 30rS , the RAKED reached
the outer edge. The redistributed angular momentum
also leads to an even higher ejection of matter from the
disk. The added viscosity appears to make the flow
more stable and the vertical oscillations become negli-
gible. The NBOL in Case C3 is equivalent of the transi-
tion layer of Titarchuk, Lapidus and Muslimov (1998).
However, our simulations generate the Keplerian disk
self-consistently, compared to their cases where it was
assumed to be Keplerian. In addition to that, we find
sub-Keplerian to sub-Keplerian transition layers in Case
C2, which was not reported before. Case C1 is a equiva-
lent to the spreading boundary layer as the layer is very
thin and close to the surface. Here, too, the assumption
of Keplerian disk was not used by us and thus our sim-
ulations present a more generalized solution. We also
find that due to the high density of matter near the sur-
face, the inflow is more likely to form the NBOL type
layer first, before a disk can be formed near the sur-
face. This also connects all the three approaches by the
variation of viscosity in the flow. When a differential
viscosity is introduced through a Z-gradient, the equa-
torial region with high viscosity forms a disk and the
region away from it, maintains sub-Keplerian angular
momentum in the inflow. This leads to the formation
of a TCAF geometry."
