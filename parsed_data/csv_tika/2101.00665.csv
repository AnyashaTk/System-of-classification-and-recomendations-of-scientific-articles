condition. In the case of the slow-roll models with scalar potential, we shall calculate the slow-roll
indices, and the corresponding observational indices of the theory, and we demonstrate that the
resulting theory is compatible with the latest Planck data. The same results are obtained in the
constant-roll case, at least in the presence of a scalar potential. In the case that models without
potential are considered, the results are less appealing since these are strongly model dependent,
and at least for a power-law choice of the non-minimal coupling, the theory is non-viable. Finally,
due to the fact that the scalar and tensor power spectra are conformal invariant quantities, we argue
that the Einstein frame counterpart of the non-minimal k-inflation models with scalar potential, can
be a viable theory, due to the conformal invariance of the observational indices. The Einstein frame
theory is more involved and thus more difficult to work with it analytically, so one implication of
our work is that we provide evidence for the viability of another class of k-inflation models."

I. INTRODUCTION
"The striking GW170817 event [1] in 2017 verified in a direct way the propagation of astrophysical gravitational waves
emitted from the merging of compact astrophysical objects. Apart from generating a new scientific direction in modern
astrophysics, that of gravitational wave astronomy, the GW170817 event had significant theoretical implications in
the field of astrophysics and cosmology, due to the fact that it imposed serious restrictions on several modified gravity
theoretical frameworks. Particularly, the most striking result from a theoretical point of view was the fact that the
gravitational waves and the gamma rays emitted from the merging of the two neutron stars arrived simultaneously,
so this result ruled out many theories of Horndeski type, see Ref. [2] for an extensive analysis along this research line.
However, there are still many modified gravity theories which still yield a gravitational wave speed c2T = 1 in natural"
"units, such as f(R) gravity, f(G) Gauss-Bonnet theories and so on. For an extensive account on modified gravity
theories, we refer the reader to Refs. [3–9]. In addition, modified gravity theories can actually provide a theoretical
framework that makes possible the description and in some cases the unification of the two acceleration eras of our
Universe, such as f(R) gravity for example. The modification of Einstein-Hilbert gravity seems compelling, at least
when cosmological scales are considered. In fact, although Einstein-Hilbert gravity seems to describe accurately to a
great extent the current perception of astrophysical scales physics, it seems that at large scales needs to be modified.
Indeed, the dark energy era in the context of simple Einstein-Hilbert gravity requires the introduction of phantom
scalar fields, and exotic phenomena follow, such us the existence of late-time finite time singularities. In the context of
modified gravity, the inflationary era and the late-time acceleration era can be harbored under the unified framework
of a single theory [10].
One class of the remaining viable gravitational theories after the GW170817 event, is the k-inflation class of theories,"
"see Refs. [11–32] for an important stream of research articles. Also it is notable that k-inflation models can be related
to certain classes of Palatini f(R) gravity, see for example [33]. These k-inflation theories can actually describe both
the inflationary era, and also the late-time acceleration era, and are also known as k-essence theories. In this paper we
shall focus on the inflationary phenomenology of a modified version of k-inflation theories, for which we shall assume
that a non-minimal coupling between the scalar curvature and the scalar field exists, at least in most of the cases.
We shall also examine the above theories in the presence of a scalar potential and in the absence of a scalar potential,
and more importantly, we shall assume that the standard kinetic term of the scalar field is absent, and only higher"

"µφ are present in the Lagrangian. We shall perform an extensive phenomenological analysis
of the various models, and we shall confront each of them with the observational data coming from the 2018 Planck
collaboration [34]. For the models we shall study, either the slow-roll or the constant-roll condition will be assumed.
The slow-roll condition is needed in order to provide a sufficiently long inflationary era in order to solve the standard
inflation phenomenological problems [35–38], while the constant-roll is a relatively new phenomenological condition
in inflationary cosmology, and it is appealing since it may generate non-Gaussianities in the power spectrum of even
scalar theories of gravity, see Refs. [39–75] for an important stream of papers in the subject.
The results of our analysis can be deemed interesting since we found that the non-minimally coupled k-inflation"
"theories without potential can be viable for both the constant and the slow-roll conditions holding true, and for various
forms of the potential and the non-minimal coupling function chosen. Also in the potential-less case, we demonstrate
that the power-law non-minimal couplings are phenomenologically excluded, at least when quadratic order kinetic
terms are considered in the Lagrangian. Finally, we demonstrate that the non-minimally coupled theories with
potential are conformally transformed to k-inflation theories with the presence of a canonical scalar kinetic term, and
also with potential. Due to the fact that the power spectrum of the scalar and of the tensor perturbations is invariant
under a conformal transformation, we immediately have a direct connection of the two theories, thus the conformally
transformed theory can also, in principle, be viable."

values of the wave speed c2A, for the values of the free parameters which guarantee the phenomenological viability of
the theory in each case."

"parameter space indicates that the phenomenological viability of the model is easily achieved. Indeed, a viable
phenomenology is obtained for (N,Λ, ξ, c1,m, n) = (60, 2× 10−7, 0.14, 1020, 30.1, 10−5), for which we have,"
"ns = 0.966682, r = 0.0573751 , (36)"

c1 we obtain complex values for the observational indices, so only positive values of c1 are allowed. In addition, c1
must take larger values in reduced Planck units, since smaller values do not produce a viable phenomenology, plus
the approximations we did do not hold true for small values of c1. This is the only constraint we found for the model
at hand, since the interplay of the (Λ, ξ) and (m,n) values always produces a viable phenomenology, provided that
c1 takes large values. Another interesting feature of the model is that for the values of the free parameters for which
the phenomenological viability of the model is ensured, the slow-roll indices also respect the slow-roll condition, so
these are well below unity, and recall that these are evaluated at the first horizon crossing. For example if we choose
(N,Λ, ξ, c1,m, n) = (60, 2 × 10−7, 0.14, 1020, 30.1, 10−5) we get |ǫ1| = 0.00826076 which is too small, so the slow-roll
assumption indeed holds true during the horizon crossing. The viability of the model can be obtained for a wide
range of the free parameters. For example in Fig. 1 we present the contour plot of the spectral index and for the
tensor-to-scalar ratio for the range of values ns = [0.9635, 0.968] and r = 0.055, as functions of m and n, with the

where the curves meet indicate the values of (m,n) for which the simultaneous compatibility of the observational

non-minimally coupled scalar field to gravity, and with only the higher order kinetic term appearing in the Lagrangian.

results. In fact, the spectral index can be compatible with the Planck data, however the tensor-to-scalar ratio is
always extremely higher than the allowed observational data. However, the wave speed is always nearly equal to
unity, for all the values of the free parameters that yield sensible results (non-imaginary values). Therefore, we may
claim even from now that the power-law model without scalar potential is not so appealing.
We need to note that in the literature an interesting class of models is studied [32], in which case a scalar potential"
"and only a higher kinetic term is included in the Lagrangian, without a canonical kinetic term. These theories can
be viable, and in contrast, the non-minimally coupled theory with only a higher kinetic term is not viable, at least
when the non-minimally coupled function is a power-law type. Perhaps including higher order kinetic terms, higher
than the quadratic which we studied, may resolve this issue, but we leave this to the reader, since it is a repetition
of the method we provided above, and the result is highly model dependent, with the dependence quantified in the
choice of the coupling function to the curvature scalar h(φ)."
D. Conformally Transformed Models with Scalar Potential and Implications
"The viability of the models with scalar potential of the form (12) has a direct implication for minimally coupled
k-inflation models with non-trivial higher-order kinetic terms, with scalar potential, due to the fact that these two
theories are related via a conformal transformation. From a phenomenological point of view, the power spectrum
of the primordial scalar curvature perturbations and the power spectrum of the tensor perturbations are conformal
invariant quantities, so the spectral index of the primordial curvature perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio for
the two theories are expected to be the same in principle, although deviations from this rule are presented in the
literature, mainly related to the slow-roll condition [80–82]. Let us consider the action of the non-minimally coupled
k-inflation theory with scalar potential corresponding to Eq. (12), which is,"
"d4x

"and let us perform a conformal transformation of the metric, which has the following form,"
"gµν = Ω

"where Ω(xµ) is a differentiable function of the spacetime coordinates, and the “tilde” metric denotes the conformally

"We introduce the notation,"

"and therefore we have, f̃µ = g̃µνfν . Using the conformal transformation rules and the notation (60), the Ricci scalar

"R = Ω2

"Without loss of generality, since Ω is arbitrary, we can choose,"

"The above action can easily be transformed to an Einstein frame scalar k-inflation theory with canonical kinetic term,
by appropriately redefining the scalar field. Thus, due to the conformal relation between the actions (57) and (70),
and owing to the fact that both the scalar and tensor power spectrum is conformal invariant, the two theories can
produce similar phenomenology. This fact indicates that the model (70) with µ = 2 can be a viable model, and we can
conclude this without performing the actual calculations, which would be more tedious in comparison to the model
(57). Similar results can hold true for general µ but we do not present here for brevity."
III. CONCLUSIONS
"In this paper we studied in depth several k-inflation models with non-minimal coupling of the scalar field to the
scalar curvature. We mainly focused on models that lack of a canonical kinetic term for the scalar field, in the
presence and the absence of a scalar potential, and we studied two cases with regard to the evolution of the scalar
field, the slow-roll and the constant-roll case. In the presence of a scalar potential, and with the higher order kinetic
term being of the form ∼ c1X2, when the slow-roll conditions are assumed for the scalar field, we demonstrated
that a phenomenologically viable theory can be obtained. Particularly, we calculated the slow-roll indices and the
observational indices and we showed that the results can be compatible with the latest Planck constraints. This
result is of course model dependent, but it is quite general since it can hold true for several choices of the potential
and the non-minimal coupling function h(φ). Also the sound speed of the model never exceeds unity for a wide
range of the free parameters of the model, therefore no superluminal propagation occurs, and also it is positive and
hence no instabilities occur. Similar results are obtained when the constant-roll condition is assumed for the model.
In the case that the scalar potential is absent, the power-law model is not viable, however the results are model
dependent, and perhaps the inclusion of higher order kinetic terms may render the model phenomenologically viable.
Finally, we performed a conformal transformation of the non-minimally coupled k-inflation theory with potential, and
the resulting Einstein frame theory contains a scalar potential, the higher-order kinetic term and an ordinary scalar
kinetic term. Due to the conformal invariance of both the scalar and tensor power spectra, we argued that the resulting
Einstein frame can also be viable and compatible with the observational data. The latter theory is quite more involved
to handle analytically, thus by studying the non-minimally coupled model, one may obtain several phenomenological"
"conclusions for the Einstein frame theory. Nevertheless, the most correct way to prove the equivalence is to calculate
the observational indices, using the slow-roll or the constant-roll condition, due to the fact that the very slow-roll
condition may obscure the equivalence of the two theories, see for example [80–82]. This task is not easy in general
though, but we hope to address it in a forthcoming work."
