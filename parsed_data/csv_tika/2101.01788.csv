ABSTRACT
We present here a detailed calculation of opacities for Fe XVII at the physical conditions corresponding to the base of the
Solar convection zone. Many ingredients are involved in the calculation of opacities. We review the impact of each ingredient
on the final monochromatic and mean opacities (Rosseland and Planck). The necessary atomic data were calculated with the
"'-matrix and the distorted-wave (DW) methods. We study the effect of broadening, of resolution, of the extent of configuration"
sets and of configuration interaction to understand the differences between several theoretical predictions as well as the existing
"large disagreement with measurements. New Dirac '-matrix calculations including all configurations up to the = = 4, 5 and"
6 complexes have been performed as well as corresponding Breit–Pauli DW calculations. The DW calculations have been
extended to include autoionizing initial levels. A quantitative contrast is made between comparable DW and '-matrix models.
We have reached self-convergencewith = = 6 '-matrix and DW calculations. Populations in autoionizing initial levels contribute
significantly to the opacities and should not be neglected. The '-matrix and DW results are consistent under the similar treatment
of resonance broadening. The comparison with the experiment shows a persistent difference in the continuum while the filling
of the windows shows some improvement. The present study defines our path to the next generation of opacities and opacity
tables for stellar modeling.

1 INTRODUCTION
Opacities are key ingredients in any domain where radiative trans-
"fer is important. More specifically, Rosseland mean opacities play"
an essential role in stellar modelling. They characterize the inter-
action between the photons produced in the centre of stars and
the surrounding plasma up to the surface of the stars. Two of
the main historical providers of such quantities for stellar model-
ing are Forrest Rogers and Carlos Iglesias at the Lawrence Liv-
ermore National Laboratory (LLNL) (project referred to as OPAL
"Rogers and Iglesias (1992)) and the Opacity Project (OP, (Seaton"
1987)). Despite the fact that these two independent projects are
"based on largely different physical frameworks, the agreement be-"
tween the OPAL (Rogers and Iglesias 1992) and the upgraded OP
"opacities ((Badnell et al. 2005), hereafter OP2005) remains satis-"
factory for solar interior conditions and they both originally ac-
curately reproduced the helioseismic measurements. Those two
datasets are widely used and they are references in stellar as-
"trophysics (OPAL: https://opalopacity.llnl.gov/, OP: http://opacity-"
"cs.obspm.fr/opacity/index.html, Delahaye et al. (2016)) . The good"
agreement between OPAL and OP is corroborated by more re-
cent efforts such as OPAS from the CEA ((Blancard et al. 2012);
(Mondet et al. 2015)) and LEDCOP (now ATOMIC) from the Los

"However, a revision of the Solar composition, by Asplund and col-"
"laborators ((Asplund et al. 2004, 2005, 2009)) resulted in a reduction"
"of the content of C, N, O and Ne by 30− 40%. This has significantly"
degraded the much coveted agreement between stellar theory and he-
"lioseismic measurements. For around 15 years, in an effort to solve"
"this Solar abundance problem, atomic theorists and experimental-"
ists have been working hard to improve the quality of the opacities.
"Meanwhile, a new discrepancy appeared in 2015 with the measure-"
ment at Sandia National Laboratory of the Fe opacity at 180 eV and
"#4 = 3.1×10

"ing to the base of the Solar convection zone: )4 ≈ 2.15 × 10
6 K and"
"#4 ≈ 3.1 × 10
22 cm−3. Indeed, while all the theoretical calculations"
"agree reasonably well, the experiment measured an opacity a factor"
of 2 higher than all calculations and exhibits large differences (filled
"windows, higher continuum) at certain photon energies (Bailey et al."
2015; Nagayama et al. 2019).
In order to shed light on this long standing problem of the So-
"lar abundances and opacities, a detailed study of each component"
contributing to the determination of the opacity is required. Such a
comparison is complex as each different step and input choice affects
"the final results in many, and quite often correlated, ways. Our goal"
is to quantify these effects by comparing the two main approaches
(distorted-wave (DW) and '-matrix) employed by the theoretical
"groups who calculate fundamental atomic rates, as well as all the"

"secondary derived values of the calculations such as populations,"
"broadening, convergence and resolution."
In the following two sections we summarize the '-matrix and DW
methods and we provide detailed descriptions of the Fe XVII models
used. In Section 4 we present the results for Fe XVII opacities and
"comment on the effect of broadening, the convergence configuration"
"expansions in both the initial and final levels of photo-absorption,"
etc. We provide a summary and our conclusions in the last section.
2 METHODS:R-MATRIX-DARC
The parallel version of the DARC (Dirac Atomic '-matrix Codes)
Norrington and Grant (1987); Ballance and Griffin (2006) was em-
ployed to calculate the photo-absorption cross-sections from several
hundred initial states of Fe XVII to provide the bound-bound and
"bound-free components of a Rosseland mean opacity, subsequently"
calculated with the Opacity Project suite of codes. Three models were
employed to quantify the self-consistent convergence of opacities
within the '-matrix theory before comparison with distorted-wave
calculations.
"Usually, '-matrix photoionization calculations are initiated by"
generating a set of orbitals optimised on the levels of the residual
(F-like Fe) ion. To achieve this we employed a modified version of
the GRASP0 code Grant et al. (1980) that implements the Multi-
Configuration-Dirac-Fock (MCDF) method to provide the orbital
"radial wavefunctions upon a numerical grid, that may be subsequently"
employed by the following DARC calculation. Our initial calculation
(Model A) includes the 2B2?5=; and 2B22?4=; configurations in
"which =; = 2?, 3B, 3?, 33, 4B, 4?, 43, 4 5 . Model B extends Model A"
"to =; = 5B, 5?, 53, 5 5 , 56. Model C further extends Model B by the"
"inclusion of additional =; = 6B, 6?, 63, 6 5 , 66 orbitals."
The transition from Model B to Model C increases the number of
levels included in the close-coupling expansion from 407 levels to
638 levels. This also expands the '-matrix box from 4.2 Bohr radii
"(Model B) to 7.2 Bohr radii (Model C). Theoretically, these changes"
"seem minimal, but they lead to an increase in the Hamiltonian size"
"from approximately 75,000 × 75,000 to matrices close to 100,000 ×"
"100,000, with an associated #3 scaling in the computational effort"
when diagonalising the Hamiltonian for the initial and final state
eigenvectors. The '-matrix method inherently includes all the Ryd-
berg series attached to every target state of the residual ion which is
dependent on the resolution of the energy mesh employed.
The parallel treatment of the outer region benefits from GPU
(Graphical Processing Units) enabled codes for determining initial
boundstate levels and for the bound-free photo-absorption. For Model
"B, all the initial states (up to = = 5) are truly bound whereas for"
Model C some high lying (= = 6) initial states associated the the
2B2?6 core are above the Fe XVII ionization limit. Without the GPU
"enabled codes, it would be difficult to achieve the energy resolution"
described in the following sections within a feasible time. Model C
"has several hundred initial states, each with a fine resolution, and"
post-processing by the opacity codes requires significant amounts of
3 METHODS: AUTOSTRUCTURE (DISTORTED-WAVE)
We use the program AUTOSTRUCTURE (AS) (Badnell 2011)
within a perturbative DW approximation to calculate the required
photoabsorption data in a multi-configuration intermediate coupling
Breit—Pauli model. Photoabsorption which leads to the direct ejec-
tion of an electron into the continuum (photoionization) is calculated
independently of photoexcitation to another discrete atomic state.
This final discrete state may be truly bound or lie above the ioniza-
tion limit. We calculate the Auger width as well for the latter case.
The total width of the upper state is then an independent sum of the
"natural (radiative) width, the Auger width, and the collisional broad-"
ening width. See Badnell and Seaton (2003) for details. This enables
us to make detailed comparisons with '-matrix results which are in-
trinsically Auger-broadened. The multireference (MR) configuration
sets for the Fe 16+ photon target and the Fe 17+ residual ion (electron
target) are simple to list in terms of promotion rules. (The 1B2 is kept
closed through-out and so is omitted in the following descriptions.)
We consider first (MR1)
Fe16+: 2B22?6
and we allowed for single and double electron promotions (of 2B and
2?) up to some = = =max.
"Fe17+: 2B22?5, 2B2?6"
where we allowed for single = = 2 electron promotions up to the
same value of =max.
Due to differences in the structure of the F-like electron target
"and corresponding Ne-like photon target used by DW and '-matrix,"
the number of true bound levels differs even when the exact same
configuration expansions are used.
The contribution from = > =max is determined by extrapolation of
the = = =max photoionization data to higher =. The extrapolated con-
tribution to photoexcitation is determined by extrapolating threshold
or edge photoionization data (including the newly extrapolated) down
below threshold. We allow for configuration mixing between all con-
figurations within an ionization stage. This is in contrast with the
updated Opacity Project work which restricted the mixing to within
the = = 2 core complex. We calculated photoabsorption data for all
possible initial Boltzmann populated levels arising from this MR1
set. This includes autoionizing levels. This is in contrast with the
updated Opacity Project work which restricted the initial levels of
the AS calculation to true bound so as to match with those of the
original Opacity Project '-matrix calculations.
We note that the above MR1 set has at most two L-shell vacancies
in the final state. We considered also a supplementary MR2 set:
"Fe16+: 2B22?43B2 , 2B2?53B2 , 2?63B2"
and we allowed for single and double electron promotions from 3B2
"as well as, for PE only, single promotions from 2B & 2?, up to =max."
"Fe17+: 2B22?33B2 , 2B2?43B2 , 2?53B2"
where we allowed for single and double electron promotions from
"3B2 up to the same value of =max, for PI only. We did not calculate"
Auger widths in this instance since we were not comparing this
data with '-matrix and collisional broadening dominates over the
Auger width in general. This MR2 set enables us to determine the
inner-shell contribution to opacity from two- to three-L-shell vacancy
transitions. We constrain it to give only this contribution so that it
can be added to that from MR1. We denote the combined dataset
MR1+MR2.
"Given the above set-up, all required energy levels, radiative and"
"autoionization rates, and photoionization cross sections were cal-"
culated using the AUTOSTRUCTURE code (Badnell 2011) in the
manner described by Badnell and Seaton (2003). We carried-out cal-
culations for =max = 5 and =max = 6 so as to test the convergence of
the extrapolations. From here-on we drop the subscript and just refer
"to these calculations as = = 5 and = = 6, along with the MR set MR1"
and/or MR2 as necessary.

'-matrix and DW opacities for Fe XVII 3
4 OPACITIES
The calculation of opacities requires several steps. It is necessary i)
to determine the ionic state of the absorbing medium as well as the
"population of the atomic levels of its constituents, ii) to calculate"
"the absorbing coefficients for different processes (photo-excitation,"
"photoionization), and iii) to include plasma effects (the ions cannot"
"be considered as isolated). Such calculations, despite the computer"
"power available today, still require approximations and compromises."
Accuracy versus completeness is still at play nowadays as it was 30
"years ago: the atomic systems considered may be much larger, but"
"they cannot be infinite. Several groups (LLNL-OPAL, CEA-OPAS,"
"LANL-ATOMIC, The Opacity Project) are involved in such calcula-"
"tions, using their own methods and recipes at each step. Nonetheless,"
the various modern Rosseland mean opacities for a solar mixture at
"the conditions found in the Sun agree to within 4%. However, when"
"we compare the monochromatic opacities for individual elements,"
the differences are much larger. The mixture and the averaging over
the frequencies introduce some cancellation effects. Detailed com-
parisons are thus required for a single element at different conditions
in order to disentangle the different effects from the different ingre-
"dients, and more importantly to characterize the signature of each"
approximation on the final results. While comparisons with the few
"available experiments appear necessary, a word of caution is rele-"
"vant here: in such comparisons, experimental uncertainties must be"
clearly stated.
In the present section we consider all the different stages of an
opacity calculation and try to identify the uncertainties and their
impact on the final result. We first consider the '-matrix calcula-
tion of the photoionization cross sections and transitions probabili-
"ties, looking at the effect of the configuration expansion, resolution"
and extrapolation. Then we present the results for the DW approach
and compare them with the '-matrix ones. All the calculations are
"level-resolved. Finally, we compare the present results with other"
"models OP2005 (Badnell et al. 2005), SNAKP (Nahar and Pradhan"
2016a; Pradhan and Nahar 2018) and OPAS (Blancard et al. 2012)
and SCRAM (Hansen et al. 2007) as well as with the experimen-
tal results from SANDIA (Bailey et al. 2015; Nagayama et al. 2019).
All the opacity results presented here are for the physical conditions
"corresponding to those in the SANDIA experiment ()4 = 2.1×10
6 K"
"and #4 = 3.1 × 10
22 cm−3)."
4.1 R-matrix results
"4.1.1 Convergence: Model A (= = 4), Model B (= = 5) and Model C"
(= = 6)
One of the problems in opacity calculations comes from the dif-
"ficulty to test the convergence of one isolated ion stage. Indeed,"
"despite the ever growing computer power, increasing the number of"
configurations is a challenge. In the present calculation we have run
"3 sets of configurations up to the complex = = 4, = = 5 and = = 6"
"corresponding to Models A, B and C, described previously. These"
"relativistic calculations include respectively 267, 407 and 638 levels"
in the close-coupling expansion of the residual ion target. One might
expect an automatic increase in the resulting opacities since more
open channels as well as more resonance structure are associated
"with an ever increasing target expansion. As we can see in Figure 1,"
the monochromatic opacities do exhibit a net effect. There are more
resonances appearing when we include more configurations with
"higher =-shells, the continuum increases at low photon energy but"
seems to be lowered at high energy in spite of increasing numbers of
"open channels. In fact, one has to remember that increasing the size"

of the target and hence initial levels taken into account also means
"a redistribution of the population of the contributing levels, which"
corresponds to a dilution of the population. The strong contributors
in the = = 4 expansion will see their population reduced as we ex-
tend the calculation to = = 5 and then to = = 6. For the Rosseland
"mean opacity, this effect of dilution, from = = 4 to = = 5 is largely"
compensated by the extra contribution to the photo-absorption while
it is not compensated going from = = 5 to = = 6. The Rosseland
"mean opacity (^') of Fe XVII is the ^' = 1.2451 × 10

"mean between = = 6 and = = 4 and = = 6 and = = 5, respectively,"
"while the change in the Rosseland mean is below 4% and 1%, respec-"
tively. The differences in the Planck mean are surprising but a word
of caution is relevant here as the 3 sets of calculations are not at the
same resolution. We note that the = = 4 calculation employs 5000
"individual energy points, = = 5 uses 40000 points and = = 6 uses"
80000 points. This may partly explain the differences in the Planck
mean as we will see in the next subsection. All these results for the
mean opacities were obtained with an opacity sampling of 104 points
in energy. Higher resolution (105) has also been used and it will be
discussed later.
"4.1.2 Resolution: Model C at 10k, 20k, 40k and 80k points"
"In the '-matrix calculation of photoionization cross sections, the res-"
olution plays a crucial role since it will directly impact the capability
to resolve all the resonances present in the calculation. It will have
a greater impact on the Planck mean opacity since it is a classical
mean which depends directly on the height of the resonances. On
"the contrary the Rosseland mean being a harmonic mean, depends"
essentially on the lows of the cross sections hence should not be too
sensitive to the resolution since in the present work we do not apply
any broadening of such resonances. We expect a larger effect from
the broadening of the resonances because it will automatically fill
the windows between resonances and may even raise the continuum
over a large range of energies due to the overlapping of the broadened
"resonances. However, if the resonances are numerous, even without"
"broadening, the resolution could be an issue."
We can see this effect in Figure 2 where cross sections for Model
C with different resolutions are presented. The peak of resonances
goes up and down depending on the resolution. From 10k to 80k the
difference in ^% reaches 6%. Then the differences oscillate between

+2% and−2% for 20k and 40k when compared to 80k. The Rosseland
mean does not change by more than 0.2% between the different
"resolutions, as expected."
In the OP opacity calculation there is also another aspect con-
"cerning the resolution. This is the sampling. Indeed, to reduce the"
"number of energy points used in monochromatic opacities, we use"
an adaptive sampling in order to emphasize the energy region where
"the contribution is maximum (see Seaton et al. 1994, for details)."
As mentioned in Seaton et al. (1994) the means do not change by
more than 0.1% when the sample is done with 105 points or more
and up to 2% for 104 points. We found this sampling independent
of the original resolution in the present cases (for all the different
energy resolution in the cross sections from 10k to 80k). We adopted
the fine energy sampling (105 points) for the present study.
4.1.3 Additional bound-bound transitions.
In order to improve the calculation it is important to try to take into
account all the possible contributions to the absorption. Using the
"'-matrix method, the photoionization calculation is the most de-"
manding. Hence we cannot extend much more above the complex
"= = 6. However, the contribution from the bound-bound transitions"
"being easier to generate, we can extend it to higher levels. We added"
the bound-bound contributions from levels up to = = 9. This cor-
respond to 3.5 times more bound-bound transitions (from 4000 to
13000 lines). While we might expect some increase in opacities from
"these extra radiative transitions, as explained above, it can be counter-"
"balanced by the dilution of the population. In Figure 3, we see many"
lines (in blue compared to the red curve) added in the low energy
"ranges, and a clear lowering of the continuum at all energies as well"
as a reduced height of the peaks. In order to highlight the dilution
effect we suppressed the broadening of the bound-bound transition
for both sets. When broadening is applied (see Figure 4) we see an
increase of the continuum in the range [25 - 30 Ryd]. This is due to
the broadening of the numerous lines in this region as seen in Figure
3. Otherwise we can distinguish the lowering of the continuum at all
"energies beside the region mentioned above, due to the dilution of"
the populations. The changes in the level populations also affect the
peaks everywhere. The net total effect is an increase of the Rosse-
land mean opacity and a decrease of the Planck mean. The Planck
"mean is reduced from ^% = 1.3472 × 10

most of the extra lines are.
"and the Rosseland mean increases from ^% = 1.34764 × 10
−3 to"
"^% = 1.4559 × 10

4.1.4 Extrapolation of the cross sections for starting levels of
Rydberg series.
Another contribution can easily be added. The absorption from start-
ing levels belonging to a well identified Rydberg series can be ex-
trapolated from the highest levels belonging to the same Rydberg
series with calculated photoionization cross sections. The highest
"=-shell explicitly calculated was = = 6, and therefore taking into"
account the change in the effective quantum number along each Ryd-
berg sequence we were able to approximate small contributions from
= = 7 − 9 initial states from the = = 6 results.
In the present case we identified 28 Rydberg series among all the
327 levels up to n=9 and we have generated 102 extrapolated cross
sections. The final total number of starting levels is 358 (some of the
extrapolated cross sections are attached to existing levels belonging
to the set of 327 up to the complex = = 9). Among the levels for which
"MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2020)"
'-matrix and DW opacities for Fe XVII 5
"new cross section have been produced via these extrapolation, most"
of them were already contributing to the bound-bound absorption
described in the precedent section. These extrapolations bring more
"resonances and increase slightly the continuum, compensating suffi-"
ciently the extended dilution of the populations. Both mean opacities
(^% and ^') are affected and increased by such procedure by 2% and
3% respectively.
4.1.5 Resonance broadening
While the bound-bound transition broadening is completely treated
"in our calculation, this is not yet done for the resonances present in"
"the bound-free cross sections. Indeed, unlike the case of DW, the in-"
clusion of broadening into the '-matrix approach is not trivial. A dif-
ficulty comes in practice due to overlapping resonances arising from
"different series which, individually, require rather different collisional"
broadening. The '-matrix results reported in Nahar and Pradhan
(2016a); Pradhan and Nahar (2018) include a treatment of such
"broadening, but they give no details of their methodology. We discuss"
their results later in section 4.3.2.
4.2 AS-DW results
"Historically, The Opacity Project has favored the '-matrix approach"
for the calculation of the atomic data used in the opacity calculation
since OP focuses on the quality of the atomic data. Of course such
a choice implied some assumed approximations in the treatment of
"plasma effects. In contrast, all other groups favoured the description"
of the plasma itself at the cost of approximations in the atomic data
calculations. In the opacity calculations it is always necessary to build
up a compromise between accuracy and completeness of the atomic
"data sets and of the plasma effects. In 2005, an Opacity Project team"
have extended the validity of the OP opacities with the inclusion of
inner-shell transitions Badnell et al. (2005) using the DW approxi-
"mation. Hence, we combined both methods in order to improve our"
results for stellar applications. The less complex DW method allows
for larger configuration sets. Another important difference between
the DW and the '-matrix approaches is the treatment of photoion-
ization. There are two paths to photoionize an atom/ion. One is a
direct path with a photon with enough energy to detach directly an
electron and send it into the continuum. The second way consists in
photo-exciting the atom/ion into an autoionizing state which decays
"after, sending an electron into the continuum. This corresponds to"
the photo-excitation of an electron into a quasi-bound state followed
by a decay which makes another electron free via the Auger effect.
This can be characterized by the two following equations:
"+ ℎa → -
(=+1)+"
"+ 4
− (1)"
"+ ℎa → -
=+
∗ → -"
"(=+1)+
+ 4"
These two processes are treated directly at once by the '-matrix
"method, including the interaction between the two processes, while"
the DW approach treats the two processes separately. This has a
direct impact on the shape (i.e. the Fano profile) of the resonances
present in the photoionization cross sections. No such profiles are
present in DW calculations and the cross sections are a superposition
of a continuum and simple lines with a Voigt profile. A detailed
comparison has been presented in Delahaye et al. (2013).
All the present calculations were performed in intermediate cou-
pling. The comparison with previous LS coupling results can be

"Similarly to our '-matrix computations, we study the effect of the"

in section 3. The first set corresponds to 157 true bound starting
levels of Fe XVII and 501 levels of the residual ion. The second set

"ion. Passing from one set to the other, as we can see in Figure 5, where"
"the = = 5 set is in red and = = 6 in black, the extra contribution as"
"we did in the '-matrix results. For example, around 90 Ryd, the"
extended calculation provides new absorption which fills-in the gap
seen in the = = 5 (red) results. We have to emphasize the fact that
in the DW approach the lines from bound-bound and the resonance
from bound-free processes are both broadened. It is the overlapping
"of these broadened lines that fill-in the gap, as we will detail in"
the next subsection. The extra levels in the = = 6 calculation also
generate a dilution effect due to the different level populations. We
clearly see it in the energy range [20 − 50 Ryd]. The impact is much
more pronounced in the DW approach than in the '-matrix treatment.
This is also coming from the fact that in this comparison we took
only into account the contribution of the true bound levels as starting
levels. Extending the configuration set changes the structure of the
ion and some levels near the ionization limit shift into the continuum
as quasi bound states and disappear from the starting list of bound
levels used to calculate the opacities. This reduces significantly the
final bound-free contribution to the opacities despite the reduction
of the dilution.
We clearly see the importance of the addition of higher = transi-
tions. While the '-matrix method for example automatically includes
the resonances from high-= Rydberg series depending only on the
"resolution, it has to be done explicitly in the DW method. Since"
"we cannot include an infinite number of configurations, we use an"
extrapolation scheme in order to take into account the contribution
of the resonances converging to each edge of the photoionization
cross sections. As we did in the previous OP opacity release in 2005
"Badnell et al. (2005), we extrapolate the direct cross section below"
the edges so as to give a smooth transition of the numerous broad-
ened resonances converging towards the edge. As seen in Figure 6
the impact may be important in some cases. It fills in gaps over a

especially when it covers the spectral range of maximum contribution

"to an increase of 30% in the present case (= = 5, true bound starting"
"levels only). As we expand the configuration set the effect is reduced,"
as expected and is 20% in the = = 6 case. But we cannot go much
further since it would mean extending dramatically the configuration
When we compare the two sets of configurations = = 5 and = = 6
"with the extrapolation (Fig. 7) including the extrapolation features,"
"we see a closer agreement, especially in the high energy region. The"
remaining large discrepancies in the crucial [20 − 50 Ryd] energy
range come from the mismatch between the starting levels taken into
account due to the differences between the two structures. This will
be addressed in the next section.
4.2.2 Extension: Inclusion of quasi-bound states and triple !-shell
One advantage of the DW approach is that it allows for the inclusion
"of many more configuration and levels, even autoionizing levels as"
"initial states. If their population are sufficiently large, then they will"
make a contribution in the bound-bound transition as well as in the
photoionization. The '-matrix method takes into account only true

bound levels. as starting levels. The net result is difficult to evaluate
as the impact on the population is counterbalanced by the extra
absorption.
"In Figure 8, we have plotted the spectral cross sections of Fe XVII"
"for 4 different sets of configurations, without including the extrapo-"
lation of the high-= Rydberg resonances for clarity. In blue and green
we show the data presented above for MR1 = = 5 and = = 6 true-
bound starting levels while in red (= = 5) and black (= = 6) we have
included all starting levels (true bound plus autoionizing). While we
had 157 and 219 starting levels for MR1 = = 5 and = = 6 when
only true bound states were included now we have 19635 and 51179
starting levels respectively with the autoionizing starting levels. The
extra contribution dominates strongly the dilution when compared
with the calculation containing only true bound starting levels in the
"[20−50 Ryd] energy range but at high energy, the dilution is not fully"
"compensated-for. Hence, this will increase the Rosseland mean opac-"
"ity but it will not help to increase the continuum at high energy, as"
the experiment (Bailey et al. 2015) tends to suggest. Between = = 5
and = = 6 (bound plus autoionizing) the increase on starting levels
(more than twice as many levels) generates a dilution compensated-
for by the added contribution to the bound-bound absorption and
bound-free cross sections.
We have extended the exercise to the inclusion of transitions with
double-to-triple L-shell vacancies. One might have anticipated that
their contribution would be minor since the starting levels should
"have a small population. However, as we can see on Figure 9, their"
"contribution at high energy is significant. First, we can see some"
"windows being filled (� ∈ [65, 73 eV] and � ∈ [81, 92 eV]). Second,"
"at even higher photon energy, the continuum is significantly raised."
The total impact on the Rosseland mean opacity of Fe XVII is an
"increase of 10% . From this point forward, the DW results include the"
extrapolation below thresholds and the contribution from all initial
"autoionizing starting levels, including 2- to 3- L-shell hole transitions"
"(MR1+MR2), unless clearly stated otherwise."
4.2.3 Broadening
"As mentioned previously, the advantage of DW over '-matrix is"
the ability to collisionally broaden the Rydberg resonances in the
same manner as for bound-bound lines. This may have a significant
"contribution to the mean opacities. Indeed, as seen in Figure 10, the"
numerous resonances give rise to broad features and enhance the
Rosseland mean opacity by up to a factor of 2.

"4.3 Comparison: DW, R-matrix and others"
4.3.1 Comparison DW vs '-matrix
In Figure 11 we compare our results using both methods (DW and
"'-matrix) for = = 6, including all initial levels in the DW calculation"
and with the DW calculation for = = 6 including only the true bound
"levels. First, we can see that the '-matrix = = 6 calculation is more"
complete than the DW = = 6 one without autoionizing starting states.
"(Recall, DW has less true bound levels.) This is especially so in the"
energy region of maximum importance for the Rosseland mean opac-
ity that is to say � ∈ [30−55 Ryd]. The broadening of the resonances
in the '-matrix data would raise the continuum in this region as it
occurs in the case of DW data shown in the previous section. Other-
"wise, we see the general features are present in all the results and the"
behaviour is very similar. When comparing with the DW results ob-
"tained with all the autoionizing starting levels, including the 2–3 holes"
"ones, we see the importance of taking them into account. The low en-"
"ergy region, �?ℎ>C>= < 55 Ryd, is dominated by these levels which"
make a strong contribution to the photoionization cross sections. As
"expected, the net effect is more than a factor 2 difference in the Rosse-"
"land means (^�,
'"
"= 2.7337 × 10−3,^'−<0CA8G
'"
= 1.2834 × 10−3.)
"Another difference comes from the different structure, which trans-"
lates into a small shift of the broad features when DW is compared
to '-matrix.
The lack of broadening of the resonances in the '-matrix data
"increases the disagreement in the low energy region, while for en-"
ergies greater than 50 Ryd we see some large features and expect
very similar curves when the resonances start to blend with some

"broadening, as seen in the previous section. We may expect that the"
implementation of such broadening will ensure that the two methods
"come into closer agreement at low energy as well. Finally, it must"
also be added that the '-matrix data can benefit from an extension
"of starting levels, including some of the autoionizing levels by a"
simple extrapolation of the existing cross-sections along identified
Rydberg series. We did this exercise and end up with an increase in
the Rosseland mean of around 5%.
"However, the broadening for these features is very delicate. Indeed,"
"how realistic is the model of broadening, which is a transposition of"
"line broadening to the resonances, presented in Nahar and Pradhan"
(2016a)? How should the plasma effects modify the interference be-
tween the direct and indirect process of photoionization? Is a simple
broadening of the Fano’s profiles sufficient? Is the profile more deeply
affected and is the interference giving rise to another kind of profiles
"and shifts? While we are not yet able to answer these questions, the"
solution adopted to include broadening in a calculation will be yet
another approximation pending possible improvement.
4.3.2 Comparison with OPCD and SNAKP
OP2005 and the new '-matrix results are the closest in terms of
"treatment. As expected, in Figure 12, the black (new '-matrix) and"
the blue (OP2005) lines are very similar. The new = = 6 result shows
"more resonances, as expected, while the OP2005 has a higher con-"
tinuum in the [30 − 55 Ryd] region. This is due to the inclusion of
"the inner-shell in the OP2005 using a DW treatment and, hence, al-"
lowing for the broadening of the resonances in that region. We would
expect a rise in the continuum when broadening is implemented for
the resonances directly in the '-matrix data.
It is important to note that the differences in the Fe XVII mean
"opacities compared to OP2005 (with inner shells) are lower by 34%,"
"32% and 31% when using new '-matrix Models A, B and C, re-"
spectively. This difference is slightly different from the expected
"differences (35%, 33% and 31%). This may come from the presence"
of inner shells in OP2005 which are not totally accounted for in the
new data and even less as the maximum = in the configuration set
decreases.
When comparing the previous release from OP Badnell et al.
(2005) to the new results from the AS = = 6 calculation includ-
"ing autoionizing starting levels, we found the same general features"
at energies greater then 55 Ryd. But at lower energies the inclu-
"sion of new levels, especially the autoionizing levels generates the"
large increase in the continuum. Of course a direct implication is

"The increase reaches 55% for the full = = 5 case, with autoionizing"
"levels allowing for 2–3 hole transitions. In contrast, the Planck mean"
opacity is 24% lower.
We now proceed with considering the effect of the plasma broad-
ening in the work of Nahar and Pradhan Nahar and Pradhan (2016a)
(SNAKP hereafter). The SNAKP data presented below are taken from
the plot by Nahar and Pradhan (2016a) using the freeware g3data
(http://github.com/pn2200/g3data). We can see in Figure 13 the ef-
fect of the broadening used by Nahar and Pradhan (2016b) which
uses the data from their Figure 5. When shown on the same graph
we see it appears to show a somewhat unusual behaviour in the
"monochromatic cross sections. Indeed, around 70 Ryd, while there is"
"a dip in their cross sections as in ours and no significant resonances,"
the broadened ones are enhanced by one order of magnitude. This
cannot come from the two strong lines seen after (at 75 Ryd) since
they are bound-bound transitions and hence already broadened in
"our treatment. In the high-energy region, the broadened opacities"
give rise to a continuum below the non-broadened ones. These fea-
tures show that some artefacts are due to the algorithm used for their
"broadening, with a possible impact on the final results. While the"
broadening issue is not the cause of the differences with the exper-
"imental data, as previously mentioned in Blancard et al. (2016), it"
is certainly crucial in the calculation of monochromatic and mean
"opacities. It raises the value of ^' , as we have shown previously."
We also examined the latest result from Pradhan and Nahar (2018)
where they studied the accuracy and completeness of their calculation
on Fe XVII. One striking difference comes from the large enhance-
ment of the monochromatic cross sections in the region of main
"contribution to the Rosseland mean opacities [35− 55 Ryd]. Indeed,"
in our '-matrix calculations going up to the = = 6 complex and
"where the resolution has been carefully studied, as well as in our"
DW calculation including the autoionizing levels as starting levels
(more than 50000 levels) we could not see such a large increase in
this region where no large contribution from resonances is expected
"from our results. In Figure 13, the magenta dashed line shows the"
"same drop as SNAK where there are resonances in their calculation,"
"around 75 Ryd and between 95 Ryd and 100 Ryd, but it shows a"
large contribution well above all our results in the [35 − 55] Ryd
"region. We cannot understand this increase here, which looks like"
"some unidentified broadening or other contributions. Of course, Na-"
har and Pradhan mention the contribution to the continuum of the
"extra 50,000 levels they included via a distorted-wave calculation,"
but this appears very different from any other similar DW calcula-
"tions, including ours. At any rate, the large rise in the continuum in"
the [35 − 55] Ryd region is clearly the source of their large increase
in the Rosseland mean. We cannot identify the source of this and
may only speculate that is may be a re-normalisation problem for
the population when incorporating their new DW data. We already
presented the changes in the OP2005 release due to such approxi-
mations of re-normalisation. It was considered negligible (a few %)
at that time for the applications. Today the inclusion of such a large
"number of levels changes the picture. Unfortunately, even such a large"
"increase does not solve the differences with the experimental data,"
"as already pointed out by Blancard et al. (2016). Moreover, while"
Bailey et al. (2015) presented the differences in the Rosseland mean
"opacity, the comparison only concerns a partial section of the energy"
"range, i.e. the one for which experimental data are available. This"
"implies an integration for the range � ∈ [70 − 130 Ryd]. Now, when"
Pradhan and Nahar (2018) claim in their Table 1 a ratio of 1.65 com-
"pared to OP2005, it seems to apply to the Rosseland mean opacity"
of Fe XVII over the total energy range and not just the range covered
"by the experiment. So, the comparisons in Bailey et al. (2015) and"
Pradhan and Nahar (2018) do not appear to be strictly equivalent.
4.3.3 Total Fe opacity and Comparison with experimental data
In order to compare with the experimental data it is necessary to
perform the same kind of improved calculations for all important
ions present in the plasma for the given conditions. In the present
"case )4 = 2.1 × 10
6 K and #4 = 3.1 × 10"
22 cm−3. The main ions
"present in such Fe plasma are Fe XVI, Fe XVII, Fe XVIII, Fe XIX"
and Fe XX. New atomic data calculations are underway for these
"ions. However, a first analysis can be performed using the new data"
for Fe XVII in combination with the the older OP2005 data for the
other ions. In Figure 14 we compare the monochromatic opacities
for Fe with the our new '-matrix and DW data for Fe XVII to the
OP2005 results and the experimental data.
Given the results for Fe XVII discussed in the previous sections
and due to differences in the procedure to include the new Fe XVII
"data to the total Fe mixture, we will analyse separately '-matrix and"
DW results. The complete comparisons for the Rosseland and Planck
mean cross sections for Fe XVII and Fe as well as the opacity means
are presented in Table 2 to 4. In Table 2 (Planck cross sections) and
Table 3 (Rosseland cross sections) we are presenting the results for
the different Fe XVII model alongside the values for the Fe when
these new models are included in the total Fe calculation.
"For '-matrix, while we obtained Fe XVII mean opacities signif-"
"MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2020)"
'-matrix and DW opacities for Fe XVII 9
"icantly lower for the new '-matrix data (-20%, -32% for = = 5 and"
"-5%,-31% for n=6 in ^% and ^' respectively, these differences being"
"clearly understood as detailed in the previous sections, we also have"
"differences in the total Fe mean opacities of (-5%, -9% for = = 5 and"
"-2%, -9% for = = 6 in ^% and ^' respectively). In addition to all"
the effects presented in the previous sections due to the new data we
must add the effect of the new structures for Fe XVII onto the ioniza-
tion fractions. As we can see in T able 1 the ionic fractions strongly
depend on the structure of Fe XVII which differs between models.
The differences in the ionization potentials are of the order of 2.5%
to 5% for all ions but Fe XVII between the three new '-matrix model
"(A:= = 4, B:= = 5 and C:= = 6) and reach 10% to 28% for Fe XVII."
The new calculation always produces a lower Fe XVII content and
a higher fraction of the other ions compared to the OP2005 data.
"Hence, the changes in the cross sections and transitions probabilities"
"of Fe XVII per se have a reduced direct effect, but they also change"
the ionic fractions and hence indirectly change the total Fe opacities.
When comparing the results in Table 2 and 3 between the '-matrix
"models and OP2005, we clearly see the effect of the modification"
of the ionic fraction from Table 1 due to the inclusion of the new
"Fe VXII data. Finally, model C with the inclusion of extrapolated"
"cross sections and extra bound-bound transitions, shows a closer re-"
sult in the ionic fraction and in the partial and total cross sections
when compared to 2005 release. While the '-matrix data has im-
"proved significantly with the present calculations, the net effect is not"
yet fully displayed since no broadening is included and other ions
need also to be treated to extract the proper estimations.
"With the DW Fe XVII data, we used the original OP2005 ionic"
fractions to translate the net effect of the new atomic data into the
means (Rosseland and Planck).
"Comparing with the DW calculation for Fe XVII, as expected we"
reach the largest difference. The main effect being the inclusion of
all the autoionizing levels as starting levels as well as the global
broadening of all resonances alongside all bound-bound lines. We
have clearly shown in the previous sections the large increase of the
"continuum in the [30 − 55] Ryd energy range which, as expected,"
"enhances the Rosseland means greatly. Hence, while the models"
"including only true bound starting levels, as in the '-matrix datasets,"
since they do not include the contribution up to = = 9 as opposed to
"the OP2005 inner-shells which do, f'(Fe XVII) are lower than the"
OP2005 release and are very similar to the '-matrix values. Once
"the autoionizing starting levels are allowed, as some were already"
"present in the OP2005 results, the sign of the difference changes"
"directly, even with the = = 5 DW model. The differences are ∼ 14%"
"(MR1 = = 5 with auto), ∼44% (MR1 = = 6 with auto) and ∼ 65%"
(MR1+MR2 = = 6 auto plus 2–3 holes) as seen in Tables 2 and 3 for
Fe XVII when compared to OP2005. This then translates directly into
"an increase in the total Fe Rosseland mean of 13%. On the contrary,"
the Planck mean is reduced for the reason discussed previously due
to the combination of dilution and height lowering in the lines and
resonances which have been broadened in the present DW Fe XVII
models.
"Finally, in Table 4 we compare our total Fe Planck and Rosseland"
mean opacities to two other theoretical models. This comparison
"highlights some of the results shown previously. However, it has"
to be taken with caution since only one ion among the five main
contributors has been updated. The Planck mean opacities derived
"from '-matrix data, while close to OP2005, are 10% higher than"
"SCRAM results (S. Hansen private communication, using the code"
SCRAM Hansen et al. (2007)) and 10% lower than the OPAS results
"(C. Blancard private communication, using OPAS Blancard et al."
(2012)). These results are certainly emphasizing the importance of

broadening and suggest that a distinction between the treatment re-
served for the resonance and the bound-bound transitions would be
welcome. For the Rosseland mean opacities the present results show
the signature of the limitation of the exercise since new calculations
for all other ions will affect the results more drastically than for just a
"single ion. However, it is interesting to see the strong signature of the"
"presence of the autoionizing starting levels, indeed, we reach a 15%"
increase in the present DW results compared to the OP2005. But they
are still much lower compared to the two other theoretical results.
Of course we cannot anticipate the final results on Fe when all data
for the other ions will be included since many compensation and
"cancellation effects will occur. However, we expect some increase in"
the total Fe Rosseland mean opacities and maybe a decrease in the
"Planck opacities, pending verification as intuition does not replace"
computations in cases as complex as the ones studied here. Indeed a
new fully DW calculation will imply a complete broadening of the
lines and resonances. In the '-matrix results a different treatment
needs to be applied to the resonances compared to the bound-bound
transitions. A careful build-up and implementation of the broaden-
ing treatment is crucial since this effect affects Planck and Rosseland
opacities in different ways.
As another attempt to estimate the impact of our present Fe XVII
"calculation on the final Fe monochromatic opacities, we compare it"
to the revised experimental data (Nagayama et al. 2019) as well as to
the 2015 results (Bailey et al. 2015). The first thing we may expect
is that the continuum at high energy is not going to increase with
"any of the new Fe XVII models. As seen above, any extension of"
targets does not affect significantly the results in the energy range

above 100 Ryd where SANDIA’s experiment is showing a much
larger value. It has to be mentioned that this discrepancy has been
reduced by half since the revision of the analysis of the experimental
data in Nagayama et al. (2019). Another aspect of the discrepancy
comes from the ’windows’ filled in the experimental data but not in
theoretical calculations. It is important to note that the addition of
the 2- to 3-holes autoionizing levels in the DW Fe XVII models is
clearly producing a contribution within the energy range considered
in the experiment. In Figure 14 we have plotted the monochromatic
opacities for a pure Fe XVII plasma alongside the experimental data.
The opacities present a clear increase in the 80 Ryd. and 90 Ryd (2 of
the 3 so called ’windows’) when the 2- to 3-holes autoionizing levels
are taken into account. Of course one has to be cautious. The effect
of population and ionic fraction will certainly temper the results. The
final conclusion will come with the other ions which may or may not
exhibit the same features.
In Figure 15 we present the total Fe opacities obtained by replacing
"the OP2005 Fe XVII data with the present results. As expected, the"
impact of the new data are not reducing substantially the discrepan-
"cies at high energy. While the continuum part seems hard to change,"
the filling of the windows remains a challenge and requires new data
"for the other ions concerned, as seen in Figure 16, where the new data"
"for Fe XVII are beginning to fill some gaps. As already mentioned,"
the Rosseland and the Planck means are definitely affected and will
certainly be more-so when all ions of interest have been included.

'-matrix and DW opacities for Fe XVII 11
5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We have carried-out large-scale '-matrix and DW calculations of
Fe XVII radiative data to generate monochromatic opacities. We have
thoroughly studied the impact of the different approximations on the
final results and compared the methods. We have also compared them
to previous calculations and experimental data.
The main results are summarized in Tables 2-4 of section 4.3.3
with Table 4 including the values for ^% and ^% from OPAS (CEA)
and SCRAM (SANDIA/LANL).
We have tested different target expansions and reached conver-
gence in both sets of calculations while going from = = 4 to = = 6
"for both methods. In the '-matrix calculation for Fe XVII, the final"
results display a variation of less than 5% in the Rosseland mean
opacity between the = = 6 and = = 4 and 2% = = 6 and = = 5
expansions.
We have tested the limit of the '-matrix resolution and reached
satisfactory results with 80000 points for the photoionization cross
sections which do not change the Rosseland and Planck mean opac-
"ities by more than 0.2% and 2%, respectively."
While the '-matrix method automatically interacts all of the res-
"onances arising from the given target expansion, unlike the DW ap-"
"proach, the lack of collisional resonance broadening is the limiting"
factor in the accuracy of the results presented here. While SNAKP
"have reported broadened '-matrix results, they give no details of"
their methodology and we have seen (section 4.3.2) that it appears to
give rise to some unusual behaviour in the monochromatic opacities.
"In contrast, the DW method allows us to treat each resonance as a"
bound-bound line which can be broadened at will.
"In the DW approach, we were able to extend the calculations"
"further, including the contribution from initial autoionizing levels"
with two L-shell holes (which is not yet possible computationally
in the '-matrix approach). The two-to-three L-shell hole transitions
clearly make a significant contribution to the Rosseland and Planck
mean opacities that cannot be neglected. The autoionizing levels as a
whole contribute for more than 50% to the Rosseland mean opacities
of Fe XVII with a 10% increase coming from the two-to-three L-shell
hole transitions.
"Overall, the net effect on the Fe Rosseland mean opacity reaches"
"an increase of 7% at the test ()4, #4) when comparing the total"
opacities using the new data for Fe XVII (DW = = 6 MR1+MR2)
compared to the OP release from 2005. Our new '-matrix Fe XVII
"data, while missing resonance broadening and autoionizing initial"
"levels, produce Rosseland mean opacities 10% below the results"
from OP2005. The comparison with the data from other groups
"(OPAS-CEA, SCRAM-SANDIA) shows the importance of the new"
treatment of the atomic data in the results from The Opacity Project.
When considering the Planck mean opacities the new results sit
just in between the other theoretical ones. This clearly indicates the
different sensitivities to different aspects of the calculations of the
two different means. It is important to determine clear constraints for
each mean in order to define the proper global treatment to calculate
opacities. While the present Rosseland mean opacity results are still
"very low in comparison to other theoretical results, the present data"
indicate that our new calculations and those underway for the other
relevant Fe ions may significantly reduce the difference. (The focus
in this paper has been on the physics describing the atomic processes
rather than trying to converge the means.)
"As far as the comparison with the experiment is concerned, it"
clearly shows that nothing in the continuum at high energy has been
"improved. However, the work on the other ions concerned will be of"
the utmost importance. The presence of the autoionizing levels in the
present work for Fe XVII has already shown some features which fill
some windows. If it is confirmed for the others ions we may partly
resolve the existing discrepancy with experimental observations. But
it remains to be established.
Both computational methods employed here (DW and '-matrix)
"are complementary and could be combined, as we already did in the"
"OP2005 release, in order to increase accuracy and completeness at"
the same time.
"'-matrix and DW calculations for other Fe ions (Fe XVIII, Fe XIX,"
Fe XX) are underway with the aim of giving us a complete picture
of the global effect on the Fe opacity under the conditions at the base
of the solar convection zone. The interplay between all the different
effects does not allow us a reliable intuitive prediction of the results
"that will be obtained from these new larger calculations. For example,"
one of the strong effects turns out to be the change in the ionic fraction
introduced by the change of the structure in each particular ion.
It was found previously that the OP results were lower than OPAL
(or OPAS) for some Fe-peak elements present in the Solar mixture
"and higher in others (C,N,O ...) but the Rosseland mean opacities for"
the solar mixture agreed to within less than 4%. Should our Fe results
"be followed by a large revision of the stellar Fe opacities, a global re-"
vision would become necessary. Its consequences would affect more
than just stellar opacities. It is important to pave the way to the next
generation of stellar OP opacities and astrophysical opacities. The
next large set of calculations for all elements must be prepared and
"the different issues viz. ('-matrix) broadening, resonances and au-"
toionizing level contributions must be better analyzed in any attempt
for an improved treatment.
