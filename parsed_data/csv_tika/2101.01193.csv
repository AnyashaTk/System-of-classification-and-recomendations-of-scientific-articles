"ABSTRACT
Gas metallicity 𝑍 and the related dust-to-gas ratio 𝑓d can influence the growth of H ii regions via metal line cooling and
UV absorption. We model these effects in star-forming regions containing massive stars. We compute stellar feedback from
photoionization and radiation pressure (RP) using Monte Carlo radiative transfer coupled with hydrodynamics, including stellar
and diffuse radiation fields.We follow a 105M� turbulent cloud with 𝑍/Z� = 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1 and 𝑓d = 0.01𝑍/Z� with a cluster-sink
particle method for star formation. The models evolve for at least 1.5Myr under feedback. Lower 𝑍 results in higher temperatures
and therefore larger H ii regions. For 𝑍 > Z�, radiation pressure 𝑃rad can dominate locally over the gas pressure 𝑃gas in the inner
half-parsec around sink particles. Globally, the ratio of 𝑃rad/𝑃gas is around 1 (2 Z�), 0.3 (Z�), 0.1 (0.5 Z�), and 0.03 (0.1 Z�). In
the solar model, excluding RP results in an ionized volume several times smaller than the fiducial model with both mechanisms.
Excluding RP and UV attenuation by dust results in a larger ionized volume than the fiducial case. That is, UV absorption
hinders growth more than RP helps it. The radial expansion velocity of ionized gas reaches +15 km s−1 outwards, while neutral
gas has inward velocities for most of the runtime, except for 0.1 Z� which exceeds +4 km s−1. 𝑍 and 𝑓d do not significantly alter
the star formation efficiency, rate, or cluster half-mass radius, with the exception of 0.1 Z� due to the earlier expulsion of neutral
gas."

1 INTRODUCTION
"Stars form in clusters and associations inside giant molecular clouds
(GMCs). In the Milky Way, the star formation efficiency (SFE; the
proportion of gas mass converted into stars) is of the order 10 to 30
per cent at the cluster scale and a few per cent at the global GMC
scale (Lada & Lada 2003). This inefficiency may be explained by
stellar feedback driven primarily by O stars (Matzner 2002). These
massive stars are sources of energy andmomentum for the interstellar
medium via mechanisms such as photoionization, radiation pressure,
stellar winds, and supernovae (e.g. see the review by Dale 2015). In
this paper, we focus on the radiative processes.
There remainsmuch uncertainty as to the relative impact of the dif-"
"ferent feedback mechanisms. One way of assessing this is to compare
the pressures associatedwith each process in a particular star-forming
region. This has been done for a variety of H ii regions in the Small
and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC, respectively; Lopez
et al. 2011; Pellegrini et al. 2011; Lopez et al. 2014; McLeod et al.
2019), in the Galactic Centre (Barnes et al. 2020), and more recently
in the Galactic disc (Olivier et al. 2020, submitted). Most regions
in these studies show low levels of radiation pressure compared to
the thermal pressure from ionized gas, while other regions (typically
the smaller ones) show the opposite result. This can also vary as a
function of distance from the stellar sources, as in 30 Doradus in the"

"LMC, where the inner region is dominated by radiation pressure and
the outer parts by ionization."
"One parameter that could modify the effectiveness of feedback is
the metallicity, 𝑍 . The LMC and SMC have sub-solar metallicities
with 𝑍 ≈ 0.5 Z� and 0.2 Z� , respectively (Russell & Dopita 1992).
Observations show that metallicity varies within the Milky Way, de-
creasing with distance from the Galactic Centre where 𝑍 ≈ 2 Z�
(Deharveng et al. 2000). This will factor into radiative transfer pro-
cesses. The dominant cooling sources for ionized gas are collision-
ally excited forbidden lines from metal ions (Osterbrock & Ferland
2006). The dust-to-gas ratio is proportional to metallicity (Draine
et al. 2007), and radiation pressure is exerted primarily onto dust
grains which can be dynamically coupled to the gas. Furthermore,
the heating/cooling processes of dust grains can inhibit fragmen-
tation around protostars (Krumholz et al. 2007; Bate 2009; Offner
et al. 2009), and scaling this with metallicity can alter the density and
temperature structure even in low-mass clusters (Bate 2019). When
considering feedback from massive stars, changing the metallicity
and dust fraction can modify the D-type expansion of H ii regions.
Haworth et al. (2015) investigated this with detailed photoionization
modelling in 1D, with a single ionizing source in a uniform-density
medium. Including dust grains resulted in the attenuation of ionizing
radiation, which made the H ii region smaller compared to the model
without dust. A higher gas metallicity resulted in a lower electron
temperature, decreasing the expansion rate of H ii regions. Apply-
ing this in 3D to turbulent star-forming regions could provide key"

"information for interpreting the observations which probe different
metallicity environments."
"Over the last decade and a half, there has been a growing body
of work in 3D simulations of photoionization to investigate star for-
mation and gas dynamics (including but not limited to Dale et al.
2005; Mellema et al. 2006; Peters et al. 2010; Arthur et al. 2011;
Dale et al. 2012; Walch et al. 2012; Colín et al. 2013; Geen et al.
2015; Howard et al. 2016; Gavagnin et al. 2017; Ali et al. 2018;
Kim et al. 2018; Zamora-Avilés et al. 2019; Vandenbroucke &Wood
2019; Bending et al. 2020; Fukushima et al. 2020; Sartorio et al.
2021). Models span a wide range of initial cloud conditions across
mass, density, morphology, turbulence, and stellar population. In
general, SFEs are reduced by the impact of photoionization com-
pared to hydrodynamics-only runs, with some calculations showing
only a modest reduction (e.g. Dale et al. 2014; Howard et al. 2017)
while others reach the low values seen in the Milky Way (e.g. Geen
et al. 2017)."
"Radiation pressure is now routinely included in models of massive
star formation on the scale of individual cores (Krumholz et al. 2009;
Kuiper et al. 2010; Harries et al. 2017; Rosen et al. 2019; Mignon-
Risse et al. 2020) and implementations are becoming more common
for the cluster/GMC scale. For example, radiation pressure has been
investigated on its own (Skinner & Ostriker 2015; Tsang &Milosavl-
jević 2018) and in conjunction with photoionization (Howard et al.
2016, 2017; Kim et al. 2018; Ali et al. 2018; Ali & Harries 2019;
Fukushima et al. 2020). Overall, radiation pressure appears to be a
secondary effect at the GMC scale, except possibly at the highest
masses/luminosities/surface densities where it becomes more impor-
tant (Fall et al. 2010; Howard et al. 2018)."
"However, radiative transfer methods for photoionization are often
simplified by prescribing a single temperature for ionized gas, using
the on-the-spot approximation, or neglecting dust which absorbs UV
radiation and reprocesses it into the IR. Models which include ra-
diation pressure typically only use ∼2 frequency bins (e.g. ionizing
and non-ionizing photons), use an average dust opacity, and neglect
the pressure from either direct (stellar) radiation or indirect (dust-
processed) radiation, depending on the regime of interest. This does
not accurately capture all the microphysics, as wavelength-dependent
dust opacities span many orders of magnitude, and dust-processed
radiation may undergo multiple absorption/re-emission/scattering
events that can particularly affect high-surface density gas (Crocker
et al. 2018). Likewise, for photoionization, the presence of diffuse
ionizing radiation and dust absorption can change the size and mor-
phology of H ii regions (Ercolano & Gritschneder 2011; Haworth
& Harries 2012; Haworth et al. 2015). Furthermore, capturing the
metallicity-dependence of the electron temperature requires comput-
ing heating/cooling rates which take into account metal ions."
"In previously published models (Ali et al. 2018; Ali & Harries
2019), we included these processes using a detailed Monte Carlo
radiative transfer scheme for clouds of 103 and 104M� and a single
massive star. In this paper, we model a 105M� cloud with 𝑍/Z� =
0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2, with dust-to-gas ratio scaling linearly with 𝑍 . We
have extended the method to track star formation using cluster-sink
particles which form on the fly, accrete gas, and sample stars from
an initial mass function. They emit photon packets from across the
spectrum which then propagate through gas/dust in the interstellar
medium. We detail the numerical methods in section 2, go through
the results in section 3, discuss them in section 4, and conclude in
section 5."

2 NUMERICAL METHODS
"We use the torus code, which couples Monte Carlo radiative trans-
fer (MCRT) with hydrodynamics on a 3D grid (for a full description
of the code, see Harries et al. 2019). We use the same methods
as Ali et al. (2018) and Ali & Harries (2019), with different ini-
tial conditions and the addition of a cluster-sink particle approach
detailed in section 2.1. As a summary, the hydrodynamics scheme
is flux conserving, finite volume, and total variation diminishing.
Poisson’s equation for self-gravity is calculated using a V-cycling
multigrid method with Dirichlet boundary conditions based on a
multipole expansion. Gas can flow out of the grid but not in. The
hydrodynamics evolves isothermally, with temperatures set by an
MCRT calculation at the beginning of each time step. The MCRT
scheme is based on the method of Lucy (1999). The source luminos-
ity is split into photon packets which propagate through the medium,
undergoing absorption/re-emission/scattering events until they exit
the grid. Photoionization equilibrium is computed for the ion states
listed in Table 1 using the method described by Haworth & Harries
(2012), with abundances scaling linearly with metallicity. Photon
wavelengths are interpolated from 1000 logarithmically spaced bins
between 102 and 107 Å. The MCRT scheme therefore follows the
diffuse radiation field as well as the stellar radiation field, including
ionizing photons re-emitted by gas, and photons reprocessed by dust.
The method naturally takes into account shadowed regions, penetra-
tion of shadows by diffuse radiation, and radiation hardening. We
use Draine & Lee (1984) silicate grains with an MRN (Mathis et al."

opacity is plotted in Fig. 1. We do not include dust destruction,
as on GMC scales this occurs primarily through supernova shocks
(Jones 2004). We assume the dust is dynamically well-coupled to
the gas. Elemental abundances at solar metallicity are taken from
Asplund et al. (2009) and are listed in Table 1. Thermal balance
between photon absorption and thermal emission provides the dust
temperature. This is connected to the gas temperature by a collisional
heat exchange rate from Hollenbach & McKee (1979),"

"where 𝑇d, 𝑛d, 𝜎d, are the dust temperature, number density, and
cross-section respectively, 𝑇 is the gas temperature, 𝑣p is the thermal
speed of protons at 𝑇 , and 𝑓 is a factor which depends on 𝑇 and the
ionization fraction. The gas thermal balance uses heating rates from
H and He photoionization, cooling from H and He recomination
lines, collisionally excited lines from H and metals, and free-free
continuum. This takes into account the frequency dependence of the
stellar spectra and diffuse radiation field. The momentum-transfer
method of Harries (2015) provides a value for the radiation pressure,
which is added onto the momentum equation in the hydrodynamics
step. We do not include magnetic fields in these models."
2.1 Cluster-sink particles
"Weuse the sink particle algorithm described byHarries (2015) which
uses formation criteria based on Federrath et al. (2010). Due to the
spatial resolution of the calculationswe present here,we do not follow
the formation of individual stars, so we have extended the method
to make sink particles represent clusters or sub-clusters. Sinks are
formed above a density threshold of 104 cm−3, which corresponds
to the density above which stars are observed to form in cores in the
Galactic disc (Lada & Lada 2003; Barnes et al. 2019 and references
therein; see also Howard et al. 2014 who use this criterion with a
similar method in their simulations).
Before starting the simulations, we pre-tabulate a list of stars by"
"randomly sampling from a Chabrier (2003) initial mass function
(IMF) up to a total of 105M� . This is similar to the method by Geen
et al. (2018), but we retain the stars below 8M� as well. We use the
same pre-tabulated IMF for every model. Each sink has a reservoir of
mass available for star formation which is replenished by accretion
onto the sink. The sink mass gets converted into a stellar population
with an efficiency 𝜖 = 0.3, such that the reservoir mass 𝑀reservoir =
𝜖𝑀sink −"
"∑
𝑀∗, where 𝑀∗ are the individual stellar masses in that"
"sink. The value of 𝜖 is based on observational constraints from Lada
& Lada (2003); the simulations by Howard et al. (2014) use a similar
approach with an efficiency of 0.2 per free-fall time. After each
hydrodynamical time step, we check which reservoirs are massive
enough to take the next star off the list and select one of those at
random. The stellar mass is subtracted from the reservoir, and the
process continues down the list until no sink reservoirs are massive
enough.
While the position and velocity of each star simply follow the par-"
"ent sink particle, other stellar properties including mass, radius, and
luminosity vary independently with time. These evolve using inter-
polated values from the MESA Isochrones & Stellar Tracks (MIST;
Choi et al. 2016) with rotational parameter 𝑣/𝑣crit = 0 andmetallicity
[Fe/H] following the gas metallicity set in the initial conditions (sec-
tion 2.2). A sink is allowed to radiate after it is populated with a star"

to the spectrum. A sink with only low-mass stars does not radiate, as
the photoionization calculation is more stable without the ionizing
flux which is negligible but non-zero. Radiation is emitted from the
sink particle as a point source, with the sink’s luminosity being the
sum of its component stellar luminosities (𝐿sink ="
"∑
𝐿∗), and the"
"sink’s spectral energy distribution (SED) being an addition of its
component stellar SEDs. SEDs for O stars are interpolated from the
tlusty OSTAR2002 (Lanz & Hubeny 2003) grid of models using
the relevant gas metallicity, while later-type stars use Kurucz (1993)
models. In the next hydrodynamical step, the sink particle may con-
tinue accreting and the population procedure is repeated. Spectra
are only recalculated every ten hydrodynamical time steps, as this
reduces the computation time and the hydrodynamical timescale is
much shorter than the stellar evolutionary timescale; however, a cal-
culation is forced for sinks which have just been populated."
2.2 Initial conditions
"Our initial condition is a spherical cloud with mass 𝑀 = 105M�
and radius 𝑅 = 11.9 pc. These parameters are based on observa-
tions of molecular clouds by Roman-Duval et al. (2010). The sphere
has a uniform-density inner core up to 𝑟 = 𝑅/2, then a power-
law decrease with 𝜌(𝑟) ∝ 𝑟−1.5. The density outside the sphere is
0.01𝜌(𝑅). The mean mass density and number density of the sphere
is 1.05 × 10−21 g cm−3 and 629 cm−3, respectively. The free-fall time
associated with this average density is 〈𝑡ff〉 = 2.1Myr. The mean sur-
face density is Σ = 0.05 g cm−2 = 240M� pc−2. The temperature is
initially 10K for both gas and dust. The grid size from end to end is
45.4 pc, giving a linear resolution of 0.18 pc per cell with 2563 cells.
The grid structure is fixed, uniform, and Cartesian.
We investigate four metallicities, 𝑍/Z� = 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1. For each"
"metallicity, we assume a dust-to-gasmass ratio = 0.01×𝑍/Z� follow-
ing Draine et al. (2007). For 𝑍 = Z� , we carry out two more models
to investigate the effects of radiation pressure and UV absorption:
one with dust but no radiation pressure, and one with no dust and
no radiation pressure. The models and their labels are summarised
in Table 2. Metallicity and dust-to-gas ratio remain fixed over the
simulation.
We apply a random Gaussian turbulent velocity field over the"
"sphere. This is taken fromBate et al. (2002) and has a power spectrum
𝑃(𝑘) ∝ 𝑘−4 for wavenumber 𝑘 , such that the kinetic energy equals
the gravitational potential energy, i.e. the virial parameter 𝛼vir ≡
2𝐸kin/𝐸grav = 2. We check the criteria for sink particle formation,
accretion, and star population as described in section 2.1 at every
time step (unlike our previous models, Ali et al. 2018 and Ali &
Harries 2019, where star particles were placed at 0.75 〈𝑡ff〉)."

The growth of H ii regions around massive stars 5
3 RESULTS
"The spherical cloud evolves under self-gravity and a decaying tur-
bulent velocity field. This creates filaments in which sink particles
eventually form, especially in the inner half of the sphere where the
density is highest. The first sink forms after 0.42Myr (0.2 〈𝑡ff〉). The
first massive star (19M�) forms at 0.80Myr (0.38 〈𝑡ff〉) – beyond
this point in the text and in all plots, we define this as 𝑡 = 0 as this
is also when the radiative feedback starts. H ii regions are created
around sinks which accrete enough mass to form massive stars. As
the H ii regions expand, they collect gas into shells. Because the den-
sity structure is non-uniform, radiation is able to penetrate through
lower-density gas, ionizing areas of the cloud further away (including
the diffuse environment outside the cloud). Individual H ii regions
also combine with neighbouring ones. Dense structures resist being
ionized, but their star-facing surfaces get photoevaporated. The mor-
phology of the gas and H ii regions can be seen in Figs. 2 and 3,
which show the final snapshots of column density"

97.8M� (0.92 Myr), 103.5M� (1.31 Myr), 88.0M� (1.42 Myr),
and 115.9M� (1.69 Myr) at which point the computation ended.
Simulations were stopped due to small time steps caused by the
acceleration from radiation pressure. In section 3.1, we analyse the
growth of the ionized gas as a function of time, and examine the kine-
matics of both the neutral and ionized components. In section 3.2,
we calculate star formation rates/efficiencies and cluster properties.
Finally in section 3.3, we compare the thermal and radiation pres-
sures to determine how each feedback mechanism contributes to the
dynamics."
3.1 H ii region expansion
"The total ionized mass and volume as a function of time in each
model is shown in Fig. 4. We count cells as being ionized if the ion-
ization fraction of hydrogen is greater than 0.9. The solid lines show
the different metallicities, while the dashed line shows z1_norp and
the dotted line shows z1_norp_nodust (see Table 2 for the parameters
and physics in each model). Lower-metallicity models grow larger
H ii regions – a lower cooling rate from metal ions results in a higher
temperature, which produces a larger pressure gradient between ion-
ized and neutral gas; furthermore, a lower dust-to-gas ratio means
less attenuation of ionizing photons by dust. The mean electron tem-
peratures that we find at each metallicity are 5.6 × 103 K at 2 Z� ,
8.2 × 103 K at 1 Z� , 11 × 103 K at 0.5 Z� , and 17 × 103 K at 0.1 Z�
– this is the temperature averaged over the ionized volume then aver-
aged over time. The effect of dust absorption and radiation pressure
is seen in the difference between z1_norp_nodust, z1_norp, and z1.
Of the three, z1_norp_nodust grows the largest – photoionization is
the only feedback mechanism, but there is no shielding from dust.
Adding dust (z1_norp) results in the smallest H ii region, by an order
of magnitude, as now there are dust grains which attenuate the ion-
izing photons. Enabling radiation pressure (z1) gives a result in the
middle, showing that the additional pressure component from dust
is not effective enough to counter the stunting caused by absorption.
z0.5 has practically the same amount of ionized mass and volume as
z1_norp_nodust, and z0.1 has the most of all the models. For illus-
trative purposes, we also plot Spitzer (1978) expansion profiles as a"

for the entire duration of every model, with mean velocities reaching
in excess of +10 km s−1 and still increasing as the models evolve.
Velocities can be higher than the ionized sound speed as other dy-
namical mechanisms are involved, even in the ionization-onlymodels
– the surfaces of dense, neutral material can be photoevaporated, and
this newly ionized gas can be accelerated to ∼30 km s−1 (see also Ali
et al. 2018, where we show this in a lower-mass cloud with a single
massive star). An improvement on our previous models is that new"

"sink particles form inside dense clumps and ionize them from the
inside, creating new compact H ii regions. These expand and break
out, joining up with H ii regions formed by neighbouring sinks.
The neutral gas is infalling for the majority of the runtime for all"
"models except z0.1 and (in the final 0.5Myr) z0.5. Compared to the
hydrodynamics-only run, the feedback models have slightly higher
velocities (i.e. if gas is flowing inwards, it is doing so more slowly).
Furthermore, the gradients eventually turn positive, showing that
feedback is accelerating the neutral gas too. The hydrodynamics-only
model is the only one which shows the rate of infall continually in-
creasing. 〈𝑣𝑟 〉 for z1_hydro reaches aminimumvalue of−5.9 km s−1,
while the lowest velocity among the feedback models is −2.8 km s−1
– this is reached by z1_norp, which retains a constant infall velocity
over its lifetime. z0.1, the most outflowing model, reaches a velocity
of +4.4 km s−1. Overall, feedback does affect the kinematics of the
neutral gas, providing resistance against infall. However, z0.1 is the
only model which exhibits neutral outflow for a significant period
of the runtime. In addition to the support given by a higher thermal
pressure against gravitational infall, neutral structures can experience
a rocket effect when photoevaporated gas pushes off the surface (see
also Mellema et al. 1998, 2006; Arthur et al. 2011), providing an-
other source of acceleration not present in the hydrodynamics-only
model."
3.2 Star formation
"Our cluster-sink method allows particles to form and accrete on the
fly, which is an improvement on our previous method of placing
individual stars manually at one pre-defined moment in time. The
drawback is that a particular sink’s stars are all lumped together into
a point – instead of having many 1000s of real star particles, we have"
"MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2020)"
The growth of H ii regions around massive stars 7
"∼100 ‘cluster’ particles. While this provides a clear computational
advantage, it makes it difficult to separate the ensemble of particles
into several well-defined, distinct clusters, and to analyse individual
clusters by themselves. For this reason, our analysis treats the whole
system as one cluster.
Fig. 6 shows the evolution of the cluster half-mass radius 𝑟hm vs"
"total stellar mass for each model. In this case, ‘cluster’ means all
sinks which are populated with at least one star, and the relevant
mass is the stellar mass not the sink mass (see section 3.2 for details
about the sink particle method). 𝑟hm is the radius from the centre of
mass which encloses half the total mass. For comparison, we also
show data for young massive clusters (YMCs) in the Milky Way
and Large Magellanic Cloud from Portegies Zwart et al. (2010). All
the clusters lie between the Milky Way YMCs. With the exception
of z0.1, all the models are indistinguishable from one another and
becomemore compact asmass (i.e. time) increases, especially as they
approach 104M� . Similar behaviour is seen byLiow&Dobbs (2020)
in models of cloud-cloud collisions which do not include feedback,
where massive clusters contract once gravity becomes important.
The results imply that variations in metallicity, dust absorption, and
radiation pressure do not guarantee changes in cluster compactness,
even though the H ii regions produced by each model are of different
sizes and masses (as shown in Fig. 4) – for example, z1_norp has
the smallest H ii region, while both z1_norp_nodust and z0.5 have
an ionized volume which is an order of magnitude larger. That is,
a larger H ii region does not guarantee a larger cluster. z0.1 is an
outlier as its cluster does not contract as much as the other feedback
models, which all follow the same relationship as each other. This is
because the neutral gas has a higher mean velocity, which is directed
radially outwards for z0.1 instead of radially inwards as in the other
models (see Fig. 5). Since the turnover from infall to outflow occurs
relatively early in the evolution (by 𝑡 = 1Myr = 0.5 〈𝑡ff〉), this halts
the collapse of the gas and hence the sinks – the turnover happens
too late (or not at all) for the other models. The hydrodynamics-only
calculation is shifted to the right as it accretes more mass, due to the
lack of pressure support from feedback and the accelerating rate of
neutral-gas infall.

the models which run the longest, z1_norp (dashed line) has a higher
SFE than z1_norp_nodust (dotted line) – 0.2 vs 0.15. The former has
a smaller H ii region (Fig. 4) and smaller radial expansion velocities
both for ionized gas and neutral gas (Fig. 5), meaning more mass can
funnel into sink particles, creating more stars; the sink accretion rate
for this model is higher by about a factor of 10 at late times. Overall"

of the radiative force per unit area"

"is, on the whole, dominated by the thermal pressure from ionization.
Radiation pressure is only significant near the sink particles. For ex-
ample, the figure shows an area in the H ii region which is dominated
by radiation pressure, to the bottom right of the centre of mass (the
cross symbol). This is where several sink particles are concentrated
near a neutral, high-density clump. Additionally, a lone sink particle
near the right edge of the frame is growing its own compact H ii
region and radiation-pressure bubble. To characterise these pressure
hotspots and identify trends as a function of radius, we also calculate
radial averages of 𝑃gas, 𝑃rad, and the ratio 𝑃rad/𝑃gas. To do this, we
compute each quantity in every cell, bin it according to distance from
the origin, then find the median, first quartile, and third quartile in
each radial bin. This creates a series of concentric shells around the
origin, with average values being found for each shell. These results
are shown in Fig. 9.
The origin of the first column of Fig. 9 is the first H ii region"
"at 𝑡 = 0.43Myr. The ionizing sources are the same in each model
and have masses of 31.7, 27.8, and 18.7M� . The H ii region is
approximately 2 pc in radius. In the innermost radial bins, 𝑃rad/𝑃gas
has values around 10 for the z2 model, 3 for z1, 1 for z0.5, and
0.1 for z0.1. That is, radiation pressure dominates over (or is at least
comparable to) the gas pressure for all but the lowest metallicity case.
This drops offwith radius, with allmetallicities having 𝑃rad/𝑃gas < 1
by 0.7 pc.
The origin of the second column of Fig. 9 is the cluster centre"
"of mass at 𝑡 = 1.22Myr. 𝑃rad/𝑃gas is approximately constant in the
inner 5 pc, before tailing off at the ionization front. The median is
just below 1 for z2, around 0.3 for z1, 0.1 for z0.5, and 0.03 for z0.1.
The smaller ratio at low metallicity is a caused by a combination of
𝑃rad being smaller (lower dust-to-gas ratio) and 𝑃gas being higher
(higher temperature).
In summary, radiation pressure can be important at sub-pc scales"
"near sink particles, while ionization becomes the dominant term fur-
ther out. On the cluster scale, radiation pressure is at best comparable
to the gas pressure (𝑍 > Z�), and at worst negligible (𝑍 = 0.1 Z�).
For the z1 model, the total ionized mass and volume are larger when
radiation pressure is enabled compared to when it is switched off
(see Fig. 4). This can be caused by the high 𝑃rad in the vicinity of
sink particles clearing material away with a similar force as the ther-
mal pressure from ionization. However, as explained in section 3.1,
a more effective way of producing a larger H ii region is to remove
the dust altogether; even though this removes the source of radia-
tion pressure, it means more ionizing photons are absorbed by gas
rather than processed away by dust – feedback is more efficient when
photons are ionizing gas instead of imparting momentum to dust."
4 DISCUSSION
4.1 Comparison of pressures with observations
"In this subsection, we compare the pressure contributions with obser-
vational studies of the LMC, SMC, and more recently of the Galactic
Centre in the Milky Way. These regions have different metallicities,
with 𝑍 ≈ 2 in the Galactic Centre, 0.5 Z� in the LMC, and 0.2 Z� in
the SMC (Russell & Dopita 1992; Deharveng et al. 2000). First we
consider the different definitions used in the literature. Lopez et al.
(2011, 2014) define the direct radiation pressure as"
"𝑃dir (𝑟) =
∑︁ 𝐿bol
4𝜋𝑟2𝑐"
", (10)"
"where the sum is over stars with bolometric luminosity 𝐿bol at a
projected distance 𝑟 away from the point of interest, and 𝑐 is the
speed of light. The volume-averaged value is defined as"
"〈𝑃dir〉 =
∫
𝑃dir (𝑟) d𝑉∫
d𝑉"
"=
3𝐿bol
4𝜋𝑅2𝑐"
. (11)
"where 𝑅 is the radius of the H ii region (or aperture). McLeod et al.
(2019) and Barnes et al. (2020) use a similar expression, except they
assume 𝐿bol ≈ 𝑄0〈ℎa〉, the rate of ionizing photons emitted by the
source populationmultiplied by themean SED energy. It is important
to note that this does not have a dependence on gas/dust properties
(density, opacity, metallicity, etc). Therefore, as noted by the authors,
these expressions are strictly a property of the radiation field – they
show the radiative momentum flux at position 𝑟 given a luminos-
ity which only decreases by geometric dilution. This is delivered
as momentum in the gas if radiation streams through an optically
thin medium before getting absorbed at the position 𝑟 . Beyond 𝑟 ,
the deposited momentum would be further reduced by attenuation.
Alternatively, radiation could leak out through holes in the density
structure instead of interacting with gas at all. Determining this ob-
servationally is mademore complicated by projecting stars and gas to
2D. In short, this 𝑃dir measures the potential for a source to provide
momentum, not how much momentum is actually deposited in the
gas. Without accounting for density, it is possible that 𝑃dir is being
overestimated in the observations, particularly for larger radii/optical
depths, as 𝑃dir is propagating as ∝ 𝑟−2 instead of ∝ 𝑟−2e−𝜏 (𝑟 ) . Pel-
legrini et al. (2011) use a different method, carrying out a grid of
cloudy (Ferland et al. 1998) photoionization models for varying po-
sitions 𝑟 and densities 𝑛H (keeping 𝑄0 fixed). Therefore instead of"

With these caveats, we can comparewith the trends found byLopez"
"et al. (2011) (equation 10) and Pellegrini et al. (2011) (equation 12)
who both observed 30 Doradus in the LMC and computed pressure
ratios at multiple points inside the region. Both studies found that
the direct radiation pressure was greater than or comparable to the
ionized gas pressure in the inner region, but was less important fur-
ther out, by up to an order of magnitude. However, they disagree
about the distances involved – Pellegrini et al. say radiation pressure
dominated the inner 10 pc, while this is closer to 70 pc for Lopez
et al.. The maximum of 𝑃dir/𝑃gas was around 3 for Pellegrini et al.
and 10 for Lopez et al.; the discrepancies may be attributed to dif-
ferences in the method. Compared with our models, 30 Doradus is
an extreme example containing stars with higher luminosities and
effective temperatures (thus more energetic spectra). This makes the
radiation pressure larger, as 𝑃dir ∝ 𝐿bol ∝ 𝑇4eff. The ratio 𝑃dir/𝑃gas
is similarly affected, as the ionized gas temperature 𝑇 does not scale
significantly with 𝑇eff (and 𝑃gas ∝ 𝑇).
A later study by Lopez et al. (2014) examined 32 H ii regions in"
"the LMC and SMC using volume-averaged pressures (equation 11).
They found that the ionization pressure was the dominant term,
while the direct radiation pressure was up to two orders of mag-
nitude smaller (∼ few × 10−12 dyn cm−2). These results were con-
sistent across H ii region sizes between 10 and 100 pc. McLeod et al.
(2019) observed LMC H ii regions with higher angular resolution
and identified younger, more compact sub-regions (down to 3 pc).
They reached similar conclusions to Lopez et al. (2014), although
values of 〈𝑃dir〉 were even smaller (by a factor of 10) which they at-
tribute to the method being dependent on morphology. Barnes et al.
(2020) examined H ii regions in the super-solar metallicity of the
Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way. The authors note
that the CMZ has higher ambient pressures than the LMC/SMC,
which would affect the expansion of the H ii region and the point
where pressure equilibrium between ionized gas and neutral gas is
reached (see Raga et al. 2012 for the theoretical description). They
used equation (11) which is not metallicity-dependent, but the ther-
mal gas pressure (and hence the ratio between them) is, as 𝑃gas ∝ 𝑇 .
For a sample of H ii regions up to a few pc in size, they found a trend
with radius showing the direct radiation pressure was dominant up
to 0.1 pc, beyond which the ionization pressure became important.
The largest ratios were reached on the smallest scales within Sgr B2,
with 𝑃dir/𝑃gas ≈ 10.
A final note can be made on the role of the indirect radiation"
"pressure. Although our models do include both components, they
can not be disentangled explicitly as we track the net momentum
change in each cell, not the momentum transferred with each photon
interaction event – in the notation of the observational papers, our
𝑃rad = 𝑃dir + 𝑃IR. The observational studies which calculate both
components show one of them being much larger than the other.
Lopez et al. (2014) found 𝑃IR ∼ 0.1𝑃gas (∼ few × 10−11 dyn cm−2),
except for two sources where they were comparable, and 𝑃IR � 𝑃dir.
Conversely, Lopez et al. (2011) found 𝑃IR � 𝑃dir. Therefore, it
seems reasonable to compare our 𝑃rad to whichever component is
dominant for a particular region. A more analogous comparison
could be made by computing synthetic observations from our simu-"
"lations and using the observational methodology on those outputs. In
summary, our work is broadly in agreement with the observational
results – if radiation pressure is the dominant feedback mechanism,
this occurs at small scales, while the thermal pressure dominates on
larger scales."
4.2 Comparison with theory
"Our star formation efficiency results are almost the same for each
metallicity, although it is possible they may diverge were the models
to be evolved for longer. Fukushima et al. (2020) did find differences
as a function of metallicity in their models of photoionization and
radiation pressure at 𝑍/Z� = 1, 0.1, and 0.01. They found lower
SFEs at lower metallicities, attributing this to the greater disruption
at higher temperature. For a similar surface density as our model, the
different metallicities showed SFEs of around 20 per cent at 1 Z� ,
10 per cent at 0.1 Z� , and 3 per cent at 0.01 Z� . The SFE was set by
photoionization – the fiducial model with both mechanisms was the
same as the model with only photoionization, while the model with
only radiation pressure had a greater SFE by a factor of 4 (a more
drastic variation than we find).
Kim et al. (2018) also found that radiation pressure was secondary"
"to photoionization in their parameter study of GMCmass and surface
density. In particular, radiation pressure started to become important
above 200M� pc−2 (for reference, our cloud is 240M� pc−2). In
general, lower SFEs were reached by photoionization-only models
compared to radiation pressure-only runs, and combined-feedback
models were slightly lower; around this surface density, the SFEs
were around 20 to 40 per cent. It should be noted that Kim et al.
convert 100 per cent of the sink mass to stars, while we limit this to
30 per cent. As in our models, the ratio between the hydrodynamics
and feedback SFE was around 0.5.
Howard et al. (2017) also carried out combined photoionization-"
"radiation pressure simulations. They saw SFEs around 16 to 21 per
cent in GMCs between 104 and 106M� , which are only slightly
higher than the results we find here (albeit their simulations are
evolved for a longer fraction of the free-fall time). The reductions in
the SFE compared with hydrodynamics-only runs were 20 to 50 per
cent, which are also exhibited by longer-running models in our set of
simulations. Their star formation method and definition of the SFE
are similar to ours, perhaps making this a more direct comparison
than with Kim et al. (2018). Howard et al. (2018) also applied the
two mechanisms in a 107M� cloud at 𝑍/Z� = 1 and 0.1. Radiation
pressure drove an outflow bubble around the central cluster, but only
in the solar metallicity cloud. On those scales, photoionization was
insignificant, with the SFE being the same as the hydrodynamics
model when radiation pressure was switched off. They found the
SFE at 0.1 Z� was higher than the solar model by a factor of 4,
which is the opposite trend to Fukushima et al. (2020). However,
Howard et al. only emitted radiation from sink particles once they
exceeded 104M� , and this could affect the evolution at early times.
The right-most panel of Fig. 8 shows a region of high radiation"
"pressure where gas is accelerated in the cells around a dense group
of sink particles. This creates a cavity in the ionized gas at this
location, comparable to the descriptions by Mathews (1967) and
Draine (2011). It should be noted that dust is dynamically well-
coupled to the gas in our numerical scheme. Taking into account
separate dust dynamics can result in a dust cavity with variations
in dust-to-gas ratio and grain size distribution, as well as shallower
gradients in gas density (Akimkin et al. 2015, 2017; Ishiki et al.
2018).
Variation in the initial conditions between simulations clearly adds"
"MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2020)"
The growth of H ii regions around massive stars 11
"complexity when trying to make direct comparisons – the structure
of the density and velocity before stars form and feedback initiates
will affect cloud evolution. In addition to mass, average density, and
radial dependence of density, different models use different turbulent
velocity fields. The effects of this were investigated by Geen et al.
(2018), who carried out a suite of models with photoionization feed-
back, varying the velocity structure and hence final cloud length and
filamentary structure. Separately they varied the random sampling
of the IMF in the star formation prescription. Resulting SFEs varied
between 6 and 23 per cent, showing that a relatively large margin
of error can be caused by the model setup and not just the feedback
physics. In the context of those results, our work would imply that
variations in metallicity are not as important as other initial condi-
tions such as morphology when it comes to setting the star formation
efficiency.
Radial velocities for Kim et al. (2018) were between +18 and"
"+26 km s−1 for ionized gas, and between +5 and +15 km s−1 for
neutral gas. The magnitudes are similar to our results, particularly for
the lowest metallicity model, and are consistent with the rocket effect
(Oort & Spitzer 1955;Mellema et al. 1998, 2006; Arthur et al. 2011).
The fact that feedback in our clouds must first overcome infall could
be due to the initial radial density profile – Kim et al. use clouds with
uniform density, while ours are centrally concentrated. The radiation
pressure-only model by Tsang & Milosavljević (2018) shows infall
being stabilised by feedback to a near-constant velocity, while the
hydrodynamics run collapses at an accelerating pace. Again, the
initial conditions differ, as Tsang & Milosavljević use a turbulent
box with 100 times more mass and 30 times the density of our cloud,
so the infall velocities were also faster – inside a 1 pc radius around
the central cluster, this approached −100 km s−1 after a free-fall time
in the hydrodynamics run, and around −20 km s−1 in the feedback
case. Nonetheless, the qualitative behaviour matches what we find.
Our general results show that photoionization is the dominant"
"feedback mechanism driving the evolution of the cloud, while radi-
ation pressure plays a secondary, local role. This is similar to the di-
chotomy between photoionization and momentum-only stellar winds
as described by Dale et al. (2014), where the momentum injected by
winds created cavities around sink particles. Likewise, our SFEs are
higher than expected for the GMC scale, which could be attributed
to the initial conditions, or to the lack of other feedback mechanisms
(such as energy-injecting stellar winds and supernovae which pro-
duce hot gas around ∼ 106 K). While there is still uncertainty about
the impact of metallicity on star formation, its role in gas disper-
sal is clearer – lower metallicity aids photoionization, while higher
metallicity aids radiation pressure."
5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
"Wehavemodelled a 105M� turbulent cloudwith different gasmetal-
licities, 𝑍/Z� = 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1 and dust-to-gas ratio scaling linearly
with 𝑍 .We included stellar feedback from cluster-sink particles in the
form of photoionization and radiation pressure. We also computed
thermal balance to consistently calculate electron temperatures at
the different metallicities. We used a Monte Carlo radiative transfer
method which is able to capture the microphysical detail in each
feedback mechanism – photon packets spanning orders of magni-
tude in wavelength interact with gas and dust grains in the same
way as real photons, getting absorbed, re-processed, and scattered.
This presents a key advancement compared to previous studies of
stellar feedback in GMCs. The method provides robust calculations
of ionization pressure, radiation pressure, and hence the ratio be-"
"tween them. As these quantities are used to observationally constrain
the relative importance of different feedback mechanisms (e.g. as a
function of radius), it is necessary for simulations to provide accurate
results. Our key findings are:"
"(i) lower-metallicity H ii regions have higher temperatures and
therefore expand faster. This is because metal forbidden lines are the
dominant cooling mechanism for ionized gas. Temperatures range
from 5.6 × 103 K at 2 Z� to 17 × 103 K at 0.1 Z�
(ii) feedback disperses ionized gas and provides support against"
"gravitational infall for neutral gas. Ionized gas is accelerated outwards
for the entire duration of each model – the mass-weighted mean
expansion velocity, 〈𝑣𝑟 〉, approaches +15 km s−1 by the end of the
simulations. Neutral gas has 〈𝑣𝑟 〉 directed inwards for most of the
evolution. The pure hydrodynamics run is the onlymodelwhere infall
accelerates, reaching 〈𝑣𝑟 〉 = −5.9 km s−1. For the feedback models,
the most negative 〈𝑣𝑟 〉 is −2.8 km s−1 – the velocity either stabilises
or turns into outflow. This happens in the first Myr (0.5 〈𝑡ff〉) at
0.1 Z� , which by the end of its runtime has neutral gas flowing out
at +4.4 km s−1
(iii) switching off radiation pressure results in a smaller H ii re-"
"gion than the fiducial model with both photoionization and radiation
pressure (at solar metallicity)
(iv) however, switching off radiation pressure and removing dust"
"results in an H ii region larger than the fiducial one. This is because
UV photons are absorbed by dust grains and reprocessed to lower
energies, diluting the ionizing flux. In terms of H ii region size, the
growth caused by radiation pressure is not enough to completely
offset the stunting caused by UV absorption. This highlights the
importance of including dust radiative transfer in models of pho-
toionization feedback, whether or not radiation pressure is included
(v) we calculate the radial dependence of each pressure compo-"
"nent. Radiation pressure dominates over the gas pressure, or is at
least comparable to it, in the inner 0.7 parsec around sink particles
for 𝑍 > 1 Z� . The maximum ratio of the radiation pressure to gas
thermal pressure 𝑃rad/𝑃gas ≈ 10 at 𝑍 = 2 Z�
(vi) on the global scale, 𝑃rad/𝑃gas is around 1 at 2 Z� , 0.3 at Z� ,"
"0.1 at 0.5 Z� , and 0.03 at 0.1 Z� ."
"Our results show that although radiation pressure is less impor-
tant than photoionization on large scales (∼ 10 pc), it still aids in the
growth of H ii regions via radiation-pressure hotspots on small scales
(< 1 pc), especially above solar metallicity. This can explain differ-
ences in the observations, where Lopez et al. (2014) and McLeod
et al. (2019) infer negligible radiation pressure in H ii regions larger
than 3 pc at low metallicity, whereas Barnes et al. (2020) estimate
radiation pressure is dominant on the sub-pc scale at high metallicity.
To fully understand how the feedback processes affect the dynamics,
it is necessary to observe pressure contributions in young and com-
pact H ii regions, in addition to the older, larger H ii regions which
have until recently been the primary focus of observational stud-
ies. Furthermore, this shows the metallicity-dependence of radiation
pressure must be taken into account, which is not yet apparent in the
literature.
Our models specifically investigate the impact of metallicity and"
"dust in radiative feedback, so we keep the same initial cloud con-
ditions for all models. We do not take into account environmental
factors such as variations in external pressure (Barnes et al. 2020) or
galactic-scale forces (Rey-Raposo et al. 2017; Bending et al. 2020)
which can influence the evolution of H ii regions and GMCs. We
use the same turbulent velocity field for each model and the same
ordering of stars which populate cluster-sink particles; varying ei-
ther can affect cloud morphology and star formation measures (Geen"
"MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2020)"
12 A. A. Ali
"et al. 2018). Finally, we neglect other feedback mechanisms such as
stellar winds, which may be needed to attain lower star formation
efficiencies."
