"Abstract. It is well known that the inflationary scenario often displays different sets of
degeneracies in its predictions for CMB observables. These degeneracies usually arise either
because multiple inflationary models predict similar values for the scalar spectral index n"
"and the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, or because within the same model, the values of {n
S
, r}"
"are insensitive to some of the model parameters, making it difficult for CMB observations
alone to constitute a unique probe of inflationary cosmology. We demonstrate that by taking
into account constraints on the post-inflationary reheating parameters such as the duration
of reheating N"
"re
, its temperature T"
"re
and especially its equation of state (EOS), w"
"re
, it is"
"possible to break this degeneracy in certain classes of inflationary models where identical
values of {n"
"S
, r} can correspond to different reheating w"
"re
. In particular, we show how"
"reheating constraints can break inflationary degeneracies in the T-model and the E-model
α-attractors. Non-canonical inflation is also studied. The relic gravitational wave (GW)
spectrum provides us with another tool to break inflationary degeneracies. This is because
the GW spectrum is sensitive to the post-inflationary EOS of the universe. Indeed a stiff

1 Introduction
"There has been a remarkable progress in our understanding of the early universe over the past
three decades fostered by new theoretical insights and reinforced by a plethora of precision
cosmological missions, ranging from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to large scale
structure (LSS) observations. As a result, the inflationary paradigm [1–6] has emerged as
a key scenario for describing the early universe and for setting initial conditions for the
hot Big Bang phase of expansion. One of the key predictions of the inflationary scenario
is the quantum-mechanical production of primordial tensor fluctuations which give rise to
a stochastic background of relic gravitational waves with an approximately scale-invariant
primordial power spectrum, |nT | ≪ 1, at large scales including the cosmological ones [7].
The reason for this lies in the fact that unlike other massless fields such as photons and
massless neutrinos which couple conformally to gravity and whose production is therefore
suppressed in the conformally flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe,
gravitational waves in General Relativity (GR) couple minimally to gravity [8] that results in
their non-adiabatic production in an expanding isotropic universe if the Ricci scalar R is non-
zero 1. While several distinct predictions of the single field slow-roll scenario of inflation have
received spectacular observational confirmation, both from CMB as well as LSS observations,"
"1More complicated situation may occur in modifed gravity. In particular, in f(R) gravity small oscillations
of the gravitational scalar degree of freedom with a non-zero R do not create gravitons; in quantum language,
decay of scalarons into pairs of gravitons is suppressed [9]."
"the detection of primordial tensor fluctuations, both in the form of CMB B-mode polarization
on large angular scales as well as a spectrum of relic gravitational waves (GWs), remains one
of the major challenges confronting observational cosmology in the coming decade."
"It is well known that the GW primordial power spectrum at large scales provides us with
important information about the nature of an inflaton field due to its direct relation to the
inflaton potential in the case of the minimal inflaton coupling to gravity (or, in the Einstein
frame). Of equal importance is the fact that their spectrum, Ω"
"GW
(k), and spectral index"
"=
d log ΩGW
d log k"
"at sufficiently small scales can serve as a key probe to physical processes
occurring after inflation. As originally shown in [10], the primordial spectrum of relic grav-
itational radiation at small scales is exceedingly sensitive to the post-inflationary equation
of state (EOS), w. In fact the GW spectrum has distinctly different properties for stiff/soft
equations of state. For a stiff EOS, w > 1/3, the GW spectrum shows a blue tilt: n"
"GW
> 0,"
"that increases the GW amplitude on small scales. Softer equations of state, w < 1/3, on the
other hand, lead to a red tilt, whereas the radiation EOS, w = 1/3, results in a flat spectrum
with n"
"GW
≃ 0."
"Another key aspect of inflationary cosmology, namely the epoch of ‘reheating’, also
remains observationally inaccessible at present, despite a profusion of theoretical progress in
this direction. It is well known that the post-inflationary universe passed through a series of
physical epochs each of which can be characterized by an EOS, wi. Of these, the most recent
ones are: the radiation dominated stage with wr ≃ 1/3, the matter dominated stage with
wm ≃ 0 and the present stage of accelerated expansion with wde < −1/3. However, after the
end of inflation and before the commencement of the radiation dominated stage, the universe
went through the epoch of reheating during which the energy contained in the inflaton field
was transferred to the other matter/radiation degrees of freedom present in the universe."
"The nature of the reheating epoch, including its duration N
re"
"and EOS w
re
, depends"
"crucially upon how the inflaton couples with (and hence releases its energy into) other matter
fields in the universe. If this process is slow then reheating takes place perturbatively and
the inflaton scalar field oscillates for a very long time, gradually releasing its energy into
matter/radiation. In this case, the EOS during the oscillatory regime is determined primarily
by the shape of the inflaton potential near its minimum value, about which the inflaton
oscillates. Perturbative reheating in GR is expected to occur if the inflaton φ decays primarily
into fermions (which soon decay into the standard model fields), its decay into bosons being
strongly suppressed in the absence of the trilinear φχ2 interaction [11] 2."
"On the other hand, if the inflaton decays into bosons, χ, through a coupling g2φ2χ2 with
g ≫ 10−3, then oscillations of φ can lead to a parametric resonance during which quanta of
the field χ are produced in copious amounts. This stage is usually referred to as preheating
[11, 14–17]. The backreaction of χ on φ ends the resonance and the subsequent decay of
excitations of the φ and χ fields into standard model (SM) fields gives rise to reheating and
the subsequent thermalization of the universe at a temperature T"
"re
. The duration of the"
"pre-radiative epoch, which includes the end of inflation, the parametric resonance, the decay
of the inflaton into bosons (φ → χχ) and fermions (φ → ψ ψ) and thermalization can be
quite long, and it is convenient to encode its physics by means of an effective EOS parameter
w"
"re
. Since w"
"re
influences the spectrum of relic gravitational waves, observations of the GW"
"spectrum can shed light on the complex, non-linear and out of equilibrium physics which
operates during the reheating epoch."
"2The situation is changing dramatically in the case of strong non-minimal coupling of bosons to gravity [12,
13]."
"In addition to primordial tensor fluctuations which result in the GW background, a key
prediction of inflationary cosmology is the generation of primordial scalar fluctuations which
later grow to form the LSS of the universe. Scalar and tensor perturbations generated during
inflation create an imprint in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) which can be used
to deduce the scalar spectral index n"
"S
and the tensor to scalar ratio r – two important"
"observables which can be used to rule out competing inflationary models [6, 18]. However
it is well known that inflationary models often display degeneracies, with two (or more)
models predicting essentially the same values of {n"
"S
, r}. This leads to so called ‘cosmological"
"attractors’ or ‘universality classes’ of the inflationary scenario [19–21]. This degeneracy makes
it difficult for CMB observations alone to constitute a unique probe of inflationary cosmology
[22, 23]."
"In this paper we show that reheating predictions including the reheating duration N
re
,"
"temperature T
re"
"and particularly the EOS w
re
, can help break degeneracies in inflationary"
"scenario’s in which identical values of {n

"(k) is sensitive to the value of w
re
, observations"
"of Ω
GW"
"(k) by space-based GW observatories can shed valuable light both on the dynamics
of reheating as well as on the parameters of the inflationary potential."
"Our paper is organised as follows: section 2 demonstrates the existence of inflationary
degeneracies in the T-model and E-model α-attractors and in non-canonical inflation. In
section 3 we provide an introduction to reheating and discuss implications of reheating pre-
dictions on inflationary degeneracies in the aforementioned models. The spectrum of relic
GWs for the three inflationary models is determined in section 4 and a summary of our
results is presented in section 5."
2 Inflationary degeneracies
"It is well known that the inflationary scenario displays different sets of degeneracies in its
predictions for the CMB observables. These usually arise either because multiple inflationary
models predict similar values for the scalar spectral index n"
"S
and the tensor-to-scalar ratio r,"
"or because within the same model, the values of {n
S
, r} are insensitive to some of the model"
"parameters. We focus on three separate inflationary models and show that the degeneracies in
{n"
"S
, r} which they display can easily be broken by incorporating information obtained from"
"reheating predictions as well as using the associated relic gravitational wave background.
The models discussed in this paper are: the T-model and E-model α-attractors and the
non-canonical m2φ2 model."

with V (φ) ≃ V0. On the other hand small values, |λφ| ≪ mp describe the minimum of

"Note that these expressions do not depend upon the value of p in (2.7) as shown in

"One therefore finds that both the T-model (2.1) as well as the E-model (2.7) display
degeneracies, since the same values of {n"
"S
, r} can correspond to different values of p."
"Fortunately in both (2.1) and (2.7) this degeneracy can be broken once inflation ends
and the scalar field begins to oscillate. As we shall see later, Nk – the number of e-folds
between the Hubble exit of the CMB pivot scale and the end of inflation, is sensitive
to the post-inflationary reheating regime. Indeed in both models, close to its minimum
value, the potential has the form V ∝ φ2p, for which the mean EOS, w"
"osc
= 〈wφ〉,"
"is described by (2.3). In the perturbative reheating regime, parameters such as the
reheating duration N"
"re
and temperature T"
"re
are very sensitive to 〈wφ〉 = (p−1)/(p+1)"
"and hence to the value of p. Similarly the primordial GW background is also sensitive
to the value of p. Therefore a degeneracy in {n"
"S
, r} is easily broken if constraints"
"on the CMB observables {n
S
, r} are determined by taking into account the reheating"
"EOS. This can be further supplemented by the observations of the GW spectral density
parameter Ωg(k)."

"2
φ̇2 , (2.11)"
"where M has dimensions of mass while α is dimensionless. When α = 1 the Lagrangian
(2.11) reduces to the usual canonical scalar field Lagrangian L(X,φ) = X − V (φ)."

"which reduces to the canonical expression ρ

which reduces to the standard result
2Nk + 1
(2.21)
"for canonical scalars (α = 1). From (2.20) we find that increasing the value of the non-
canonical parameter α reduces the scalar-to-tensor ratio r; see figure 3. Comparing (2.20)"
"with (2.6) & (2.10) we find that α plays the same role as the parameter λ in the potentials
(2.1), (2.7). There therefore appears to be a close similarity, indeed a degeneracy, between
values of {n"
"S
, r} in the non-canonical m2φ2 model and in the T-model and Starobinsky"
"model, respectively. Interestingly, for a given value of Nk all three models have the same
value of n"
"S
. The value of r can also be identical in the three models by an appropriate choice"
"of λ and α. (Note that n
S
does not depend upon the free parameters λ and α present in the"
"α-attractor models and non-canonical models, respectively.)
The degeneracy in {n"
"S
, r} in the three inflationary models is easily broken by noting"
"that the equation of state during post-inflationary oscillations of the scalar field is markedly
different in canonical (2.3) and non-canonical (2.16) models. This implies that the spectrum
of the relic gravitational wave background will differ in canonical and non-canonical models.
To summarize, the relic GW background carries an important imprint of the post-inflationary
universe which can be used to break degeneracies in the inflationary parameters {n"
"S
, r}"
probed by the CMB.
3 Reheating
"A key feature of inflationary cosmology is that it allows the universe to reheat4 by transferring
the energy localized in the inflaton to the matter/radiative degrees of freedom present in the
universe."
"In potentials possessing a minimum, reheating can occur in two distinct ways: (i) per-
turbatively (slowly), (ii) rapidly – via a parametric resonance. Which of these two ways is
realized depends upon the nature of the coupling between the inflaton and bosons/fermions.
Below we provide a brief summary of perturbative and non-perturbative reheating in the
context which is relevant for this paper. The reader is referred to [11, 14–17] for more details
on the subject of reheating."
3.1 Perturbative reheating
"The perturbative theory of reheating after inflation corresponds to the case when the average
number of particles created in each Fourier mode k is small. It was first used already in the
same paper [1], where the R+R2 inflationary model was introduced, in order to obtain the
transition from the quasi-de Sitter (inflationary) stage to radiation dominated one through
an intermediate matter dominated stage. Its detailed presentation can be found in [38] and
more recently in [39]. In the context of the new inflationary scenario [3, 4] such theory was
later developed in [40]. Phenomenologically it amounts to adding a friction term Γφ̇ to the
classical equation of motion of the scalar field oscillating around the minimum of its potential
[40, 41]"
φ̈+ 3Hφ̇+ Γφ̇+ V ′(φ) = 0 . (3.1)
"The perturbative theory of reheating works well if either (a) the inflaton decays only into
fermions ψ through a hψψ̄φ coupling with h2 ≪ mφ/mp, or (b) the coupling of the inflaton
to bosons, χ, described by 1"
"2
g2φ2χ2 is weak with g ≪ 3× 10−4, making particle production"
via parametric resonance ineffective [11].
"4The term ‘reheating’ is a misnomer carried over from early models of inflation in which inflation began
from a thermalized initial state. In later models, such as chaotic inflation and those discussed in this paper,
the universe commences inflating from a non-radiation state and heats up only once, after inflation ends [5]."
"As noted in the previous section, close to their minimum value, the potentials discussed
in this paper have the general form V (φ) ∝ φ2p. Equation (3.1) suggests that the amplitude
of scalar field oscillations around this minimum decreases as"
"φmax ∝ a
−"
"−Γ t
2p"
which reduces to the standard result [11]
"φmax ∝ a−3/2 e−
1"
"2
Γ t (3.3)"
"for the chaotic potential V ∝ m2φ2.
Reheating in this perturbative scenario is complete when the (decreasing) expansion"
"rate becomes equal to the decay rate so that H ≃ Γ. Following thermalization, the reheating
temperature is given by Tr ≃ 0.1"
"Γmp which is independent of the duration of inflation and
the properties of V (φ). The fact that the coupling between matter and the inflaton can alter,
via radiative corrections, the shape of V (φ), places strong constraints on the total decay rate:
Γ < 10−20mp. This in turn implies that the reheating temperature in perturbative models
can be relatively small Tr < 10"
"9 GeV [11, 17].
It therefore follows that the post-inflationary oscillatory stage in models with perturba-"
"tive (slow) reheating can be quite long. It is important to note that during most of this stage
(while H ≫ Γ) the EOS of the oscillating scalar field is given by (2.3) namely 〈wφ〉 = p−1p+1 ."
"As pointed out in [10] and discussed in detail in section 4, the spectrum of relic gravita-
tional waves created during inflation is very sensitive to the post-inflationary EOS, w"
"re
, and"
"hence to the value of the inflationary parameter p. Observations of the GW spectrum can
therefore help in breaking the degeneracy between inflationary models which was pointed out
in section 2."
3.2 Non-perturbative reheating
"For inflationary models in which the main source of reheating is through the decay of the
inflaton into bosons, the universe thermalizes and reheats through a sequence of successive
stages."
"1. The first stage, sometimes called preheating, sees the commencement of a parametric
resonance brought about by coherent oscillations of the inflaton φ around the minimum
of its potential. The resonance can be either narrow or broad depending upon (a) the
value of coupling constant g in the interaction 1"
"2
g2φ2χ2 between the inflaton and the"
"bosonic field χ, (b) the scalar field amplitude Φ, (c) its effective mass, m2φ = V
′′. If"
"the resonance is broad (g2Φ2/m2φ
>∼ 1) then coherent oscillations of φ give rise to an"
"exponentially large number of quanta of the field χ in a discrete set of wave bands. (The
existence of self-interaction, such as the presence of a λφ4 term in the Lagrangian, can
also result in the creation of quanta of the φ field during oscillations.)"
"2. The second stage witnesses the backreaction of χ on φ (via scattering). This effect can
be quite significant and can lead to the termination of the resonance."
"3. During the third stage, which can be quite prolonged, quanta of the φ and χ fields trans-
fer their energy into other matter fields including radiation. The interaction between
the quanta of different fields leads to their thermalization and results in the universe
acquiring a reheating temperature Trh."
"Thus the end of the third stage sees the commencement of the radiation dominated stage
of expansion during which the EOS in the universe is p ≃ ǫ/3. The dynamics of the three
stages of reheating is quite complex and usually requires a numerical treatment [42]. It is
however quite instructive if one characterizes the pre-radiation stages (1) - (3) by an effective
EOS which, following [26, 29, 30], can be assumed to be a constant lying in the interval
−1/3 < w ≤ 1."
"As noted earlier, and discussed in detail in section 4, the pre-radiation EOS, w, affects
the spectrum of relic gravity waves produced during inflation. Future space-based GW ex-
periments might therefore shed light on this important parameter, and through it on the

usually characterized by a set of three parameters {w"

"at the end of reheating T

number of e-folds between the end of inflation ae and the end of reheating (commencement
of the radiation dominated epoch) are, given by Nre = log (are/ae). While Nre and Tre are
interesting physical quantities in their own right describing the epoch of reheating, they are
also potentially important for correctly interpreting the bounds on CMB observables such as
the scalar spectral index n"
"S

"around the minimum of a V ∝ φ2p potential the effective reheating EOS is given by (2.3),

"can then use (3.18) and (3.17) to obtain constraints on the duration of reheating N

"Equations (3.18) and (3.17) capture some of the essential implications of reheating kine-

easy to see, from equation (3.18), that for a softer reheating EOS with w"
"re

Exactly the opposite is true for a stiffer EOS with w"

"flips sign so that a larger value of N infk implies a larger Nre and hence a longer duration of
reheating. Similarly equation (3.17) implies that the longer is the duration of reheating N"
"the lower will be the reheating temperature T
re
. Moreover this result is independent of the"
"value of w
re
simply because 1+w"
"re
> 0 (since w"
"re
> −1/3 by definition). Another interesting"
"aspect of equation (3.18) is that, given an inflationary potential with a fixed value of N infk
(which satisfies the CMB bound on n"
"S
∈ [0.9607, 0.9691]), the duration of reheating N"
"re
in-"
"creases with an increase in the effective EOS w
re
as long as w"

that w = 1/3 is a critical value of the EOS during reheating."
"Turning our attention to T
re
, one notes that conservative upper and lower bounds on this"
"quantity can be placed from the following considerations. It is well known that the CMB
upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, namely r ≤ 0.06, translates into an upper bound
on the inflationary Hubble scale H infk ≤ 6.1×1013 GeV, which in turn sets an upper bound on
the energy scale of inflation Tinf ≤ 1.6×1016 GeV, as described in appendix B. Since reheating
happens after the end of inflation, one gets T"
"re
≤ 1.6×1016 GeV as an absolute upper bound"
"on the reheating temperature. Similarly, in order to preserve the success of the hot Big Bang
phase, reheating must terminate before the beginning of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)
yielding the absolute lower bound T"
"re
≥ 1 MeV. Hence the most conservative bounds on the"
"reheating temperature are
1MeV ≤ T"
"re
≤ 1016 GeV . (3.27)"

bounds on the CMB observables for a given inflationary potential by proceeding in the
following systematic way (also see [26, 27, 29, 30])"
– 16 –
"1. Given a slow-roll inflationary potential V (φ) with V ∝ φ2p as the asymptote during
reheating, the effective reheating equation of state is taken to be w"
"re
≡ 〈wφ〉 = p−1p+1 ."
"2. Given the strong CMB constraint on the scalar spectral index, namely n
S
∈ [0.9607, 0.9691],"
"we obtain a range of allowed values on φk from equation (3.22) and hence on N
inf

"equation (3.20). It is important to stress that this bound on N infk has been obtained
purely from CMB constraint on n"
"S
, without taking into account the reheating con-"
"straints on N
re
and T"
"re
yet, which we shall do in the next step."
"3. We can then use equation (3.18) to translate the bound on N infk to a bound on Nre
(as well as on T"
"re
using equation (3.17)). Note that N"
"re
might turn out to be negative"
"for some range of allowed values for N infk . Hence in the next step, we will discard the
corresponding range of N infk that yields unphysical negative values of Nre . This puts
additional tighter constraint on N infk ."
"4. Next, as discussed above, imposing the condition N
re
> 0 as well as demanding"
"∈ [1MeV, 1016 GeV], we obtain a tighter bound on N infk and hence subsequently
on {n"
"S
, r}."
"5. We tabulate the final allowed range of values for N infk , nS , r, Nre and Tre ."
"The importance of this procedure lies in the fact that it allows us to obtain reheating con-
sistent constraints on the CMB observables {n"
"S
, r}, which are tighter than those obtained in"
"[22]. In the following subsection we apply this methodology to determine reheating consis-
tent values of {n"

"potential. This will help us to break the inflationary degeneracies in these models. Later in
section 4, we will discuss the implications of the reheating constraints for the spectrum of
relic gravitational waves background."
"Before moving on, one should clarify that the above strategy is only applicable to infla-
tionary models with w"
"re
6= 1/3, which implies p 6= 2 in the potential V ∝ φ2p. For w"
"re

on the other hand, we have chosen λ = 1. Our choice for λ is motivated by the following
considerations:"
"1. These values of λ correspond to the degeneracy regions in which different values of p
result in the same values of {n"
"S

"2. Moreover, as shown in the right panels of figures 1 & 2, a larger value of λ corresponds
to a smaller value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. Our choice of λ = 0.4 (T-model) and
λ = 1 (E-model) corresponds to r ∼ 10−3 which lies within the observable range of
upcoming CMB missions such as the CMB-S4 [57] and the Simons Observatory [58]."
5 Discussion
"The inflationary paradigm often exhibits degeneracies, with two (or more) models predicting
essentially the same values of {n"
"S
, r}, leading to the existence of ‘cosmological attractors’ or"
"‘universality classes’ of inflation [19–21]. Such degeneracies render difficulties for the CMB
observations alone to constitute a unique probe of the inflationary dynamics. Such degenera-
cies usually emerge either because multiple inflationary potentials make similar predictions
for the scalar spectral index n"
"S
and the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, or because within the same"
"model, the predicted values of {n
S
, r} are insensitive to some of the model parameters in"
"the potential. In this work, we have demonstrated the existence of inflationary degeneracies
in two classes of α-attractor inflationary models, namely the T-model and E-model [19, 20]
discussed in section 2.1. Inflationary degeneracies have also been shown to exist in the non-
canonical framework of inflation [36, 37] discussed in section 2.2."
"In the context of the α-attractors, we have shown that the scalar spectral index n
S
be-"
"comes insensitive to the potential parameter λ (related to the curvature of the superconformal
Kähler metric [20]) as well as the exponent p, for λ > O(0.1). The tensor-to-scalar ratio r,
decreases with an increase in λ, and becomes insensitive to the exponent p for λ > O(0.1).
A similar degeneracy also exists with respect to the non-canonical parameter α in (2.11) in
non-canonical inflation, as demonstrated in figure 3."
"In section 3 we provided an introduction to the kinematics of reheating in terms of the
reheating parameters {w"
"re
, N"
"re
, T"
"re
}, and spelled out our strategy (developed along the lines"
"of [26, 29, 30]) for yielding tighter constraints on the CMB observables by taking into account
reheating constraints developed for the case of perturbative reheating. In sections 3.4 and
3.5, we demonstrated that the inflationary degeneracies of the T-model and the E-model"
– 31 –
"α-attractors can be easily broken by noting that the reheating EOS is very sensitive to the
parameter p. In particular, we showed that imposing the liberal reheating constraints N"
"re
> 0"
"and T
re
∈ [1MeV, 1016 GeV] on the α-attractor potentials, the CMB predictions for {n"
"S
, r}"
"got segregated into different regions of space, as illustrated in figure 6 and 7.
However for the case of quadratic potential in the non-canonical framework, we found"
"that reheating constraints are not able to break the degeneracy in {n
S
, r} appreciably, owing"
"to the fact that the non-canonical EOS, obeying
〈"
"< 0, does not include the critical"
"point of segregation w
re
= 1/3."
"In section 4, we showed that the spectrum of relic GWs could easily distinguish between
canonical and non-canonical inflation. We also demonstrated that by considering reheating
consistent tightened constraints on {n"
"S
, r}, the corresponding spectra of relic GWs could"
"help distinguish between different values of p in the T-model and the E-model α-attractors.
In particular, as illustrated in figure 12 and 13, we found that the relic GW background
generated for a stiffer reheating equation of state could be detectable by the future space
based GWs observatory BBO. We also concluded that for p = 3, the GW spectra do not
possess enough power to reach LISA sensitivity, in agreement with the conclusions drawn
in [46]. We plan to investigate the existence of degeneracies in a wider class of inflationary
model, including the universality class corresponding to the non-minimally coupled power-
law potentials [59] in a future work7. Probing thermal history of the universe by combining
CMB and GW observations was discussed in [60, 61]."
"In a scenario in which inflation is followed by a long duration of reheating (N
re
≥ 10), the"
"reheating temperature can be much lower than the energy scale of inflation, as demonstrated
by equation (3.17). In this case, a relatively stiffer post inflationary EOS w"
"re
= 〈wφ〉 > 1/3"
"exhibits interesting observational signatures in the form of blue tilted GWs, as seen from
(4.25). However [63, 64] noted that a sufficiently long period of reheating with an equation
of state w"
"re
≥ 0 might lead to scalar field fragmentation due to self resonance for potentials,"
"such as (2.1) and (2.7), which behave like V (φ) ∝ φ2p during reheating while possessing
asymptotically flat wing/wings for larger field values. In the context of α-attractors, the
regime of scalar field fragmentation corresponds to λ ≫ 1 in (2.1) and (2.7). For p = 1, the
effective equation of state remains w"
"re
= 〈wφ〉 = 0, independently of whether fragmentation"
"occurs or not [64]. For p = 2, fragmentation occurs for λ ≫ 1 and within a few e-folds, the
effective EOS becomes w"
"re
≃ 1/3 which is the same as 〈wφ〉. So our analysis for p = 1, 2"
"remains unaltered independently of the value of λ. Coming to the case of p = 3, fragmentation
occurs for λ ≫ 1 and the effective EOS, within a few e-folds, becomes w"
"re
≃ 1/3 which is"
"different from 〈wφ〉 = 1/2. However fragmentation is effective only for λ ≫ 1, for which
the tensor to scalar ratio is extremely small, namely r ≪ 10−3, rendering it undetectable
by planned CMB missions. We therefore conclude that, as long as λ is not too large, our
analysis remains robust even for the case of p = 3."
"Our analysis in this paper was carried out within the framework of the perturbative
theory of reheating. In the case of non-perturbative reheating, the physics of the reheating
epoch can be quite complex. In this case, one usually assumes the effective w"
"re
to be a"
"constant for the sake of simplicity [26, 29, 30]. During the initial stage of preheating, particle
production occurs in a rapid and explosive manner due to parametric resonance. However the
backreaction of created particles usually leads to the termination of the resonance after which"

"the universe reheats via the slow perturbative decay of the inflaton. As long as the duration
of preheating is short, ∆N ≤ 1, and the inflaton dominates the energy budget of the universe,
our analysis may also be extended to the case of non-perturbative reheating by assuming that
a fraction ‘q’ of the energy density ρe remains in the inflaton after the termination of the
resonance. Accordingly the modified form of equation (3.18) can be written as"
