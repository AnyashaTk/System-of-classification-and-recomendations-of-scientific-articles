observations of SH (upper limits) – we perform a systematic study of the chemistry of sulfur-bearing hydrides. We self-consistently
determine their column densities using coupled excitation, radiative transfer as well as chemical formation and destruction models.
We revise some of the key gas-phase reactions that lead to their chemical synthesis. This includes ab initio quantum calculations of
the vibrational-state-dependent reactions SH+ + H2(v)� H2S+ + H and S + H2 (v)� SH + H. We find that reactions of UV-pumped
H2(v≥ 2) molecules with S+ ions explain the presence of SH+ in a high thermal-pressure gas component, Pth/k≈ 108 cm−3 K, close to
the H2 dissociation front (at AV < 2 mag). These PDR layers are characterized by no or very little depletion of elemental sulfur from
the gas. However, subsequent hydrogen abstraction reactions of SH+, H2S+, and S atoms with vibrationally excited H2, fail to form
enough H2S+, H3S+, and SH to ultimately explain the observed H2S column density (∼2.5×1014 cm−2, with an ortho-to-para ratio of
2.9± 0.3; consistent with the high-temperature statistical value). To overcome these bottlenecks, we build PDR models that include a
simple network of grain surface reactions leading to the formation of solid H2S (s-H2S). The higher adsorption binding energies of S
and SH suggested by recent studies imply that S atoms adsorb on grains (and form s-H2S) at warmer dust temperatures (Td < 50 K) and
closer to the UV-illuminated edges of molecular clouds. We show that everywhere s-H2S mantles form(ed), gas-phase H2S emission
lines will be detectable. Photodesorption and, to a lesser extent, chemical desorption, produce roughly the same H2S column density
(a few 1014 cm−2) and abundance peak (a few 10−8) nearly independently of nH and G0. This agrees with the observed H2S column
density in the Orion Bar as well as at the edges of dark clouds without invoking substantial depletion of elemental sulfur abundances."

1. Introduction
"Hydride molecules play a pivotal role in interstellar chemistry
(e.g., Gerin et al. 2016), being among the first molecules to
form in diffuse interstellar clouds and at the UV-illuminated
edges of dense star-forming clouds, so-called photodissociation
regions (PDRs; Hollenbach & Tielens 1997). Sulfur is on the
top ten list of most abundant cosmic elements and it is par-
ticularly relevant for astrochemistry and star-formation studies.
Its low ionization potential (10.4 eV) makes the photoionization
of S atoms a dominant source of electrons in molecular gas at
intermediate visual extinctions AV ' 2 - 4 mag (Sternberg & Dal-
garno 1995; Goicoechea et al. 2009; Fuente et al. 2016)."
"The sulfur abundance, [S/H], in diffuse clouds (e.g., Howk
et al. 2006) is very close to the [S/H] measured in the solar
photosphere ([S/H]� ' 1.4×10"
"−5; Asplund et al. 2009). Still, the
observed abundances of S-bearing molecules in diffuse and
translucent molecular clouds (nH ' 102 − 103 cm−3) make up a"
"very small fraction, < 1 %, of the sulfur nuclei (mostly locked
as S+; Tieftrunk et al. 1994; Turner 1996; Lucas & Liszt 2002;
Neufeld et al. 2015). In colder dark clouds and dense cores
shielded from stellar UV radiation, most sulfur is expected in
molecular form. However, the result of adding the abundances
of all detected gas-phase S-bearing molecules is typically a
factor of ∼102-103 lower than [S/H]� (e.g., Fuente et al. 2019).
Hence, it is historically assumed that sulfur species deplete
on grain mantles at cold temperatures and high densities (e.g.,
Graedel et al. 1982; Millar & Herbst 1990; Agúndez & Wake-
lam 2013). However, recent chemical models predict that the
major sulfur reservoir in dark clouds can be either gas-phase
neutral S atoms (Vidal et al. 2017; Navarro-Almaida et al. 2020)
or organo-sulfur species trapped on grains (Laas & Caselli 2019).
Unfortunately, it is difficult to overcome this dichotomy from an
observational perspective. In particular, no ice carrier of an abun-
dant sulfur reservoir other than solid OCS (hereafter s-OCS, with
an abundance of ∼10−8 with respect to H nuclei; Palumbo et al."

"1997) has been convincingly identified. Considering the large
abundances of water ice (s-H2O) grain mantles in dense molec-
ular clouds and cold protostellar envelopes (see reviews by van
Dishoeck 2004; Gibb et al. 2004; Dartois 2005), one may also ex-
pect hydrogen sulfide (s-H2S) to be the dominant sulfur reservoir.
Indeed, s-H2S is the most abundant S-bearing ice in comets such
as 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (Calmonte et al. 2016). How-
ever, only upper limits to the s-H2S abundance of .1 % relative to
water ice have so far been estimated toward a few interstellar sight-
lines (e.g., Smith 1991; Jiménez-Escobar & Muñoz Caro 2011).
These values imply a maximum s-H2S ice abundance of
several 10−6 with respect to H nuclei. Still, this upper limit could
be higher if s-H2S ices are well mixed with s-H2O and s-CO ices
(Brittain et al. 2020)."
"The bright rims of molecular clouds illuminated by nearby
massive stars are intermediate environments between diffuse and
cold dark clouds. Such environments host the transition from
ionized S+ to neutral atomic S, as well as the gradual formation
of S-bearing molecules (Sternberg & Dalgarno 1995). In one
prototypical low-illumination PDR, the edge of the Horsehead
nebula, Goicoechea et al. (2006) inferred very modest gas-phase
sulfur depletions. In addition, the detection of narrow sulfur radio
recombination lines in dark clouds (implying the presence of S+;
Pankonin & Walmsley 1978) is an argument against large sulfur
depletions in the mildly illuminated surfaces of these clouds.
The presence of new S-bearing molecules such as S2H, the first
(and so far only) doubly sulfuretted species detected in a PDR
(Fuente et al. 2017), suggests that the chemical pathways leading
to the synthesis of sulfuretted species are not well constrained;
and that the list of S-bearing molecules is likely not complete."
"Interstellar sulfur chemistry is unusual compared to that
of other elements in that none of the simplest species,
X=S, S+, SH, SH+, or H2S+, react exothermically with H2 (v= 0)
in the initiation reactions X + H2 → XH + H (so-called hydrogen
abstraction reactions). Hence, one would expect a slow sul-
fur chemistry and very low abundances of SH+ (sulfanylium)
and SH (mercapto) radicals in cold interstellar gas. However,
H2S (Lucas & Liszt 2002), SH+ (Menten et al. 2011; Godard
et al. 2012), and SH (Neufeld et al. 2012, 2015) have been de-
tected in low-density diffuse clouds (nH . 100 cm−3) through
absorption measurements of their ground-state rotational lines1.
In UV-illuminated gas, most sulfur atoms are ionized, but the
very high endothermicity of reaction"

"(E / k = 9860 K, e.g., Zanchet et al. 2013a, 2019) prevents
this reaction from being efficient unless the gas is heated
to very high temperatures. In diffuse molecular clouds
(on average at Tk ∼ 100 K), the formation of SH+ and SH only
seems possible in the context of local regions of overheated gas
subjected to magnetized shocks (Pineau des Forets et al. 1986) or
in dissipative vortices of the interstellar turbulent cascade (Godard
et al. 2012, 2014). In these tiny pockets (∼100 AU in size), the
gas would attain the hot temperatures (Tk ' 1000 K) and/or ion-
neutral drift needed to overcome the endothermicities of the above
hydrogen abstraction reactions (see, e.g., Neufeld et al. 2015)."
"Dense PDRs (nH ' 103 − 106 cm−3) offer a complementary
environment to study the first steps of sulfur chemistry. Because
of their higher densities and more quiescent gas, fast shocks or
turbulence dissipation do not contribute to the gas heating. In-
stead, the molecular gas is heated to Tk . 500 K by mechanisms"
"1 SH was first reported by IR spectroscopy toward the cirumstellar
envelope around the evolved star R Andromedae (Yamamura et al. 2000)."
"that depend on the flux of far-UV photons (FUV; E <13.6 eV).
A different perspective of the H2 (v) reactivity emerges because
certain endoergic reactions become exoergic and fast when a
significant fraction of the H2 reagents are radiatively pumped to
vibrationally excited states v ≥ 1 (Stecher & Williams 1972; Free-
man & Williams 1982; Tielens & Hollenbach 1985; Sternberg
& Dalgarno 1995). In this case, state-specific reaction rates for
H2 (ν, J) are needed to make realistic predictions of the abundance
of the product XH (Agúndez et al. 2010; Zanchet et al. 2013b;
Faure et al. 2017). The presence of abundant FUV-pumped
H2 (v≥ 1) triggers a nonthermal “hot” chemistry. Indeed, CH+
and SH+ emission lines have been detected in the Orion Bar PDR
(Nagy et al. 2013; Goicoechea et al. 2017) where H2 lines up to
v= 10 have been detected as well (Kaplan et al. 2017)."
"In this study we present a systematic (observational and
modeling) study of the chemistry of S-bearing hydrides in
FUV-illuminated gas. We try to answer the question of whether
gas-phase reactions of S atoms and SH+ molecules with vibra-
tionally excited H2 can ultimately explain the presence of abun-
dant H2S, or if grain surface chemistry has to be invoked."

2. Observations of S-bearing hydrides
2.1. The Orion Bar
"At an adopted distance of ∼414 pc, the Orion Bar is an interface
of the Orion molecular cloud and the Huygens H ii region that
surrounds the Trapezium cluster (Genzel & Stutzki 1989; O’Dell
2001; Bally 2008; Goicoechea et al. 2019, 2020; Pabst et al. 2019,
2020). The Orion Bar is a prototypical strongly illuminated dense
PDR. The impinging flux of stellar FUV photons (G0) is a few
104 times the mean interstellar radiation field (Habing 1968). The
Bar is seen nearly edge-on with respect to the FUV illuminating
sources, mainly θ1 Ori C, the most massive star in the Trapezium.
This favorable orientation allows observers to spatially resolve the
H+-to-H transition (the ionization front or IF; see, e.g., Walmsley
et al. 2000; Pellegrini et al. 2009) from the H-to-H2 transition
(the dissociation front or DF; see, e.g., Allers et al. 2005; van
der Werf et al. 1996, 2013; Wyrowski et al. 1997; Cuadrado et al.
2019). It also allows one to study the stratification of different
molecular species as a function of cloud depth (i.e., as the flux
of FUV photons is attenuated; see, e.g., Tielens et al. 1993; van
der Wiel et al. 2009; Habart et al. 2010; Goicoechea et al. 2016;
Parikka et al. 2017; Andree-Labsch et al. 2017)."

"Regarding sulfur2, several studies previously reported the
detection of S-bearing molecules in the Orion Bar. These include
CS, C34S, SO, SO2, and H2S (Hogerheijde et al. 1995; Jansen
et al. 1995), SO+ (Fuente et al. 2003), C33S, HCS+, H2CS, and NS
(Leurini et al. 2006), and SH+ (Nagy et al. 2013). These detections
refer to modest angular resolution pointed observations using
single-dish telescopes. Higher-angular-resolution interferometric
imaging of SH+, SO, and SO+ (Goicoechea et al. 2017) was
possible thanks to the Atacama Compact Array (ACA)."
2.2. Observations of H2S isotopologues and H3S+
"We observed the Orion Bar with the IRAM 30 m telescope at
Pico Veleta (Spain). We used the EMIR receivers in combination
with the Fast Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) backends at
200 kHz resolution (∼0.4 km s−1, ∼0.3 km s−1, and ∼0.2 km s−1 at
∼168 GHz, ∼217 GHz, and ∼293 GHz, respectively). These obser-
vations are part of a complete line survey covering the frequency
range 80− 360 GHz (Cuadrado et al. 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019)
and include deep integrations at 168 GHz toward three positions
of the PDR located at a distance of 14′′, 40′′, and 65′′ from the
IF (see Fig. 1). Their offsets with respect to the IF position at
α2000 = 05h 35m 20.1s , δ2000 = − 05◦25′07.0′′ are (+10′′, -10′′),
(+30′′, -30′′’), and (+35′′, -55′′). The first position is the DF."
"We carried out these observations in the position switching
mode taking a distant reference position at (−600′′, 0′′). The
half power beam width (HPBW) at ∼168 GHz, ∼217 GHz, and
∼293 GHz is ∼15′′, ∼11′′, and ∼8′′, respectively. The latest obser-
vations (those at 168 GHz) were performed in March 2020. The
data were first calibrated in the antenna temperature scale T ∗A and
then converted to the main beam temperature scale, Tmb, using"
"2 Sulfur has four stable isotopes, in decreasing order of abundance:
32S (IN = 0), 34S (IN = 0), 33S (IN = 3/2), and 36S (IN = 0), where IN is the
nuclear spin. The most abundant isotope is here simply referred to as S."
"Tmb = T ∗A/ηmb, where ηmb is the antenna efficiency (ηmb = 0.74 at
∼168 GHz). We reduced and analyzed the data using the GILDAS
software as described in Cuadrado et al. (2015). The typical rms
noise of the spectra is ∼3.5, 5.3, and 7.8 mK per velocity channel
at ∼168 GHz, ∼217 GHz, and ∼293 GHz, respectively. Figures 1
and 2 show the detection of o-H2S 11,0 − 10,1 (168.7 GHz),
p-H2S 22,0 − 21,1 (216.7 GHz), and o-H234S 11,0 − 10,1 lines
(167.9 GHz) (see Table E.1 for the line parameters), as well as
several o-H233S 11,0 − 10,1 hyperfine lines (168.3 GHz)."
"We complemented our dataset with higher frequency H2S
lines detected by the Herschel Space Observatory (Nagy et al.
2017) toward the “CO+ peak” position (Stoerzer et al. 1995),
which is located at only ∼4′′ from our DF position (i.e., within the
HPBW of these observations). These observations were carried
out with the HIFI receiver (de Graauw et al. 2010) at a spectral-
resolution of 1.1 MHz (0.7 km s−1 at 500 GHz). HIFI’s HPBW
range from ∼42′′ to ∼20′′ in the 500 - 1000 GHz window (Roelf-
sema et al. 2012). The list of additional hydrogen sulfide lines
detected by Herschel includes the o-H2S 22,1 − 21,2 (505.5 GHz),
21,2 − 10,1 (736.0 GHz), and 30,3 − 21,2 (993.1 GHz), as well as the
p-H2S 20,2 − 11,1 (687.3 GHz) line. We used the line intensities,
in the Tmb scale, shown in Table A.1 of Nagy et al. (2017)."
"In order to get a global view of the Orion Bar, we also ob-
tained 2.5′ × 2.5′ maps of the region observed by us with the
IRAM 30 m telescope using the 330 GHz EMIR receiver and
the FTS backend at 200 kHz spectral-resolution (∼0.2 km s−1).
On-the-fly (OTF) scans were obtained along and perpendicular to
the Bar. The resulting spectra were gridded to a data cube through
convolution with a Gaussian kernel providing a final resolution of
∼8′′. The total integration time was ∼6 h. The achieved rms noise
is ∼1 K per resolution channel. Figure 1 shows the spatial distri-
bution of the 13CO J=3-2 (330.5 GHz) and SO 89-78 (346.5 GHz)
integrated line intensities."

2.3. ALMA imaging of Orion Bar edge in SH+ emission
"We carried out mosaics of a small field of the Orion Bar us-
ing twenty-seven ALMA 12 m antennas in band 7 (at ∼346 GHz).
These unpublished observations belong to project 2012.1.00352.S
(P.I.: J. R. Goicoechea) and consisted of a 27-pointing mosaic
centered at α(2000) = 5h35m20.6s; δ(2000) = -05o25′20′′. The
total field-of-view (FoV) is 58′′×52′′ (shown in Fig. 1). The two
hyperfine line components of the SH+ NJ = 10 − 01 transition
were observed with correlators providing ∼500 kHz resolution
(0.4 km s−1) over a 937.5 MHz bandwidth. The total observation
time with the ALMA 12 m array was ∼2h. In order to recover the
large-scale extended emission filtered out by the interferometer,
we used deep and fully sampled single-dish maps, obtained with
the total-power (TP) antennas at 19′′ resolution, as zero- and
short-spacings. Data calibration procedures and image synthesis
steps are described in Goicoechea et al. (2016). The synthesized
beam is ∼1′′. This is a factor of ∼4 better than previous inter-
ferometric SH+ observations (Goicoechea et al. 2017). Figure 3
shows the resulting image of the SH+ 10 − 01 F = 1/2-3/2 hyper-
fine emission line at 345.944 GHz. We rotated this image 37.5o
clockwise to bring the FUV illumination in the horizontal di-
rection. The typical rms noise of the final cube is ∼ 80 mK per
velocity channel and 1′′-beam. As expected from their Einstein
coefficients, the other F = 1/2-1/2 hyperfine line component at
345.858 GHz is a factor of ∼2 fainter (see Table E.2) and the
resulting image has low signal-to-noise (S/N)."
"We complemented the SH+ dataset with the higher fre-
quency lines observed by HIFI (Nagy et al. 2013, 2017) at
∼526 GHz and ∼683 GHz (upper limit). These pointed observa-
tions have HPBWs of ∼41′′ and ∼32′′ respectively, thus they
do not spatially resolve the SH+ emission. To determine their
beam coupling factors ( fb), we smoothed the bigger 4′′-resolution
ACA + TP SH+ image shown in Goicoechea et al. (2017) to the
different HIFI’s HPBWs. We obtain fb ' 0.4 at ∼526 GHz and
fb ' 0.6 at ∼683 GHz. The corrected intensities are computed as
Wcorr = WHIFI / fb. These correction factors are only a factor of . 2
lower than simply assuming uniform SH+ emission from a 10′′
width filament."
2.4. SOFIA/GREAT search for SH emission
"We finally used the GREAT receiver (Heyminck et al. 2012)
on board the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astron-
omy (SOFIA; Young et al. 2012) to search for the lowest-
energy rotational lines of SH (2Π3/2 J = 3/2-1/2) at 1382.910 and
1383.241 GHz (e.g., Klisch et al. 1996; Martin-Drumel et al.
2012). These lines lie in a frequency gap that Herschel/HIFI
could not observe from space. These SOFIA observations belong
to project 07_0115 (P.I.: J. R. Goicoechea). The SH lines were
searched on the lower side band of 4GREAT band 3. We em-
ployed the 4GREAT/HFA frontends and 4GFFT spectrometers
as backends. The HPBW of SOFIA at 1.3 THz is ∼20′′, thus
comparable with IRAM 30 m/EMIR and Herschel/HIFI observa-
tions. We also employed the total power mode with a reference
position at (−600′′,0′′). The original plan was to observe during
two flights in November 2019 but due to bad weather conditions,
only ∼70 min of observations were carried out in a single flight."
"After calibration, data reduction included: removal of a first
order spectral baseline, dropping scans with problematic receiver
response, rms weighted average of the spectral scans, and cali-
bration to Tmb intensity scale (ηmb = 0.71). The final spectrum,
smoothed to a velocity-resolution of 1 km s−1 has a rms noise of
∼50 mK (shown in Fig. 4). Two emission peaks are seen at the"

"frequencies of the Λ-doublet lines. Unfortunately, the achieved
rms is not enough to assure the unambiguous detection of each
component of the doublet. Although the stacked spectrum does
display a single line (suggesting a tentative detection) the re-
sulting line-width (∆v' 7 km s−1) is a factor of ∼3 broader than
expected in the Orion Bar (see Table E.3). Hence, this spectrum
provides stringent upper limits to the SH column density but
deeper integrations would be needed to confirm the detection."
3. Observational results
"3.1. H232S, H234S, and H233S across the PDR"
"Figure 1 shows an expanded view of the Orion Bar in the
13CO (J = 3-2) emission. FUV radiation from the Trapezium stars
comes from the upper-right corner of the image. The FUV ra-
diation field is attenuated in the direction perpendicular to the
Bar. The infrared H2 v= 1–0 S (1) line emission (white contours)
delineates the position of the H-to-H2 transition, the DF. Many
molecular species, such as SO, specifically emit from deeper
inside the PDR where the flux of FUV photons has consider-
ably decreased. In contrast, H2S, and even its isotopologue H342 S,
show bright 11,0-10,1 line emission toward the DF (right panels
in Fig. 1; see also Jansen et al. 1995). Rotationally excited H2S
lines have been also detected toward this position (Nagy et al.
2017), implying the presence of warm H2S close to the irradiated
cloud surface (i.e., at relatively low extinctions). The presence
of moderately large H2S column densities in the PDR is also
demonstrated by the unexpected detection of the rare isotopo-
logue H332 S toward the DF (at the correct LSR velocity of the
PDR: vLSR ' 10.5 km s−1). Figure 2 shows the H332 S 11,0-10,1 line
and its hyperfine splittings (produced by the 33S nuclear spin). To
our knowledge, H332 S lines had only been reported toward the hot

We rotated these images (all showing the same FoV) with respect to Fig. 1 to bring the FUV illuminating direction in the horizontal direction (from
the right). The circle shows the DF position targeted with SOFIA in SH (20′′ beam) and with the IRAM 30m telescope in H2S and H3S+."
3.2. SH+ emission from the PDR edge
"Figure 3 zooms into a small field of the Bar edge. The ALMA
image of the CO J = 3-2 line peak temperature was first presented
by Goicoechea et al. (2016). Because the CO J = 3-2 emission
is nearly thermalized and optically thick from the DF to the
molecular cloud interior, the line peak temperature scale (Tpeak)
is a good proxy of the gas temperature (Tk 'Tex 'Tpeak). The CO
image implies small temperature variations around Tk ' 200 K.
The middle panel in Fig. 3 shows the ALMA image of the SH+
NJ = 10-01 F = 1/2-3/2 hyperfine line at 345.944 GHz. Compared
to CO, the SH+ emission follows the edge of the molecular PDR,
akin to a filament of ∼10′′ width (for the spatial distribution
of other molecular ions, see, Goicoechea et al. 2017). The SH+
emission shows localized small-scale emission peaks (density or
column density enhancements) that match, or are very close to,
the vibrationally excited H2 (v= 1-0) emission (Fig. 3). We note
that while some H2 (v= 1-0) emission peaks likely coincide with
gas density enhancements (e.g., Burton et al. 1990), the region
also shows extended emission from FUV-pumped H2 (v= 2-1)
(van der Werf et al. 1996) that does not necessarily coincide with
the H2 (v= 1-0) emission peaks."
"Fig. 4. Search for the SH 2Π3/2 J=5/2-3/2 doublet (at ∼1383 GHz) to-

"3.3. Search for SH, H3S+, and H2S ν2 = 1 emission"
"We used SOFIA/GREAT to search for SH 2Π3/2 J=5/2-3/2 lines
toward the DF (Fig. 4). This would have been the first time
that interstellar SH rotational lines were seen in emission.
Unfortunately, the achieved rms of the observation does not al-
low a definitive confirmation of these lines, so here we will only
discuss upper limits to the SH column density. The red, green,
and blue curves in Fig. 4 show radiative transfer models for
nH = 106 cm−3, Tk = 200 K, and different SH column densities
(see Sect. 4 for more details)."
"Our IRAM 30 m observations toward the DF neither resulted
in a detection of H3S+, a key gas-phase precursor of H2S. The
∼293.4 GHz spectrum around the targeted H3S+ 10-00 line is
shown in Fig. 5. Again, the achieved low rms allows us to provide
a sensitive upper limit to the H3S+ column density. This results
in N(H3S+) =(5.5-7.5)×1010 cm−2 (5σ) assuming an excitation
temperature range Tex = 10-30 K and extended emission. Given
the bright H2S emission close to the edge of the Orion Bar, and be-
cause H2S formation at the DF might be driven by very exoergic
processes, we also searched for the 11,0-10,1 line of vibrationally
excited H2S (in the bending mode ν2). The frequency of this line
lies at ∼181.4 GHz (Azzam et al. 2013), thus at the end of our
2 mm-band observations of the DF (rms' 16 mK). However, we
do not detect this line either."

4. Coupled nonlocal excitation and chemistry
"In this section we study the rotational excitation of the observed
S-bearing hydrides3. We determine the SH+, SH (upper limit),
and H2S column densities in the Orion Bar, and the “average” gas
physical conditions in the sense that we search for the combina-
tion of single Tk, nH, and N that better reproduces the observed
line intensities (so-called “single-slab” approach). In Sect. 6 we
expand these excitation models to multi-slab calculations that
take into account the expected steep gradients in a PDR."
"In the ISM, rotationally excited levels are typically populated
by inelastic collisions. However, the lifetime of very reactive
molecules can be so short that the details of their formation and
destruction need to be taken into account when determining how
these levels are actually populated (Black 1998). Reactive col-
lisions (collisions that lead to a reaction and thus to molecule
destruction) influence the excitation of these species when their
timescales become comparable to those of nonreactive collisions.
The lifetime of reactive molecular ions observed in PDRs (e.g.,
Fuente et al. 2003; Nagy et al. 2013; van der Tak et al. 2013;
Goicoechea et al. 2017, 2019) can be so short that they do not
get thermalized by nonreactive collisions or by absorption of the
background radiation field (Black 1998). In these cases, a proper
treatment of the molecule excitation requires including chemi-
cal formation and destruction rates in the statistical equilibrium
equations (dni / dt = 0) that determine the level populations:∑"

"coefficients and k stands for H2, H, and e−), and J̄i j is the
mean intensity of the total radiation field over the line profile.
In these equations, ni Di is the destruction rate per unit vol-
ume of the molecule in level i, and Fi its formation rate per
unit volume (both in cm−3s−1). When state-to-state formation
rates are not available, and assuming that the destruction rate is
the same in every level (Di = D), one can use the total destruc-
tion rate D [s−1] (="
"∑
k nk kk(T ) + photodestruction rate, where"
"kk [cm3s−1] is the state-averaged rate of the two-body chemical
reaction with species k) and consider that the level populations
of the nascent molecule follow a Boltzmann distribution at an
effective formation temperature Tform:"
"Fi = F gi e
−Ei/kTform /Q(Tform). (7)"
"In this formalism, F [cm−3 s−1] is the state-averaged formation
rate per unit volume, gi the degeneracy of level i, and Q(Tform) is
the partition function at Tform (van der Tak et al. 2007).
3 Readers interested only in the chemistry of these species and in depth-
dependent PDR models could directly jump to Section 6.
4 We use the following inelastic collision rate coefficients γi j:
• SH+– e−, including hyperfine splittings (Hamilton et al. 2018).
• SH+– o-H2 and p-H2, including hyperfine splittings (Dagdigian 2019).
• SH+– H, including hyperfine splittings (Lique et al. 2020).
• o-H2S and p-H2S with o-H2 and p-H2 (Dagdigian 2020).
• SH– He, including fine-structure splittings (Kłos et al. 2009)."
"This “formation pumping” formalism has been previously
implemented in large velocity gradient codes to treat, for example,
the local excitation of the very reactive ion CH+ (Nagy et al. 2013;
Godard & Cernicharo 2013; Zanchet et al. 2013b; Faure et al.
2017). However, interstellar clouds are inhomogeneous and gas
velocity gradients are typically modest at small spatial scales.
This means that line photons can be absorbed and reemitted
several times before leaving the cloud. Here we implemented
this formalism in a Monte Carlo code that explicitly models the
nonlocal behavior of the excitation and radiative transfer problem
(see Appendix of Goicoechea et al. 2006)."
"Although radiative pumping by dust continuum photons does
not generally dominate in PDRs, for completeness we also in-
cluded radiative excitation by a modified blackbody at a dust
temperature of ∼50 K and a dust opacity τλ = 0.03 (150/λ[µm])1.6
(which reproduces the observed intensity and wavelength depen-
dence of the dust emission in the Bar; Arab et al. 2012). The
molecular gas fraction, f (H2) = 2n(H2)/nH, is set to 2/3, where
nH = n(H) + 2n(H2) is the total density of H nuclei. This choice
is appropriate for the dissociation front and implies n(H2) = n(H).
As most electrons in the DF come from the ionization of carbon
atoms, the electron density ne is set to ne ' n(C+) = 1.4×10−4 nH
(e.g., Cuadrado et al. 2019). For the inelastic collisions with o-H2
and p-H2, we assumed that the H2 ortho-to-para (OTP) ratio is
thermalized to the gas temperature."
4.1. SH+ excitation and column density
"We start by assuming that the main destruction pathway of
SH+ are reactions with H atoms and recombinations with
electrons (see Sect. 6.1). Hence, the SH+ destruction rate is
D' ne ke(T ) + n(H) kH(T ) (see Table 1 for the relevant chemi-
cal destruction rates). For Tk = Te = 200 K and nH = 106 cm−3
(e.g., Goicoechea et al. 2016) this implies D' 10−4 s−1 (i.e., the
lifetime of an SH+ molecule in the Bar is less than 3 h). At
these temperatures and densities, D is about ten times smaller
than the rate of radiative and inelastic collisional transitions that
depopulate the lowest-energy rotational levels of SH+. Hence,
formation pumping does not significantly alter the excitation of
the observed SH+ lines, but it does influence the population of
higher-energy levels. Formation pumping effects have been read-
ily seen in CH+ because this species is more reactive5 and its
rotationally excited levels lie at higher-energy (i.e., their inelastic
collision pumping rates are slower, e.g., Zanchet et al. 2013b)"
"Figure 6 shows results of several models: without
formation pumping (dotted curves for model “F = D = 0”),
adding formation pumping with SH+ destruction by H
and e− (continuous curves for model “F,D”), and using
a factor of ten higher SH+ destruction rates (simulating a
dominant role of SH+ photodissociation or destruction by
reactions with vibrationally excited H2; dashed curves for
model “F,D ×10”). Since the formation of SH+ is driven by
reaction (1) when H2 molecules are in v≥ 2, here we adopted
Tform ' E(v= 2, J = 0) / k− 9860 K≈ 2000 K. Because these are
constant column density N(SH+) excitation and radiative transfer
models, we used a normalized formation rate F ="

the observed line intensities in the Orion Bar. Dotted curves are for a
standard model (F = D = 0). Continuous curves are for a model that
includes chemical destruction by H atoms and e− (model F,D). Dashed
lines are for a model in which destruction rates are multiplied by ten
(model F,D ×10). The vertical black line marks the best model."
"The detected SH+ rotational lines connect the fine-structure
levels NJ = 10-01 (345 GHz) and 12-01 (526 GHz). Upper limits
also exist for the 11-01 (683 GHz) lines. SH+ critical densities
(ncr = Ai j / γi j) for inelastic collisions with H or H2 are of the same
order and equal to several 106 cm−3. As for many molecular ions
(e.g., Desrousseaux et al. 2021), SH+–H2 (and SH+–H) inelastic
collisional rate coefficients4 are large (γi j & 10−10 cm3 s−1). Thus,
collisions with H (at low AV ) and H2 (at higher AV ) generally dom-
inate over collisions with electrons (γi j of a few 10−7 cm3 s−1). At
low densities (meaning nH < ncr) formation pumping increases
the population of the higher-energy levels (and their Tex), but
there are only minor effects in the low-energy submillimeter
lines. At high densities, nH > 107 cm−3, formation pumping with
Tform = 2000 K produces lower intensities in these lines because
the lowest-energy levels (Eu/k<Tk <Tform) are less populated."
"The best fit to the observed lines in model F, D is
for N(SH+)' 1.1×1013 cm−3, nH ' 3×105 cm−3, and Tk ' 200 K.
This is shown by the vertical dotted line in Fig. 6. This
model is consistent with the upper limit intensity of the
683 GHz line (Nagy et al. 2013). In this comparison, and fol-
lowing the morphology of the SH+ emission revealed by
ALMA (Fig. 3), we corrected the line intensities of the SH+
lines detected by Herschel/HIFI with the beam coupling fac-
tors discussed in Sec. 2.3, The observed 12-01/10-01 line ra-
tio (R = W(526.048)/W(345.944)' 2) is sensitive to the gas den-
sity. In these models, R is 1.1 for nH = 105 cm−3 and 3.0 for
nH =106 cm−3. We note that nH could be lower if SH+ forma-
tion/destruction rates were faster, as in the F,D ×10 model. This
could happen if SH+ photodissociation or destruction reactions
with H2(v≥2) were faster than reactions of SH+ with H atoms or
with electrons. In Sec. 6 we show that this is not the case."
4.2. SH excitation and column density
"SH is a 2Π open-shell radical with fine-structure, Λ-doubling, and
hyperfine splittings (e.g., Martin-Drumel et al. 2012). However,
the frequency separation of the SH 2Π3/2 J = 5/2-3/2 hyperfine
components is too small to be spectrally resolved in observations
of the Orion Bar (see Fig. 4).The available rate coefficients for
inelastic collisions of SH with helium atoms do not resolve the
hyperfine splittings. Hence, we first determined line frequencies,
level degeneracies, and Einstein coefficients of an SH molecule
without hyperfine structure. To do this, we took the complete set
of hyperfine levels tabulated in CDMS. Lacking specific inelastic
collision rate coefficients, we scaled the available SH– He rates
of Kłos et al. (2009) by the square root of the reduced mass ratios
and estimated the SH– H and SH– H2 collisional rates."
"The scaled rate coefficients are about an order of magni-
tude smaller than those of SH+. However, the chemical de-
struction rate of SH at the PDR edge (reactions with H, pho-
todissociation, and photoionization, see Sect. 6.1) is also slower
(we take the rates of SH–H reactive collisions from Zanchet
et al. 2019). We determine D' 3×10−6 s−1 for nH = 106 cm−3,
Tk = 200 K, and AV ' 0.7 mag. Models in Fig. 7 include these
chemical rates for Tform =Tk (a lower limit to the unknown forma-
tion temperature). Formation pumping enhances the intensity of
the 2Π3/2 J = 5/2-3/2 ground-state lines by a few percent only."
"To estimate the SH column density in the Orion Bar we com-
pare with the upper limit intensities of the SH lines targeted
by SOFIA. If SH and SH+ arise from roughly the same gas at
similar physical conditions (nH ' 106 cm−3 and Tk ' 200 K) the
best model column density is for N(SH)≤ (0.6-1.6)×1014 cm−2.
If densities were lower, around nH ' 105 cm−3, the upper limit
N(SH) column densities will be a factor ten higher."

(lower limit) or emission that fills the 15′′ beam at 168.7 GHz. The vertical line marks the best model, resulting in an OTP ratio of 2.9± 0.3."
4.3. H2S excitation and column density
"H2S has a X2A ground electronic state and two nuclear spin
symmetries that we treat separately, o-H2S and p-H2S. Pre-
vious studies of the H2S line excitation have used collisional
rates coefficients scaled from those of the H2O – H2 system.
Dagdigian (2020) recently carried out specific calculations of
the cross sections of o-H2S and p-H2S inelastic collisions with
o–H2 and p-H2 at different temperatures. The behavior of the new
and the scaled rates is different and it depends on the H2 OTP
ratio (e.g., on gas temperature) because the collisional cross sec-
tions are different for o-H2–H2S and p-H2–H2S systems. At the
warm temperatures of the PDR, collisions with o-H2 dominate,
resulting in rate coefficients for the ∼168 GHz o-H2S line that are
a factor up to ∼2.5 smaller than those scaled from H2O–H2."
"H2S is not a reactive molecule. At the edge of the PDR its
destruction is driven by photodissociation. We determine that the
radiative and collisional pumping rates are typically a factor of
∼100 higher than D≈ 2×10−6 s−1 (for nH = 106 cm−3, Tk = 200 K,
G0 '104, and AV ' 0.7 mag). Figure 8 shows non-LTE o-H2S and
p-H2S excitation and radiative transfer models. As H2S may have
its abundance peak deeper inside the PDR and display more
extended emission than SH+ (e.g., Sternberg & Dalgarno 1995),
we show results for Tk = 200 and 100 K. When comparing with
the observed line intensities, we considered either emission that
fills all beams, or a correction that assumes that the H2S emis-
sion only fills the 15′′ beam of the IRAM 30m telescope at
168 GHz. The vertical dotted lines in Fig. 8 show the best model,
N(H2S) = N(o-H2S)+N(p-H2S) = 2.5×1014 cm−2, with an OTP
ratio of 2.9± 0.3, thus consistent with the high-temperature
statistical ratio of 3/1 (see discussion at the end of Sect. 6.4). Mod-
els with lower densities, nH ' 105 cm−3, show worse agreement,
and would translate into even higher N(H2S) of & 1015 cm−2. In
either case, these calculations imply large columns of warm H2S
toward the PDR. They result in a limit to the SH to H2S column
density ratio of ≤ 0.2-0.6. This upper limit is already lower than
the N(SH)/N(H2S) = 1.1-3.0 ratios observed in diffuse clouds
(Neufeld et al. 2015). This difference suggests an enhanced H2S
formation mechanism in FUV-illuminated dense gas."
5. New results on sulfur-hydride reactions

"are very endoergic for H2 (v= 0), with endothermicities in Kelvin
units that are significantly higher than Tk even in PDRs. This
is markedly different to O+ chemistry, for which all hydrogen
abstraction reactions leading to H3O+ are exothermic and fast
(Gerin et al. 2010; Neufeld et al. 2010; Hollenbach et al. 2012)."
"The endothermicity of reactions involving HnS+ ions de-
creases as the number of hydrogen atoms increases. The potential
energy surfaces (PES) of these reactions possess shallow wells at
the entrance and products channels (shown in Fig. 9). In addition,
these PESs show saddle points between the energy walls of reac-
tants and products whose heights increase with the number of H
atoms. For reaction (2), the saddle point has an energy of 0.6 eV
('7,000 K) and is slightly below the energy of the products. How-
ever, for reaction (3), the saddle point is above the energy of the
products and is a reaction barrier. These saddle points act as a
bottleneck in the gas-phase hydrogenation of S+."
"If one considers the state dependent reactivity of vibrationally
excited H2, the formation of SH+ through reaction (1) becomes
exoergic6 when v≥ 2 (Zanchet et al. 2019). The detection of bright
H2S emission in the Orion Bar (Figs. 1 and 4) might suggest that
subsequent hydrogen abstraction reactions with H2 (v≥ 2) pro-
ceed as well. Motivated by these findings, and before carrying out
any PDR model, we studied reaction (2) and the reverse process
in detail. This required to build a full dimensional quantum PES
of the H3S+ (X1A1) system (see Appendix A)."
"In addition, we studied reaction (4) (and its reverse) through
quantum calculations. Details of these ab initio calculations and
of the resulting reactive cross sections are given in Appendix B."
"6 If one considers H2 rovibrational levels, reaction (1) becomes exoergic

"In FUV-illuminated environments, collisions with H atoms
are very important because they compete with electron recom-
binations in destroying molecular ions, and also they contribute
to their excitation. An important result of our calculations is that
the destruction rate of H2S+ (SH+) in reactions with H atoms
are a factor of ≥ 3.5 (≥ 1.7) faster (at Tk ≤ 200 K) than those
previously used in astrochemical models (Millar et al. 1986).
Conversely, we find that destruction of SH in reactions with H
atoms (Appendix B) is slower than previously assumed."
6. PDR models of S-bearing hydrides
"We now investigate the chemistry of S-bearing hydrides and the
effect of the new reaction rates in PDR models adapted to the
Orion Bar conditions. In this analysis we used version 1.5.4. of
the Meudon PDR code (Le Petit et al. 2006; Bron et al. 2014).
Following our previous studies, we model the Orion Bar as a
stationary PDR at constant thermal-pressure (i.e., with density
and temperature gradients). When compared to time-dependent
hydrodynamic PDR models (e.g., Hosokawa & Inutsuka 2006;
Bron et al. 2018; Kirsanova & Wiebe 2019), stationary iso-
baric models seem a good description of the most exposed and
compressed gas layers of the PDR, from AV ≈ 0.5 to ≈ 5 mag

"In our models, the FUV radiation field incident at the PDR
edge is G0 = 2×104 (e.g., Marconi et al. 1998). We adopted an
extinction to color-index ratio, RV = AV /EB−V , of 5.5 (Joblin
et al. 2018), consistent with the flatter extinction curve ob-
served in Orion (Lee 1968; Cardelli et al. 1989). This choice
implies slightly more penetration of FUV radiation into the cloud
(e.g., Goicoechea & Le Bourlot 2007). The main input parame-
ters and elemental abundances of these PDR models are sum-
marized in Table 2. Figure 10 shows the resulting H2, H, and

photodissociation cross sections (σdiss), as well as SH and H2S
photoionization cross sections (σion). These cross sections are
shown in Fig C.1 of the Appendix. The integration is performed
over the specific FUV radiation field at each position of the PDR.

"dependent quantum rates for reaction (1) enhances the formation
of SH+ in a narrow layer at the edge of the PDR (AV ' 0 to 2 mag).
This agrees with the morphology of the SH+ emission revealed
by ALMA images (Fig. 3). For H2 (v= 2), the reaction rate en-
hancement with respect to the thermal rate ∆k = k2(T )/k0(T )
(see discussion by Agúndez et al. 2010) is about 4×108 at
Tk = 500 K (Millar et al. 1986). Indeed, when the fractional
abundance of H2 (v= 2) with respect to H2 (v= 0), defined as
f 2 = n (H2 v= 2)/n (H2 v= 0), exceeds a few times 10−9, meaning
∆k · f 2 > 1, reaction (1) with H2 (v≥ 2) dominates SH+ forma-
tion. This reaction enhancement takes place only at the edge of
the PDR, where FUV-pumped H2 (v≥ 2) molecules are abundant
enough (gray dashed curves in Fig. 12) and drive the formation
of SH+. The resulting SH+ column density increases by an order
of magnitude compared to models that use the thermal rate."
"In this isobaric model, the SH+ abundance peak occurs
at AV ' 0.7 mag, where the gas density has increased from
nH ' 6×104 cm−3 at the PDR edge (the IF) to ∼5×105 cm−3 (at
the DF). At this point, SH+ destruction is dominated by recom-
bination with electrons and by reactive collisions with H atoms.
This implies D(SH+) [s−1]∼ ne ke ' nH kH� n(H2 v≥ 2) k2, as we
assumed in the single-slab SH+ excitation models (Sec. 4.1).
Therefore, only a small fraction of SH+ molecules further re-
act with H2 (v≥ 2) to form H2S+. The resulting low H2S+ abun-
dances limit the formation of abundant SH from dissociative
recombinations of H2S+ (recall that we estimated that reaction
S + H2 (v≥2)→ SH + H is very slow). The SH abundance peak is
shifted deeper inside the cloud, at about AV ' 1.8 mag, where SH
forms by dissociative recombination of H2S+ and it is destroyed
by FUV photons and reactions with H atoms. In these gas-phase
models the H2S abundance peaks even deeper inside the PDR, at
AV ' 5 mag, where it forms by recombinations of H2S+ and H3S+
with electrons as well as by charge exchange S + H2S+. How-
ever, the new rate of reaction H2S+ + H is higher than assumed
in the past, so the new models predict lower H2S+ abundances at
intermediate PDR depths (thus, less H3S+ and H2S; see Fig. 12)."
"The SH column density predicted by the new gas-phase
model is below the upper limit determined from SOFIA. However,
the predicted H2S column density is much lower than the value
we derive from observations (Table 3) and the predicted H2S line
intensities are too faint (see Sect. 6.4)."
"Because the cross sections of the different H2S photodissocia-
tion channels have different wavelength dependences (Zhou et al.
2020), the H2S and SH abundances between AV ≈ 2 and 6 mag"

"are sensitive to the specific shape of the FUV radiation field (de-
termined by line blanketing, dust absorption, and grain scattering;
e.g., Goicoechea & Le Bourlot 2007). Still, we checked that
using steeper extinction curves does not increase H2S column
density any closer to the observed levels. This disagreement be-
tween the observationally inferred N(H2S) column density and
the predictions of gas-phase PDR models is even worse7 if one
considers the uncertain rates of radiative association reactions
S+ + H2→H2S+ + hν and SH+ + H2→H3S+ + hν included in the
new gas-phase model. For the latter reaction, the main prob-
lem is that the electronic states of the reactants do not correlate
with the 1A1 ground electronic state of the activated complex
H3S+∗ (denoted by ∗). Instead, H3S+∗ forms in an excited triplet
state (3A). Herbst et al. (1989) proposed that a spin-flip followed
by a radiative association can occur in interstellar conditions"
"7 Older gas-phase PDR models previously predicted low H2S
column densities (Jansen et al. 1995; Sternberg & Dalgarno 1995)."
"and form H3S+∗(X1A1) (Millar & Herbst 1990). In Appendix A.3,
we give arguments against this mechanism. For similar reasons,
Prasad & Huntress (1982) avoided to include the S+ + H2 radia-
tive association in their models. Removing these reactions in pure
gas-phase models drastically decreases the H2S+ and H3S+ abun-
dances, and thus those of SH and H2S (by a factor of ∼100 in these
models). The alternative H2S+ formation route through reaction
SH+ + H2(v= 2) is only efficient at the PDR surface (AV < 1 mag).
This is due to the large H2(v= 2) fractional abundances, f2 > 10−6
at Tk > 500 K, required to enhance the H2S+ production. There-
fore, and contrary to S+ destruction, reaction of SH+ with H2
is not the dominant destruction pathway for SH+. Only deeper
inside the PDR, reactions of S with H+3 produce small abundances
of SH+ and H2S+, but the hydrogenation of HnS+ ions is not
efficient and limits the gas-phase production H2S."
6.2. Grain surface formation of solid H2S
"Similarly to the formation of water ice (s-H2O) on grains
(e.g., Hollenbach et al. 2009, 2012), the formation of H2S may
be dominated by grain surface reactions followed by desorp-
tion back to the gas (e.g., Charnley 1997). Indeed, water vapor is
relatively abundant in the Bar (N(H2O)≈ 1015 cm−2; Choi et al.
2014; Putaud et al. 2019) and large-scale maps show that the H2O
abundance peaks close to cloud surfaces (Melnick et al. 2020)."
"To investigate the s-H2S formation on grains, we updated the
chemical model by allowing S atoms to deplete onto grains as
the gas temperature drops inside the molecular cloud (for the
basic grain chemistry formalism, see, Hollenbach et al. 2009).
The timescale of this process (τgr,S) goes as x(S)−1 n−1H T"
"−1/2
k ,"
"where x(S) is the abundance of neutral sulfur atoms with respect
to H nuclei. In a PDR, the abundance of H atoms is typically
higher than that of S atoms8 and H atoms stick on grains more
frequently than S atoms unless x(H)< x(S)·0.18. An adsorbed H
atom (s-H) is weakly bound, mobile, and can diffuse through-
out the grain surface until it finds an adsorbed S atom (s-S). If
the timescale for a grain to be hit by a H atom (τgr,H) is shorter
that the timescale for a s-S atom to photodesorb (τphotdes,S) or
sublimate (τsubl,S) then reaction of s-H with s-S will proceed
and form a s-SH radical roughly upon “collision” and with-
out energy barriers (e.g., Tielens & Hagen 1982; Tielens 2010).
Likewise, if τgr,H < τphotdes,SH and τgr,H < τsubl,SH, a newly ad-
sorbed s-H atom can diffuse, find a grain site with an s-SH radical
and react without barriers to form s-H2S. In these surface pro-
cesses, a significant amount of S is ultimately transferred to s-H2S"
"8 We only consider the depletion of neutral S atoms. S+ ions are ex-
pected to be more abundant than S atoms at the edge of the Orion Bar
(AV . 2 mag) where Tk and Td are too high, and the FUV radiation field
too strong, to allow the formation of abundant grain mantles."

black curve is the timescale for a grain to be hit by an H atom. Once in

s-O and s-S atoms remain on grain surfaces sufficiently long to combine

"(e.g., Vidal et al. 2017), which can subsequently desorb: thermally,
by FUV photons, or by cosmic rays. In addition, laboratory ex-
periments show that the excess energy of certain exothermic
surface reactions can promote the direct desorption of the product
(Minissale et al. 2016). In particular, reaction s-H + s-SH directly
desorbs H2S with a maximum efficiency of ∼ 60 % (as observed
in experiments, Oba et al. 2018). Due to the high flux of FUV
photons in PDRs, chemical desorption may not always compete
with photodesorption. However, it can be a dominant process in-
side molecular clouds (Garrod et al. 2007; Esplugues et al. 2016;
Vidal et al. 2017; Navarro-Almaida et al. 2020)."
"The photodesorption timescale of an ice mantle is propor-
tional to Y−1 G−10 exp (+b AV ), where Y is the photodesorption
yield (the number of desorbed atoms or molecules per incident

timescale for mantle sublimation (thermal desorption) goes as

frequency of the solid lattice, Td is the dust grain temperature,
and Eb/k is the adsorption binding energy of the species (in K).

an s-S atom (τsubl,S) (left curve for Eb/k (S) = 1100 K and right
curve for Eb/k (S) = 2600 K), and the same for an s-O atom (blue
curve). The gray dotted curve is the timescale for s-S atom pho-
todesorption (τphotodes,S) at AV = 5 mag. At G0 strengths where the
continuous line is below the dashed and dotted lines, an adsorbed
s-S atom remains on the grain surface sufficiently long to react
with a diffusing s-H atom, form s-SH, and ultimately s-H2S."
"Figure 13 shows that, if one takes Eb/k (S) = 1100 K (the
most common value in the literature; Hasegawa & Herbst 1993),
the formation of s-H2S is possible inside clouds illuminated by
modest FUV fields, when grains are sufficiently cold (Td < 22 K).
However, recent calculations of s-S atoms adsorbed on water ice
surfaces suggest higher binding energies (∼ 2600 K; Wakelam
et al. 2017). This would imply that S atoms freeze at higher Td
(. 50 K) and that s-H2S mantles form in more strongly illumi-
nated PDRs (the observed Td at the edge of the Bar is ' 50 K and
decreases to '35 K behind the PDR; see, Arab et al. 2012)."
"The freeze-out depth for sulfur in a PDR, the AV at which
most sulfur is incorporated as S-bearing solids (s-H2S in our sim-
ple model) can be estimated by equating τgr,S and τphotdes,H2S.
This implicitly assumes the H2S chemical desorption does not
dominate in FUV-irradiated regions, which is in line with the par-
ticularly large FUV absorption cross section of s-H2S measured
in laboratory experiments (Cruz-Diaz et al. 2014). With these as-
sumptions, the lower panel of Fig. 13 shows the predicted s-H2S
and s-H2O freeze-out depths. Owing to the lower abundance and
higher atomic mass of sulfur atoms (i.e., grains are hit slower
by S atoms than by O atoms), the H2S freeze-out depth appears
slightly deeper than that of water ice. For the FUV-illumination
conditions in the Bar, the freeze-out depth of sulfur is expected
at AV & 6 mag. This implies that photodesorption of s-H2S can
produce enhanced abundances of gaseous H2S at AV < 6 mag."
"FUV-irradiation and thermal desorption of H2S ice mantles
have been studied in the laboratory (e.g., Cruz-Diaz et al. 2014;

surface grain chemistry, experiments show that reaction
s-H + s-SH→ s-H2S is exothermic (Oba et al. 2018), whereas
reaction s-H + s-H2S, although it has an activation energy
barrier of ∼1500 K, it may directly desorb gaseous SH. Finally,
reaction s-SH + s-SH→ s-H2S2 may trigger the formation of
doubly sulfuretted species, but it requires mobile s-SH radicals
(e.g., Jiménez-Escobar & Muñoz Caro 2011; Fuente et al. 2017).
Here we will only consider surface reactions with mobile s-H."
6.3. Gas-grain PDR model results
"Here we show PDR model results in which we add a simple net-
work of gas-grain reactions for a small number of S-bearing
(S, SH, and H2S) and O-bearing (O, OH, H2O, O2, and CO)
species. These species can adsorb on grains as temperatures drop,
photodesorb by FUV photons (stellar and secondary), desorb
by direct impact of cosmic-rays, or sublimate at a given PDR
depth (depending on Td and on their Eb). Grain size distributions
(ngr ∝ a−3.5, where a is the grain radius) and gas-grain reactions
are treated within the Meudon code formalism (see, Le Petit et al.
2006; Goicoechea & Le Bourlot 2007; Le Bourlot et al. 2012;
Bron et al. 2014). As grain surface chemistry reactions we include
s-H + s-X→ s-XH and s-H + s-XH→ s-H2X, where s-X refers to
s-S and s-O. In addition, we add the direct chemical desorption re-
action s-H + s-SH→H2S with an efficiency of 50 % per reactive
event, and also tested different efficiencies (�) for the chemical
desorption process s-H + s-H2S→SH + H2."
"In our models we compute the relevant gas-grain timescales
and atomic abundances at every depth AV of the PDR. If the
timescale for a grain to be struck by an H atom (τgr,H) is shorter
than the timescales to sublimate or to photodesorb an s-X atom or
a s-XH molecule; and if H atoms stick on grains more frequently
than X atoms, we simply assume these surface reactions proceed
instantaneously. At large AV , larger than the freeze-out depth, this
grain chemistry builds abundant s-H2O and s-H2S ice mantles."
"Figure 14 shows results of two types of gas-grain models. The
only difference between them is the adopted adsorption binding"
"energies for s-S and s-SH. Left panel is for a “high Eb” model
and right panel is for a “low Eb” model (see Table 4). We note
that these models do not include the gas-phase radiative associa-
tion reactions S+ + H2→H2S+ + hν and SH+ + H2→H3S+ + hν;
although their effect is smaller than in pure gas-phase models."
"The chemistry of the most exposed PDR surface layers
(AV . 2 mag) is the same to that of the gas-phase models dis-
cussed in Sect. 6.1. Photodesorption keeps dust grains free of ice
mantles, and fast gas-phase ion-neutral reactions, photoreactions,
and reactions with FUV-pumped H2 drive the chemistry. The re-
sulting SH+ abundance profile is nearly identical and there is no
need to invoke depletion of elemental sulfur from the gas-phase
to explain the observed SH+ emission (see Fig. 15). Beyond these
first PDR irradiated layers, the chemistry does change because
the formation of s-H2S on grains and subsequent desorption alters
the chemistry of the other S-bearing hydrides."
"In model high Eb, S atoms start to freeze out closer to the
PDR edge (Td < 50 K). Because of the increasing densities and
decreasing temperatures, the s-H2S abundance with respect to H
nuclei reaches ∼10−6 at AV ' 4 mag. In model low Eb, this level
of s-H2S abundance is only reached beyond an AV of 7 mag. At
lower AV , the formation of s-H2S on bare grains and subsequent
photodesorption produces more H2S than pure-gas phase models
independently of whether H2S chemical desorption is included
or not. In these intermediate PDR layers, at AV ' 2-7 mag for the
strong irradiation conditions in the Bar, the flux of FUV photons
drives much of the chemistry, desorbing grain mantles, preventing
complete freeze out, and dissociating the gas-phase products."
"There are two H2S abundance peaks at AV ' 4 and 7 mag. The
H2S abundance in these “photodesorption peaks” depends on
the amount of s-H2S mantles formed on grains and on the bal-
ance between s-H2S photodesorption and H2S photodissociation
(which now becomes the major source of SH). The enhanced H2S
abundance modifies the chemistry of H2S+ and H3S+ as well:
H2S photoionization (with a threshold at ∼10.4 eV) becomes the
dominant source of H2S+ at AV ' 4 mag because the H2 (v≥2)
abundance is too low to make reaction (2) competitive. Besides,
reactions of H2S with abundant molecular ions such as HCO+,
H+3 , and H3O"
+ dominate the H3S+ production.

"Our gas-grain models predict that other S-bearing molecules,
such as SO2 and SO, can be the major sulfur reservoirs at these
intermediate PDR depths. However, their abundances strongly de-
pend on those of O2 and OH through reactions S + O2→SO + O
and SO + OH→SO2 + H (see e.g., Sternberg & Dalgarno 1995;
Fuente et al. 2016, 2019). These reactions link the chemistry of S-
and O-bearing neutral molecules (Prasad & Huntress 1982) and
are an important sink of S atoms at AV & 5 mag. However, while
large column densities of OH have been detected in the Orion Bar
(& 1015 cm−2; Goicoechea et al. 2011), O2 remains undetected
despite deep searches (Melnick et al. 2012). Furthermore, the
inferred upper limit N(O2) columns are below the expectations of
PDR models (Hollenbach et al. 2009). This discrepancy likely im-
plies that these gas-grain models miss details of the grain surface
chemistry leading to O2 (for other environments and modeling
approaches see, e.g., Ioppolo et al. 2008; Taquet et al. 2016). Here
we will not discuss SO2, SO, or O2 further."
"At large cloud depths, AV & 8 mag, the FUV flux is largely
attenuated, temperatures drop, the chemistry becomes slower, and
other chemical processes dominate. The H2S abundance is con-
trolled by the chemical desorption reaction s-H + s-SH→H2S.
This process keeps a floor of detectable H2S abundances (>10−9)
in regions shielded from stellar FUV radiation. In addition, and
although not energetically favorable, the chemical desorption
s-H + s-H2S→SH + H2 enhances the SH production at large AV
(the enhancement depends on the desorption efficiency �), which
in turn boosts the abundances of other S-bearing species, includ-
ing that of neutral S atoms."
"The H2S abundances predicted by the high Eb model repro-
duce the H2S line intensities observed in the Bar (Sect. 6.4). In
this model s-H2S becomes the main sulfur reservoir. However,
we stress that here we do not consider the formation of more
complex S-bearing ices such as s-OCS, s-H2S2, s-Sn, s-SO2 or
s-HSO (Jiménez-Escobar & Muñoz Caro 2011; Vidal et al. 2017;
Laas & Caselli 2019). Together with our steady-state solution of
the chemistry, this implies that our predictions are not precise
deep inside the PDR. However, we recall that our observations"
"refer to the edge of the Bar, so it is not plausible that the model
conditions at AV & 8 mag represent the line of sight we observe."
"Model low Eb produces less H2S in the PDR layers below
AV . 8 mag because S atoms do not freeze until the dust tempera-
ture drops deep inside the PDR. Even beyond these layers, ther-
mal desorption of s-S maintains higher abundances of S atoms
at large depths. Indeed, model low Eb predicts that the major
sulfur reservoir deep inside the cloud are gas-phase S atoms.
This agrees with recent chemical models of cold dark clouds
(Vidal et al. 2017; Navarro-Almaida et al. 2020)."
6.4. Line intensity comparison and H2S ortho-to-para ratio
"We now specifically compare the SH+, SH, and H2S line inten-
sities implied by the different PDR models with the intensities
observed toward the DF position of the Bar. We used the output
of the PDR models – Tk, Td, n(H2), n(H), ne, n(SH+), n(SH), and
n(H2S) profiles from AV = 0 to 10 mag – as input for a multi-slab
Monte Carlo model of their line excitation, including formation
pumping (formalism presented in Sect. 4) and radiative transfer.
As the Orion Bar is not a perfectly edge-on, this comparison re-
quires a knowledge of the tilt angle (α) with respect to a pure
edge-on PDR. Different studies suggest α of ≈ 5o (e.g., Jansen
et al. 1995; Melnick et al. 2012; Andree-Labsch et al. 2017). This
inclination implies an increase in line-of-sight column density,
compared to a face-on PDR, by a geometrical factor (sinα)−1. It
also means that optically thin lines are limb-brightened."
"The left panel of Fig. 15 shows SH+ line intensity predic-
tions for isobaric PDR models of different Pth values (leading
to different Tk and nH profiles). Since the bulk of the SH+ emis-
sion arises from the PDR edge (AV ' 0 to 2 mag) all models
(gas-phase or gas-grain) give similar results. The best fit is for
Pth ' (1–2)×108 cm−3 K and α'5o. These high pressures, at least
close to the DF, agree with those inferred from ALMA images of
HCO+ (J = 4-3) emission (Goicoechea et al. 2016), Herschel ob-
servations of high-J CO lines (Joblin et al. 2018), and IRAM 30 m
detections of carbon recombination lines (Cuadrado et al. 2019)."

"Right panel of Fig. 15 shows SH and H2S line emission
predictions for the high Eb gas-grain model (magenta squares),
low Eb gas-grain model (gray triangles), and a pure gas-phase
model (cyan circles). For each model, the upper limit intensities
refer to radiative transfer calculations with an inclination angle
α= 5o. The lower intensity limits refer to a face-on PDR. Gas-
phase models largely underestimate the observed H2S intensities.
Model low Eb produces higher H2S columns and brighter H2S
lines, but still below the observed levels (by up to a factor of ten).
Model high Eb provides a good agreement with observations; the
two possible inclinations bracket the observed intensities, and it
should be considered as the reference model of the Bar. It is also
consistent with the observational SH upper limits."
"Our observations and models provide a (line-of-sight)
N(o-H2S)/N(p-H2S) OTP ratio of 2.9± 0.3, consistent with
the (gas-phase) high-temperature statistical equilibrium value.
However, the cold “nuclear-spin-temperatures” (Tspin�Tk; see
definition in eq. D.1) implied by the low water vapor OTP ratios
observed in some sources (< 2.5) have been associated with the
temperature of the ice mantles where H2O molecules might have
formed (i.e., Tspin 'Td; Mumma et al. 1987; Lis et al. 2013). In
the case of H2S, our derived OTP ratio toward the DF position
implies any Tspin above 30±10 K (see Fig. D.1). Hence, this tem-
perature might be also compatible with s-H2S formation9 in warm
grains if Tspin 'Td upon formation is preserved in the gas-phase
after photodesorption (e.g., Guzmán et al. 2013). Interestingly,
the H2O OTP ratio derived from observations of the Orion Bar is
2.8± 0.1 (Putaud et al. 2019) and implies Tspin(H2O) = 35± 2 K.
This value is compatible with Tspin(H2S) and might reflect the
similar Td of the PDR layers where most s-H2O and s-H2S form
and photodesorb. Nevertheless, laboratory experiments have chal-
9 Crockett et al. (2014) inferred N(o-H2S)/N(p-H2S) = 2.5± 0.8 in the
hot core of Orion KL using LTE rotational digrams. However, they
favored an OTP ratio of 1.7± 0.8 based on the column density ratio
of selected pairs of rotational levels with similar energies. This latter
OTP ratio implies Tspin(H2S)' 12 K (Fig. D.1), perhaps related to much
colder dust grains than in PDRs or to colder gas conditions just before the
hot core phase; so that reactive collisions did not have time to establish
the statistical equilibrium value. We note that the observed OTP ratios of
H2CO, H2CS, and H2CCO in the Bar are also ∼3 (Cuadrado et al. 2017)."
"lenged this Tspin 'Td association, at least for s-H2O: cold water
ice surfaces, at 10 K, photodesorb H2O molecules with an OTP
ratio of ∼3 (Hama et al. 2016). Follow up observations of p-H2S
lines across the Bar will allow us to study possible variations of
the OTP ratio as G0 diminishes and grains get colder."
6.5. Generalization to different G0 and nH conditions
"In this section we generalize our results to a broader range of
gas densities and FUV illumination conditions (i.e., to clouds
with different G0 / nH ratios). We run several PDR models us-
ing the high Eb gas-grain chemistry. The main difference com-
pared to the Orion Bar models is that here we model con-
stant density clouds with standard interstellar grain properties
(RV = 3.1). Figure 16 (left panel) shows models of clouds with
constant nH = 104 cm−3 and varying FUV radiation fields, while
Fig. 16 (right panel) show models of constant FUV illumina-
tion (G0 = 100) and varying gas densities10. The main result of
this study is the similar gas-phase H2S column density (a few
1014 cm−2 up to AV = 10) and H2S abundance peak (a few 10−8
close to the FUV-irradiated cloud edge) predicted by these mod-
els nearly irrespective of G0 and nH. A similar conclusion was
reached previously for water vapor in FUV-illuminated clouds
(Hollenbach et al. 2009, 2012). Increasing G0 shifts the position
of the H2S abundance peak to larger AV until the rate of S atoms
sticking on grains balances the H2S photodissociation rate (the
dominant H2S destruction mechanism except in shielded gas;
see also Fig.13). Since s-H2S photodesorption and H2S photodis-
sociation rates depend on G0, the peak H2S abundance in the
PDR is roughly the same independently of G0. On the other
hand, the formation rate of s-H2S mantles depends on the prod-
uct n(S) ngr ∝ n2H, whereas the H2S photodesorption rate depends
on ngr ∝ nH. Hence, the H2S abundance peak moves toward the
cloud surface for denser PDRs (like the Orion Bar). The exact
abundance value depends on the adopted grain-size distribution
and on the H2S photodesorption yield (which is well constrained
by experiments; see, Cruz-Diaz et al. 2014; Fuente et al. 2017)."
"10 In these models we consider undepleted [S/H] abundances and only
the chemical desorption s-H + s-SH→H2S (with a 50 % efficiency)."
"Article number, page 15 of 25"
A&A proofs: manuscript no. aa_sulfur_bar_accepted
"The role of chemical desorption increases and can dominate
beyond the photodesorption peak as the flux of stellar FUV pho-
tons is attenuated. Here we do not carry out an exhaustive study
of this mechanism, which is hard to model in full detail because
its efficiency decreases considerably with the properties of grain
surfaces (bare vs. icy; see e.g., Minissale & Dulieu 2014). In our
models, and depending on ζCR, photodesorption by secondary
FUV photons can also be important in cloud interiors. These
processes limit the conversion of most of the sulfur reservoir into
S-bearing ices and increase the abundance of other gas-phase
species deep inside clouds, notably S atoms and H2S molecules."
"The H2S abundance in shielded gas depends on the
destruction rate by gas-phase reactions different than photodisso-
ciation, in particular H2S reactions with H+3 . The H"
"+
3 abundance"
"increases with ζCR and decreases with the electron density. Fig-
ure 16 (right) shows models of constant G0 and constant ζCR
in which the H2S abundance at large depths increases with de-
creasing density (more penetration of FUV photons, more ion-
ization, more electrons, less H+3 ). The lowest gas density model,
nH = 103 cm−3, shows the highest H2S abundance at large AV .
Because S freeze-out is less efficient at low densities, the low-
density model shows higher gas-phase S abundances at large
depths, making atomic S a dominant gas-phase sulfur reservoir.
Unfortunately, direct observation of atomic S in cold gas is com-
plicated, which makes it difficult to benchmark this prediction."
"In warm PDRs, in addition to S radio recombination lines
(e.g., Smirnov et al. 1995), the 3P fine-structure lines of atomic
sulfur, the [S i] 25, 56µm lines, can be interesting diagnostics of
gas physical conditions and of [S/H] abundances. Unfortunately,
the low sensitivity of previous infrared telescopes was not suf-
ficient to detect the [S i] 25µm line (∆E12 = 570 K) in the Orion
Bar (Rosenthal et al. 2000); although it is detected in protostellar
outflows (e.g., Neufeld et al. 2009; Goicoechea et al. 2012). More-
over, the 3P2-1D2 forbidden line of atomic sulfur at 1.082µm can
be an interesting tracer of the ionization and dissociation fronts
in PDRs. Some of these lines will be accesible to high-angular-
resolution and high sensitivity observations with JWST."
6.5.1. The origin of H2S emission in other environments
"Irrespective of nH and G0, grain surface formation of s-H2S and
photodesorption back to the gas-phase lead to H2S column densi-
ties of a few 1014 cm−2 in PDRs. This is in agrement with the ob-
served column in the Bar (G0 ≈ 104) as well as at the mildly illumi-
nated rims of TMC-1 and Barnard 1b clouds (G0 ≈ 10; Navarro-
Almaida et al. 2020). The inferred H2S abundance in the shielded
interior of these dark clouds (AV > 10 mag) drops to a few 10−9,
but the species clearly does not disappear from the gas (N(H2S)
of a few 1013 cm−2; Navarro-Almaida et al. 2020). Interestingly,
neither in the Bar the H2S line emission at ∼168 GHz decreases
much behind the PDR (Fig. 1) even if the flux of FUV photons is
largely attenuated compared to the irradiated PDR edge."
"Despite oxygen is ∼25 times more abundant than sulfur, the
H2O to H2S column density ratio in the Orion Bar PDR is only
about ∼ 5. This similarity must also reflect the higher abundances
of CO compared to CS. Furthermore, the H2S column density
in cold cores is strikingly similar to that of water vapor (Caselli
et al. 2010, 2012). This coincidence points to a more efficient des-
orption mechanism of s-H2S compared to s-H2O in gas shielded
from stellar FUV photons. Navarro-Almaida et al. (2020) argues
that chemical desorption is able to reproduce the observed H2S
abundance floor if the efficiency of this process diminishes as ice
grain mantles get thicker inside cold dense cores."
"Turning back to warmer star-forming environments, our pre-
dicted H2S abundance in FUV-illuminated gas is comparable
to that observed toward many hot cores (∼10−9-10−8; van der
Tak et al. 2003; Herpin et al. 2009). In these massive protostel-
lar environments, thermal desorption of icy mantles, suddenly
heated to Td & 100 K by the luminosity of the embedded massive
protostar, drives the H2S production. Early in their evolution,
young hot cores (. 104 yr) can show even higher abundances
of recently desorbed H2S (before further chemical processing
takes place in the gas-phase; e.g., Charnley 1997; Hatchell et al.
1998; Jiménez-Serra et al. 2012; Esplugues et al. 2014). Indeed,
Crockett et al. (2014) reports a gas-phase H2S abundance of sev-
eral 10−6 toward the hot core in Orion KL. This high value likely
reflects the minimum s-H2S abundance locked as s-H2S mantles
just before thermal desorption. In addition, the H2S abundance in
the Orion Bar is only slightly lower than that inferred in protostel-
lar outflows (several 10−8). In these regions, fast shocks erode and
sputter the grain mantles, releasing a large fraction of their molec-
ular content and activating a high-temperature gas-phase chem-
istry that quickly reprocesses the gas (e.g., Holdship et al. 2019).
All in all, it seems reasonable to conclude that everywhere s-H2S
grain mantles form, or already formed in a previous evolutionary
stage, emission lines from gas-phase H2S will be detectable."
"In terms of its detectability with single-dish telescopes, H2S
rotational lines are bright in hot cores (Tpeak, 168 GHz ' 30 K in
Orion KL but ' 1-3 K toward most hot cores; Tercero et al. 2010;
van der Tak et al. 2003; Herpin et al. 2009), in strongly irradiated
PDRs (' 6 K, this work), and in lower-illumination PDRs such as
the Horsehead (' 1 K; Rivière-Marichalar et al. 2019). The H2S
emission is fainter toward cold dark clouds (' 0.2 K in TMC-1;
Navarro-Almaida et al. 2020) and protostellar outflows (' 0.6 K
in L1157; Holdship et al. 2019). These line intensity differences
are mostly produced by different gas physical conditions and not
by enormous changes of the H2S abundance."
"Finally, H2S is also detected outside the Milky Way (firstly by
Heikkilä et al. 1999). Lacking enough spatial-resolution it is more
difficult to determine the origin of the extragalactic H2S emission.
The derived abundances in starburst galaxies such as NGC 253
(∼10−9; Martín et al. 2006) might be interpreted as arising from a
collection of spatially unresolved hot cores (Martín et al. 2011).
However, hot cores have low filling factors at star-forming cloud
scales. Our study suggests that much of this emission can arise
from (the most common) extended molecular gas illuminated by
stellar FUV radiation (e.g., Goicoechea et al. 2019)."
7. Summary and conclusions
"We carried out a self-consistent observational and modeling study
of the chemistry of S-bearing hydrides in FUV-illuminated gas.
We obtained the following results:
– ALMA images of the Orion Bar show that SH+ is confined to
narrow gas layers of the PDR edge, close to the H2 dissociation
front. Pointed observations carried out with the IRAM 30m
telescope show bright H322 S, H"
"34
2 S, H"
"33
2 S emission toward the"
"PDR (but no H3S+, a key gas precursor of H2S) as well as behind
the Bar, where the flux of FUV photons is largely attenuated.
SOFIA observations provide tight limits to the SH emission.
– The SH+ line emission arises from a high-pressure gas com-
ponent, Pth ' (1–2)×108 cm−3 K, where SH+ ions are destroyed
by reactive collisions with H atoms and electrons (as most HnS+
ions do). We derive N(SH+)' 1013 cm−2 and an abundance peak
of several ∼10−9. H2S shows larger column densities toward
the PDR, N(H2S) = N(o-H2S) + N(p-H2S)' 2.5×1014 cm−2.
Our tentative detection of SH translates into an upper limit"
"Article number, page 16 of 25"
Goicoechea et al.: Bottlenecks to interstellar sulfur chemistry
"column density ratio N(SH)/N(H2S) of < 0.2-0.6, already
lower than the ratio of 1.1-3.0 observed in low-density diffuse
molecular clouds (Neufeld et al. 2015). This implies an enhanced
H2S production mechanism in FUV-illuminated dense gas.
– All gas-phase reactions X + H2(v=0)→XH + H (with X = S+,
S, SH+, or H2S+) are highly endoergic. While reaction of
FUV-pumped H2(v≥ 2) molecules with S+ ions becomes
exoergic and explains the observed levels of SH+, further
reactions of H2(v≥ 2) with SH+ or with neutral S atoms, both
reactions studied here through ab initio quantum calculations, do
not form enough H2S+ or H3S+ to ultimately produce abundant
H2S. In particular, pure gas-phase models underestimate the
H2S column density observed in the Orion Bar by more than
two orders of magnitude. This implies that these models miss
the main H2S formation route. The disagreement is even worse
as we favor, after considering the potential energy surfaces of
the H2S+∗ and H3S+∗ complexes, that the radiative associations
S+ + H2→H2S+ + hν and SH+ + H2→H3S+ + hν may actually
not occur or possess slower rates than considered in the literature.
– To overcome these bottlenecks, we built PDR models that
include a simple network of gas-grain and grain surface reactions.
The higher binding energies of S and SH suggested by recent
studies imply that bare grains start to grow s-H2S mantles not
far from the illuminated edges of molecular clouds. Indeed, the
observed N(H2S) in the Orion Bar can only be explained by the
freeze-out of S atoms, grain surface formation of s-H2S mantles,
and subsequent photodesorption back to the gas phase. The
inferred H2S OTP ratio of 2.9± 0.3 (equivalent to Tspin ≥ 30 K)
is compatible with the high-temperature statistical ratio as well
as with warm grain surface formation if Tspin 'Td and if Tspin is
preserved in the gas-phase after desorption.
– Comparing observations with chemical and excitation models,
we conclude that the SH+-emitting layers at the edge of the
Orion Bar (AV < 2 mag) are charaterized by no or very little
depletion of sulfur from the gas-phase. At intermediate PDR
depths (AV < 8 mag) the observed H2S column densities do not
require depletion of elemental (cosmic) sulfur abundances either.
– We conclude that everywhere s-H2S grain mantles form (or
formed) gas-phase H2S will be present in detectable amounts.
Independently of nH and G0, FUV-illuminated clouds produce
roughly the same H2S column density (a few 1014 cm−2) and
H2S peak abundances (a few 10−8). This agrees with the H2S
column densities derived in the Orion Bar and at the edges
of mildly illuminated clouds. Deep inside molecular clouds
(AV > 8 mag), H2S still forms by direct chemical desorption and
photodesorption by secondary FUV photons. These processes
alter the abundances of other S-bearing species and makes
difficult to predict the dominant sulfur reservoir in cloud interiors."
"In this study we focused on S-bearing hydrides. Still, many
subtle details remain to be fully understood: radiative as-
sociations, electron recombinations, and formation of multi-
ply sulfuretted molecules. For example, the low-temperature
(Tk < 1000 K) rates of the radiative and dielectronic recombi-
nation of S+ used in PDR models may still be not accurate
enough (Badnell 1991). In addition, the main ice-mantle sul-
fur reservoirs are not fully constrained observationally. Thus,
some of the narrative may be subject to speculation. Similarly,
reactions of S+ with abundant organic molecules desorbed from
grains (such as s-H2CO, not considered in our study) may con-
tribute to enhance the H2S+ abundance through gas-phase reac-
tions (e.g., S+ + H2CO→H2S+ + CO; Prasad & Huntress 1982).
Future observations of the abundance and freeze out depths of
the key ice carriers with JWST will clearly help in these fronts."

Appendix A: H2S+ formation and destruction
"In this Appendix we give details about how we calculated the H2
vibrational-state-dependent rates of reaction (2) and of the reverse
reaction, the destruction of H2S+ (2A′) by reactive collisons with
H (2S ) atoms (summarized in Fig. A.1)."
"We first built a full dimensional potential energy surface (PES)
of the triplet H3S+ (3A) system by fitting more than 150,000
ab initio points, including the long range interactions in the reac-
tants and products channels. The main topological features of the
PES are summarized in the minimum energy path between reac-
tants and products (see middle panel of Fig. 9). These ab initio
points were calculated with an explicitly correlated restricted
coupled cluster including a single, double, and (perturbatively)
triple excitations (RCCSD(T)-F12a) method (Knizia et al. 2009).
The analytical fit has a overall rms error of ' 0.01 eV (Fig. A.2).
Appendix A.1 provides more details."
"Reaction (2) is endothermic by 0.672 eV, and the PES of the
triplet state shows two shallow wells in the H2 + SH+ entrance
channel (named 3W1a and 3W1b, with a depth of ' 0.118 eV) and
another one near the H + H2S+ products (named 3W2, with a
depth of 0.08 eV). Between the reactants and products wells there
is a saddle point, with an energy of 0.601 eV. This saddle point,
slightly below the products, has a geometry similar to 3W2 in
which the H–H distance is strongly elongated compared to that of
H2. These features are also present in the maximum multiplicity
PES of reactions H2 + S+(4S ) and H2 + H2S+(2A) (see Fig. 9).
We determine the state-dependent rates of reaction (2) and of the
reverse reaction using a quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) method
on our ground triplet PES. We provide more details on how the
reactive cross sections for fixed collision energies were calculated
in Appendix. A.2."
"The formation rate of H2S+ from H2 (v= 0) is very slow. For
H2 (v= 1), the rate constant significantly increases at ≈ 500 K,
corresponding with the opening of the H2S+ + H threshold. At
this point, it is important to consider the zero-point energy (ZPE)
of the products (see next section for details). For H2 (v= 2) and
H2 (v= 3), reaction rates are faster, close to the Langevin limit.
Finally, the H2S+ destruction rate constant is very similar to that
of its formation from H2 (v= 2). In Appendix A.3 we provide
more information about the destruction of HnS+ ions through
radiative association and spin flip mechanisms."
Appendix A.1: Ab initio calculations and PES
"Dagdigian (2019) presented a PES for the SH+-H2 system that
includes 4-dimensions and is based on RCCSD(T)-F12a ab initio
calculations. This PES was used to study SH+–H2 inelastic col-
lisions using a rigid rotor approach in which the two diatomic
molecules are kept fixed at their equilibrium distances. However,
in order to study the reactivity of the collision, the two diatomic
distances have to be included to account for the breaking and
formation of new bonds."
"Reaction (2) corresponds to a triplet state H3S+ (3A). The
H2S+ (2A′) + H (2S ) products can form a triplet and a singlet
state. The triplet state can lead to the destruction of H2S+ through
reaction with H atoms. The singlet state, however, produces very
excited states of the reactants. Thus, it only leads to inelastic
collisions but not not to the destruction of H2S+(2A′). In con-
sequence, here we only consider the ground triplet electronic
state of the system. In addition, the H+3 + S ("
"3P) channel is about
2.4 eV above the H2 + SH+ asymptote, and will not be included
in the present study."

"In order to study the regions where several electronic states

calculation (Shiozaki & Werner 2013; Werner & Knowles
1988a,b) including the Davidson correction (icMRCI-F12+Q;
Davidson 1975). The ic-MRCI-F12 calculations were carried out
using state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field
(SA-CASSCF) orbitals with all the CAS configurations as the
reference configuration state functions. We used a triple zeta corre-
lation consistent basis set for explicitly correlated wave functions
(cc-pVTZ-F12; Peterson et al. 2008). In order to avoid orbital
flipping between core and valence orbitals. SA-CASSCF calcula-"

"tions with three lowest triplet states were carried out including
the core and valence orbitals as active space (18 electrons in 11
orbitals). For the ic-MRCI-F12 calculation, the core orbitals was
kept doubly occupied, resulting in about 2.5 × 106 (9 × 107) con-
tracted (uncontracted) configurations. All ab initio calculations
were performed with MOLPRO (Werner et al. 2012)."
"Our ic-MRCI-F12 calculations show that the crossings with
electronic excited states are 2 eV above the energy of the re-
actants. The energy interval below 2 eV is enough to study
reaction 2. In these low-energy regions, RCCSD(T)-F12a cal-
culations were also performed. They are in good agreement with
the ic-MRCI-F12 results and the t1 diagnostic is always below
0.03. This allows us to conclude that for energies below 2 eV, the
RCCSD(T)-F12a method performs well, presents a simple con-
vergence, and being size consistent, is well adapted to the present
case. This method is the same one employed in the inelastic
collision calculations by Dagdigian (2019)."
"We performed extensive RCCSD(T)-F12a calculations in all
accessible regions to properly describe the six-dimensional phase
space. 150000 ab initio points were fitted to a multidimensional
analytic function, that generates the six-dimensional PES repre-
sented as"
H = Hdiab + HMB (A.1)
"(Aguado et al. 2010; Sanz-Sanz et al. 2013; Zanchet et al. 2018;
Roncero et al. 2018), where Hdiab is an electronic diabatic matrix
in which each diagonal matrix element describes a rearrangement
channel – six in this case, three equivalent for SH+ + H2 channels,
and three equivalent for H2S+ + H fragments (we omitted the
H+3 + S channel) – as an extension of the reactive force field
approach (Farah et al. 2012). In each diagonal term, the molecular
fragments (SH+, H2 and H2S+) are described by 2 or 3 body fits
(Aguado & Paniagua 1992), and the interaction among them
is described by a sum of atom-atom terms plus the long range
interaction. The non diagonal terms of Hdiab are described as
previously (Zanchet et al. 2018; Roncero et al. 2018) and the
parameters are fitted to approximately describe the saddle points
along the minimum energy path in the right geometry."

lar polarizabilities of H2(X1Σ+g ), respectively, and µ1(rS H) is the
dipole moment of SH+(X3Σ−). P2(cos θ) represents the Legen-
dre polynomial of degree 2. The dependence of the molecular
properties of H2 with the interatomic distance rHH is obtained
from Velilla et al. (2008). The dipole moment of SH+ depends
on the origin of coordinates. Since SH+(X3Σ−) dissociates in
S+(4S ) + H(2S ), we select the origin of coordinates in the S atom,
so that the dipole moment tends to zero when R goes to infinity."

Appendix A.2: Determination of reactive collision rates
"We studied the reaction dynamics using a quasi-classical trajec-
tory (QCT) method with the code miQCT (Zanchet et al. 2018;
Roncero et al. 2018). In this method, the initial vibrational en-
ergy of the reactants is included using the adiabatic switching
method (AS) (Grozdanov & Solov’ev 1982; Johnson 1987; Qu
& Bowman 2016; Nagy & Lendvay 2017). Energies are listed
in Table A.2. The initial distance between the center-of-mass
of the reactants (H2 + SH+ or H2S+ + H) is set to 85 bohr, and
the initial impact parameter is set randomly within a disk, the
radius of which is set according to a capture model (Levine &
Bernstein 1987) using the corresponding long-range interaction.
The orientation among the two reactants is set randomly."
"A first exploration of the reaction dynamics is done at
fixed collision energy, for H2 (v= 0, 1, 2 , 3) + SH+ (v= 0) and
H + H2S+(v= 0), and the reactive cross section is calculated as in

for which the reaction takes place, and Nr is the number of trajec-
tories leading to products. Fig. A.2 shows results for Nt > 20000
and all energies and initial reactant and vibrational states."
"For the SH+ (v= 0, j = 0) + H2 (v, j = 0) reaction there is a
strong dependence on the initial vibrational state. For H2 (v= 0),
there is nearly no reactive event, and only at 1 eV there are some
reactive trajectories. For H2 (v= 2 and 3), however, the reaction
shows a relatively large cross section, that decreases with increas-
ing collision energy, as expected for exoergic reactions. Energies
below 10-100 meV are dominated by long range interactions,
leading to an increase in the maximum impact parameter, bmax,
consistent with the variation of the cross section."
"Reaction SH+ (v= 0, j = 0) + H2 (v= 1, j = 0) shows an unex-
pected behavior that deserves some discussion. At energies below
40 meV, the cross section is large and decreases with increasing
energy. In the 40-200 meV range, the reactive cross section drops
to zero, showing a threshold at 200 meV that is consistent with
the endothermicity of the reaction."
"In order to analyze the reaction mechanism for H2 (v= 1)
below 40 meV, we carried out an extensive analysis of the tra-
jectories. A typical one is presented in Fig. A.4 for 10 meV. The
H2 and SH+ reactants are attracted to each other by long range
interactions, until they get trapped in the 3W1 wells, as it is shown
by the evolution of R, the distance between center-of-mass of the
two molecules. The trapping lasts for 8 ps, thus allowing several
collisions between H2 and SH+ and permitting the energy transfer
between them. The H2 molecule ultimately breaks, and leaves
SH+ with less vibrational energy. This can be inferred from the
decrease in the amplitudes of the SH+ distance. The energy of the
H2S+ product is below the ZPE (see Table A.2). This is a clear
indication of ZPE leakage in the QCT method, due to the energy
transfer promoted by the long-lived collision complex."
"Several methods exist that correct the ZPE leakage. One is
the gaussian binning (Bonnet & Rayez 1997, 2004; Bañares et al.
2003, 2004). Here we have applied a simplification of this method,"

This plot shows that all values are nearly the same as those calcu-
lated simply by counting trajectories as an integer (as done in the
normal binning method; see filled symbols in Fig. A.3). The only
exception is the case of SH+ + H2 (v= 1) below 400 meV, which
becomes zero when considering the ZPE of fragments at the end
of the trajectories."

Appendix A.3: On the radiative associations of HnS+
"Herbst et al. (1989) and Millar & Herbst (1990) proposed that the
radiative association HnS+ + H2 → Hn+1S+ + hν is viable pro-
cess at low gas temperatures. Although this chemical route is
widely used in astrochemical models, here we question the viabil-
ity of this process. The lower multiplicity (L) PESs of H2S+ (2A′′)
and H3S+ (1A) are L = 1/2 and 0 respectively. These are shown in
Fig. 9, together with the minimum multiplicity electronic state
of H4S+ (bottom panel). This state does not have a deep well or
any higher multiplicity state that could connect to higher states
of reactants and products."
"For of H3S+ formation through radiative association, this pro-
cess assumes that a H3S+(3A)∗ complex forms in a triplet state, the"
"Article number, page 22 of 25"

"high spin state H considered here. According to our calculations,
such a complex is formed after low-energy H2 (v= 0, 1) + SH+
reactions (below 40 meV). The complex is formed in the 3W1
well, corresponding to geometries very far from those of the low
spin well, the 1W well. Therefore, a radiative spin flip and decay
through phosphorescence is not possible. Herbst et al. (1989)
proposed a second step, in which the spin flips from the triplet
to the singlet state, followed by a radiative association, finally
leading to the H3S+(1A) product."
"The origin of the spin flip must be the spin-orbit couplings,
very relevant for S-bearing species, that favor the spin transition
when singlet and triplet states are close in energy. Using the PESs
calculated here, the lowest crossing region is at ' 0.25 eV, very
close to that of H2(v= 0). At low temperatures, the H3S+(3A)∗
complex formed by H2 (v= 0) + SH+ reactions might allow a
transition between the two electronic states with different spin.
However, the spin flip probability is proportional to the square of
the overlap |〈H3S+ (3A)∗ |H3S+ (1A)∗〉|2. This probability is very
small because the two wells, 3W1 and 1W1, correspond to very
different geometries. In consequence, we conclude that this ra-
diative association mechanism must be negligible, especially at
the high gas temperatures of PDR edges where the H3S+(3A)∗
complex is not formed."
"As an alternative, a spin flip in a direct collision (not form-
ing a H3S+(3A)∗ complex) may be more efficient and should be
further investigated. Indeed, experimental measurements of the
S+(4S ) + H2 (v= 0) cross section show a maximum at about 1 eV
of collisional energy attributed to spin-orbit transitions leading to
spin flip (Stowe et al. 1990)."
"Appendix B: Reaction S (3P) + H2 (v) � SH + H
This reaction involves open shell reactants, S (3P), and products,
SH (2Π). Neglecting spin flipping, there are three states that corre-
late to S(3P), two of them connect to the SH (2Π). These two elec-
tronic states are of 3A′ and 3A′′ symmetry, and have been studied
in detail by Maiti et al. (2004). Here we use the adiabatic PES cal-
culated by Maiti et al. (2004). Reaction S + H2 → SH + H is en-
dothermic by ' 1.02 eV (without zero-point energy corrections),
very similar to the endothermicity of reaction S+ + H2→SH+ + H
(Zanchet et al. 2013a, 2019). The main difference is the presence
of a barrier, of ' 78 meV (' 905 K) with respect to the SH + H
asymptote."
"We performed quantum wave packet calculations for the re-
actions S + H2 (v= 2, 3, j=0) and SH (v= 0, j=0) + H. We used
MADWAVE3 (Gómez-Carrasco & Roncero 2006; Zanchet et al.
2009) to calculate the reaction probabilities for the initial vibra-
tional state of the diatomic reactant (in the ground state rotational
state, j = 0). We employed the usual partial wave expansion to
calculate the reaction cross section. We calculated only few total
angular momenta of the triatomic system, J = 0, 10 and 20. The
other J needed in the partial wave expansion were obtained using
the J-shifting-interpolation method (see Zanchet et al. 2013a).
The initial-state-specific rate constants are obtained by numerical
integration of the cross section using a Boltzmann distribution
(Zanchet et al. 2013a). The resulting reaction rate constants are
shown in Figs. B.1 and B.2. The numerical values of the rate con-
stants are fitted to the usual analytical Arrhenius-like expresion
(shown as dotted curves). We note that the shoulder in the rate
constants of reaction SH (v=0) + H requires two functions in the
temperature range of 200-800 K. Rate coefficients are tabulated
in Table 1."
