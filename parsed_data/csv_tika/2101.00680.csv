ABSTRACT
The polarization properties of radio sources powered by an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) have
attracted considerable attention because of the significance of magnetic fields in the physics of these
"sources, their use as probes of plasma along the line of sight, and as a possible contaminant of polar-"
"ization measurements of the cosmic microwave background. For each of these applications, a better"
understanding of the statistics of polarization in relation to source characteristics is crucial. In this
"paper, we derive the median fractional polarization, Π0,med, of large samples of radio sources with 1.4"
"GHz flux density 6.6 < S1.4 < 70 mJy, by stacking 1.4 GHz NVSS polarized intensity as a function of"
angular size derived from the FIRST survey. Five samples with deconvolved mean angular size 1.8′′ to
8.2′′ and two samples of symmetric double sources are analyzed. These samples represent most sources
smaller than or near the median angular size of the mJy radio source population We find that the
"median fractional polarization Π0,med at 1.4 GHz is a strong function of source angular size . 5
′′ and a"
"weak function of angular size for larger sources up to ∼ 8′′. We interpret our results as depolarization
inside the AGN host galaxy and its circumgalactic medium. The curvature of the low-frequency radio"
"spectrum is found to anti-correlate with Π0,med, a further sign that depolarization is related to the"
source.

1. INTRODUCTION
An active galactic nucleus (AGN) often creates jets
that travel through the host galaxy and out into inter-
galactic space to form extended radio lobes filled with
"relativistic particles, that can extend for hundreds of"
"kpc. The total energy of radio lobes spans a wide range,"
up to 1061 erg for the most powerful radio sources (Mc-
Namara et al. 2005). Radio lobes displace plasma in
the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM) with tem-
"peratures averaging around 5 × 107 K which, at least
temporarily, prevents the gas from settling into a steady"
"state in the gravitational potential of the cluster, a pro-"
cess known as AGN feedback (Fabian 2012). If a steady
"state occurred, the gas density in the centre of the clus-"

ter would be high enough for the gas to cool and initiate
a high star formation rate in galaxies. It is widely sus-
pected that AGN feedback is the mechanism that sup-
presses such cooling flows (Balogh et al. 2001; Vernaleo
& Reynolds 2006; Peterson & Fabian 2006; McNamara
"& Nulsen 2007; Fabian 2012). For example, AGN can"
quench star formation by preventing the gas from cool-
"ing (thermal feedback), stirring the gas, or by expelling"
the gas from the galaxy completely (kinetic feedback)
(Ishibashi & Fabian 2012). Since the hot ICM repre-
"sents most of the baryonic mass of a cluster, AGN feed-"
back can have a profound impact on the formation and
evolution of massive galaxies (Silk & Rees 1998; Croton
et al. 2006; Nyland et al. 2018).
"The radio lobes have high pressure, from both the rel-"
"ativistic electrons and magnetic field, assuming that the"
energy density of the magnetic field is within an order of
magnitude from equipartition (e.g. Kronberg 2004). The
degree of linear polarization of the synchrotron emission

is of interest because it reveals ordering of the magnetic
field structure on large scales (Burn 1966). The orienta-
tion of a source with respect to the line of sight influences
which part of the source is most polarized. This may be
due to the projection of the mean magnetic field on the
"plane of the sky, or a result of the Laing-Garrington"
effect (Laing 1988; Garrington et al. 1988). The polar-
ization of extra-galactic sources may also be related to
"other properties of the source structure, including the"
"prominence of jets, hot spots and extended lobes. The"
accretion mode of the central engine (O’Sullivan et al.
"2017), and opacity of compact components (Farnes et al."
2014a) have been proposed as physical attributes of the
source that affect polarization of the integrated emis-
sion. Depolarization by intervening gas-rich systems has
been suggested as a contributing factor (e.g. Farnes et al.
2014b).
Comprehensive analysis of the polarization of bright
"(Sν & 100 mJy) radio sources has been done by Mesa
et al. (2002) and later by Tucci et al. (2004) using the"
NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) (Condon et al. 1998).
Mesa et al. (2002) found that the median polarization of
"sources at 1.4 GHz brighter than 80 mJy is ' 2.2%, and
that fainter sources have a significantly higher percent"
"polarization than for brighter sources. Furthermore,"
Mesa et al. (2002) found that the degree of polarization
"is anti-correlated with the flux density of sources, which"
was further confirmed by Tucci et al. (2004) for steep-
spectrum radio sources. Taylor et al. (2007) found the
median polarization increases to 4.8% for sources with
flux density of 10 < S1.4 < 30 mJy. Stil et al. (2014)
found that from 2 to 20 mJy the median degree of polar-
"ization in the NVSS remains .2.5%, much smaller than
previously claimed (Stil et al. 2014, for a review) but"
consistent with the findings of Rudnick & Owen (2014).
"At higher frequencies, Sadler et al. (2006) found a"
median percentage polarization of 2.3% for a sample
"of sources selected at 20 GHz, again with a trend for"
fainter sources to have a higher fractional polarization.
Bonavera et al. (2017) found a mean percentage polar-
ization for AGN sources of 3% to 3.5% from 30 GHz to
353 GHz via stacking Planck satellite data (Planck Col-
laboration et al. 2018). Trombetti et al. (2018) found
"∼ 3% polarization at 44 GHz and 100 GHz. However,
very few sources were detected in polarization at these"
"high frequencies, and their samples are dominated by"
flat spectrum sources. The available evidence suggests
that the median fractional polarization of AGN is re-
"markably constant from ∼ 1 GHz to a few hundred GHz.
Several authors have reported a correlation of frac-"
tional polarization with angular size in the sense that
extended radio sources are more polarized (Cotton et al.
2003; Grant et al. 2010; Rudnick & Owen 2014; Hales
et al. 2014; Lamee et al. 2016). Vernstrom et al. (2019)
examined a sample of 317 physical and 5111 random
pairs of bright radio sources and found that the physical
"pairs were more polarized than the random pairs, while"
the more widely separated physical pairs were more po-
larized than the close physical pairs. Correlations with
spectral index in the sense that flat-spectrum sources
"are less polarized (Tucci et al. 2004; Stil & Keller 2015),"
may be related as flat spectrum sources are believed to
be more compact (Sadler et al. 2006). Vernstrom et al.
(2019) reported a correlation of fractional polarization
with 150 MHz to 1400 MHz spectral index with polariza-
"tion increasing between α1501400 = −0.7 and α1501400 = −0.5.
Their sample was derived from the catalog of Taylor"
"et al. (2009), which applied a detection threshold in po-"
larized intensity.
Rudnick & Owen (2014) presented an ultra-deep po-
larization survey of the GOODS-N field (resolution of
"1.6′′, detection threshold of 14.5 µJy beam-1) and found"
that all sources with detected polarized emission were
resolved after convolving the images to a resolution of
"10′′. In other words, the polarized sources are associated"
with the small number of sources with emission on angu-
lar scales of 10′′. Windhorst (2003) derived an angular
"size - flux density relation of Ψ(′′) = 2.0 (S1.4)
0.3"
. For a
"source with S1.4 ∼ 20 mJy, the median angular size is
∼5.0′′. This raises the question what sub-population of
radio sources is represented in the faint mJy polarized"
"source population, and which plasma is responsible for"
wavelength-dependent depolarization.
The polarization detections in Rudnick & Owen
(2014) were identified with galaxies in the redshift range
"0.2 < z < 1.9. For a redshift of 0.5 < z < 2.0, an angular"
size of 10′′ corresponds to a physical size of about 83 kpc
"in a ΛCDM cosmology1 with H0 = 67 km s
−1 Mpc−1,"
"ΩM = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7 (Planck Collaboration et al. 2018)."
"Cotton et al. (2003), Fanti et al. (2004) and Ros-"
setti et al. (2008) reported a sudden drop in polar-
ization of Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) and Giga-
"hertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) sources (see O’Dea 1998,"
for a summary of defining characteristics) with largest
size less than 6 kpc. These authors adopted H0 =
100 km s−1 Mpc−1 and ΩM = 1 from the sample of Fanti
"et al. (2001), which means that the corresponding scale"
"in our adopted cosmology is 12 kpc, double the value"
listed by Cotton et al. (2003). Fanti et al. (2004) found
depolarization on scales . 2.5 kpc (5 kpc adjusted for

consistent with this cosmology."

"cosmology) at 3.6 cm wavelength and at . 4 kpc (8 kpc
adjusted for cosmology) at 6 cm wavelength. This wave-"
length dependence was attributed to Faraday depolar-
ization (Burn 1966) by the dense interstellar medium in
the inner parts of a gas-rich host galaxy (Chiaberge et al.
"2009). In this context, the question whether some of the"
low-frequency opacity in these sources is attributed to
free-free absorption is most interesting. The sub-galactic
scale at which this depolarization occurs is much smaller
"than the ∼ 80 kpc scale suggested by the 10′′ angular
scale found by Rudnick & Owen (2014). GPS sources"
are believed to be the more compact examples of a con-
tinuous sequence where larger sources become optically
thin at lower frequencies (e.g. O’Dea 1998). Sources
that were historically included in CSS samples tend to
"display a turnover of the spectrum below ∼ 500 MHz.
Recently, Webster et al. (2020) presented a sample of"
galaxy-scale radio sources identified at 150 MHz that do
not have an inverted low-frequency spectrum.
"The bright radio source population (S1.4 ≥ 100 mJy)
consists mostly of luminous sources (Wilman et al."
"2008), brighter than the luminosity boundary between"
FR I and FR II radio galaxies (Fanaroff & Riley 1974).
Radio galaxies below the traditional FR I/FR II lumi-
"nosity boundary dominate the population below ∼30
mJy, but recent work has indicated that numerous low-"
luminosity sources with FR II morphology exist (e.g.
Mingo et al. 2019). Webster et al. (2020) found 8 times
more FR I than FR II in their sample of sources with
"galaxy-scale jets, although the majority of their sample"
remained unclassified.
Very little is known about the polarization proper-
"ties of this faint radio source population, which may"
be different from bright sources whose polarization is
detectable in current all-sky surveys. Deep surveys of
small areas of the sky have revealed some interesting
"results, but these investigations are limited by small-"
sample statistics.
In this paper we use stacking to investigate the rela-
tionship between source angular size and polarization of
"fainter, generally less powerful, AGN. The radio sources"
investigated here have a total 1.4 GHz flux density be-
"tween 6.6 ≤ S1.4 ≤ 70.0 mJy detected in the NVSS
(Condon et al. 1998) and FIRST (White et al. 1997)"
surveys. We also derive representative spectral indices2
for these samples. Stacking is useful because it allows
us to investigate much larger samples with a sensitivity
similar to that of the deepest small-area surveys. This
approach is different from direct observation because it

determines the median polarization of a flux density lim-
ited sample without detection threshold.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes
"the method of stacking, the radio survey data used, and"
the method of sample selection; Section 3 presents the
main results of the stacking; and lastly Sections 4 and 5
provide a discussion of the results and subsequent con-
clusions.
2. METHODS AND DATA
2.1. Stacking
Stacking is a technique to detect the mean or median
"signal of a sample of sources if the individual sources, or"
"a significant fraction of the sample, cannot be detected"
individually. Samples of galaxies selected from optical or
"infrared surveys, have been stacked at radio wavelengths"
(White et al. 2007; Carilli et al. 2008; Garn & Alexander
"2009, Ocran et al., in prep.). Stacking is particularly"
effective for investigation of significant samples of rare
"types of sources, for which it is impractical to do deep"
observations of each source.
Polarization is a special case for stacking. The target
catalog can be selected from the total intensity radio
"survey, while stacking is performed on the polarization"
data from the same survey. When combining a large
"sample of unrelated sources, stacking the Stokes param-"
eters Q and U will result in zero signal because of the
random distribution of polarization angles. Stacking is
mostly done on images of polarized intensity. This cre-
ates additional challenges because the noise in the im-
ages is non-Gaussian. The probability density function
"of polarized intensity,"
"p =
√
Q2 + U2, (1)"
is given by the Rice distribution (Rice 1945; Vinokur
"1965),"
"F (p | p0, σQU ) =
p"
"σQU
exp
[
−p"
"2 + p20
2σ2QU"
"( ipp0
σQU"
")
. (2)"
"Here, p0 is the true polarized signal, J0 is the 0
th order"
"Bessel function, and σQU is the standard deviation of the"
"noise in the Stokes Q and U images, which is presumed"
Gaussian.
"In the limit of no signal, p0 = 0, the Rice distribution"
reverts to the Rayleigh distribution. For very weak but
"finite polarized signal, p0 < σQU , the relation between"
the median of the Rice distribution and the true polar-
ized signal p0 is non-linear. The expectation value of the
observed polarized intensity is also much larger than the
true signal (e.g. Simmons & Stewart 1985). The median
observed polarized intensity pmed of a sample of sources
4 Johnston et al.
also depends in a complicated way on the distribution
of the true signals (Stil et al. 2014). We return to this
issue in Section 3.1.
Stacking gives us the median observed polarized inten-
"sity, which is far from the true sample median because"
of this strong polarization bias. The median polarized
signal can be retrieved by means of Monte Carlo Simu-
lations as described by Stil et al. (2014). Similar proce-
dures were also applied at higher frequencies to polariza-
tion from the Planck satellite by Bonavera et al. (2017)
and Trombetti et al. (2018). In order to correct for con-
tamination of the cosmic microwave background polar-
"ization by AGN, stacking the square of fractional polar-"
"ization is also applied, with different statistics (Gupta"
et al. 2019).
The Monte Carlo simulations aim to reproduce the
distribution of observed polarized intensities pi for a
"given distribution of true polarized intensities p0,i, de-"
fined by a distribution function with an adjustable me-
dian. The median of the model distribution is then var-
ied until the median of the simulated pi matches the
median of the observed polarized intensities. The shape
of the distribution is constrained by the distribution of
"observed polarized intensities, traced by the ratio of the"
upper quartile to the lower quartile (Stil et al. 2014).
The polarized source counts derived from stacking by
Stil et al. (2014) were closely consistent with those de-
rived from the GOODS-N deep field (Rudnick & Owen
"2014), and the implied density of polarized sources has"
recently been confirmed by early observations of the
POSSUM survey.
In this paper we apply Monte Carlo simulations simi-
"lar to those of Stil et al. (2014), with a modification for"
the broad flux density bins of the samples investigated
here. The flux density range within a bin is included in
the simulations by multiplying the fractional polariza-
tion Π0 drawn from the assumed distribution with the
actual flux density of each source in the sample. This
ensures that the range of flux densities in the sample
is represented into the simulated distribution of pi. A
dummy run of the stack on images of Stokes Q or U
"is made to measure a local noise level σQU,i for each"
source. Further description of the Monte Carlo simula-
tions is postponed until Section 3 as it requires details
derived during the analysis.
2.2. The Data
In this paper we utilize data from a total of five radio
sky surveys. For stacking polarization we use the NRAO
"VLA Sky Survey3 (NVSS; Condon et al. 1998), which"
"covers 82% of the sky (∼ 33885 deg2) imaged at 1400
MHz in total and polarized intensity. With the VLA in"
"‘D’ configuration, the NVSS has an angular resolution"
"of 45′′ (FWHM). However, in this paper we only use"
the original source catalog for the purpose of sample
"selection, as discussed in Section 2.3. For stacking, we"
utilize a version of the NVSS constructed by Taylor et al.
(2009) where the images were made at 60′′ resolution. In
"the original NVSS survey images, intensities are rounded"
"to a fraction of the noise, which interferes with stacking."
"The NVSS has a root mean square (rms) noise of ∼
0.45 mJy beam−1 in total intensity and ∼ 0.29 mJy
beam−1 in Stokes Q and U. The 90% confidence range"
"for positions is approximately±1′′ in right ascension and
declination for strong sources and ±2′′ for faint sources
(Condon et al. 1998). These errors are small enough"
to include position information in our sample selection
and interpretation of images from surveys with higher
angular resolution in following sections.
Sample selection of the sources used for stacking in-
volves a combination of the NVSS and the Faint Im-
ages of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters survey4
"(FIRST; White et al. 1997; Helfand et al. 2015), also"
"imaged at 1400 MHz, but with the VLA in ‘B’ config-"
"uration. FIRST covers 25.63% (10,575 square degrees)"
of the sky with 5′′ angular resolution and rms noise of
"∼ 0.15 mJy beam−1. Therefore, FIRST has a much
better positional accuracy of < 0.5′′ rms (White et al."
1997) and can distinguish small-scale structures with ac-
curate positions. The largest angular scale detectable by
"FIRST is ∼ 30′′.
For spectral analysis we use three additional low-"
frequency surveys to accompany the higher frequency
"NVSS, starting with the Westerbork Northern Sky Sur-"
"vey5 (WENSS; Rengelink et al. 1997). WENSS covers
3.14 sr of the sky north of declination +29◦. At 325"
"MHz, WENSS has a 54′′ resolution with a positional ac-"
"curacy of 1.5′′ and an rms noise of ∼ 4 mJy beam−1.
This sensitivity is a good match to the NVSS for steep"
"spectrum sources, but less so for sources with a flat or"
an inverted spectrum. In this paper we use stacking of
total intensity images in all surveys to retrieve a sample
median flux density at each frequency.
We also utilized the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey6 ADR1
(TGSS; Intema et al. 2017) made with the Giant Me-

trewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) which covers 3.6π sr
"of the sky between declination −53◦ and +90◦ imaged
at a frequency of 150 MHz. The rms noise of the TGSS"
"is 〈σ〉 ≈ 5 mJy beam−1. The original resolution of the
TGSS is 25′′ but in this work we used the Common"
Astronomy Software Applications (CASA; Jaeger 2008)
task imsmooth to convolve the published TGSS images
"to 60′′ resolution. After convolution, the image noise is"
14 mJy beam−1 rms.
"Finally, we use the 74 MHz VLA Low-Frequency Sky"
Survey7 (VLSS; Cohen et al. 2007) with a FWHM an-
gular resolution of 80′′ and an average rms noise of
"∼ 100 mJy beam−1. These four surveys have compara-
ble beam-sizes which is ideal for spectral analysis of the"
"integrated emission of radio sources. When combined,"
these surveys sample the spectral energy distribution
from 74 MHz to 1400 MHz.
To gain insight into the morphology of our samples
"in greater detail, we make use of the quick-look im-"
ages from the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Sur-
"vey8 (VLASS; Lacy et al. 2020). Similar to the NVSS,"
VLASS will image the entire sky north of declination
"−40◦ in Stokes I, Q, and U. But unlike the NVSS and
FIRST surveys, VLASS is imaged in the 2 to 4 GHz"
"frequency range and will have 2.5′′× 2.5′′ (VLA B/BnA
configurations) angular resolution with a combined sen-"
sitivity of 70µJy rms. The final data products are not
yet available. We only do a limited investigation of angu-
lar size and morphology using Stokes I quick-look images
released through the NRAO website.
2.3. Sample Selection
The sample selection process started with a list of
unconfused sources from the unified catalogue of ra-
"dio sources9 compiled by Kimball & Ivezić (2008), and"
is similar to the sample selection for structure applied
by these authors. The catalog combines data of radio
"sources from four radio catalogs, including the FIRST,"
"NVSS, and WENSS surveys. The data set was re-"
duced to only include sources within the footprint of
"the FIRST survey, which is completely covered by the"
NVSS. The FIRST survey specifically avoids the galactic
"plane (|b| . 2◦) and was chosen in part to ensure that all
sources examined in this paper are extragalactic in na-"
"ture. This reduced the list from approximately 2.7×106
sources to ∼ 1.0×106 for further sample selection. From
the reduced data set we start by using logarithmic bin-"
ning to divide the data into 7 flux bins across a NVSS
"7 https://www.cv.nrao.edu/vlss/VLSSpostage.shtml
8 https://science.nrao.edu/vlass
9 http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/∼akimball/radiocat.shtml"
"flux density range from ∼6.6 to 70.0 mJy, with a bin
size of 0.146 dex, or a factor of 1.4 in flux density."
Sample selection makes use of the recorded sky co-
ordinates of the sources as reported in the NVSS and
FIRST catalogs. As a result of the difference in angular
"resolution of the FIRST and NVSS surveys, indepen-"
dent RA and DEC values in J2000 equatorial coordi-
nates are provided in each survey for the same source
on the sky. The NVSS position can be seen as an aver-
age of the FIRST positions weighted by the brightness of
FIRST sources within the NVSS beam. The NVSS po-
"sition errors are only ∼ 1′′ (FWHM), so we can use the
angular separation (r) between the reported positions"
(NVSS/FIRST) during sample selection. If we want to
"select single sources, we can restrict the reduced data-set"
to only include sources where the reported positions in
"FIRST and NVSS agree to within a small amount, such"
"as 3′′. Or if we want to select double sources, we only"
include sources where the reported positions are differ-
"ent by a significant amount, such as 5′′ to 7′′, alongside"
other selection criteria.
"Along with the restriction on position separation, each"
flux bin is divided into sub-samples based on two addi-
tional parameters. We start with the ratio of the inte-
grated flux densities (S) of both NVSS and FIRST. This
can be defined as a parameter R so that
"R = SNVSS
SFIRST"
"If both surveys measured the same flux density, such"
"that SNVSS = SFIRST, then R = 1, implying that there
is a single source at the centre of the NVSS point spread"
"function. But if R = 2 and the reported positions do
not align, then FIRST will resolve a likely double source"
with components of equal brightness within the NVSS
beam. This statement will be verified later.
"Additionally, we select samples based on the compact-"
"ness of each source, which is defined as the ratio of the in-"
tegrated flux density and peak intensity of FIRST. This
compactness parameter C can be written as
"C = SFIRST
IFIRST"
The compactness parameter describes how closely re-
lated the FIRST peak intensity is to the integrated in-
tensity of the source. SFIRST is derived from fitting a
"two-dimensional Gaussian to each source. If C = 1 then
the peak intensity is equal to the integrated intensity"
"and the source is very compact. By extension if C > 1
then the source becomes more extended for higher val-"
"ues of C. Later in this paper, we will derive more precise
mean angular sizes as a function of C."

"bins) to Single e (most extended, all flux bins), where"
necessary accompanied by an index number for the flux
"bin (1 to 7, e.g. Single 3a). We may also refer to all"
Single samples in flux bin 1 as Single 1.
"Similarly, in Figure 2 we select double sources by only"
accepting sources if the FIRST position is considerably
"different from the NVSS position, in this case between 5′′"
"and 7′′. Now most sources are distributed near R ≈ 2.
This is because there is another FIRST source within the"
synthesised NVSS beam. A sample of double sources is
"then selected in the orange box with flux ratio 1.7 ≤
R ≤ 2.3 and compactness 0.9 ≤ C ≤ 1.4. We call this
the Double a sample (Table 1). Sources to the left and"
"right ofR ≈ 2 (orange box) are still likely double sources
but asymmetrical in brightness. This process is then"
"repeated for a position difference of 7′′ ≤ r ≤ 9′′. This
is the Double b sample. Where necessary the Double"
samples are written with a flux bin number in analogy
with the Single samples.
"Using the method described in Figures 1 and 2, 49"
samples were selected across a NVSS flux range of
"∼ 6.6 ≤ SNV SS ≤ 70.0 mJy. Relevant information
on the samples and their respective selection criteria is"
summarised in Table 1. The sample sizes range from
"several hundred to several thousand, and contain a to-"
"tal of 67,967 sources. Due to the nature of the selec-"
"tion algorithm, a small number of Double sources were"
included in both angular separation selections. How-
"ever, this only occurs for ≈ 1.6% (62/3850) of all double
sources selected for stacking and can be considered sta-"
tistically negligible for our purposes.
Figure 3 illustrates the fraction of all available sources
"that are actually included in our analysis, and the frac-"
tion of each sample. The figure compares the number of
sources selected for stacking in each sample divided by
the number of NVSS sources within the footprint of the
FIRST survey for each flux density bin. In the bright-
"est flux bin we obtain ∼ 51.43% of all available sources,
and ∼ 24.09% of all sources in the faintest flux bin. We"

describe the morphology of the selected samples before
we show a random selection of sources that were not
included in any of our samples.
"The most compact sources (0.9 ≤ C ≤ 1.15), corre-
sponding to the dark blue box of Figure 1, represent"
the vast majority of the sources selected in each flux bin
"for stacking with sample sizes on the order of ∼ 103 and
∼ 104. It is also evident that the fraction of sources that
we select in each bin becomes progressively smaller for"
fainter flux bins. This decrease may be due to sources
being removed from the selection boxes due to noise or
position errors. The efficacy of the sample selection lim-
"its the flux density range of this work, not our ability to"
detect a signal in stacked polarized intensity.

e (yellow) samples as listed in Table 1. The Double a and
Double b samples are at the very top in orange and red, re-
spectively."
Examples of the appearance of these samples as seen
"in FIRST are provided in Figures 4, 5, and 6. Each"
"figure is comprised of a 5×6 mosaic of 54′′×54′′ images
of sources selected from the 13.0 ≤ S1.4 ≤ 18.0 mJy flux
bin 5. This representation illustrates the composition"
of the samples in a way that any peculiar sub-class in
the sample that represents 10% or more of sources in
the sample should be represented by a few examples in
these figures. The most compact samples examined in
"this paper are C ≤ 1.15, which are essentially unresolved
in FIRST, trivially appearing as a point source. Sources"
that are just resolved in FIRST can be seen in Figure
"4 for a compactness range of 1.15 ≤ C ≤ 1.4 (Single
5b). Sources that are even more resolved (1.9 ≤ C ≤
2.4; Single 5d) are shown in Figure 5. With this visual"
inspection we verify that our ranges of C effectively sort
"sources by angular size, with no significant dilution of"
the samples by noise. These figures also suggest that
none of our samples is close to the confusion limit.
"For comparison, Figure 6 shows a mosaic of the double"
"radio sources (Double 5a). As expected, each image in"
the mosaic consists of two reasonably symmetric radio
"lobes near each other at various orientations. However,"
"some sources such as those in panels (row, column) (2,1)"
"and (5,2) appear to have only one lobe present or have"
very faint lobes. This suggests there is extended emis-
"sion in some sources that is resolved out in FIRST, which"
is one of the challenges higher resolution surveys face as
pointed out by Rudnick & Owen (2014).
"Figure 4. 5 × 6 mosaic of single sources from flux bin 5
(13.0 ≤ S1.4 ≤ 18.2 mJy) that are just resolved in FIRST,
Sample 5b (Table 1, 1.15 ≤ C ≤ 1.4). Each individual image
is a 54′′ × 54′′ section of the sky centered on the position in
the NVSS source catalog."
Figure 7 shows a random subset of the sources in flux
bin 3 that were not selected. The panels are 54′′ on a
side to allow comparison with the samples represented
"in Figures 4, 5, and 6. About half of the rejected sources"
have larger angular size and more complex morphology
"than sources in our samples. On rare occasions, we find"
a source that is just one lobe of a much more extended
source. This may be the case for the first and the fifth
source in the top row of Figure 7. The larger angular
size of these sources would complicate interpretation of
the stacked intensities. Our sample selection also re-
jects asymmetric double sources. These are interesting
"in their own right, but stacking of asymmetric double"
sources is a significant separate investigation. We re-
tain the symmetric Double samples because their com-
"ponents have the same C as our most compact Single
samples."

"Figure 5. Mosaic of single sources that are well resolved in
FIRST, Sample 5d (Table 1, 1.9 ≤ C ≤ 2.4, flux bin 5). The
sources are shown with the same angular scale and intensity
range as those in Figure 4."
"Figure 6. Mosaic of randomly selected double sources from
sample Double 5a (Table 1, 5′′ ≤ r ≤ 7′′, flux bin 5). All
other details are the same as those in Figures 4 and 5."
"We also see some rejected compact sources, most likely"
"due to variability, but this is not a large fraction of the"
rejected sources. Rejection because of variability must
"be rare because we find few sources with R << 1 be-
yond what can be attributed to noise (Figure 1). In-"
"tema et al. (2017) find that R can decrease to ∼ 0.8 for
the faintest detectable sources in their survey. R < 1
occurs also for brighter sources, but asymptotically R
approaches 1. We do not use sources close to the detec-"
"tion threshold of FIRST and NVSS, so we apply a lower"
"limit R > 0.9. The requirement of a significant po-
sition offset between FIRST and NVSS guards against"
contamination of the Double samples by variable Single
sources. By far the largest subset of rejected sources
are extended radio galaxies with angular size compara-
ble to or larger than the NVSS beam. This adds con-
fidence that our Single samples represent well-defined
and reasonably complete sub-sets of the compact mJy
radio source population.
The representative angular size of sources in our sam-
ples may be derived using the new quick-look images
"of the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS), nominal frequency 3"
"GHz, angular resolution 2.5′′. The VLASS quick-look"
images are slightly under-sampled and have only lim-
ited application because of their preliminary calibration
"and imaging. The frequency is also higher, which may"
cause subtle effects imposed by differences in spectral
"index. However, all our samples are within the angular"
"size range detectable by VLASS, and the 2.5′′ angular"
resolution is high enough to place meaningful limits on
source size.
"Figure 7. A random selection of 30 sources rejected by our
sample selection for flux bin 3 (Table 1). The panels are
54′′ on a side, illustrating that many of rejected sources are
more extended than any in our samples. Smaller subsets of
rejected sources consist of asymmetric doubles and compact
sources whose FIRST flux density differs from the NVSS flux
density, presumably because of variability. Other possible
reasons for rejection are excessive flux errors related to image
artifacts and occasional large position errors. At these flux
density levels, the chance of a random alignment within the
NVSS beam is small because the confusion limit is well below
the brightness of the faintest samples."
"Table 2 lists θ1/2, the FWHM of the emission of the"
single-source samples derived from Gaussian fits to the
mean-stacked VLASS images. For the largest two sam-
"ples, the brightness distribution is not quite Gaussian"
and the images are less smooth because of the smaller
sample size and the larger solid angle. The estimated er-
"ror for the compact samples is about 0.1′′, while for the"
Properties of Compact Faint Radio Sources 9
two most extended samples the error is approximately
1′′. The fitted FWHM is larger for the fainter samples
compared to brighter samples with the same compact-
"ness C, in a way that is consistent with NVSS position er-
rors increasing from about 1′′ (FWHM) to 3′′ (FWHM)"
over the flux density range 70 mJy to 7 mJy.
Deconvolved angular sizes were derived from the
mean-stacked VLASS images by subtracting in quadra-
ture a 2.5′′ (FWHM) circular Gaussian beam and 1′′
"(FWHM) position errors for the brightest samples, with"
no further correction for under-sampling of the VLASS
synthesized beam. This results in deconvolved FWHM
sizes for the samples of Single 1 sources (50 mJy to
"70 mJy) as 1.8′′ ± 0.1′′ (0.9 ≤ C ≤ 1.15), 2.9′′ ± 0.1′′
(1.15 ≤ C ≤ 1.4), 4.9′′ ± 0.2′′ (1.4 ≤ C ≤ 1.9), 6.5′′ ± 1′′
(1.9 ≤ C ≤ 2.4), and 8.2′′ ± 1′′ (2.4 ≤ C ≤ 5.0). These
correspond to projected physical sizes of 15, 24, 41, 54,"
"and 68 kpc, respectively for an angular size distance 1.72"
Gpc at z = 1. We note that the median angular size at
70 mJy according to the relation of Windhorst (2003) is
"7′′, which is large compared to the angular sizes found"
"for our samples. This is a result of our sample selection,"
"which is more targeted towards compact, single sources"
in the FIRST survey. We will return to this in Section 4.
Mean-stacked VLASS images of the Double 5 samples
are shown in Figure 8. The ring morphology is the sig-
nature of a set of randomly oriented double sources with
separation according to expectations from the sample se-
lection. We find little or no evidence for a central core as
a third source component. The symmetric appearance in
individual VLASS and FIRST images suggests that the
sample is dominated by edge-brightened sources with a
FR II morphology. Only a few of our Double sources
appear as a compact core with a more extended jet or
lobe. The mean stacked VLASS images show significant
brightness within the annulus defined in the sample se-
lection. We adopt an angular size of 12′′ (100 kpc at
z = 1) for the Double a sample and an angular size of
"16′′ (133 kpc) to the Double b sample. In this paper,"
we are mainly concerned with the angular size of the
"Single samples, which is derived in a different way. We"
only make qualitative reference to the relative sizes of
the Single and Double samples. This is possible because
our sample selection strictly requires one compact com-
"ponent in the FIRST catalog to be within the annulus,"
with a flux density that is approximately half the NVSS
"flux density, and no further requirement for the distri-"
bution of the remaining flux. There is no requirement
whether the brighter or the fainter component matches
the offset criterion with the NVSS position. Inspection
of the sample (Figure 6) shows that this results mostly in
sources for which most of the flux density is in two com-
pact components. Individual VLASS images suggest a
FR II morphology for most sources in our samples of
"doubles, so we tentatively interpret the two components"
as hot spots that trace the extremities of the source.
The source list was filtered to avoid the same source
appearing twice in the target list.

the images used in the stacking analysis."
Our samples of Doubles were selected for comparison
with the Single source samples as a function of angu-
lar size. The sample selection targets Doubles with at
least one compact component. Figure 2 suggests that
there are other double sources with a more unequal flux
"density ratio of the components, and perhaps more dif-"
fuse components. This is significant because our Double
sample selection may favour sources with jet axis in the
plane of the sky whose opposite sides are the least sub-
ject to the Laing-Garrington effect (Laing 1988; Garring-
ton et al. 1988). The Double samples are by selection
"almost exclusively sources with FR II morphology, while"
the Single samples probably include sources with dif-
ferent morphology that remains undetermined with the
available data. This should be taken into account when
comparing the Double samples with the Single samples.
We will return to this topic in the discussion.
"Unlike the Double samples, the mean-stacked VLASS"
images of the Single samples are clearly brightest at the
"center, defined by the NVSS position. Inspection of the"
VLASS images of individual sources shown in Figure 9
"shows a linear morphology that is often, but not always"
"edge-darkened, reminiscent of a poorly resolved source"
with FR I morphology. Blended lobes of an FR II source
may give the same appearance. Approximately half of
the Single a sources in Figure 9 shows asymmetry with
"a brighter side and a fainter side, and half is quite sym-"
"metric, elongated in one direction and unresolved in the"
orthogonal direction. The Single a sample also contains
sources that appear compact double sources at the reso-

is a homogeneous morphological class. Very few sources
in our samples appear to be resolved in two dimensions

or near-infrared identifications of these samples. Inspec-
tion of SDSS DR7 images made available through the

cates that for all samples the host galaxies must be near
or beyond the photometric limit of the SDSS (r mag-

nancini et al. (2010) presented a detailed study of radio
galaxies in the SDSS in relation to spectral index and en-"
vironment. Considering that host galaxies of radio loud
"AGN tend to be luminous elliptical galaxies, we get a"
crude indication that all our samples are dominated by
"radio sources at significant redshift. Most importantly,"
it is clear that our most compact sample does not include
a large number of low-redshift star forming galaxies.
3. RESULTS
"3.1. Derivation of the true sample median Π0,med"
The main objective of this paper is to further inves-
tigate the results of Rudnick & Owen (2014). In this
paper we follow the procedure for stacking total and po-
"larized intensity as outlined by Stil et al. (2014), which is"
performed using the Python Astronomical Stacking Tool
Array (PASTA) by Keller & Stil (2018). Table 2 lists
"the median SNVSS flux densities for each stacked image,"
"the number of sources included in each stack (Nstack),"
and the results of subsequent analysis of the stacking.
Figure 10 shows raw stacked images in total (left col-
umn) and polarized (right column) intensity from flux
bin 5 with a median flux density SNVSS = 15.35 mJy.
Each row of images is a sub-sample which corresponds
"to a different compactness C selection. Source angular
size increases from top to bottom, the last 2 rows being"
the Double samples. The median peak total intensity of
"the images shown is 14.99±0.05 mJy and varies between
each sub-sample by up to a maximum 1.59% difference"
"from the median value (See Table 2). By comparison,"
"the Stokes I background noise varies between ∼ 0.02 and
∼ 0.07 mJy beam−1. The noise in Stokes I stacked im-
ages is raised by residual side lobes of emission below the"
clean threshold of the NVSS. The most compact sample
"for the flux bin shown in Figure 10 has 8202 sources,"
while the most extended sample has only 223 sources.
While the total intensity images in Figure 10 do not
"vary significantly, there are clear visible differences in"
the median stacked polarized intensity images. Notice
the much fainter stacked polarized median intensity of
pmed = 0.41 mJy for the sources unresolved in FIRST at
5′′. There is a considerable jump in polarized intensity
to pmed = 0.55 mJy as soon as a source becomes resolved
"in FIRST, with subtle visible increases in strength as a"
"source becomes more extended. Additionally, we can"
see that the double sources in the last two rows have
the strongest polarized intensity signal at pmed = 0.64
mJy. We find similar results in the raw stacked images
across all flux bins.
The mean background level in stacked polarized inten-
sity (pmed) is always positive as a result of the polariza-
tion bias in the absence of signal. The average noise in
the Stokes Q and U images from the NVSS is 0.29 mJy
beam−1 (Condon et al. 1998). In each of the stacked
"polarized intensity images, the median off-source back-"
"ground is approximately 0.365 mJy beam−1, which is"
close to the expected median of the Rayleigh distribu-
"tion σQU
√"
2 ln 2 = 0.341 mJy beam−1. In the present
"analysis, we use local noise values, derived from the ac-"
"tual survey images, for each source."
The noise level of the stacked polarized intensity im-
ages as a function of sample size is examined by off-
setting the declination values from the original target
sources in each sample by 1◦. These new offset target
"lists are then stacked again, effectively creating median"
stacked images of the background noise surrounding the
area of the source. Figure 11 visualizes the off-source
background noise as a function of the stacked sample
"size (Nstack), which can be fitted by a power law of"

source increases from top to bottom. The differences be-
tween the stacked Stokes I images are too subtle to be seen
in this representation. The stacked polarized intensity im-
ages display a significant increase in the median polarized
signal with angular size of the source, most notably for the
more compact sources. The noise in stacked polarized inten-
sity is higher for smaller samples, resulting in a lower signal

B = 0.260± 0.005, and β = −0.500± 0.003, for a domain of

All of the sources in each of the selected samples are
distributed throughout the survey. This means that the
differences in the raw median stacked images such as
those shown in Figure 10 are not simply the result of
"an artifact of noise or other data bias, instead being"
"the result of real astrophysical differences. Therefore, it"
can already be concluded in a qualitative way that the
percent polarization of extragalactic sources is strongly
"related to their structure, with extended sources on a"
"scale of & 5′′ having a higher median percent polariza-
tion than more compact sources."
3.2. Monte Carlo simulations
The noise bias and statistical errors related to polar-
ization are modeled with Monte Carlo simulations of the
stacking as described in Section 2.1. The true median
"fractional polarization Π0,med for each sample derived"
from the Monte Carlo simulations is listed in Table 2
with errors derived from the variance in the Monte Carlo
simulations. The errors are larger for the Single b - e
samples and the Double samples due to the smaller sam-
ple sizes. We find very significant differences in median
fractional polarization in relation to structure. Before
"we discuss these in more detail, we must return to the"
effect of the assumed distribution function of Π0 on the
"derived sample median Π0,med."
Stil et al. (2014) pointed out that samples with the
same true median polarized intensity will have some-
what different stacked median polarized intensity de-
pending on the true distribution of polarized intensity

of the sample. This happens because of the non-linear
relation between the expectation value of polarized in-
tensity and the true signal at low signal to noise ratio.
"The distribution on the derived Π0,med introduces a sys-"
tematic effect that is typically several times the statis-
"tical noise in the stacked polarized intensity, but it is"
only a fraction of the polarization bias correction itself
"(c.f. Stil et al. 2014, Figures 4 and 6). A distribution of"
true polarized intensities implies that the polarized sig-
"nal to noise ratio is different for every source, even if the"
noise is perfectly uniform in the survey. The non-linear
relation between observed and true polarized intensity
yields a disproportionately higher polarized intensity for
the sources in the sample that have a higher p0. Unless
"the signal to noise ratio is high, the true distribution of"
p0 skews the distribution of observed p. For sufficiently
"large samples, this effect can be detected and exploited"
to derive or approximate the distribution of p0 (Stil et al.
2014).
Figure 12 illustrates the effect of the distribution of in-
"trinsic p0,i on the distribution of observed pi for two of"
our samples. The thick gray curves represent the cumu-
lative distributions of observed polarized intensity p for
the Single 2a sample (top) and the combined Double 2
sample (bottom). We do Monte Carlo realizations of the
stack that assume a distribution function of fractional
"polarization that is scaled to vary Π0,med as a fitting pa-"
rameter. Model distributions of pi are then generated
"for the specific sample, by reading the Stokes I intensity"
and local noise level for each source. We apply a frac-
"tional polarization drawn from the assumed distribution,"
to be multiplied by the Stokes I intensity of a real source
"in the sample, and a polarization angle from a uniform"
distribution. This yields model Stokes Q0 and U0 to
"which Gaussian noise is added, with standard deviation"
equal to noise in Q/U images local to the source. This
approach allows us to generate model pi that include the
"range in flux density of the sample, the sample size, and"
the local noise level. We generate many (typically 100

"only the median Π0,med to vary with flux density."
The model cumulative distributions shown in Fig-
ure 12 all intersect the cumulative distribution of the
data at the median because they represent fits to the
"median polarized intensity of the data. They may, how-"
"ever, deviate elsewhere from the cumulative distribution"
of the data. Deviations may also occur because of the
"finite sample size, and exceptional data values related to"
image errors and confusing sources that populate the ex-
treme wing of the distribution. We use median stacking
to minimize the effect of outliers. With the same argu-
"ment, we use the quartiles p25% and p75% to quantify"
differences between the model and observed cumulative
distributions in a way that is robust against outliers.
"Specifically, the ratio of these quartiles gives us one num-"
"ber that, in conjunction with the requirement to fit the"
"median, quantifies agreement between the Monte Carlo"
distributions and the data (Figure 12). Stil et al. (2014)
pointed out that the effect of the distribution function
of Π0 is much smaller than the total polarization bias
"correction, especially at a high signal to noise ratio. The"
effect of the assumed distribution of Π0 changes the de-
rived median fractional polarization by an amount that
is more than the statistical errors but less than the differ-
"ences between samples. We return to this in Section 4,"
after we present our results.
It is always possible to reproduce the median polar-
ized intensity of the sample assuming a distribution of
"Π0 for which the median Π0,med is a fitting parameter,"
"by scaling the distribution function. However, an ar-"
bitrary distribution will not reproduce the quartile ra-
"tio as a function of flux density, as shown by Stil et al."
(2014). The requirement to match the quartile ratio can
be met by adjusting the distribution function of Π0 in
the Monte Carlo simulations. We do not expect to re-
"trieve the actual distribution function, but we can thus"
make a parameterization of the distribution of Π0 that is
consistent with the data. The main point is to define the
number of sources in the sample with stronger polarized
signal in relation to those with weaker polarized signal
"in a continuous way. To do this, we can afford some"
freedom in the parameters introduced in the description
of the distribution function.
Figure 13 shows quartile ratios as a function of flux
density for different samples. The error bars plotted
on the data represent the standard deviation of inde-
pendent Monte Carlo realizations that adopt the fitting
"Π0,med and model distribution. A single distribution"
function reproduces the quartile ratios of a sample as a
function of flux density reasonably well. Also shown are
dashed curves that represent the quartile ratios of fits
with distributions from other samples. These illustrate
the statistical significance with which some distributions
are rejected by the quartile ratio test.
A Gaussian distribution of Π0 reproduces the quar-
tile ratios for samples Single b and Single c reasonable
"well (Figure 13, top right and bottom left). However,"
assuming a Gaussian distribution of Π0 that matches
"pmed for the most compact sample Single a, results in"
the blue dashed curve in the top left corner of Figure 13.
A Π0 distribution with a much stronger tail is required
to reproduce the quartile ratios observed for the most
"compact sources. To this end, we used Π0 ≥ 0 distribu-
tions of the form"
"f1(Π0) ∼
1"
"A+ Π
γ
0"
with A = 1.95% and γ = 1.8. This distribution yields
"a median fractional polarization of 2.23%, which can be"
adjusted by scaling the values drawn at random by the
desired factor.
The Double samples are also not well represented by
a Gaussian distribution of Π0 (blue dashed curve in the
"bottom right panel of Figure 13). Here, a Gaussian dis-"
"tribution yields a quartile ratio that is too large. The Π0
distribution that matches the most compact sample pro-"
"vides an even worse fit than the Gaussian, as shown in"
Figure 12 (bottom panel and the dark blue dashed curve
"in the bottom right panel of Figure 13. Here, a distri-"
bution that tends more toward a uniform distribution is
"required. After some experimentation, a Gaussian with"
"a positive mean value, discarding any negative values,"
"was selected. The distribution function, for Π0 ≥ 0,"
"f2(Π0) ∼ exp
[
− 1"
"2
(Π0 − 0.7)2"
"]
, (6)"
yields a median fractional polarization 1.01%. The func-
tion was subsequently scaled along the Π0 axis to adjust
the median. The data do not require a distribution with
"a local minimum at Π0 = 0, but there is no a priori"
reason to rule out such a distribution either. Consider-
"ing the modest size of the double samples, this function"
proved adequate.
It may at first glance appear strange that a single
Π0 distribution function leads to different quartile ratio
curves in different panels of Figure 13. These differ-
ences are most evident for the dark-blue curves in Fig-
ure 13. The reason for this behaviour is the different
signal to noise ratio of the sample that must be repro-
"duced. In the construction of the quartile ratio curves,"
the Π0 distribution is scaled to produce a median value
of the observed polarized intensity after blending in the

noise. For a sample with a higher median stacked polar-
"ized intensity, pmed, the signal to noise ratio is higher,"
and therefore the quartile ratio is closer to the quartile
ratio of the true distribution. The quartile ratio of the
noise without signal is determined in turn by the range
of noise values in the sample. This is very similar for
"each of the samples considered here, but we note that"
these samples are restricted to the sky coverage of the
"FIRST survey, which is not the same as the complete"
The quartile analysis can only be done for sufficiently
"large samples, in this case samples Single a, b, c, and"
the combined Double sample. For the samples Single d
and Single e we applied a Gaussian distribution with-
out the quartile ratio test. If the true distribution is
"different, a small systematic error in true median frac-"
tional polarization ensues. We can estimate the size of
this systematic error by repeating the analysis with dif-
ferent distributions. Adopting the distribution function
for the most compact sample in the Monte Carlo sim-
ulations for the extended Sample 5c yields a median
"2.98% ± 0.43. Table 2 lists Π0,med = 2.78% ± 0.13%.
The systematic difference in the derived true median"
"Π0,med is smaller than the statistical error for this small"
sample (see also Section 4). The quoted uncertainty de-
"pends on the assumed distribution, because the median"
observed polarized intensity is a complicated function
of the distribution of the actual signal. In order to re-
"produce an 1σ change in the observed median, the true"
median needs to be varied by a larger or smaller amount
depending on the distribution function of Π0.
"3.3. Π0,med as a function of size and flux density"
"Figure 14 shows Π0,med as a function of stacked 1.4"
GHz flux density. Each data point represents a stacked
sample with its own Monte Carlo analysis. The left
"panel shows data for the Single samples, while the right"
"panel shows results for the Double samples. The most
compact sources, represented by the dark blue circles,"
are the least polarized with median fractional polar-
"ization Π0,med . 1.0%. This is less than half of the
median fractional polarization of a complete sample of"
"radio sources with the same flux density, which is signif-"
icant considering that the most compact sample repre-
"sents ∼ 70% of our Single sources, and at least a third of
all NVSS sources (see Figure 3). The next compactness"
"bin (1.15 ≤ C ≤ 2.0) is significantly more polarized with
Π0,med ∼ 2.3%, which is higher for fainter samples."
Cotton et al. (2003) and Fanti et al. (2004) reported
an abrupt drop in 1.4 GHz fractional polarization of
CSS and GPS sources compiled by Fanti et al. (2001)
at a size scale of 12 kpc (adjusted for cosmology). The
scale at which this depolarization occurs is smaller at
"shorter wavelengths, indicating Faraday depolarization"
as a likely cause (Fanti et al. 2004). The abrupt drop in

and sample size ratios according to the numbers in Table 2. The extreme tail of the distribution is not shown, as it is not well

fractional polarization from a few percent to less than
"1% is very similar to our present result, especially when
comparing the 1.4 GHz polarization of all sources with"
"size less than ∼ 40 kpc (adjusted for cosmology) in Fanti
et al. (2004) with our samples. There are some differ-"
ences. We make no selection on spectral index. The
angular size derived from VLASS stacking (Section 2)
"of our Single a sample is only slightly larger, about 15"
kpc. We also see a more gradual but statistically signif-
icant increase for more extended sources. Our samples
are about an order of magnitude fainter than the sam-
"ple of Fanti et al. (2001), and consequently the sample"
size is much larger. We will return to this comparison in
"Section 4. In the next section, we will see that the low-"
frequency spectrum of our samples does not turn over as
"CSS spectra tend to do, which is more in line with the"
recent sample of galaxy scale jets presented by Webster
et al. (2020).
The median fractional polarization continues to in-
"crease to Π0,med ∼ 3.2% as C increases. These samples
also show a tendency for higher fractional polarization in"
"fainter sources, with the caveat that this trend is some-"
"what dependent on the Π0 distribution, which is not"
well constrained for small samples (see Section 4). The
right panel of Figure 14 shows the two Double samples.
These are the most polarized of all our samples with
"Π0,med ∼ 4%, approximately independent of (total) flux
density."
Figure 15 shows a histogram of a Monte Carlo realiza-
tion of the Π0 distributions of all sub-samples for flux

sample. The histogram is truncated at 15% polariza-
tion to improve legibility. Extended sources are under-
represented at the low and over-represented at the in-
"termediate fractional polarization, relative to their part"
of the entire sample. The median fractional polariza-

"tion of the combined sample is 1.16%, which is smaller"
"than the ∼ 2% median of NVSS sources with the same
flux density. The red curve in Figure 15 shows, for"
"the same total sample size, the empirical Π0 distribu-"
tion of NVSS sources brighter than 100 mJy by Beck
"& Gaensler (2004) with 6% unpolarized sources, which"
yields a median 1.89%. The distributions are superfi-
"cially similar, but the accumulation of our samples is"
significantly skewed to lower Π0.
"We attribute the difference to our sample selection,"
which is likely very effective identifying single compact
"sources, but not designed to be complete for resolved"
"sources. In particular, our requirement of positional cor-"
respondence within 3′′ between the FIRST and NVSS
surveys is small compared with the source size of our
more extended single source samples. Figure 2 suggests
that allowing for more extended source components and
more unequal fluxes could increase the sample of dou-
"bles by a factor of a few, at the risk of introducing more"
chance alignments and perhaps image artifacts. Fur-
"thermore, the angular size of the Single a sample is well"
below the median angular size of sources at mJy flux
"densities (see also Figure 4 to Figure 7), but the Single a"
"sample represents ∼ 65% of the cumulative sample. It is
in line with our results that we find a distribution that is"
skewed to low polarization as our samples are more rep-
resentative of the compact source population. Rejected
"sources as shown in Figure 7 may be more polarized, in"
line with the results of Rudnick & Owen (2014).
The median fractional polarization of bright radio
"sources in the NVSS is ∼ 2%, with a modest tendency
of faint sources to be more polarized. We find that this"
dependence of fractional polarization on flux density is
correlated with angular size. Stil & Keller (2015) pre-
sented results from stacking samples of radio sources se-
lected by spectral index. These authors found that flat
spectrum sources have a low fractional polarization con-
"sistent with the Single a sample. However, the Single a"
sample is too large to be made up of only flat spectrum
sources. Stil & Keller (2015) found that steep spectrum
"sources had a consistent ∼ 2% median fractional po-
larization, while sources with an intermediate spectral"
index showed a strong relation of fractional polarization
with flux density. It is interesting that two completely
different selections of sub-samples of radio sources reveal
"a similar pattern. To this end, we investigate also the"
spectral index of our samples through median stacking
of total intensity in the NVSS and three other surveys
with comparable angular resolution.

"to derive spectral indices10 α3251400, α

325, and α"
"74
150 from"
the median stacked Stokes I images. The errors in the
spectral indices were derived from the noise in the im-
ages using standard error propagation. This does not
take into account that the samples were drawn from a
population of sources with an intrinsic range of spectral
indices. The accuracy with which one can derive the
sample median from a sample of finite size is limited.
The intrinsic range of spectral indices of the samples
cannot be determined from the available data. An esti-
mate can be obtained by simulating the sample median
of the spectral index distribution of bright sources pub-
lished by De Breuck et al. (2000). The median spectral
"index of their distribution is −0.785. Assuming noise-
less data, the uncertainty on the median is 0.023 for a"
"sample size of 120, 0.017 for a sample size of 200, 0.010"
"for sample size of 500, and 0.0033 for sample size of"
5000. The accuracy of the spectral indices in Table 2 is
therefore limited by sample size and survey sensitivity.
Some care is required when comparing the spectral
indices in Table 2 to the literature. The approach we
take includes all sources in our sample selected by NVSS
"flux density, regardless of whether they are detected in"
the other surveys. This is substantially different from
most of the spectral index studies found in the liter-
"ature, which depend on a cut-off imposed by the de-"
tection threshold in both of the surveys (e.g. Williams
et al. 2013). This does not occur for us; we rely on the
spectral index from the median flux density to trace the
representative value of α. Marvil et al. (2015) derived
spectral indices in the same manner as we do (mean of
"α74325 = −0.45). However, their sample consists of bright
spiral galaxies and not AGN."
"Upon inspection of Table 2, there is a trend for the"
spectrum of all our samples to become flatter (α in-
"creases) with fainter flux density, although not all by"
the same amount. The effect is strongest for the dou-
"bles, with a difference of ∆α3251400 = +0.25, followed by"
"the compact sources (∆α3251400 = +0.22), and is smallest"
for the extended single sources (∆α3251400 = +0.16).
Figure 16 shows the spectral index (α3251400 and spec-
"tral curvature α74150 − α3251400) from stacking in relation
to their median fractional polarization for the three"
"brightest flux bins. In the top panel, we not only see"
"the divide in Π0,med between compact and extended"
"sources, as in Figure 14, we also see a consistent and"
significant difference in α3251400 between the compact and

tween the samples at frequencies of 150 MHz and 74"

(α74150 ∼ −0.9) at the faintest flux density. This effect ap-
pears in other stacked samples as well, and it is stronger"
for faint sources. It is an artifact of either VLSS or
TGSS at low brightness levels. Differences in the flux

calibration of surveys should have a proportional effect
"on sources of all brightness, so we do not attribute this"
problem to flux calibration standards. We can also dis-
"card confusion with faint sources, because such sources"
should be visible in the FIRST and VLASS images. For

between parentheses in Table 2.
It is intriguing that there are differences in the change
in α that are large compared to the uncertainty. It is dif-
ficult to attribute this trend to systematic errors because
we see differences between samples of the same bright-
"ness, and many sources are well above the Stokes I noise"
level in all four surveys. We note that sample selection
for sources in the 6.6 to 70.0 mJy 1.4 GHz flux density
range is affected by detection thresholds in some all-sky
"surveys, and by small-number statistics in deep fields."
There is some debate in the literature about a possi-
ble change of spectral index with flux density (Randall
"et al. 2012, and references therein). A number of papers"
claim that the spectrum of radio sources gets flatter as
they get fainter (Intema et al. 2011; Mahony et al. 2016).
"For radio sources selected at 1.4 GHz, Owen & Morrison"
(2008) found that α3251400 tends to flatten for sources with
"S1.4 < 10 mJy, and angular sizes larger than 3
′′. How-"
"ever, Owen & Morrison (2008) find that for the faintest"
"flux densities (∼ 0.5 mJy) α3251400 steepens again. This
is in broad agreement with what we find in this paper."
Other papers find no evidence of spectral index flatten-
ing at low flux densities (Prandoni et al. 2006; Ibar et al.
2009; Mauch et al. 2013).
The values we find for α3251400 are in agreement with
Mauch et al. (2013) who found a median spectral in-
"dex of α3251400 = −0.71 for a sample of 5,263 sources de-
tected in the NVSS and the H-ATLAS survey (Eales"
et al. 2010). Bornancini et al. (2010) analyzed the re-
lationship between the spectral index and the environ-
ment of radio galaxies with hosts identified in the SDSS.
Bornancini et al. (2010) find that the mean spectral
"index for sources in galaxy clusters is α3251400 = −0.65,
with steeper spectra associated with rich clusters, and"
no clear trend of flattening towards low frequencies.
Randall et al. (2012) found median spectral indices of
"α8431400 = −0.775, α8431400 = −0.584 and α8431400 = −0.533 for
sources selected at 26 ≤ S1.4 ≤ 95.4, 13.5 ≤ S1.4 ≤ 26,
and 6.4 ≤ S1.4 ≤ 9.8 mJy."
Very compact radio sources become optically thick
to their own synchrotron emission due to synchrotron
self-absorption. A radio source that is opaque at low
"frequencies (∼ 100 MHz) can be transparent at higher
frequencies (i.e. 1.4 GHz). This may explain why the"
compact samples have a flatter low-frequency spectrum
than the extended Single and Double samples.
"We find that C > 1.15 sources have a steeper spec-
trum α3251400 ≈ −0.80, the double sources having the
highest spectral index of α3251400 ≈ −0.90. Extended and
double sources tend to have a steeper spectrum due to"
"synchrotron ageing (Myers & Spangler 1985, and refer-"
ences therein). Grant et al. (2010) found a mean spec-
"tral index of α3251420 = −0.77 for 343 sources detected
in the DRAO ELAIS N1 deep field. Furthermore, de"
Gasperin et al. (2018) found a mean spectral index of
"α1501400 = −0.7870 with standard deviation of σ = 0.24 for
503,647 sources in the NVSS and TGSS surveys. This"
"is in agreement with Hurley-Walker et al. (2017), who"
"found a median spectral index of −0.78 for a sample of
122,959 sources (S200 > 160 mJy). Although Hurley-"
Walker et al. (2017) observed the sky from 72 to 231

dices over higher frequency ranges. Mauch et al. (2003)
"found a median of α8431400 = −0.83 from cross-matching
sources in the SUMSS and NVSS surveys. Recently,"
a study by Ishwara-Chandra et al. (2020) examined
"the spectral indices of of 6,400 faint radio sources be-"
tween 610 and 1400 MHz with a median flux density of
"S610 = 4.5 mJy and found a mean α
610
1400 = −0.85±0.05."
"Compared to the literature, the reported values are very"
"similar to what we find for extended and doubles sources,"
having typical spectral indices for sources selected at 1.4
"At lower frequencies, our compact samples have flatter"
"spectra, with spectral indices ranging from α150325 = −0.47
to −0.37. There is a significant difference between the
literature and what we derived from the median stacked"
images. Williams et al. (2013) found a mean spectral
"index of α153327 = −0.84 ± 0.02 for 1,289 sources cross-
matched with NVSS, WENSS and T-RaMiSu. Heald
et al. (2015) found a median α120160 = −0.77 for sources
detected using the LOFAR High Band Antenna. Hurley-"
"Walker et al. (2017) also found a median α71231 = −0.78
for 245,470 sources, in agreement with Heald et al."
"(2015). Recall that in Figure 3 ∼ 50% of all NVSS
sources present in the footprint of the FIRST survey did"
not show up in our samples. Our most compact samples
"(Single a) consist of 33.8% to 16.7% of available sources,"
and only a combined 17.6% to 7.5% are extended and
double sources. The difference between our results and
those of the literature may be due to the restrictions
imposed during sample selection (see Section 2.3 and
Figure 7).
4. DISCUSSION
4.1. Technical considerations
20 Johnston et al.
One of the most powerful applications of stacking is to
compare the medians of samples selected from the same
"survey, but distinguished by an independent selection"
criterion that is related to a physical property of the
"targets. In this paper, we stack polarized intensity for"
samples of radio sources selected by total flux density
and compactness. We find very significant differences
in the (raw) stacked polarized intensity as a function
"of the compactness parameter C. The trend shown in
Figure 10 is found for all flux bins."
These differences cannot be attributed to data qual-
"ity issues such as polarization purity, variation of noise"
"with position, etc., because each sample probes hun-"
dreds to thousands of positions distributed throughout
the survey area. The mean background of the stacked
polarized intensity images (Figure 6) is very consistent
"between the samples, as one would expect for samples"
drawn at random positions throughout the survey. The
noise about the median off-source position in the stacked
polarized intensity image is proportional to the inverse
"square root of the sample size, as shown in Figure 11."
This is why the stacked image of a small sample of bright
sources appears noisier than the stacked image of a large
sample of faint sources (e.g. in Figure 10). The effec-
tive noise level is as low as 3 µJy beam−1 for the largest
samples.
The polarized signal to noise ratio in the NVSS for
a single 8 mJy source that is 1% polarized is just 0.28.
"At this low signal to noise ratio, the observed polarized"
intensity is dominated by noise bias and depends only
weakly on the real signal. Deriving the observed median
fractional polarization from the stacked median polar-
ized intensity requires Monte Carlo simulations that in-
clude a prescription of the distribution function of frac-
tional polarization. This distribution function is con-
strained by the quartile ratio of the observed polarized
intensities of the sample (Figure 13). The quartile ratio
is sufficiently sensitive to the shape of the Π0 distribu-
"tion to derive key attributes of the distribution function,"
such as non-Gaussianity for samples of order 103 sources
and larger.
Incorporating the distribution of Π0 leads to a modest
"adjustment of Π0,med as illustrated in Figure 18. Here"
we show fractional polarization as a function of flux den-
"sity for the Single a, Single c, Single e, and the Double"
"samples from Figure 14, along with curves that show the"
results that might have been obtained assuming various
distributions of Π0 without constraint by the quartile
ratio analysis. The curves in each panel of Figure 18 dif-
fer only in the distribution of Π0 assumed in the Monte
"Carlo analysis that fits Π0,med. The alternative distribu-"
tions assumed in Figure 18 are almost all confidently re-
jected by the quartile ratio analysis (Figure 12 and Fig-
"ure 13), the uniform distribution applied to the Double"
samples being a reasonably close match. Convergence
of the curves for the brighter samples shows that the ef-
fect of the distribution reduces as the polarized signal to
noise ratio of the median source increases. This must be
"so because Π0,med is a fitting parameter and the effect"
of noise is reduced for brighter samples.
"At lower signal to noise ratio, the distribution of Π0
matters because sources in the tail of the Π0 distri-"
bution contribute disproportionately to higher pi (Stil
et al. 2014). Figure 18 illustrates that the Π0 distri-
bution has to be very different to have a noticeable ef-
"fect, and such different distributions are confidently re-"
jected by the quartile ratio constraint (Figure 12 and
"Figure 13). In particular, Figure 18 underlines that the"
"correlation of Π0,med with flux density for the resolved"
Single samples is not an effect of the assumed Π0 distri-
"bution. The correlation would disappear if a skewed Π0
distribution like the one that applies to the Single a was"
assumed. This distribution is strongly rejected because
it does not reproduce the quartile ratio of the data for
the other samples (Figure 13). We conclude that the
"results shown in Figure 14 are robust, even for samples"
where the quartile analysis could not be performed.
There is no significant difference in median 1.4 GHz
Stokes I intensity in the stacked images of Single sam-
ples with different compactness. The Double b samples
"appear only ∼ 7% fainter in median stacked total inten-
sity. This confirms our implicit assumption that the 60′′"
beam captures the integrated flux density of all samples.
We measure comparable quantities for all samples in the
polarization stacking as well as in the Stokes I stacking
"as a function of frequency, using surveys with ∼ 1′ reso-
lution. The panels in Figures 4 to 7 cover approximately"
"the FWHM beam size of these surveys.
The combined samples represent approximately half"
of all NVSS sources within the footprint of the FIRST
"survey. That is a significant fraction, considering that"
some factors unrelated to the nature of a source can
cause rejection by our sample selection. These include
"chance alignments, splitting a source into multiple cat-"
"alog entries by the survey’s source finder, and the ef-"
"fects of noise on R and C, especially for the fainter sam-
ples. Some sources are too extended to be considered"
"for stacking at a resolution of 1′, or the brightness ratio"
of the lobes may be too dissimilar to be selected in our
"double sample, or the lobes are more diffuse. Also, large-"
amplitude variability may remove some sources from the
"samples with R ≈ 1.
Our sample selection is quite restrictive on the dou-"
ble sources to provide a well-defined comparison sample

illustrates the range of potential systematic errors if the quartile ratio analysis had not been considered. In fact, these curves
are rejected by the quartile ratio test (Figure 12 and Figure 13). For the brighter samples, our results are robust to the level
of the statistical errors for a wide range of distributions. The effect of the distribution of Π0 is larger for fainter samples (Stil
et al. 2014). The model curves represent the Π0 distributions of other samples discussed in the text, as well as a delta function

for the Single source samples. We recognize that among
the sources that were not selected there are many ex-
tended sources and wider or asymmetric doubles (Fig-
ure 7). The lower median fractional polarization of our
accumulated sample when compared with the complete
NVSS is in line with this finding and with the conclu-
sions of this paper.
The high median fractional polarization of the double
samples confirms that these samples represent mostly
physical doubles as opposed to chance alignments. Any
chance alignments of compact sources of the kind in our
samples of single sources should result in integrated po-
larization that is less than the median of the single com-
"pact sources, because the polarization angles would not"
"be correlated. On the contrary, the higher fractional po-"
larization is consistent with aligned polarization vectors
"in the two parts. If not, even higher polarization is im-"
plied for one or both of the individual components. This
"can only be confirmed by future surveys, but it is likely"
that the two compact components of our double sources
22 Johnston et al.
are lobes with hot spots at the termination points of the
opposite jets as in FR II sources. Assuming symmetry
in a statistical sense such that the 1.4 GHz polarization
"vectors in the doubles are aligned and equally polarized,"
"we arrive at an interesting conclusion, because differen-"
tial Faraday rotation between the opposite sides must
not destroy this alignment. Each of the two sides expe-
riences Faraday rotation by an amount ∆θ = φλ2 with
λ2 = 0.04585 m2 for the NVSS. If the Faraday depths φ
of the medium in front of the two sides are different by
just 22 rad m−2 differential Faraday rotation of one side
relative to the other would amount to 1 rad at 1.4 GHz.
The difference in rotation measure between the two sides
should therefore be much less than 22 rad m−2 to main-
tain symmetry at 1.4 GHz. Vernstrom et al. (2019)
found the rms difference in RM of lobes of a sample
"of physical doubles to be only 4.6 ± 1.1 rad m−2. This
is a remarkably tight limit for the differential Faraday"
"rotation between the two sides of the double sources,"
considering the rms rotation measure of cluster cores is
"a few hundred rad m−2 (e.g. Clarke et al. 2001), and"
the standard deviation of RM across well-resolved radio
galaxies is about 20 rad m−2 or larger (e.g. Taylor & Per-
ley 1993; Laing et al. 2008; Feain et al. 2009; Anderson
et al. 2018; Banfield et al. 2019). This property makes
resolved symmetric doubles prime background sources
for experiments that require precision measurements of
Faraday rotation (Rudnick 2019).
4.2. Why a correlation between polarization and
angular size?
We find that the median fractional polarization of ra-
dio sources depends on angular size. The most com-
"pact sample, with angular size ∼ 1.8′′ has Π0,med . 1%,
although the derived Π0 distribution is significantly"
skewed to higher fractional polarization. In the distri-
"bution shown in Figure 15, ∼ 40% of compact sources
is less than 0.5% polarized, but ∼ 16% of the compact
sample is more than 3% polarized. Similar fractions ap-"
ply to other flux bins. These numbers suggest a sky
density of 0.7 per square degree for all 7 flux bins com-
"bined, or 3 × 104 in the sky. This serves to show that
the low median fractional polarization of this sample"
does not exclude the presence of a significant fraction of
polarized sources with angular size less than 2′′. The ev-
idence for a skewed Π0 distribution is the quartile ratio
analysis presented in Figure 12 (top panel) and Figure 13
(top left panel). A peculiar consequence of this result
is that the fraction of compact sources as a function of
"Π0 initially decreases to a minimum around Π0 ≈ 6%,
and subsequently increases among the most polarized"
"sources (Figure 14), notwithstanding the low Π0,med of"
the sample.
"The second most compact sample, with angular size"
"∼ 2.9′′, is 2.5 to 3 times more highly polarized than
the compact sample. The median fractional polarization"
of progressively more extended samples increases more
slowly to 3% to 4% for sources with typical angular size
5′′ to 8′′ (40 to 70 kpc). Polarization of the Doubles
samples is consistent with this trend to somewhat larger
angular scales.
"Considering that the largest difference in Π0,med is"
"found between the two most compact samples, the ques-"
tion arises whether our most compact sample depolar-
"izes at a smaller angular scale. After all, Figure 9 shows"
a mixture of resolved and unresolved sources in the
VLASS images of sample Single 5a. To investigate this
"further, we evaluated the integrated flux density in cut-"
outs as shown in Figure 9 and separated the sample by
VLASS compactness at the ratio of the integrated flux
density to the peak intensity equal to 1.4. The compact
"sub-sample has very low polarization Π0,med = 0.5%."
The more resolved sub-sample is more polarized with
"Π0,med = 1.5%, but less so than any of the more ex-"
tended samples (Figure 14). The polarization of the
compact sub-sample is so low that our model for residual
instrumental polarization (0.3% rms of Stokes I leaking
"in each of Q and U, see also Ma et al. 2019) becomes a"
significant source of uncertainty. A complete analysis of
VLASS compactness is better postponed until a VLASS
"source catalog becomes available, as this experiment was"
done with a subset of preliminary VLASS images. Still
this result is more in line with a rapid increase in median
fractional polarization across a range of angular scales
"from . 2′′ to ∼ 5′′ and a more modest increase on even
larger angular scales. This contrasts with the single pre-"
"cipitous drop on scales . 1.5′′ (. 12 kpc), and smaller
at shorter wavelengths, for bright CSS and GPS sources"
(Cotton et al. 2003). Lamee et al. (2016) also found
a higher 1.4 GHz to 2.3 GHz depolarization factor for
"compact sources sources than for extended sources, al-"
though these authors considered flux densities and angu-
lar scales an order of magnitude larger than the present
samples.
Could our compact source sample be dominated by
similar faint CSS sources? Sadler (2016) suggested a
population of faint CSS sources may have eluded de-
"tection, although the sample of CSS radio sources of"
Randall et al. (2012) represents just a small fraction of
the total population of faint radio sources. Our com-
pact sample represents 68% of our combined sample (in-
"cluding doubles), which amounts to & 34% of all radio
sources with flux density of tens of mJy. The lower limit"
Properties of Compact Faint Radio Sources 23
indicates that some compact sources must have been re-
jected in our sample selection because of the proxim-
"ity of an unrelated source, position errors, variability,"
etc. Because of this large percentage of the total pop-
"ulation, our compact source sample should represent a"
larger diversity of less exceptional sources. We also see
"that Π0,med increases on larger angular scales. Depolar-"
ization of CSS and GPS sources may just be the most
extreme case of depolarization by Faraday rotation in
the ISM of the host galaxy.
We focus the discussion on depolarization mechanisms
"related to the source and its immediate surroundings, as"
opposed to Faraday depolarization in unrelated objects
along the line of sight. While intervening galaxies are
a potential alternative cause of depolarization of radio
"sources with (sub) galactic size, the relatively high frac-"
tional polarization of our samples of symmetric double
sources provides an argument that angular separation
"from the centre (i.e. the host galaxy), not solid angle"
"of the radio emission, is the determining factor. The"
compactness of the components in the Doubles samples
is similar to that of the Single a and Single b samples.
"Also, there is at best weak evidence for depolarization"
associated with systems along the line of sight traced by
optical Mg absorption lines (Farnes et al. 2014b; Chi-
aberge et al. 2009; Kim et al. 2016) or Ly-α absorbers
(Farnes et al. 2017).
Another reason to associate depolarization with the
"source itself is the correlation of Π0,med with spectral"
index and spectral curvature (Figure 16). Stil & Keller
"(2015) found a strong relation between Π0,med and spec-"
tral index in the flux density range of this work. Flat
"spectrum sources (α3251400 > −0.30 by their definition)
were found to be much less polarized than steep spec-"
"trum sources (α3251400 < −0.75). Flat and inverted spec-
trum sources are included in our samples, but the size"
of the compact sample is far too large to be made up
of just flat-spectrum sources. We find that the spectral
indices from median stacking indicate a slightly flatter
"spectrum for the compact sources, with not more than"
"a hint of a break below 325 MHz, but the range of all"
"spectral indices α3251400 from median stacking found here,"
qualifies as steep spectrum according to the most com-
mon definition (e.g. De Breuck et al. 2000).
Farnes et al. (2014a) found that flat spectrum sources
and a subset of steep spectrum sources appear to have
Π0 that is nearly independent of wavelength. These au-
thors raised opacity of different emitting regions of a
compact source at different wavelength as a possible ex-
planation why the median fractional polarization does
"not change above 1.4 GHz. At least qualitatively, our"
"result appears consistent with this suggestion, in that"
"our combined sample of compact sources, selected in-"
"dependently of spectral index, has similarly low Π0,med
as a separate sample of flat spectrum sources (Stil &"
"Keller 2015). However, we do not expect optically thick"
"synchrotron emission on scales ∼ 15 kpc in a majority
of sources. The steep low-frequency spectrum implied"
by median stacking suggests that the fraction of sources
whose flux density is dominated by compact components
"that become optically thick below 325 MHz, is small."
The spectral index distribution of the sources for
which Farnes et al. (2014a) derived a polarization spec-
"tral index β (Π0 ∼ λβ), shows that steep spectrum
sources are significantly under-represented in their fi-"
nal sample (compare their Figure 5 with their Figure
7). Steep spectrum sources that are depolarized on sub-
galactic scales could be under-represented in the sam-
ple of sources with multi-wavelength polarimetry avail-
able in the literature compiled by Farnes et al. (2014a).
"At higher frequencies, a larger fraction of this sub-"
population could be polarized (Fanti et al. 2004; Ros-
"setti et al. 2008), but they would be under-represented"
in a flux-limited sample at high frequencies because of
their steep spectrum. Lamee et al. (2016) found that
28% of their steep spectrum sources (24% of their com-
plete sample with S2300 > 420 mJy) were depolarized
"(1.4 GHz relative to 2.3 GHz) by a factor ≥ 2. A sub-
sample selected to repolarize (low frequency polarization"
higher than high-frequency polarization) has a flat me-
"dian spectral index −0.1, while sources with stronger
depolarization had a steep spectral index −0.9. These
authors also estimated they may have missed ∼ 10% of
their sample in the form of heavily depolarized sources."
A better understanding of Faraday rotation effects in
relation to source size and properties of the host galaxy
will be key to unlocking the magnetic properties of AGN.
If the low polarization of compact sources at 1.4 GHz
arises from a flat spectrum optically thick core that is
separate from a more extended steep-spectrum compo-
"nent, then this core should be visible in the VLASS"
images at 3 GHz. Figure 9 shows first-look images of
the VLASS survey for a random subset of sources in
our most compact sample with angular resolution 2.5′′.
"Since the reference frequency of VLASS is a factor ∼ 2
higher than that of the NVSS and FIRST, the sources"
span a wider range of flux density because of differ-
"ences in spectral index. Also, flat spectrum compo-"
nents may be somewhat more prominent in the VLASS
"images. Still, the morphology of sources in the Sin-"
gle a sample at 2.5′′ resolution is not that different
from the more extended sources seen at 5′′ resolution
in FIRST images (Compare Figure 9 with Figure 4 and
Figure 5). We see elongated sources with symmetric
24 Johnston et al.
"lobes or edge-darkened morphology, not unlike the high-"
redshift FR I/FR II sample of Chiaberge et al. (2009).
Opposite lobes of an edge-brightened source may blend
at low resolution to appear as an edge-darkened source.
Jimenez-Gallardo et al. (2019) presented a sample of
edge-brightened galaxy-scale radio sources that do not
classify as GPS or CSS. Morphological classification of
individual sources requires even higher resolution im-
ages. Roughly half of the Single a sample in Figure 9
"contains a brighter, compact component, but by no"
means is the compact sample one of core-dominated
sources.
Linear polarization of optically thin synchrotron emis-
sion depends on the amount of order in the magnetic
"field in the source, and on differential Faraday rotation"
within the source or across the source. The structure
of the source is important for detailed modeling of po-
"larization as a function of wavelength. Currently, we"
have limited morphological information for our samples.
Our Double samples are most likely sources with FR II
morphology. The structure of our Singles samples is not
"so clear. CSS, GPS, and FR 0 (e.g. Sadler et al. 2014;"
Baldi et al. 2018) sources are most likely included in the
Single a samples. The steep low-frequency spectra of
our Single a samples suggest that these samples include
a more diverse class of objects than just CSS and GPS.
The more extended Single samples may well contain a
mixture of morphologies (e.g. Mingo et al. 2019; Webster
et al. 2020).
Our results imply that the size of the radio source in
relation to the size of its host galaxy is an important
parameter for its 1.4 GHz polarization. This would in-
clude not only young powerful radio galaxies identified
"with CSS and GPS sources, but also, at lower flux den-"
"sities, less powerful radio galaxies subject to frustration"
"by their host’s interstellar medium, or those with inter-"
mittent activity. The largest scale to which we see an
"increase in Π0,med (5
′′ to 8′′ or 40 to 70 kpc) is com-"
"parable to the gaseous halo of a galaxy, which suggests"
that the circumgalactic medium contributes to depolar-
ization.
Physically larger sources that project into a small an-
gular size will display associated properties related to
"relativistic beaming, such as a bright core, flat spec-"
"trum, variability, and a strong Laing-Garrington effect."
Anderson et al. (2019) reported variability in Faraday
rotation of pc scale components in BLAZARS over a 5-
"year period. In a sample of randomly oriented sources,"
the median source axis makes an angle of 60◦ with the
line of sight. Relativistic beaming will increase the frac-
tion of sources where the jet is well aligned with the line
"of sight, but the size of the compact source sample is"
too large to suggest that our samples differentiate more
in projection effects than in physical size.
Next generation wide-area polarization surveys of the
"sky, POSSUM and VLASS, will provide direct measure-"
ments of the polarization of faint radio sources currently
only accessible through stacking. These surveys will add
information from Faraday rotation for large samples of
"sources, a key unknown for the samples that we inves-"
tigated here. These surveys also open up new frontiers
for stacking and other sub-threshold techniques as the
weak polarized signal of most sources detectable in total
intensity will remain below the detection threshold.
Stacking these future surveys need not require huge
"resources in computing or data storage, as our stacking"
of VLASS quick-look images shows. Key to this is a re-
duction of scope that is tuned to available resources. A
"wide-area, but not necessarily all sky, subset of images"
"with arcsecond resolution, while averaged over a consis-"
tent λ2 range around a low frequency and a high fre-
"quency within the survey’s frequency band, would cre-"
"ate a small overhead in data archiving, while creating"
the opportunity to explore science with sensitivity that
requires a sky survey with the next generation of tele-
"scopes, such as ngVLA and the Square Kilometre Array"
(SKA).
"To this end, one or two orders of magnitude increase"
in sensitivity by stacking samples up to a few 104 in
VLASS or POSSUM would be sufficient to probe polar-
"ization to the 1% level at the detection limit of Stokes I,"
without exceeding scalability of the stacking code or the
"demonstrated domain of
√
N improvement of the noise"
when stacking surveys (e.g. Figure 11). Polarization of
sub-mJy sources will remain accessible only by stack-
ing and narrow deep fields in the era of POSSUM and
VLASS. Low-redshift star forming galaxies are expected
to display very low 1.4 GHz polarization. This may be-
come apparent as a sharp drop in median polarization in
the flux density range where star forming galaxies begin
to outnumber AGN. Advanced sample selection that in-
"cludes data from sky surveys at other wavelengths, such"
as X-ray or infrared surveys will allow comparative stud-
ies of physically different sub-samples analogous to the
work presented here.
Detection of individual sources in total intensity is re-
quired for the interpretation of the stacked polarized
signal. The large samples available from future surveys
will primarily aid in the quartile ratio analysis. The
higher sensitivity of these surveys will also improve the
sample selection based on R and C.
5. CONCLUSIONS
Properties of Compact Faint Radio Sources 25
In this paper we explore the integrated polarization of
AGN as a function angular size in the flux density range
70 mJy down to 6.6 mJy by stacking polarized intensity
from the NVSS survey. We investigate 7 compactness
classes in 7 flux bins: 5 samples of Single sources with
increasing ratio of integrated flux density to peak inten-
"sity in the FIRST survey, and two samples of Double"
"sources. All samples are unresolved in the NVSS, allow-"
ing for mutual comparison of their median polarization
properties.
We find a strong dependence of median fractional po-
"larization on angular size, especially for the samples"
"with deconvolved sizes 1.8′′ and 2.9′′, as defined as the"
FWHM of the emission of the sample in mean-stacked
"VLASS images, deconvolved for the VLASS beam and"
NVSS position errors. This confirms various earlier sug-
gestions from deep fields in the literature of a relation
between fractional polarization and angular size. Our
"much larger samples reveal a strong change in Π0,med
on angular scales . 5′′ and a more gradual change on
angular scales up to ∼ 8′′. The most compact sample
(70% of all Single sources) has Π0,med ∼ 0.8%, approxi-
mately one third the value of the complete population."
More extended sources have a median fractional polar-
ization in the range 2.2% to 4% that is also higher for
fainter sources. Our samples of symmetric doubles are
at the high end of this range.
The rapid change in fractional polarization in the an-
"gular size range ∼ 2′′ to ∼ 5′′ is suggestive of a relation
with the size of the host galaxy, as previously noted by"
"Rudnick & Owen (2014), but it occurs on scales larger"
than depolarization reported for CSS sources by Cotton
"et al. (2003), suggesting that the circumgalactic medium"
plays a role.
Analysis of the derived distribution of fractional po-
larization shows that 16% of our most compact sample is
more than 3% polarized with a sky density 0.7 per square
degree. The skewed Π0 distribution and large number of
compact sources imply also that compact sources should
"be common amongst highly polarized sources, despite"
their low median polarization. This is good news for cer-
tain applications of a sky-wide Faraday Rotation Mea-
"sure Grid, because the line of sight to these compact"
sources is much better determined than for the more
extended samples.
Symmetric double sources are the most polarized of
our samples. This confirms that these are physical dou-
"bles, probably hot spots in sources with a FR II mor-"
phology. Symmetry of these sources also implies that
differential Faraday rotation between the opposite sides
of a symmetric double source is typically (much) less
"than ∼ 22 rad m−2. This makes these double sources
excellent candidates to be top tier sources in the Rota-"
tion Measure Grid for probing magnetic fields along the
line of sight.
Total intensity stacking of the samples in 4 separate
"arcminute-resolution radio surveys at 1.4 GHz (NVSS),"
"325 MHz (WENSS), 150 MHz (TGSS) and 74 MHz"
(VLSS) shows subtle but statistically significant differ-
ences in spectral properties between the samples. The
spectral index derived from median-stacked total inten-
"sity between 325 MHz and 1.4 GHz is steep, but less so"
"for the most compact sample (α3251400 ≈ −0.7) and more
so for the doubles α3251400 ≈ −0.9, with the remaining
samples in between. We find an anti-correlation between"
"Π0,med at 1.4 GHz and curvature of the low-frequency"
spectrum down to 74 MHz. This anti-correlation also
provides a new argument that depolarization occurs in
"the source itself, as opposed to unrelated systems along"
the line of sight.
