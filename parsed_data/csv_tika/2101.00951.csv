"Abstract. We have constructed and compared models of rotating neutron stars and strange stars, within
the Hartle framework. The significance of the low energy density region and crust region inside the neutron
star has been studied, along with how much the existence of strange matter above the energy density 300
MeV/fm3 can affect the neutron star properties. We have confirmed several universalities among the
neutron star properties such as, dimensionless moment of inertia vs dimensionless quadrupole moment,
dimensionless tidal deformability vs dimensionless moment of inertia and moment of inertia parameters vs
R/2M."
"1. Introduction
From the atmosphere to the core of neutron stars covers an energy density range from 106 gm/cm3 to
several times nuclear matter density. At densities above nuclear matter density matter may undergo
phase transitions and new exotic states may form. The existence of these states relies on the strong
interaction and the structure of baryons. In 1960 [1] it was suggested that the core of neutron stars may
have mesons (pions-the lightest meson). In 1980 [2] the possibility of Bose condensation of Kaons at
densities above three times nuclear matter density was suggested. Since then it has been addressed by
many authors, for instance see Ref.[3]. As the energy density increases, baryons may decompose into
their constituent quarks. Invanenko and Kurdgelaidze [4] in 1965 showed that neutron stars core may
be made of deconfined quark matter. Since 1990, such phase transitions have been considered by many
authors [5][6]."
"The key ingredient to understand their interior is the nuclear equation of state. New born neutron stars
are extremely hot but after enough time they become cold and they have matter made of mainly neutrons
partly protons, electrons and muons in β equilibrium with respect to the weak interactions. Different
approaches have been adopted over time to model the neutron star under the constraints imposed by
observed neutron star properties. We will compare properties of neutron stars based on EoSs that include
either, nucleons only, nucleons and hyperons or strange quark matter at high energy density."

2.1. Equation of state (EoS)
We are taking into consideration three EoSs. N-QMC700 and F-QMC700 (see Ref.[7]) which are based
on QMC model [8]. N-QMC700 only allows nucleons while F-QMC700 includes hyperons. Both EoSs
take nucleon structure into account. In both, N-QMC700 and F-QMC700, the mass of σ meson [9]
is considered mσ = 700 MeV . Below energy density < 110 MeV/fm3, the matter forms in the crust
of the star, with inhomogeneities consisting of nucleons arranged on a lattice, as well as neutron and
electron gases. In this density region the QMC Equation of State (EoS) needs to be matched [7] with
the equations of state, showing the composition of matter at those densities. Baym-Pethick-Sutherland
(BPS) EoS [10] is used in this work. For the sake of convenience the parametrized EoSs are given below.

"where B is the bag constant whose value is taken to be 1014gm/cm3. This EoS suggests quark

"2.2. Structural equations
The structural equation for a static, spherical neutron star involves solving the TOV [13][14] equation,
derived from the general theory of relativity [15], for a particular equation of state (EoS). The line element
for such a compact star is given by (G = c = 1)"

"Rotational equation. For slowly rotating neutron stars, Hartle’s [16] approach is adopted. Structural
equations are solved under the general relativistic framework. Hartle’s approach to get the solution for a
perturbed Schwarzschild metric is based on the idea that, as stars rotate their pressure, energy density and"
"baryon number, all get perturbed. The perturbed line element of rotating, axially symmetric equilibrium
configuration, is given by"
"ds2 = −e2ν(r,θ,Ω)(dt)2 +e2ψ(r,θ,Ω)(dφ−ω(r, θ,Ω)dt)2 +e2µ(r,θ,Ω)(dθ)2 +e2λ(r,θ,Ω)(dr)2 +O(Ω3) (5)"
"where ν, ψ, µ and λ are the perturbed metric functions , r and θ are polar coordinates and Ω is the
uniform rotational velocity of the star. ω is the rotating velocity of the local inertial frame of reference
dragged along the direction of rotation of the neutron star. This dragged velocity also depends on the
polar coordinates r, θ. Since the velocity of local dragging of the inertial reference frame depends on the
neutron star’s mass concentration inside and outside, which varies with Ω, ω is a function of Ω. Relative
angular velocity is denoted by, ω(Ω − ω(r, θ,Ω)) It is this relative velocity (ω), which is of particular
interest, when discussing the rotational flow of the fluid inside the neutron star."

"3. Results
Fig. 1(a) represents the pressure and energy relation, for all three chosen EoSs. The strange matter
EoS (MIT - black dot) is unphysical in the low energy density region (at the crust). Here, a key point
must be stated, i.e. in the low energy density region, there is only nuclear matter. Strange matter or
hyperons only come into existence when the energy density increases beyond a few times the nuclear
matter density. All of them have only nuclear matter at low energy density, so they must show a similar
characteristic in that region. As the energy density increases, around 580 MeV/fm3, F-QMC700 starts
to deviate from the N-QMC700 because hyperons (Ξ−,Λ,Ξ0) start to develop at this point (see Ref.[7]).
On the other hand, the strange matter EoS around the energy density 300 MeV/fm3 and 500 MeV/fm3"
"crosses the nucleons only matter EoS, suggesting a transition to strange quark matter (deconfined quarks)
often called a ”strange star”. N-QMC700 is the stiffest EoS which is based on nucleon only matter. Fig.
1(b) gives the relation between the mass and the radius of neutron stars for these EoSs. Although the
strange matter EoS predicts a maximum mass of over 2 M�, it poorly predicts the mass and the radii of
the neutron stars at the low energy densities. At the crust, where the energy density is low, it must show
an expansion in the radius, like the N-QMC700 and F-QMC700."
"In Fig. 2, the strange matter EoS is corrected for the low energy density region with the parameters
of nucleons only EoS (N-QMC700). In Fig. 2(a), the strange matter EoS parameters are matched to the
nucleon only EoS parameters for the energy densities below 300 MeV/fm3 and in Fig. 2(b), mass vs
radius plot is presented with changed parameters for strange matter EoS. Here, we are calculating the
properties of neutron stars when the strange matter starts to exist at 300 MeV/fm3. In Fig. 2, all three
EoSs now show the same characteristic at the low energy densities. With this change the behavior of all
the three EoS show similar radii at the low energy densities and all three EoSs predict maximum mass
of neutron stars close to 2M�. There is a universality that most of the EoSs dimensionless moment of
inertia vs dimensionless quadrupole moment (I-Q relation) plots fall on the top of each other and show
a characteristic which is (almost) independent of EoSs [18]. In Fig. 3(a), N-QMC700 and F-QMC700
both show the same characteristic and follow the universality while strange matter EoS behavior is very"

"different and it does not follow the universality. After fixing the parameters of the strange matter EoS
in the lower energy density region, it follows the universality depicted in Fig. 3(b). As predicted by
Yagi and Yunes [17], dimensionless tidal deformability (λ/M5) vs dimensionless moment of inertia
(I/M3) plot shows a behavior which is independent of EoS. As shown in Fig. 4(a), both N-QMC700
and F-QMC700 EoSs fall exactly on top of each other and follow the universality whereas the strange
matter EoS is very different, falling far away from them and not following the universality. The results
when the parameters of the strange matter EoS are fixed for the energy density below 300 MeV/fm3
with N-QMC700 are shown in Fig. 4(b). The strange matter EoS dimensionless moment of inertia vs
dimensionless tidal deformability plot follows the universality like the QMC EoS. Lattimer and Schultz
[19] showed that the parameter of moment of inertia, I/M0R20, where M0 is the mass and R0 is the radius
of the neutron star, is related to compactness in such a way that their plot is independent of EoSs and all
of them fall almost on the same line. We see in Fig. 5(a) that the moment of inertia parameter for the
strange matter EoS is very different from N-QMC700 and F-QMC700 and it does not follow the moment
of inertia constraint, while N-QMC700 and F-QMC700 EoS do. After fixing the parameters as shown in
Fig. 5(b) at the lower energy densities 300 MeV/fm3, all three EoSs satisfy the relation independent of
EoS. They fall almost on the same line [10]."

"4. Conclusion and Future Perspectives
Models for rotating neutron stars have been successfully compared within the Hartle framework at
frequency 500 Hz for the different EoSs under the constraints imposed by observations. It is shown that
EoSs based purely on hadrons (N-QMC700 & F-QMC700), satisfy the empherical constraints which is
a clear indication that the QMC model may play a significant role in defining the properties of matter
at energy densities several times the nuclear matter density. Several universalities among the neutron
star properties such as dimensionless moment of inertia vs dimensionless quadrupole momentum,
dimensionless moment of inertia vs dimensionless tidal deformability and moment of inertia parameter
vs R/2M, have been confirmed in these models."
"Following the discovery of gravitational waves we may impose new constraints on the EoS in a
neutron star binary system, which may prove handy in understanding the interior of neutron stars.
Furthermore, recently improvements have been made in the QMC model [20][21], and with these
advancements we can improve our EoS and can get better results. In future it will be interesting to
see how QMC EoS explain the neutron star cooling process, magnetic fields and the tidal deformability
in the neutron star merger."
