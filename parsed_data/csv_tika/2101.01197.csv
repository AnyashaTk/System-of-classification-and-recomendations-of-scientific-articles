"ABSTRACT
We present the Stromlo Stellar Tracks, a set of stellar evolutionary tracks, computed by modifying the Mod-"
"ules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) 1D stellar evolution package, to fit the Galactic Concor-
dance abundances for hot (T > 8000 K) massive (≥ 10 M�) Main-Sequence (MS) stars. Until now, all stellar
evolution tracks are computed at solar, scaled-solar, or alpha-element enhanced abundances, and none of these
models correctly represent the Galactic Concordance abundances at different metallicities. This paper is the
first implementation of Galactic Concordance abundances to the stellar evolution models. The Stromlo tracks
cover massive stars (10 ≤ M/M� ≤ 300) with varying rotations (v/vcrit = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4) and a finely sampled
grid of metallicities (−2.0 ≤ [Z/H] ≤ +0.5; ∆[Z/H] = 0.1) evolved from the pre-main sequence to the end
of 12Carbon burning. We find that the implementation of Galactic Concordance abundances is critical for the
evolution of main-sequence, massive hot stars in order to estimate accurate stellar outputs (L, Teff , g), which,
in turn, have a significant impact on determining the ionizing photon luminosity budgets. We additionally sup-
port prior findings of the importance that rotation plays on the evolution of massive stars and their ionizing
budget. The evolutionary tracks for our Galactic Concordance abundance scaling provide a more empirically
motivated approach than simple uniform abundance scaling with metallicity for the analysis of H II regions and
have considerable implications in determining nebular emission lines and metallicity. Therefore, it is important
to refine the existing stellar evolutionary models for comprehensive high-redshift extragalactic studies. The
Stromlo tracks are publicly available to the astronomical community online."

1. INTRODUCTION
"Our understanding of stellar physics and our ability to cre-
ate realistic and accurate stellar evolution models across a
wide range of stellar parameters heavily impact our ability
to create physically realistic stellar population synthesis and
photoionization models to interpret galaxy spectra. Most
stellar evolutionary models (e.g., BaSTI (Pietrinferni et al.
2004; Hidalgo et al. 2018); Geneva (Ekström et al. 2012);
Padova (Girardi et al. 2004); Y2 (Yi et al. 2001, 2003; De-
marque et al. 2004)) assume solar or scaled-solar abundances
(Anders & Grevesse 1989; Asplund et al. 2009). Two imme-
diate problems arise from currently available stellar tracks."
"First, solar (Anders & Grevesse 1989; Asplund et al. 2009)
relative abundance ratios conflict observed abundance ratios
in H II regions in the Milky Way, Large Magellanic Cloud, or
Small Magellanic Cloud at a given metallicity (Morel 2009;
Nieva & Przybilla 2012; Nicholls et al. 2017). The solar-
scaled and alpha-enhanced abundances predict non-realistic
stellar quantity measurements (L, g, Teff , etc) and thus will
predict non-realistic ionizing photon budgets when used to"

"interpret observations. This is critically important as solar-
scaled stellar evolutionary tracks are in general not well
matched to stellar observations and subsequent nebular emis-
sion modeling (see Przybilla 2008; Morel 2009; Nicholls
et al. 2017; Cazorla et al. 2017; Kewley et al. 2019a). The
implementation of abundance patterns is especially critical
in massive, hot stars that dominate the excitation sources for
H II regions. This is especially important because nearby OB
stars quite often exhibit metal abundances that are generally
lower than solar estimates (Morel 2009)."
"Iron abundances relative to α-element abundances change
as a function of time and with the galactic environment (Wyse
& Gilmore 1993) and this systematic variation of [α/Fe]
needs to be taken into account at different metallicities. It
is not just iron that changes with metallicity – a complete
census on the chemical history of other elements and their
evolution with overall metallicity is critical to determine ac-
curate metallicity measurements in galaxies, especially at
high redshift. The [NII]/[OII] ratio is an ideal abundance
diagnostic (Kewley & Dopita 2002), but at high redshift the
[OII]λλ3727, 3729 doublet is often unobservable, relying on
calibrations based on [NII]/Hα (Denicoló et al. 2002) and/or
the [NII]/[OIII] ratio (Pettini & Pagel 2004). Often yet, only
red line ratios are available such as Hα, [NII], and [SII], and"

"the O/H ratio relies on indirect methods using combinations
of these line ratios (Dopita et al. 2016)."
"Second, coarse metallicity grids are usually assumed in
the calculation of stellar evolutionary tracks. These coarse
metallicity griding results in non-accurate values while in-
terpolating different stellar quantities (L, g, Teff , etc) for the
metallicities falling in between the grid metallicities. The
coarse metallicity grids limit the resolution at which theo-
retical strong-line metallicity diagnostics can be reliably cal-
culated (Kewley et al. 2019b,a). Interpolation of metallicity
diagnostics in coarse metallicity grids prevents accurate mea-
surements of nebular emission lines for star-forming galaxies
and potentially has important consequences for the interpre-
tation of galactic properties of high-redshift galaxies such as
their star formation rates (SFRs; e.g., Kewley et al. 2004) and
ionization parameters which show metallicity dependence in
ionization parameter diagnostics (Kewley & Dopita 2002;
Kewley et al. 2019a)."
"Accurate determination of the chemical evolutionary state
of distant galaxies will be critically important for next gen-
eration observatories such as JWST that will reveal the first
galaxies. These objects will not be physically represented
with current stellar evolutionary models at Solar or alpha-
enhanced abundances and will predict non-realistic stellar
quantities and thus, ionizing photon budgets. New stel-
lar evolution models that are not limited to Solar or alpha-
enhanced abundance ratios are critically needed. New stel-
lar evolution models and their opacities additionally need to
be calculated at much finer metallicity intervals of ∼0.1–0.2
dex in log(O/H) to avoid non-accurate values while interpo-
lating different stellar quantities. These new tracks will allow
for consistent abundance ratios to be used in stellar popula-
tion synthesis and photoionization models to derive accurate,
high-resolution metallicity diagnostics for the first time."
"This paper will enable the future development of atmo-
sphere and photoionization nebular modeling with the same
physical inputs to self-consistently predict the emission spec-
tra arising from ionized nebula and central ionizing stellar
population. This paper is the first in this series and presents
the stellar evolutionary tracks using Galactic Concordance
abundances to be used in modern stellar population synthe-
sis, atmosphere, and photoionization models. The Galactic
Concordance reference standard and scaling system serves
as an empirical basis for interpreting observations and deter-
mining the physical conditions of H II regions."
"The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we de-
scribe the numerical methods adopted in our stellar evolu-
tion models. Section 3 reports the results and comparison
between the Stromlo non-uniform abundance stellar tracks
and the scaled-solar MIST stellar tracks. We discuss the im-
pact of the abundance ratio implementation on the photon
ionizing budget in Section 4. We conclude and summarize
our results in Section 5."
2. METHOD: STELLAR EVOLUTION CALCULATION
"In order to explore the impact of non-uniform scaled
abundances on stellar evolutionary tracks, we construct"
"the Stromlo Stellar Tracks1, self-consistent stellar evolu-
tion models using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar
Astrophysics (MESA2; Paxton et al. 2011, 2013, 2015, 2018,
2019) stellar evolution code. We build upon the stellar evo-
lutionary models used in the MESA Isochrones and Stellar
Tracks (MIST) by Choi et al. (2016) to present models with
the scaling abundances based on Milky Way stellar abun-
dance data referred to as ‘Galactic Concordance’ (Nicholls
et al. 2017). We focus on massive (>10 M�) hot stars that
dominate the ionizing budget that power H II regions and
provides the feedback that regulates the efficiency of star
formation (Mckee & Ostriker 2007; Krumholz et al. 2012;
Hopkins et al. 2012) and drives turbulence and wind out-
flows."
"We configure MESA to include all the same physical pro-
cesses and parameters values as used in the MIST library
as described by Choi et al. (2016) with modifications to im-
prove the treatment of massive stars as outline by Roy et al.
(2020), which includes our inclusion of Galactic Concor-
dance abundances to replace replace commonly adopted uni-
form scaling abundances (Section 2.1), radiative opacities
(Section 2.2), and our treatment of mixing mechanisms (Sec-
tion 2.3). The software used to generate the Stromlo Tracks
is the GALCON-HOT-MIST package, to be described in Roy
et al. (in preparation)."
"For this work, we use MESA version v9793 compiled with
GNU Fortran version 7.2.0 installed as part of MESA SDK3.
All of our MESA calculations implement the same spatial
and temporal resolution conditions as adopted by Choi et al.
(2016) for MIST. Below we briefly outline the parameters in
MESA/MIST immediately pertinent to this work and we re-
fer the reader to Paxton et al. (2011, 2013, 2015) for more
detailed information on MESA and Choi et al. (2016) for
more detailed information regarding the physical processes
in MIST. For detailed information regarding the impact of
our different setups to the MIST models for high mass stars
and associated uncertainties in various parameter choices and
their effects, we refer the reader to Roy et al. (2020)."
2.1. Non-solar elemental abundances
"We adopt the non-solar abundance standard developed by
Nieva & Przybilla (2012) and Nicholls et al. (2017) referred
to as ‘Galactic Concordance’ abundances. Galactic concor-
dance is based on the observed metallicities of 29 main-
sequence B-stars in local galactic region (Nieva & Przybilla
2012) and is augmented with elements that are of minor
importance in nebular and stellar modeling (Nicholls et al.
2017). Galactic Concordance abundances are representative
of present day, nearby massive stars (Nieva & Przybilla 2012)
and we adopt the scaling method in order to scale elements
consistently down to [Fe/H] = −2 using the scaling relation"

STROMLO STAR TRACKS 3"
"of Nicholls et al. (2017). The Galactic Concordance refer-
ence standard and scaling method provides a reliable present-
day cosmic abundance reference points for anchoring chem-
ical evolution models to observation. Most importantly for
this work and future work on creating self-consistent atmo-
spheres and nebular models based on the same abundance,
Galactic Concordance allows for linking the stellar abun-
dance scale to the nebular abundance scale. As elements
have been observed to vary systematically with [Fe/H], un-
like MIST, we do not assume that all elements uniformly
scale with Fe and we adopt the non-uniform scaling relation
for the abundances of Nicholls et al. (2017)."
"We adopt the same linear fits for the elemental scaling pa-
rameter given in Nicholls et al. (2017) and use stellar abun-
dance measurements using iron as the reference scale in all
our models. The piecewise linear fit for iron-based scaling
for the α and α-like elements X is calculated as follows:"
"[X/Fe] = +ΞFe −2.5 < [Fe/H] < −1.0
[X/Fe] = −ΞFe × [Fe/H] −1.0 < [Fe/H] < +0.5
[X/Fe] = −ΞFe × 0.5 [Fe/H] > +0.5"
"where ΞFe is the iron-based scaling factor for each element,
listed in Table 2 of Nicholls et al. (2017). The elements H,
He, Li, Be and B are not described by the Ξ parameter, be-
cause hydrogen is the reference element, we assume helium
scales simply with the oxygen scaling factor. Carbon and ni-
trogen are not well described by a simple piecewise linear
fit because of the complexities of primary and secondary en-
richment and are fit via the expression:"
"log(X/O) = log
("
"10a + 10[log(O/H)+b]
)
, (2)"
"where for carbon a = −0.8, b = 2.72, and for nitrogen a =
−1.732, b = 2.19. For fluorine, chlorine, neon and argon,
there are no extensive stellar abundance scaling data and we
assume their abundances scale with oxygen."
2.2. Radiative opacities
"The radiative opacity tables implemented in MESA are
divided into two temperature regimes and are treated sepa-
rately, high (log T/K > 4) and low (log T/K < 4) temper-
atures. Our model grids are all computed in the high mass
regime M > 10 M� and thus we only use the high tem-
perature opacity tables. The radiative opacities implemented
in MESA for the high temperature regime are from OPAL
(Rogers & Iglesias 1992; Iglesias & Rogers 1993, 1996) or
OP (Seaton 2005). Following Choi et al. (2016), we use
OPAL opacities. The OPAL opacity tables in MESA and
as incorporated in MIST are computed using Asplund et al.
(2009) photospheric abundances."
"The Galactic Concordance non-uniform parametric scal-
ing provides a more physically realistic approach than sim-
ple uniform abundance scaling with metallicity. For self-"
"consistency in our stellar tracks, we calculate new OPAL4"
"opacity tables for our tracks that use Galactic Concordance
abundances. The OPAL opacity tables must be re-computed
at each metallicity value in our stellar grid (Section 2.5) be-
cause we cannot assume uniform scaling as is traditionally
done with the OPAL tables in MESA that assume solar abun-
dances."
2.3. Mixing processes
"In stellar evolution codes, mixing describes the convective
transport of energy within the stellar interior. We implement
the Ledoux criterion for the convective mixing of elements
as adopted in Choi et al. (2016). The only change in our
mixing methods is the inclusion of the instability caused by
magnetic torques by dynamo-generated fields referred to as
Spruit Tayler (ST), which follows the standard approach used
for high-mass stellar evolution in MESA (Heger et al. 2000,
2005). This is combined with the five rotationally induced in-
stabilities MIST used: dynamical shear instability (DSI), sec-
ular shear instability (SSI), Solberg-Høiland (SH) instability,
Eddington-Sweet (ES) circulation, and Goldreich-Schubert-
Fricke (GSF) instability."
"The diffusion coefficients for these six rotational mixing
processes are combined with the diffusion coefficients for
non-rotational processes: convection, convection overshoot,
semiconvective mixing, and thermohaline mising. The to-
tal sum of the angular momentum and abundance diffusion
equations describe the diffusion coefficients. MESA imple-
ments mixing using the common approach of treating the
chemical composition D and angular momentum ν transport
in a diffusion approximation (e.g., Potter et al. 2012). We
calculate D and ν following Choi et al. (2016) with the addi-
tional inclusion ST instabilities as implemented in Roy et al.
(2020) for high mass stellar evolution."
"For further details of mixing mechanisms and angular mo-
mentum transport in MIST, we refer readers to Choi et al.
(2016)."
2.4. Mass loss
"Mass loss is one of the dominant uncertainties in evolu-
tionary models of massive stars (Smith 2014). Our treatment
of mass loss via stellar winds is based on the “Dutch” mass
loss recipe that is standard in MESA. We adopt the Vink
et al. (2001) mass loss prescription for metallicity-dependent
winds in hot T > 104 K stars. Mass loss is enhanced by rota-
tion (Section 2.5) and our prescriptions for mass loss matches
the stellar wind recipe of Choi et al. (2016) for MIST."
"As discussed in Roy et al. (2020), varying the mass-loss
rate by a constant factor has minimal impact on the He sur-
face fraction for rapidly rotating stars. This is due to rota-
tional mixing providing a mechanism to bring He to the sur-
face that is independent of mass-loss. On the other hand,
for non-rotating stars, varying the mass-loss rate by a con-
stant factor has a non-negligible impact on the enhancement"

"of surface abundances. Roy et al. (2020) found that tripling
the mass-loss rate for a 100 M� star allows surface He en-
richment to occur for metallicites as low as [Fe/H] = −1.
Reducing the mass-loss rate by a factor of 3 prevents the sur-
face He mass fraction from ever reaching above 30%, elim-
inating the WR evolutionary phase, even at solar metallic-
ity. The main effect of increasing or decreasing the mass-
loss rate thus changes the maximum amount of surface He
enrichment, with a larger impact on non-rotating stars."
2.5. Model grid
"We calculate extensive grids of stellar evolutionary tracks
that cover a wide range in stellar mass, rotation, and metal-
licities as follows:"
"Stellar mass: The stellar mass of evolutionary tracks
ranges from 10 to 300 M� following the same spacing as
MIST for a total of 55 models in our mass range: ∆M =
1M� in the range 10–20 M�, ∆M = 2M� in the range
22–40 M�, ∆M = 5M� in the range 45–150 M�, and
∆M = 25M� in the range 175–300 M�. We choose
these masses to provide sufficient coverage of the range of
masses that dominate the photoionization budget for ease of
input into atmosphere and nebular modeling. The models are
evolved through the end of carbon burning and are stopped
when the central 12C abundance drops to 10−4."
"Stellar abundance: We calculate grids with metallicity
values from [Fe /H] = −2.0 to +0.5, with 0.1 dex spacing.
We calculate Galactic Concordance non-solar-scaled abun-
dance (Nicholls et al. 2017) grids where the relative fraction
of each elemental abundance as a function of metallicity is
calculated according to Eqn. 1. We also calculate protoso-
lar abundance (Asplund et al. 2009) grids as implemented
in MIST. Following Choi et al. (2016), we calculate the ini-
tial helium abundance adopting a scaling of ∆Y/∆Z = 1.5
with the primordial helium abundance Yp = 0.249. Once Y
is computed for a value of Z, we calculate X as X = 1 – Y –
Z."
"Stellar rotation: Rotation can significantly alter the evo-
lution of massive stars (Heger et al. 2000, 2005) and is par-
ticularly important for our massive stellar models. We com-
pute models both with and without rotation. Following the
prescription described Choi et al. (2016), we initialize our
rotating stars to begin with solid body rotation at the Zero
Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS). We use v/vcrit values of 0,
0.2, and 0.4, where v/vcrit is the critical surface linear veloc-
ity, defined at the equator of the star as:"
v2crit =
"R3
, (3)"
where the Eddington luminosity LEdd is:
"LEdd =
4πGMc"
"κ
, (4)"
"for a star with mass M , radius R, luminosity L, and opac-
ity κ, and speed of light c. We adopt a fiducial rotation rate
v/vcrit = 0.4 wherever the rotation rate is not explicitly men-
tioned as this value is frequently used as a standard rotating"
"rate for models of massive stellar evolution and is supported
by theoretical models of massive star formation independent
of metallicity (Rosen et al. 2012). We do not implement ro-
tation rates faster than v/vcrit = 0.4 as Roy et al. (2020) finds
qualitatively similar results for all models with v/vcrit > 0.4.
The results of our grid of stellar evolution models are de-
scribed in the following section."
3. RESULTS
"Our primary goal is to produce extensive grids of stellar
evolutionary tracks for massive stars that cover a wide range
in stellar masses, ages, evolutionary phases, and metallicities
at non-solar scaled abundances for ease of comparison to so-
lar scaled abundance stellar tracks. Our high mass models are
terminated at the end of core carbon burning (C-burn) stage,
the point at which the central 12C mass fraction drops below
10−4."
3.1. Stellar Tracks
"Figure 1 shows MIST (solar) and Galactic Concordance
evolutionary tracks at [Fe/H] = 0.0 and v/vcrit = 0.4. The
differences in the tracks are relatively minor. More massive
stars (> 150 M�) with solar abundances tend to burn hotter
and more luminous than the galactic concordance abundance
tracks due to having a higher metal content. The change
in the solar and non-solar scaled abundance tracks becomes
more noticeable with increasing deviation at sub solar metal-
licities, a direct result of the non-uniform scaling of abun-
dances with metallcities in the Stromlo tracks. This implies
that the inferred ionizing spectra from these stars will have
an increasingly important impact on the interpretation of HII
region emission line spectra at metallicities less than solar."
"Figure 2 shows the impact of rotation on the Galactic Con-
cordance and solar stellar evolutionary tracks at [Fe/H] = 0.0,
[Fe/H] = −1.0, and [Fe/H] = −2.0. The rotating models tend
to be hotter and more luminous overall than the non-rotating
star models as a result of the reduced mean opacity in rotating
stars. The same effect in solar scaled MIST tracks was also
reported in Choi et al. (2017). The effect of rotation on the
stellar evolutionary tracks has the largest impact at the lowest
metallicities ([Fe/H] = −2.0 in Figure 2). Overall, rotation in
stars has a larger impact than abundance ratio changes in the
stellar tracks (Figure 1), with the differences most noticeable
at the lowest metallicities ([Fe/H] = −2.0) as well."
"Figures 3 and 4 show the stellar surface gravity g as a func-
tion of the effective temperature Teff and compares the im-
pact of abundances and stellar rotation. Similar to a star’s
luminosity(Figure 1), we find that for stars with metallicities
[Fe/H]& −1, the galactic concordance abundance patterns
have an equally important role as rotation (Figure 4) in de-
termining the intrinsic stellar properties of Teff and surface
gravity g. For stars at low metalicities ([Fe/H] = −2), ro-
tation has a larger impact in determining the stellar proper-
ties (e.g., Teff , surface gravity g, luminosity) than the correct
abundance patterns."

tation plays in determining Teff and luminosity, which ap-
pears to be as important as the chemical abundances. Teff
and luminosity are closely connected to mass-loss and sur-
face abundances of different elements and we demonstrate
here the measured surface abundance of our massive stars
and its relation with rotational mixing."
"Figure 5 shows the surface 4He mass fraction as a func-
tion of time for a sample of initial stellar masses, metal-
licities ([Fe/H] = 0.0, −1.0, and −2.0), and three rotation
rates (v/vcrit= 0.4, 0.2, and 0.0). Figure 5 demonstrates
that rotation in stars more massive than ∼ 100 M� heav-
ily impacts the surface composition; massive, rotating stars
spend the vast majority of their lives on the main sequence
with enhanced He surface abundances consistent with Wolfe
Rayet stellar evolutionary phase (e.g, Abbott & Conti 1987;
Crowther et al. 1995; Meynet & Maeder 2003, 2005; Roy"
"et al. 2020). Rotational mixing and the enhancement of the
surface He begins very fast; the surface He abundance rises
to over 40% just after ∼2 Myr for rotating v/vcrit= 0.4 stars
of &100 M� at metallicity [Fe/H] = 0.0. The two con-
vective zones (inner core and outer core) of rotating stars
are connected by three dominant rotational transport mech-
anisms: meridional circulation (ES circulation), GSF insta-
bility, and Spruit dynamo mixing (Roy et al. 2020). For non-
rotating massive stars, there are no diffusion mechanisms for
the transport of chemical elements from the inner convec-
tive core to the outer convective shell, and therefore there is
no surface He enhancement. Rotational mixing enhances the
surface composition of the massive stars with the effect in-
creasing with decreasing metallicity."

tions 14N normalized by the initial 14Ninitial abundance, as a
function of time and rotation rate for a range of initial stel-"

are enhanced at low metallicity regardless of the rotation and
enhanced at high rotation regardless of the metallicity. The
enhancement is more prominent for more massive stars. At

imum nitrogen surface enhancement of ∼ 14. For the low

abundance chemical elements have been noted before (Heger

impact the observed surface opacity-age relationships. This
in turn will impact the modeled ionizing photon spectrum"

compositions (e.g., Choi et al. 2017; Roy et al. 2020)."
3.3. Main sequence lifetimes
"The enhanced mixing in the cores of rotating stars respon-
sible for increasing their brightness also extends the main se-
quence lifetimes of the stars. Figure 7 shows the main se-
quence lifetime–initial mass relation. As expected, the main
sequence lifetime is longer for rotating stars due to rotational
mixing channeling additional fuel into the core of the star.
The main sequence lifetimes for the Stromlo rotating models
and MIST agree to within 10% at solar metallicity, though the
main sequence lifetimes are shorter for the Stromlo tracks at
solar metallicity. Our rotating Galactic Concordance tracks
at solar metallicity do not show the non-monotonic behavior"

all rotating stars, the boost to the main sequence lifetime at
a fixed initial mass is marginally larger for the MIST tracks
than for the Stromlo tracks, suggesting that rotational mixing
may be marginally more efficient in solar-scaled stars."
3.4. Stellar Isochrones
"We note that in any grid, there are subsets of models that do
not run to completion due to convergence issues (Choi et al.
2017, Figure 7). In general this is not an issue because the
mass sampling is sufficiently fine that there are enough mod-
els to smoothly interpolate and construct smooth isochrones
with the tracks that are available using the same mass grid as
MIST (Dotter 2016). We do note that at low metallicity, the
mass grid sampling as laid out by MIST is not always suffi-
cient to represent the fast evolutionary phases at early times,
however, we do not model ancient, metal-poor populations"
"in this current paper ([Fe/H]=−4) as is done by Choi et al.
(2017) due to computational and convergence difficulties at
these very low metallicities. The isochrones for our Stromlo
stellar tracks are computed at three rotation rates v/vcrit =
0.0, 0.2, 0.4 and at each metallicity point in our grid. Be-
cause we only compute the stellar evolutionary tracks from
10–300 M�, our isochrones are only valid for stars .25 Myr
old. The Stromlo and solar stellar evolutionary tracks are
processed into isochrones following the procedure outlined
in Dotter (2016)."
"Figures 8 and 9 show 1, 3, 5, and 10 Myr isochrones at
[Fe/H] = 0.0 and [Fe/H] = −1.0 and at varying rotations.
The effect of faster rotation resulting in hotter, brighter, and
longer-lived stars is immediately clear. The Stromlo tracks
with Galactic Concordance abundances show the same fast
appearance of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars (Teff > 104 K and sur-
face hydrogen mass fraction X < 0.3; Meynet & Maeder
2003; Georgy et al. 2012) from the massive star progenitors"

4. DISCUSSION
"In this section we discuss the implications of rotating, mas-
sive star models with non-Solar elemental abundances on the
interpretation of high-redshift star-forming galaxies. We ex-
amine applications for physical conditions at high and low
redsihft where these hot, rotating star models will have a dra-
matic impact."
"Abundance scaling of elements at metallicities lower than
the Solar standard has been explored in stars, but in the neb-
ular modelling community, only simple uniform scaling as-
sumptions are typically implemented. The surface enhance-
ment of elements in massive rotating stars will have broad
implication for the ionizing spectra of high-redshift, low-
metallicity galaxies. Under the assumption that stars re-
tain their original surface composition until they leave the
main sequence, there is minimal impact on the hydrogen-
ionizing photon fluxes, and thus the effect of this assumption
on the total ionizing photon budget is minimal. Moderate and
rapidly rotating stars heavily impact the original surface com-
position of these massive stars and while the hydrogen ion-
izing flux remains relatively unchanged, the self-consistently
evolved surface composition for fast rotating stars contains
fewer photons at the helium ionizing edge (Roy et al. 2020).
The different surface opacity-age relationships make signif-
icant contribution to the photon ionizing budget than would
be expected if the surface composition were un-evolved. This
increases the complexity in interpreting spectral line diag-
nostics and measuring reliable metallicity indicators. Conse-
quently, stellar models in conjunction with photoionization
models for nebulae with different metallicities need to take
this variation into account in order to accurately model and
predict the properties of galaxies across cosmic time."
"To investigate the impact on the ionizing spectrum of our
stellar evolutionary tracks computed using non-Solar scaled"
"abundances, we model the simple stellar populations (SSPs)
of our stellar isochrones (Section 3.4) using the Flexible Stel-
lar Population Synthesis package (FSPS; Conroy et al. 2009;
Conroy & Gunn 2010). We predict the simulated SED for a
106 M� stellar population following an instantaneous burst
of star formation and a fully sampled Kroupa (2001) IMF
with limits of 0.08 – 300 M�. We implement the MILES em-
pirical library as the primary stellar spectral library (Sanchez-
Blazquez et al. 2006; Falcón-Barroso et al. 2011)."
"We compute the time evolution of the ionizing photon lu-
minosityQ from 1 to 20 Myr for 106 M� stellar population at
[Fe/H] = −2.0, −1.0, and 0.0, shown in Figure 10 computed
at v/vcrit = 0.4 for stellar models with Soloar and Galac-
tic Concordance abundances. The models produce compa-
rable hydrogen and helium-ionizing photon output rates at
[Fe/H] = 0.0. The difference of elemental abundances on
the resulting ionizing photon output begins to deviate more
at lower metallicity with the impact occurring at the highest
energies blueward of 228 Å. The Stromlo models predicts a
soften spectrum than the Solar models, primarily due to dif-
ferences in the stellar populations of the underlying stellar
models (Figure 1). The Stromlo models cease to produce an
appreciable amount of photons blueward of 228 Å (the wave-
length of photons capable of doubly ionizing helium) beyond
5 Myr, 1 Myr shorter than what is seen for the Solar mod-
els. Single-star models rely exclusively on the most massive
stars as the principal ionizing sources and the ionizing pho-
ton output decreases dramatically upon the disappearance of
the most massive stars the first few Myr."
"It is important to stress that the only changes made to the
stellar tracks to compute the ionizing luminosity Q in Fig-
ure 10 is the relative elemental abundances from Solar to
Galactic Concordance for the Stromlo tracks. The differ-
ences in the the singly ionizing helium He I (24.6 eV) ion-
izing flux indicate this change to the tracks could affect im-
portant nebula lines compared to tracks computed with so-
lar abundances. There are a large number of key nebular"

The minimal impact of the stellar rotation on the hydrogen
ionizing luminosity compared to the helium ionizing lumi-
nosity has been demonstrated in prior studies (Levesque et al.
2012; Choi et al. 2017). The galactic concordance abundance
patterns have an equally important role as rotation in deter-"

especially at lower metallicities; adopting stellar models that

Considering non-Solar scaled abundances in stellar models

budget from star clusters in local studies as well as mea-
surements for the escape fraction of ionizing photons in
high-redshift galaxies during cosmic reionization."

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
"In this paper we investigate the impact of the stellar el-
emental abundances on the stellar evolutionary tracks in
massive rotating and non-rotating stars over a wide range
of metallicities using the Galactic Concordance abundances
from resolved Milky Way H II regions. We use MESA
for our stellar evolutionary calculations and include all the
same physical processes and parameters values as used in
the MIST track library (Choi et al. 2016) for uniform scaled
solar-abundances. We focus on massive stars evolved until
the end of the main-sequence phases and adopt the same the
modifications to improve the treatment of massive stars and
the implementation of Galactic Concordance abundances as
outlined by Roy et al. (2020)."
We summarize our main conclusions below.
"1. The assumed elemental abundance ratios have minor
influence on massive stellar evolutionary tracks at so-
lar metallicities (Figure 1). The correct implementa-
tion of non-uniformly scaled elemental abundance ra-
tios becomes more significant at sub-solar metallici-
ties, where the differences between Stromlo stars and
MIST uniform solar-scaled abundance stars are pri-
marily most pronounced for stars more massive than
50 M�at low metallicities."
"2. Rotation and abundances both play a significant role
in determining the stellar parameters of Teff , luminos-
ity, and surface gravity g (Figure 2, Figure 3). Rotation
effects are more significant at lower metallicities in de-
termining Teff , luminosity, and surface gravity g than
abundance patterns as the stars become more compact"

and the differences become more pronounced at lower metallicities and is most significant at the highest energies shortward of 228 Å."
"and angular momentum loss due to winds becomes less
important."
"3. The significant effect of rotation in determining the
stellar Teff , luminosity and surface gravity g, espe-
cially at low metallicities, has a large impact on mass-
loss and surface abundances of different elements (Fig-
ures 5 and 6). Rapidly rotating stars (v/vcrit= 0.4)
more massive than 100 M� show helium surface abun-
dance enhancement to 40% by ∼ 2 Myr. Even in non-
rotating stars, toward the end of the core H depletion,
stars experience the ‘classical’ WR phase, approaching
the Eddington limit and experiencing rapid mass-loss,
which enhances the He surface abundance upwards to
90%. At lower metallicities ([Fe/H] = −2), the effect
of rotation on He surface abundance enhancement be-
comes more significant with He surface enhancement
occurring as rapidly as 1.5 Myr for 100 M� stars. Ro-
tation plays an extremely important role in the sur-
face enhancement of nitrogen, with the effect becom-
ing more important at lower metallicities."
"4. Rotation lengthens the main sequence timescale of
massive stars (Figure 7) and leads to brighter and hot-
ter stars (Figure 9). The boost in the main sequence
lifetime at a fixed mass is slight larger in our Galactic
Concordance Stromlo tracks than in the MIST solar-
scaled models in both rotating and non-rotating stars
at low metallicities ([Fe/H] = −2; Figure 8), a result of
increased metallicity and a decrease in the mean opac-
ity."
"5. The Stromlo tracks show a softer ionizing spectrum
compared to expectations from the Solar-scaled ion-
izing spectrum (Figure 10). The ionizing photon lumi-
nosity between Solar and Galactic Concordance mod-
els deviate most significantly at low metallicities. The"
"stellar populations in low metallicity environments,
common at high redshift, only require moderate rota-
tion rates to produce significant ionizing photons, de-
creasing rapidly after the disappearance of the most
massive stars after a few Myr."
"This paper is the first implementation of Galactic Concor-
dance abundances to the stellar evolution models that does
not implement solar, scaled-solar, or alpha-element enhanced
abundances. These models will be applicable for extreme re-
gions of star formation, especially low metallicity systems
and active star-forming galaxies, where massive and rotating
star models at non-uniform scaled metallicitices have the po-
tential to heavily impact the resulting properties of the star-
forming emission line regions. The importance of rotating,
massive star models and their elemental abundance scaling
have broad implications within the context of cosmic reion-
ization and the interpretation of high-redshift star-forming
galaxies."
"The Galactic Concordance scale is not the sole scaling pa-
rameter that can be used for non-uniform scaling relations
between elements and metallicity. It is vital, however, that
a single scale is implemented for all the necessary compo-
nents involved within stellar population synthesis and pho-
toionization models. In the future, we will investigate the ef-
fect of Galactic Concordance scaled abundances of massive,
rotating stars in low metallicity environments using stellar
population synthesis applications using self-consistent atmo-
sphere and nebular modeling with MAPPINGS to quantify
the impact to the ionizing photon budget and spectral line
diagnostics."
