"Abstract. Current measurements of cosmic-ray fluxes have reached unprecedented accuracy
thanks to the new generation of experiments, and in particular the AMS-02 mission. At the
same time, significant progress has been made in the propagation models of galactic cosmic
rays. These models include several propagation parameters, which are usually inferred from
the ratios of secondary to primary cosmic rays, and which depend on the cross sections
describing the collisions among the various species of cosmic-ray nuclei. At present, our
knowledge of these cross sections in the energy range where cosmic-ray interactions occur is
limited, and this is a source of uncertainties in the predicted fluxes of secondary cosmic-ray
nuclei. In this work we study the impact of the cross section uncertainties on the fluxes of light
secondary nuclei (Li, Be, B) using a preliminary version of the upcoming DRAGON2 code.
We first present a detailed comparison of the secondary fluxes computed by implementing
different parameterizations for the network of spallation cross sections. Then, we discuss the
use of secondary-over-secondary cosmic-ray flux ratios as a tool to improve the consistency of
cross sections parameterizations and give insight of the overall uncertainties coming from the
cross sections parametrisations. We show that the uncertainties inferred from the cross section
data are enough to explain the discrepancies in the Be and Li fluxes with respect to the AMS-
02 data, with no need of a primary component in their spectra. In addition, we show that
the fluxes of B, Be and Li can be simultaneously reproduced by rescaling their cross sections
within the experimental uncertainty. Finally, we also revisit the diffusive estimation of the
halo size, obtaining good agreement with previous works and a best fit value of 6.8± 1 kpc
from the most updated cross sections parametrisations."

1 Introduction
"Propagation of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) is governed by the magnetic collisionless
interactions they suffer with the interstellar plasma waves. These interactions make them
wander inside the Galaxy following a random walk that can be studied as a diffusive
motion [1, 2]. From the evaluation of the amount of matter traversed by CRs, we know
that their diffusion is not limited to the disc of the Galaxy [3], but extends up to a few kpc
in the so-called magnetic halo."
"CRs are accelerated inside astrophysical sources (presumably supernova remnants) with
an energy spectrum typically following a power law of the form Q(E) = KE−γ . Acceleration
of CRs at sources is explained by the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) model [4–7]. CRs
produced at these sources are known as primary CRs and their spectra are usually called
“injection spectra” [8]. Nevertheless, the spectra of CRs detected at Earth are modified due
to their diffusive propagation, resulting in power laws of the form J(E) ∝ E−(γ+δ), where the
diffusion parameter δ is related to the time spent by CRs in the Galaxy τprop(E) (propagation
time)."
"On the other hand, during their journey, galactic CRs can eventually interact with the
interstellar gas (which consists mainly of hydrogen with about a 11% of helium and traces
of heavier elements [9]) producing lighter nuclei (secondary CRs) that otherwise would be
found in tiny proportions (mainly boron, beryllium, lithium and the so-called sub-Fe nuclei),
since they are hardly produced in stellar fusion or other thermonuclear processes [10]. The
spectra of secondary CRs produced from these interactions (spallation reactions) have the
form: Jk(E) ∝ ρg"
"∑
i Ji(E)σi→k(E). Here ρg is the density of the interstellar medium"
"(ISM) and σi→k(E) is the inclusive cross section of production of the CR species k from
the interaction of the CR species i with the ISM."
"The study of secondary CRs can therefore provide valuable information about the
interactions that CRs suffer during their journey. The relevant quantity used to describe
CR interactions is the “grammage” X(E) = ρgl(E) ∝ ρgτprop(E), related to the diffusion
coefficient used to describe the CR diffusive motion (D ∝ τ−1prop). Here l(E) is the effective
length traversed by CRs, which depends on the interaction cross sections and on the particle
kinetic energy per nucleon E. Nonetheless, the current experimental data on inclusive cross
sections are based on a few data points that hardly reach energies of tens of GeV/n. These
cross sections are crucial, since the best way to constrain the propagation parameters (mainly
the diffusion coefficient) is by means of the secondary-over-primary CR flux ratios [11, 12]."
"In this work, we have implemented different publicly available cross sections data sets
in the preliminary version of the DRAGON2 cosmic-ray propagation code [13, 14] to study how
the choice of cross sections affects the predictions on the fluxes of the light secondary CRs
boron, beryllium and lithium. In section 2 the set-up of the simulations is illustrated. The
results of the simulations are presented in section 3, where the fluxes of these secondary
species computed with different cross sections parametrisations are shown, and some relevant
conclusions are drawn. The effects of variations on the cross sections are then tested in
detail by studying secondary-over-secondary ratios in section 4. These ratios are extremely
sensitive to the cross sections and, therefore, represent a useful tool to test the validity of
the cross sections used in the propagation code. This allows us to evaluate the uncertainties
in the predicted fluxes of B, Be and Li associated to their production cross sections. In this
section we also perform a simultaneous fit of the high-energy part of the flux ratios among
secondary B, Be and Li by adjusting their production cross sections within the experimental
uncertainties. In addition, these secondary-over-secondary ratios will be used to look for
possible imprints of any extra primary source producing them. Then, in section 5 the effect
of the halo size on the ratios involving 10Be is explored with the different cross section models.
In this section we also get a more robust estimate of the value of the halo size. Finally, the
conclusions are drawn in section 6."
2 Propagation setup and cross section data sets
"Simulations of CR propagation are performed using the 2-dimensional model of the Galaxy
offered by the DRAGON code [15] 1, where cylindrical symmetry is assumed. The Galaxy
is described as a thin disc with radius R ∼ 20 kpc and height h ∼ 100 pc with the Sun on
the Galactic plane at a distance of 8.3 kpc from the center. The disc is surrounded by the
halo, which is a cylinder with the same radius as the disc and with height 2H of a few kpc
(two-zone model). Gas and CR sources are distributed within the disc. An illustration of the
model is shown in Fig. 1."
"A diffusion-reacceleration model is used in the CR propagation, without implicit
advection, since recent studies of the AMS-02 data with similar diffusion coefficient
parameterizations as we use here demonstrate to be compatible with no or negligible
convection [16, 17]. These models have successfully reproduced the shape of the ratios of
secondaries over primaries fluxes at low energy, as for example in refs. [18–20]. The inclusion
of stochastic reacceleration seems to be necessary to naturally explain the shapes of these
ratios."

"In the previous equations ~Ji indicates the CR diffusive flux of the i-th species and
Ni is the density per unit momentum. The term ~vω represents the advection speed, which
we assume to be null. The second term in the left-hand side accounts for the diffusion in
momentum space. The first term in the right-hand side, Qi, represents the distribution
and energy spectra of particle sources (injection spectra); the second term describes the
momentum losses; finally, the remaining four terms describe losses and gains due to decays and
fragmentations. These equations are numerically solved with a new version of the DRAGON
code 2. More information about the code can be found on refs. [13] and [14]."
"The flux terms ~Ji are related to the densities Ni by Fick’s law, ~Ji = −

"~~D is
the spatial diffusion tensor [13]. In this study, we assume that the spatial diffusion coefficient
parallel to the regular magnetic field lines vanishes because of the azimuthal symmetry
adopted for the Galaxy structure [15] and we used a general form of the spatial diffusion
coefficient perpendicular to the magnetic field lines, which is assumed to be homogeneous:"

"Here β = v/c, R is the rigidity of the particle, D0 is the constant diffusion coefficient at the

effects that may play a major role at low energy, as the dissipation of Alfven waves [21]. In
this work η will be treated as a free parameter, since also negative values are theoretically
motivated [21]."

while the high-energy break was set to R2 = 335 GV for protons and R2 = 200 GV for
the heavier nuclei. In the present work we injected 1H, 4He, 12C, 14N, 16O, 20Ne, 24Mg and
28Si as primary nuclei with the spatial distribution of sources following the model in ref.[24].
The injection spectra are tuned such that these primary CRs reproduce the AMS-02 spectra
(Figure 13)."
"In the last years CR experiments have reached unprecedented precision in the flux
measurements of CRs, making possible the study of several features unexplored in the past.
The accuracy showed in the last experimental results of the AMS-02 collaboration is of the
order of 1 − 5% (for the main nuclei involved in the creation of light secondary CRs, as C,
N and O). However, the uncertainties on the cross sections reach levels of 20− 50% in some
channels (see [25]), which makes clear the need of new cross sections data with better accuracy
to improve the precision of the predictions on CR fluxes. Even the exact determination of
the uncertainties is complicated for most of the channels, since sometimes data from different
experiments are difficult to reconcile. In addition, there are many channels with no data or
just with a few data at low energies (below 10 GeV/n), which makes the parametrisations at
high energies not straightforward at all. Also the so-called ghost-nuclei (i.e. those unstable
nuclei whose lifetime is so small that they are not propagated and their contribution is directly
added up to their daughter nuclei) have a sizeable effect in the estimation of the production
of secondary nuclei."
"Currently there are several parametrisations of the nuclei cross sections publicly
available. The first parametrisations came from the early measurements of B. Webber,
published in a series of papers during the 80s (see [26] and references therein) that ultimately
lead to the semi-empirical WNEW code [27] with a last update in 2003 [28]. Then, there
were important efforts to expand the known experimental measurements to other channels,
turning out in the semi-empirical parametrisations by Silberberg and Tsao [29–31] that
converged in the YIELDX code [32, 33]. More recently, the GALPROP team3 developed a set
of routines combining semi-empirical formulae [34–36]. Nevertheless, although these routines"

"
have remained the state of the art, it is well known that with the current available cross
section data they show serious shortcomings that limit the precision of CR studies [37]."
"A couple of years ago, a new set of cross sections derived from a different parametrisation
of data for all individual channels was presented as the default option for the incoming DRAGON2
code [14, 38]. They have been successfully used in other studies as [39] and are fully available
in the github repository of the new DRAGON version 2."
"Due to uncertainties in cross section, the discrepancies found when comparing the
predicted secondary CR fluxes to data might drive to misleading conclusions. It is therefore
clear the need of comparing different cross section data sets and their performance in
reproducing the measurements."
"In the present simulation we are propagating nuclei up to Z = 14, which implies we can
fully describe the generation of secondary nitrogen and boron (which is considered to be fully
secondary, as Be and Li). Nevertheless, the missing iron (mainly 56Fe, but also its isotopes)
and, in very low proportion, 32S make us underestimate the total amount of Li and Be in
a 3.22% and 3.7% in average, respectively (see tables IV and V in [25]). In order to save
computational time for the computations required for the rest of nuclei (up to Z = 14), we
compensate for the missing source terms (primary Fe and S) by adding just this extra ∼ 3%
to the Li and Be spectra."
"Finally, another important parameter affecting the low-energy region of the CR spectra
is the solar modulation, which is modeled using the Parker equations and the force-field
approximation [40]. This parameter depends on the solar activity and, therefore, on the
epoch in which the experimental data were taken."
"The variable used to characterize the solar modulation is the Fisk potential φ. The flux
of CRs reaching a detector at Earth is related to that in the Local Interstellar medium (LIS)
by the following equation:"
Φobs(Eobs) =
"(
2mEobs + E"
"2mELIS + E
2
LIS"
")
ΦLIS(ELIS), (2.5)"
"with ELIS = Eobs + eφ|Z|/A. In eq. 2.5, ELIS and Eobs are the kinetic energies per nucleon
in the LIS and at Earth, respectively, while m indicates the proton mass."
"In this work we have chosen for the solar modulation potential the value of 0.61 GV,
consistent with the data from the NEWK 4 neutron monitor experiment (see [41, 42]), which
allows us to reproduce the Voyager-1 [43, 44] and AMS-02 data in the period 2011-2016 and
is similar to the value found in previous studies [19]."
"3 Fluxes of the secondary CRs B, Be and Li"
"In this section we show and discuss the predicted fluxes of B, Be and Li obtained in our
analyses. These predictions are performed using the cross sections parameterizations5 from
the upcoming DRAGON2 code, GALPROP and a combination of the WNEW03 code and YIELDX
code (only for the Li production) called here Webber, and selecting the set of diffusion
parameters that reproduce the boron-over-carbon data (see Fig. 14 in appendix B) of AMS-02
[45] and using the optimal value for the halo size found from the procedure explained in Sec. 5."

"Table 1. Diffusion parameters used in the CR propagation with the different cross section
parameterizations. The values have been obtained from the fit of the B/C data from AMS-02 [45], [47]
and of the 10Be/9Be data from various experiments (see sec. 8), assuming the different cross section
models."
"These parameters are in agreement with previous analyses [16, 46] and are summarized in
Table 1. Here, we do not perform a dedicated best-fit study of the diffusion parameters, but
a scan over these parameters to fit the B/C ratio which is terminated when the condition
χ2/npoints < 1.05 is fulfilled, since this value corresponds to a p-value ∼ 50%. Additionally,
we adjust the parameters of the source spectra in Eq. 2.4 to reproduce the fluxes of individual
CR species measured by AMS-02 [47, 48]. As an example, Figure 13 in appendix B shows the
observed spectra at Earth of the main primary CR nuclei (from carbon to silicon) compared
with the predictions from our simulation with the DRAGON2 set of cross sections. We remark
again that we are using the new released data of AMS-02 for the Mg, Si and Ne fluxes for
testing the production of secondary CRs, since the collaboration reported fluxes on these CR
species around 10−20% larger than previous experiments [48], which lead up to ∼ 2% changes
in the flux of these secondary CRs. We then proceed to study the spectra of secondary CRs
and compare their fluxes to the available experimental data. The employed cross sections
parametrisations for the channels of production of B, Be and Li from C and O projectiles
(the main channels for their production) are compared to the available data in appendix A
(see ref. [25] for other rarer channels)."
"Very few works have studied the spectra of Li and Be in order to determine the diffusion
parameters (see [16] for a recent work), while nearly all authors just use boron and its ratios
to a primary CR species (usually C) to develop their models [49]. This is due to the fact that,
before AMS-02, the experimental data on Li and Be fluxes were poor and the uncertainty on
the predicted fluxes from the cross sections parametrisations in the B channels is expected to
be the smallest [50]. Typical uncertainties on the predicted Li and Be fluxes around 20−30%
and 15− 25% respectively are usually quoted [50], while the uncertainties on the predicted B
flux are around 10% [25]. The reason is that the production of B is mainly regulated by the C
and O reaction channels, while other very poorly constrained cross sections channels (mainly
those of Mg, Ne and Si) become important for the production of Li and Be, contributing to
∼ 45% of their flux."
"Figure 2 shows the spectra of B, Be and Li for the three cross section parametrisations
adopted in the present work. However, in the very high-energy region, above 200 GeV/n, we
see that the measured fluxes of Li, Be and B are slightly higher (harder) than the predicted
ones for all the three cross section parametrisations. This feature suggests the need of
introducing a break in the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient (see, e.g., ref. [54])
rather than in the CR injection spectra, but this does not affect the conclusions of this article
because the flux ratios among secondary cosmic rays mitigate the effects of features in the"

is closer to the experimental data, with discrepancies less than 15% above 10 GeV/n. The
shape of the residuals found for Be with the Webber and GALPROP parametrisations may also
be related to the adjustment of the halo size value (since the flux of the unstable isotope

DRAGON2 cross sections models. The residuals are also shown to better illustrate how large are the
discrepancies between simulations and data. These plots include the simulated spectra for various
halo sizes, since the presence of 10Be and its beta decay to 10B modify the shape of the spectra at
low energies. The simulated spectrum for the halo size that best fits the flux ratios of Be isotopes, as
explained in section 5, is also included. Data taken from //https://lpsc.in2p3.fr/crdb/ [51, 52]

"Comparing the fluxes of Li, Be and B shown in the panels of Fig. 2, we see that the main
difference arise in the predicted Li flux, which is the nucleus that suffers more from missing
cross sections data and poorly known reaction channels. Nevertheless, the differences among
the predictions obtained with the three cross section parametrisations are subject to the choice
of diffusion coefficient used, limiting a direct study of their production cross sections. In fact,
the discrepancies between cross sections sets for the predicted flux of a secondary CR, (i.e.
comparing the figures in the same column of Fig. 2), would change if we had used the same
diffusion parameters for the three cross sections parametrisations. This strong dependence
on the diffusion parameters employed makes the fluxes of individual secondary CRs to be
an insufficient tool for discriminating among cross section models. On the contrary, the flux"

https://tools.ssdc.asi.it/CosmicRays/"
"
ratios among secondary CRs are almost unaffected by the diffusion coefficient, making this
observable much more sensitive to the spallation cross sections than the fluxes of individual
species."
"Figure 3 shows the Be/B, Li/B and Li/Be flux ratios predicted using the three cross
section parametrisations, assuming the halo sizes reported in Table 1, compared to the
experimental data in the energy range from 500 MeV/n up to 1 TeV/n. We see that the
differences among the predictions obtained with the three parametrisations are very similar
to those observed between the different individual fluxes in Fig. 2. However, the advantage is
that these ratios are roughly unaffected by the parametrisation of the diffusion coefficient in
the energy region above a few tens of GeV/n and mainly dependent on their production cross
sections and on the spectra of primary CRs (set always to fit the AMS-02 data), as shown in
appendix C."
"A parameter which can significantly affect the fluxes of secondary CRs and their ratios,
at low energy, is the size of the galactic halo. To show the effect of the halo size on these
ratios, we have performed an additional set of simulations changing the halo size from 2 to
16 kpc. From Figure 3 we see that, in the case of the Li/B and Li/Be ratios, variations
of the halo size do not yield large changes at any energies (the variations of the ratios are
less than 5%). On the other hand, in the case of the Be/B ratio, variations of the halo size
yield variations in the spectra up to 10% in the low energy region. As mentioned above,
different unstable CR species have different decay lengths and, depending on the path length
they travel until reaching the Earth, different fractions of unstable nuclei can decay, thus
influencing the secondary fluxes and their ratios. In particular, the Be/B ratio is highly
sensitive to the halo size due to the presence of the radioactive isotope 10Be, which can decay
into 10B (see [39], where the authors discuss the halo size repercussions on the Be/B ratio
at low energy). This dependence is particularly evident below 10 GeV/n, given the short
lifetime of this isotope at low energies. On top of this, we point out that, as the 10Be decay
length at low energies is of the order of a few hundred pc, the Be flux at low energies can also
depend on the local gas density distribution in the Galaxy [55, 56]. Changing this distribution
could therefore change the predictions on the secondary flux ratios involving Be. However, a
detailed study of this effect is beyond the goal of the present paper. Other uncertainties in
the secondary CR fluxes are related to total inelastic cross sections and are expected to have
negligible effects in comparison (O(2%) [12])."
"From Figure 3, we can see that the largest residuals are usually found at low energies,
as expected. The shape of the flux ratios at low energy is not well reproduced when using
the Webber cross sections, with residuals up to ∼ 30%. On the other hand, the shapes of
the flux ratios obtained from the GALPROP and DRAGON2 parametrisations are very similar,
with different normalizations. The smaller residuals with respect to data are found with the
DRAGON2 parametrisation and are less than 10% above 5 GeV/n."
"In conclusion, we find that the secondary-over-secondary spectra are mainly related to
their production cross sections, and above ∼ 10−20 GeV/n they have very little dependence
on all the other discussed effects. Hence, these ratios represent an extremely useful tool to
constrain the parametrisations of the inclusive cross sections used in CR propagation codes.
In the next section we will use the flux ratios among B, Be and Li in order to evaluate the
uncertainties associated to their production cross sections and achieve a simultaneous fit from
a rescaling on their production cross sections within the experimental uncertainties."
4 Cross section uncertainties assessment
"Given the different predictions from the different parametrisations, each cross section model
may lead to a different interpretation of the CR data. As an example, from Fig. 2 we see
that the Webber cross section parametrisation yields a ∼ 20% excess in the Be and Li fluxes
in comparison to the B flux. One could correct this discrepancy either by adding a primary
component of boron (injecting boron from the source) and reducing the total grammage
traversed by CRs (in order to fit the B/C ratio) or by rescaling the cross sections of boron
production (which would have the same effect on the grammage necessary to fit the B/C
ratio), such that the three fluxes will reproduce AMS-02 data at the same time. On the
other hand, the GALPROP parametrisation yields a ∼ 25% deficit in the Li flux, which could
be explained, for example, adding an additional component of Li generated at the source (see
ref. [46]). Nevertheless, the GALPROP parametrisations could also be tuned to reproduce the
flux ratios by a proper rescaling of the production cross sections (i.e. renormalizing some
channels), within the experimental uncertainties."
"To investigate the effects of the uncertainties on the cross section parametrisations we
have defined two bracketing models from the GALPROP parametrisation, in which the spallation
cross sections for each interaction channel with 12C and 16O as projectiles have been shifted
up or down using a scaling factor corresponding to the average uncertainties on the cross
sections experimental data at ±1σ. This is motivated by the fact that the energy dependence
of the cross sections is supposed to be well known, while their normalization is not precisely
determined (see ref. [57]). A couple of channels were differently rescaled, to better contain the
cross sections data. In the case of the Li production channels from 16O and 12C, extra shifts
of 12% and 7% respectively were applied to the upper model, since a few data points exhibit
larger excursions with respect to the nominal model. In the channels of 16O producing 9Be
and 10Be the shift was taken to be half of the experimental uncertainties."
"The bracketing models are shown in figures 4, 5 and 6, where the shifts, typically
corresponding to a ±20% variation from the cross sections normalization, are shown in the
legends for each channel. We see that the Be channels are those with smaller uncertainties
and more data points, while the Li channels are those with the higher uncertainties and less
data points. We also see that the channels coming from the spallation of 16O exhibit larger
experimental errors and less data points than those from the spallation of 12C. The original
GALPROP cross sections are also shown to illustrate the relative changes. These figures also
show the cross sections obtained from the fit of the secondary-over-secondary flux ratios above
10 GeV/n, which will be discussed in Section 4.1 (see figure 7). These cross sections are scaled
from the original GALPROP parametrisations and allow us to simultaneously reproduce the flux
ratios involving Li, Be and B."
"We point out here that we are not changing the cross sections from the spallation
reactions of other nuclei than 12C and 16O (the main channels). Most of the channels
with minor importance have no or very few data measurements, what originates most of the
uncertainties on the total production cross sections of the isotopes we are studying. Although
the individual contribution to the secondary CR fluxes from each of these channels is small,
the sum of all their contributions is relevant (∼ 25% for B and > 50% for Li and Be). The
next step here consists on the evaluation of the spectra of secondary CRs for these upper and
lower (bracketing) models."

"4.1 Uncertainty effects and cross sections evaluation from the secondary-over-
secondary ratios"
"To show the effects of the cross sections uncertainties on the secondary-over-secondary flux
ratios, we have derived these ratios using the two bracketing models for the cross sections,
demonstrating that the AMS-02 data lie between these two models. The results are shown
in Figure 7, where the yellow bands represent the values of the flux ratios within the two
limiting models. The upper bound of each band corresponds to the situations in which the
numerator is taken from the upper bracketing model and the denominator from the lower
bracketing model (thus maximizing the ratio) and vice versa for the lower bound of the band.
Furthermore, the expected full uncertainty bands on the flux ratios are also represented by
black dashed lines. These bands are evaluated taking into account that the contribution from
the 12C and 16O channels are about 77% of the total B flux and around 55% and 60% of the
flux of Be and Li, respectively, according to tables IV, V and VI of [25], which implies to
scale the fluxes in the bracketing models accordingly to have a rough estimation of the full
bands. From this figure, we see that the full uncertainty band for the Li/Be ratio is nearly
twice larger than that evaluated taking into account the uncertainty associated to their main
production channels (i.e. with the two bracketing models), while for the other ratios it is
around 70% larger. In any case, we see that almost all the AMS-02 data lie within the bands
obtained just varying the main production channels. These results confirms that primary"

"Moreover, in this work, we have obtained a set of cross sections from a fit of the high

from Figure 3, it is obvious that an increase of Li cross sections is needed; however, just a
change of this cross sections does not account for the discrepancies in the Be/B and Li/B flux
ratios. This means that making variations just in the Be and Li cross sections (or whichever
pair of secondaries) independently will never reproduce the three ratios at the same time,
implying that a simultaneous adjustment of all the three fluxes is needed. Nevertheless, the
simultaneous adjustment of the studied ratios does not have an exact solution (there can be"

"degenerate solutions), so that finding the correct relation between the cross sections and the
ratios is not straightforward. Therefore, we consider that the adjustment which implies a
minimum rescaling from the original parametrisation should be favored."
"The strategy followed here to simultaneously fit the high energy part of the secondary-
over-secondary ratios consists of a progressive shift of the cross sections from the original
parametrisation for each of the main channels, until we find a configuration that matches
the three ratios at the same time, thus searching for the configuration with less variations
from the original parametrisations. Indeed, in this case we see that the fit convergence is
reached when Li and Be cross sections are very close to touch the bracketing limits (Upper
model for Li and Lower for Be), which means that there is very narrow margin to find other
degenerate solutions. The fit yielded a renormalization of the cross sections of ∼ 5% down
for the B flux (constant for all the channels), of ∼ 18% down for the Be flux (∼ 16% in the
12C channels and ∼ 20% in the 16O channels) and of 28% up for the Li flux (∼ 22% for 12C
channels and ∼ 34% 16O channels). The uncertainties on the scaling factors obtained for this
derived model are of 4% above 10 GeV/n, as discussed in appendix C. These scaling factors
can be compared to the post-fit nuisance parameters found in the combined LiBeB analysis
of ref. [16], for their QUAINT model, taking into account that the scaling factors we compute
are only related to the 12C and 16O channels. They found that the scaling parameters were
of ∼ 4% down, ∼ 6% down and ∼ 12% up for B, Be and Li respectively. These are consistent
with the values we found in our analysis, since we expect that the B scaling factor should be
very similar to the value obtained when scaling all the channels and the scaling factors for"

in agreement with the uncertainties that one would expect, as the impact of a change of these
minor channels (very poorly known) for B production is very small. In turn, the impact of the
main channels for Li and Be fluxes is approximately the same as that of the rest of the minor
channels, which means larger level of uncertainty. The use of these scaling factors obtained
from the combination of flux ratios among secondary CRs can help improving the description
of the spallation cross sections used in CR propagation codes and may also be considered
as a strategy to take care of the deficiencies on the description of the minor channels. This
strategy has been already used for improving the estimation of the production of antiprotons
from CR interactions with the interstellar gas in [58], obtaining good agreement with the
AMS-02 antiprotons data."
"As a final remark, from the lower plots of Figure 7 we see that the predicted fluxes of
these three light secondary CRs reproduce the AMS-02 data at the same time in a broad
energy region. The common discrepancy at high energies is due to the choice of the diffusion
parameters, as already mentioned, which can be also the reason for the discrepancy of the Li
flux below 2 GeV/n (although it is also related to the cross sections parametrisation). The
influence of the halo size value in the low-energy part of the Be spectrum may explain its
deviation from experimental data as commented in ref. [45]."
"In conclusion, we have demonstrated that we can reproduce the fluxes of B, Be and Li at
the same time within the experimental cross sections uncertainties, with no need of including
any primary extra source and that we can tune the spallation cross sections of production of
secondary species to reproduce the secondary-over-secondary ratios and overcome the lack of
knowledge we have in the normalization of the cross sections parametrisations. This is crucial
in order to determine the diffusion parameters with better accuracy. In fact, with a correct
balance of the secondary CRs, we could in principle also use Li and Be data in addition to B
data to determine the diffusion parameters. This will be explored in a next paper."
5 Implications of the cross sections on the halo size determination
"The height of the galactic halo H plays a relevant role for the study of secondary-to-primary
ratios involving leptons (the radiative energy loss rates are of the same order of magnitude as
the reciprocal of the diffusion time), antiprotons and, as discussed above, unstable isotopes
like 10Be. The usual way to constrain the halo size is by means of the study of the ratios of
10Be to the total Be flux or to the 9Be flux [59, 60]. The spectrum of the isotope 10Be depends
on an interplay between the diffusion time of the primary CRs (τ ∝ E−δ) and the decay time
of this isotope (which is around 1.4 My, as determined in ref. [61]). Other methods have
been used to set constraints on H from radio observations of lepton synchrotron emission [62],
from X-ray and gamma-ray studies [63], from studies on CR leptons and other heavy nuclei
[64]."
"One of the obvious consequences of using secondary isotopes to determine any feature
of the propagation is that the results will be highly influenced by the cross section model
used. We have therefore decided to evaluate the halo size with four different cross section
models: the DRAGON2, Webber and GALPROP parametrisations and the cross sections derived
in section 4.1. For each model, we have implemented a fit of the halo size using the available
data on the 10Be/9Be flux ratios, from the ACE [65], IMP [66, 67], ISEE [68], ISOMAX [69],
Ulysses [59] and Voyager [70] experiments. We have simulated different halo sizes from 1 kpc
to 16 kpc and, for each halo size, we have evaluated the 10Be/9Be flux ratios. As mentioned
above, in each of simulation (i.e. for every halo size value) the diffusion parameters have been"

Halo sizes summary
"Figure 9. Summary of the results obtained for the fits of halo sizes to the 10Be/9Be experimental data.
Also the values obtained with the derived cross sections are shown for having a broader comparison.
Error bars reflect only statistical uncertainties, as explained above. The dashed blue line represents
the mean value of the halo best fit values and the red band the uncertainties of the mean (1σ),
calculated as the mean of the halo best fit values ±σ."
"the other cross section models. This is due to the fact that, as can be seen from the curves in
Figure 8, a change in the value of H leads to changes in the flux ratios which become smaller
as H increases. Therefore, the smaller error bar found."
"We see that the derived cross sections cast a value of the halo size very similar to the
DRAGON2 and GALPROP predictions, of around 6.6 kpc (very similar to the value found in
refs. [39, 71], where the authors also employed the Be/B spectrum to make their predictions,
getting a value of ∼ 6 kpc and 5+3−2 kpc, respectively). The small value found for the Webber
parametrisations can be explained having a look to the cross sections around hundreds MeV.
For this parametrisation, the most important channels generally show a good agreement with
cross sections data, but in the case of the 12C→ 10Be channel, the discrepancy is considerable.
Therefore, from this underestimation of the cross section, the halo size prediction is expected
to be also underestimated (less 10Be production implies a lower halo size to reduce the fraction
of decaying 10Be nuclei)."
"In any case, the value obtained using the Webber parametrisations seems to be out of
the standard picture of a halo size between 3 and 10 kpc height found in measurements of
diffuse gamma-ray background [72] and with other radio observations [73–75]. The mean of
the best fit values obtained using the various cross sections shown in Fig. 9 (including the
determination of the halo size using the Webber parametrisation) is 5.6+0.86−0.85 kpc, and the
value obtained using only the most updated cross sections is 6.8± 1 kpc."
6 Conclusions
"We are living in a very exciting time for CR physics thanks to the high quality data provided
by the AMS-02 experiment, which allows making precise studies on the nature of CRs and
their propagation throughout the Galaxy. However, while the astrophysical information seems
to be accurate enough to face new physical challenges, the information about the spallation
cross section, which is the other key element in the CR puzzle, is still largely incomplete.
Since the study of secondary-over-primary CRs is the best tool to test the diffusion coefficient"
– 17 –
"parametrisations, we need to have high precision on the secondary CRs fluxes and in their
production (inclusive) cross sections."
"The amount of channels that matter in the spallation network and the difficulty to
perform the measurements lead to parametrisations that extend the energy range of the
actual measurements and expand to all important nuclei (even those for which experimental
data are missing). While we have some insight in the shape of cross sections as a function of
energy, the normalization is still somewhat uncertain."
"In this paper we have discussed different cross sections parametrisations and we have
investigated their direct impact in the fluxes of Li, Be and B. We have highlighted the
immediate relation of the secondary-over-secondary ratios with the spallation cross sections
used. We have shown that predictions from different cross sections models can differ in the
amount of Be and Li fluxes at a level from 20% to more than 40%. We also emphasize that the
uncertainties in the determination of secondary CR fluxes are in general quite large, although
those on the B flux seem to be remarkably smaller, since its production is essentially due
to the contribution of C and O channels for which more experimental data are available. In
addition, we have demonstrated the good performance achieved in the simulations when using
the default DRAGON2 cross sections model, being able to reproduce every observable within
very small errors."
"It has been shown that there is no need of invoking primary sources of secondary CRs,
as the cross sections uncertainties can largely account for the discrepancies found with respect
to data. To better show this, two models of cross sections have been considered as limiting
cases. These bracketing models represent minimum and maximum credible renormalizations
of the GALPROP model of cross sections, maintaining the same energy dependence. We
have investigated how the secondary-over-secondary flux ratios would behave under the
combination of the bracketing models to test whether, between these two limiting cases,
there is a space of cross sections that can reproduce all secondary CRs above 10 GeV/n at
the same time. A set of cross sections has been derived by matching these flux ratios at high
energy, demonstrating that they are an excellent tool to constrain and even adjust the cross
sections parametrisations. This derived cross sections model balances the deficiencies on the
description of those channels which are very poorly known and gives some insight on how
much our cross sections network is biased for every secondary species. We showed that, while
the B production channels should not be renormalized by more than 5% to reproduce the
ratios, the beryllium and lithium ones needed an overall renormalization of around 18% and
28% (in average), respectively."
"In this way we have been able to combine the information arising from secondary CRs
to mitigate the systematic uncertainties related to spallation cross sections. We argue that
this combined tuning of the normalization on a cross sections parametrisation to reproduce
the secondary-over-secondary flux ratios serves to improve the determination of the diffusion
coefficient parameters as well, and it is important to obtain predictions which are consistent
with all the observables at the same time."
"Finally, a study of the effects on the halo size on the secondary-over-secondary flux
ratios for each cross section model has been performed. In particular, the ratio 10Be/9Be
was studied for each of the models, as the 10Be isotope has a lifetime of the order of the
diffusion time of CRs in the Galaxy. This allowed the discussion on the repercussion of the
cross sections on the determination of the halo size too. The determination of the halo size
from the most updated parametrisations gives a mean value around 6.8 ± 1.0 kpc, which is
in agreement with most of the values obtained in other works."
– 18 –
"In a next work, the diffusion parameters will be studied in a combined analysis
of the secondary-over-primary and secondary-over-secondary flux ratios of B, Be and Li
including nuisance factors to allow adjustments on the normalization of the cross sections
parametrisations studied."

A Cross sections for the main channels"
"In this appendix we are showing a comparison between the different cross section models used
in the study and the experimental data in the most important reaction channels for the light
secondary CRs Li, B, Be. Experimental data are taken from various experiments and authors:
some can be found in EXFOR (Experimental Nuclear Reaction Data)7 others in the GALPROP
database of cross sections (isotope_cs.dat) and the rest come from various publications
and experiments (Bodemann1993, Davids1970, Fontes1977, Korejwo1999, Korejwo2002,
Moyle1979, Olson1983, Radin1979, Read1984, Roche1976, W90, W98a and Zeitlin2011). This
data is available upon request. More information about the references used can be found in
section 5 of ref. [14] and mainly in the appendix of ref. [57]."

C Theory on secondary-over-secondary flux ratios
"In this appendix, the basic theory about the secondary-over-secondary flux ratios is illustrated.
Here we demonstrate that they are mainly dependent on the cross sections of secondary CR
production and on the injection spectra used to describe primary CRs. Roughly speaking,
if one considers that the flux of a primary CR species at Earth is Jα ∝ qα × τprop(E) and
τprop(E) = H"

"Notice that the term E−δ is common in the summation terms and therefore is common in
numerator and denominator, cancelling out. With the equation C.1 one appreciates that these
ratios have direct dependence on the local spectrum of primary nuclei (α) and on the overall
spallation cross sections. Nonetheless, the local primary spectrum may have some dependence
on the diffusion parameters at low energies and reacceleration can slightly contribute. The
total repercussion of these parameters in the low energy region can be estimated to be at level
of 10%. Then, due to the presence of the radioactive 10Be, the most important contributor
to the low energy uncertainties is the halo size being able to introduce variations of more
than 10%, respectively. At the end, these ratios are mainly dependent on the source term
of CRs and on their spallation cross sections at high energies. The fact that these ratios do
not hold exactly for different diffusion parameters is caused by multi-step reactions, which
introduce more non-linearities difficult to predict. Despite this fact, as AMS-02 data for the"

local spectrum of primary CRs are highly precise, the largest uncertainty at high energy lies
on the spallation cross sections, and this is what makes them so suitable for adjusting the
overall cross sections with high precision (AMS-02 precision). The next figure shows the effect
of these changes on the Li/B ratio (since the importance of the halo size and gas profile is
negligible):"

than the usual uncertainties quoted in the best fits of these parameters [17, 46, 76]. The residuals are
shown with respect to the best fit model (orange line)."
"As we see, at 10 GeV/n the maximum difference between the predictions, when changing
the diffusion parameters as described, is around 4%, while at 30 GeV/n it goes down to
3% for variations of the diffusion parameters larger than the usual uncertainties related to
their determination. Nonetheless, the differences at high energy are mainly due to multi-step
reactions and the subtle differences in the primary fluxes because of the change in the amount
of secondary C (roughly 1/5 of its flux is secondary at low energies) and N (∼ 73% of it is
secondary at 10 GeV/n), which leads to sizeable changes in the secondary CRs."
