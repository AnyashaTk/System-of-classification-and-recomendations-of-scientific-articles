"Abstract The magnetic activity of the Sun directly impacts the Earth and human life. Like-
wise, other stars will have an impact on the habitability of planets orbiting these host stars.
Although the magnetic field at the surface of the Sun is reasonably well characterised by ob-
servations, the information on the magnetic field in the higher atmospheric layers is mainly
indirect. This lack of information hampers our progress in understanding solar magnetic ac-
tivity. Overcoming this limitation would allow us to address four paramount long-standing
questions: (1) How does the magnetic field couple the different layers of the atmosphere,
and how does it transport energy? (2) How does the magnetic field structure, drive and inter-
act with the plasma in the chromosphere and upper atmosphere? (3) How does the magnetic
field destabilise the outer solar atmosphere and thus affect the interplanetary environment?
(4) How do magnetic processes accelerate particles to high energies? New ground-breaking
observations are needed to address these science questions. We suggest a suite of three in-
struments that far exceed current capabilities in terms of spatial resolution, light-gathering
power, and polarimetric performance: (a) A large-aperture UV-to-IR telescope of the 1-3
m class aimed mainly to measure the magnetic field in the chromosphere by combining
high spatial resolution and high sensitivity. (b) An extreme-UV-to-IR coronagraph that is
designed to measure the large-scale magnetic field in the corona with an aperture of about
40 cm. (c) An extreme-UV imaging polarimeter based on a 30 cm telescope that combines
high throughput in the extreme UV with polarimetry to connect the magnetic measurements
of the other two instruments. Placed in a near-Earth orbit, the data downlink would be max-
imised, while a location at L4 or L5 would provide stereoscopic observations of the Sun
in combination with Earth-based observatories. This mission to measure the magnetic field
will finally unlock the driver of the dynamics in the outer solar atmosphere and thereby will
greatly advance our understanding of the Sun and the heliosphere."

1 Introduction
"The magnetic field plays a central role in many if not most of the processes we observe in
our universe. It governs complex plasma processes from the formation of structures in the
early universe to the interplanetary space that connects planets to their host stars. Although
we know the magnetic field at the solar surface reasonably well, our information on it in the
higher layers is mainly indirect. This state of knowledge is highly unsatisfactory because
the field carries most of the energy in these layers and is the dominant driver of most of the
phenomena that are observed there (e.g. heating of the gas to millions of degrees, coronal
shape and brightness, magnetic reconnection and its effects, and large-scale ejection of parts
of the solar atmosphere). The lack of direct measurements of coronal magnetic fields is
similar to being blind to the main driver of solar activity. We contend that this is one of the
major hindrances to our understanding of coronal physics. Obtaining these measurements
would help to explain a very wide variety of phenomena."

Magnetic Imaging of the Outer Solar Atmosphere (MImOSA) 3
"We can follow the interaction of the magnetic field and plasma on our central star in
detail and may essentially use the Sun as a laboratory for uncovering key magnetic and
plasma processes that act throughout the universe. In the coming decades, we expect that
answering the following overarching questions will lead to a giant leap in understanding the
Sun:"
"1. How does the magnetic field couple the different layers of the atmosphere, and how does
it transport energy?"
"2. How does the magnetic field structure, drive and interact with the plasma in the chro-
mosphere and upper atmosphere?"
"3. How does the magnetic field destabilise the outer solar atmosphere and thus affect the
interplanetary environment?"
4. How do magnetic processes accelerate particles to high energies?
"Answers to these questions will be relevant not only to solar research alone, but will af-
fect a broad range of current and upcoming topics in astrophysics. The Sun is a template for
other stars. This makes it a key to understanding the host stars of other planets and how these
host stars might affect the formation and evolution of life on their planets. For the reliable
detection of Earth-sized planets around other stars and in particular for their habitability,
we have to understand stellar variability. The magnetic field is also responsible for the UV
emission from planet-hosting stars, which is central for the chemistry in the planetary atmo-
sphere, for instance. If the magnetic field destabilises parts of the stellar atmosphere, which
results in the ejection of plasma and magnetic field into interplanetary space, this can also
strongly affect planets around the host star. Finally, high-energy particles generated by mag-
netic and plasma processes in the stellar atmosphere can have severe impacts on life. In the
case of the the solar system, this includes space technology."
"The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was launched in 1995 [25]. The inten-
sive research in the two decades since then has enabled us now to define the questions we
outlined above with high precision. Observational work together with progress in theoretical
understanding and numerical modelling shows clear paths to solving these questions in the
coming decades if the observational tools can be made adequately available."
"In this paper we describe the key measurements that give direct access to the magnetic
fields in the solar chromosphere and upper atmosphere. These measurements will have to
exceed what is currently available. This will enable us to address the overarching questions
when we combine it with the (simultaneous) measurements of the dynamic response of the
plasma to changes that are induced by the evolving magnetic field."
2 Overarching science questions
"The focus of this paper is on measuring the magnetic field in the outer solar atmosphere, i.e.
in the upper chromosphere, transition region, and corona. This information is currently not
directly available on a routine basis. Extrapolations together with extreme UV imaging can
give an instructive overview of the large-scale structure of the magnetic field in the outer so-
lar atmosphere, where the relevant physical processes occur (see Fig. 1). Our understanding
of the solar atmosphere is drastically limited by such indirect estimations of the magnetic
field, however. We have to rely on the theory of extrapolations of the magnetic field that is
measured in the photosphere, i.e. the visible surface of the Sun. These extrapolations have
to apply several assumptions, e.g. that the solar atmosphere is a vacuum or that the Lorentz
force is the only relevant force and that the inertia of the plasma is completely negligible."

An image of Earth to scale is overlaid at the bottom right corner. The image is processed using a Multi-Scale
Gaussian Normalization technique [60]. Data courtesy of NASA/SDO and AIA science team."
"Observations of the dynamic solar atmosphere clearly show that assumptions like this are
not appropriate. The actual measurement of the changing magnetic configuration is a key
part in solving the puzzle of how the magnetic field interacts with the plasma, in particular
when fast-changing processes are followed that are driven by magnetic reconnection, for
instance."
"With direct measurements of the magnetic field throughout the solar atmosphere, we will
be able to locate sites of transient energy release (through magnetic reconnection), analyse
the formation and disruption of current sheets where plasma is heated, study the transport
of energy through different modes of magnetohydrodynamic waves (or through energetic
particles), and investigate the helicity of erupting structures, all by unveiling how the mag-
netic field connects the different parts of the atmosphere. These measurements together will
provide us with an understanding of solar magnetic activity: how does the magnetic field
govern the energetic radiation from the Sun and how does it drive space weather effects?
These two questions have implications for Earth, and likewise for planets of other host stars."
"The polarisation of spectral lines encodes the information on the magnetic field of the
outer solar atmosphere (i.e. the chromosphere and beyond). This encoded information has
not been accessible to current space instruments. Sub-orbital rocket flights of about a few
minutes each have provided the only glimpse into this domain. Because the level of polari-
sation is generally low, the required noise level has to be as low as a few times 10−4 in terms
of the intensity for some polarimetric measurements. In order to achieve this signal-to-noise
ratio at high spatial resolution, the required instrumentation has to combine large aperture
and high throughput. This is as yet unavailable in space."
Magnetic Imaging of the Outer Solar Atmosphere (MImOSA) 5
"In the following we describe how the direct measurement of the magnetic field in the
outer solar atmosphere (from the upper chromosphere into the corona) will provide the cru-
cial information we need to answer the general four questions we listed above. We first
concentrate on the implications for solar research and then address how this will contribute
to a better understanding in other fields of astrophysics."
2.1 Interaction of magnetic field and plasma
"The interaction of magnetic field and plasma includes a diversity of processes that are cur-
rently poorly understood. Of particular interest are the role of the magnetic field in the
coupling of the different layers of solar and stellar atmospheres, and the conversion and
transport of energy. The most complex mixture of physics on the Sun is found in the chro-
mosphere. In a simple one-dimensional picture, this is the layer above the surface, where
the temperature starts to rise outwards. This layer is sandwiched between the photosphere,
where most photons originate, and the corona, where the temperature reaches several million
Kelvin."
"The chromosphere is a highly complex region. The magnetic field energy there is com-
parable to the internal energy of the gas. This causes an intense turbulent interaction between
the two, in particular when the velocities reach the sound speed. To add to the complexity,
the radiation processes and line formation are far away from local thermodynamic equi-
librium (LTE), and the ionisation is only partial. A model that describes this requires an
extended Ohm’s law and the consideration of multi-fluid effects."
"The hot part of the outer atmosphere, the corona, is magnetically rooted in the chromo-
sphere. To answer fundamental questions on the dynamics and energisation of the corona,
we have to understand how the magnetic field couples the corona to the chromosphere. This
is essential for describing the internal magnetic state of coronal loops. They are the basic
building blocks of the corona. Understanding the magnetic structure of coronal features on
the Sun is a stepping stone to the unsolved problem of the heating of hot plasma that is
observed throughout the universe."
"The large magnetic Reynolds numbers in the chromosphere and corona mean that we
can expect magnetic turbulence. The chromosphere and corona are additionally filled with
different wave modes that range from acoustic waves to Alfvén waves, including all mixed
forms. To unravel the magnetic effects on the plasma, we have to decompose these wave
modes into their respective parts and relate them to the (slower) build-up of currents that are
then dissipated to energise the plasma. The key for this is a continuous knowledge of the
magnetic field throughout the atmosphere. Only then can we understand the coupling and
the transport of energy by the magnetic field."
"New observations will have to provide reliable information on the magnetic structure of
the upper atmosphere that is not available today and will not be available in the coming years
with current instrumentation. We need direct access to the magnetic field through remote-
sensing observations to detect the magnetic current sheets that cover a range of spatial and
temporal scales [76]. In coronal loops as in chromospheric features, we see fine structure
down to the resolution limit of current instruments. Imaging and spectroscopic observations
indicate thin structures at scales down to 50 km [74]."
"The requirements on spatial resolution for magnetic structure measurements are slightly
more relaxed: the magnetic field starts to dominate the plasma in terms of (internal) energy
in the upper chromosphere (and beyond). Thus the spatial variations of the magnetic field
can be expected to be smaller than those of the plasma in responding to the magnetic driving."

"Fig. 2 Coupling from the photosphere to the corona. The right panel (b) shows 106 K hot plasma loops in
the corona in a small active region (150′′×150′′) seen by AIA/SDO. The left panel (a) shows the magnetic
field on the surface in the center part of the active region (50′′×50′′). Black and white are opposite magnetic
polarities. Small regions with opposite magnetic polarities are found at the footpoints of coronal loops, as
marked by circles. Based on [18]."
"To achieve magnetic field measurements, the light needs to be decomposed into its polari-
sation states. This increases the requirements on the noise level, i.e. the collected number of
photons. This means that a large aperture is also required for the magnetic measurements."
2.2 Magnetic coupling in the atmosphere
"To understand the magnetic activity of the Sun, we have to follow the magnetic connections
that channel the energy transport throughout the atmosphere. This is a multi-scale problem
because large-scale magnetic features, such as long coronal loops or helmet streamers, are
rooted in small magnetic patches in the low atmosphere. Recent observations demonstrated
the key role of small-scale magnetic patches in the photosphere for large coronal structures
[18], see Fig. 2. Even compact flaring loops show small-scale flux cancellation at their foot
points [17]. Only by tracing and quantifying the energy flux deep in the chromosphere can
we build a physical connection between the small-scale processes in the photosphere and
the large-scale coronal features. The prime requirement to achieve this is to measure the
magnetic field in all layers of the solar atmosphere in order to gain insight into the magnetic
coupling."
"Here we describe with one example how we investigate the magnetic coupling from
the chromosphere to the large-scale corona. High-resolution observations enable us to char-
acterise the magnetic field close to the limb. Very stable observing conditions such as are
found on a space-based platform are crucial for observations like this. For example, the mod-
est 50 cm telescope on Hinode was able measure the magnetic field up to heliocentric angles
of about 80◦, and the polar magnetic field could be characterised based on this [84]. With
higher resolution and sufficient sensitivity, an investigation even closer to the limb would be
possible and the magnetic field in the chromosphere could be measured. This could then be
directly connected to coronagraphic observations above the limb. When observations in the
extreme UV are added to this, structures can be followed continuously from the chromo-"

"sphere into the corona, i.e. from small to large scales. With this full magnetic field informa-
tion, magnetic disturbances such as Alfvénic perturbations could be traced, and the energy
flow from the chromosphere into the corona could be followed."
"Another prime target for the study of magnetic connectivity is the destabilisation of the
upper solar atmosphere (discussed in more detail in the next subsection). Magnetic structures
in the corona can become unstable in a very short time (compared to their overall lifetime)
and then erupt. The actual triggers of this process are still elusive. Only a full characterisation
of the connectivity of the magnetic field before the onset of the destabilisation can provide
the necessary information for understanding the magnetic configuration that later erupts.
Here again the coupling of the magnetic field across scales plays a significant role: at least
in some scenarios, small-scale processes cut the tethers of the magnetic field that holds the
magnetic structure down that later erupts [59]."
2.3 Destabilising the outer solar atmosphere
"During large disruptions of the upper solar atmosphere, huge amounts of magnetic energy
are converted into thermal energy and kinetic energy, and accelerate energetic particles.
The associated heating and acceleration processes through magnetic reconnection are still
poorly understood, and even the change in magnetic structures in the course of an eruption
is not well constrained. Extrapolations of the magnetic field from the surface are currently
used to constrain the change in free energy of the magnetic field. Before and during dy-
namic events, however, the assumptions that underlie these extrapolations break down. It is
therefore mandatory to actually measure the coronal magnetic field before, during, and after
the disruption to fully characterise this process. This destabilisation is the origin of coro-
nal mass ejections (CMEs). Once initiated, CMEs can dominate the inner heliosphere, and
stellar CMEs are likely to be a major influence on exoplanetary atmospheres."
"A CME expands when it lifts off. In this process, some CMEs reveal their complex in-
ternal structure (e.g. Fig. 3). Our current information is based on intensity images, therefore
no direct information on the magnetic field is available. Only direct measurements of the
magnetic field will allow us to distinguish between the very different physical mechanisms
that have been proposed for the initiation of CMEs [15]. This knowledge is needed not only
to strongly improve the predictability of CMEs and their space weather effects, but also
to predict what the CMEs on other stars could look like [e.g. 3, 6]. Coronagraphic direct
measurements of the magnetic field in the corona will close this gap in our knowledge."
"Many erupting features show a high degree of magnetic twist and writhe. Magnetic
helicity quantifies how elementary magnetic flux tubes are wound around each other in
a defined volume. In a closed system, magnetic helicity is almost conserved in resistive
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on timescales shorter than the global diffusion timescale
[57, 11]. Magnetic helicity can be used to quantitatively link flux ropes that are observed
in situ in the solar wind to their sources in the solar atmosphere. Magnetic helicity also
constrains the dynamical evolution of the ejected magnetic field in the solar wind [e.g. 20].
Determining the magnetic helicity carried by a CME requires measuring the magnetic field
and is therefore fundamental to understanding the evolution of CMEs."
"The magnetic field is reconfigured on large scales in the course of large-scale disrup-
tions. This magnetic reconfiguration requires that the connection to the small-scale mag-
netic features in the lower atmosphere changes as well. This is illustrated by the emergence
and submergence of magnetic flux on the solar surface and the tether-cutting mechanism for
CME eruption. Information on the magnetic field beyond what extrapolations can provide"

105 K (red) and 106 K (yellow) erupting into interplanetary space. The complex internal structure is either a
remnant of the precursor structure in the low corona or forms during the eruption. Direct measurements of the
magnetic field are essential to distinguish between these and other scenarios. Image credit: NASA’s GSFC
and SDO/AIA Team (https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180916.html)"
"is required to understand the physics of eruptions. Extrapolations of the magnetic field from
the surface level are currently used to investigate the change in free energy of the magnetic
field. However, as mentioned above, before and during dynamic events the assumptions of
these extrapolations break down, . and it is mandatory to directly measure the coronal mag-
netic field. This underlines the need for direct coronagraphic measurements of the magnetic
field during eruptions."
"The most spectacular events on the Sun are flares and CMEs. They govern the space
weather. During such events, particles are accelerated to high energies and can leave the
Sun. If they hit Earth, they cause a wide range of effects, including damage to satellites
and harm to astronauts. With an understanding of the magnetic processes before and during
the initiation of flares and CMEs, we will finally be able to understand the roots of space
weather."
2.4 High-energy processes in the atmosphere
"Particles are accelerated to high energies during flares and CMEs. Energetic processes are
not limited to large scales, however. They essentially occur on all scales, including those
we cannot currently resolve. For example, it has been proposed that particles are also ac-
celerated during unresolved energy release events (nanoflares), but we have only indirect
evidence for this [79]. These nanoflares are associated with magnetic reconnection. Measur-
ing the magnetic configuration and its change during such events will greatly advance our
understanding of the basic plasma physics process of reconnection and particle acceleration."
"Our diagnostics for reconnection in the upper solar atmosphere are currently restricted to
imaging the thermal response of the plasma that is associated with the heating during such
events, in particular through extreme-UV imaging [e.g. 78, 49]. The presence of current"
Magnetic Imaging of the Outer Solar Atmosphere (MImOSA) 9
"sheets is often indirectly derived from thin threads that are visible in extreme-UV images.
For a few cases, however, observations have revealed current sheets through direct measure-
ments of the magnetic field. They were all very low in the atmosphere [76, 44]."
"Measuring the change in the magnetic field in space and time around the reconnection
site is very important to understand the heating and particle acceleration at a reconnection
site. This alone gives access to the structure of the current sheets that form during the event
and to the location and manner in which particles are accelerated. Imaging observations in
the extreme UV and X-rays can show the changing structure of the magnetic field (assuming
that the emission indeed outlines the magnetic field). We can quantify how much magnetic
energy is converted into other forms of energy only through directly measuring the magnetic
field because some of that energy is in forms that are hard to detect (e.g. in the form of ener-
getic particles, or in small brightenings in the visible and IR wavelength ranges). Measuring
the magnetic field will therefore be essential to derive the energy that is available for particle
acceleration and for the generation of (hard) X-ray emission during the flare events."
2.5 Relation to other science fields
"The upper solar atmosphere is the source region of the radiation in the UV. This radiation
is of paramount importance for Earth’s atmosphere. It controls the chemistry and heating
in the stratosphere and in higher layers of the atmosphere of our home planet, and thereby
may significantly affect the long-term climate evolution. The extreme-UV radiation from
the corona is important for the upper atmosphere of Earth, and the near-UV radiation affects
the stratosphere. The near-UV originates from the solar photosphere and chromosphere. To
date, the relative variability in the UV radiation and its contribution to solar variability is
not fully understood, although it is clear that it is driven by magnetic field variations. When
we understand why the outer atmosphere becomes unstable, we can scientifically define
the ingredients of space weather, which through energetic particles and CMEs impacts the
terrestrial environment."
"The science proposed here is also relevant for host stars of other planets. Far more
violent disruptions than on the Sun have been observed in the outer atmospheres of other
stars. For example, super-flares have been found on sun-like stars [e.g. 71, 54]. The energy
released by these flares exceeds the energy released by the largest flares on our Sun by 1000
times. Stars that are more active than the Sun can produce CMEs that then propagate into
the astrosphere of the star [e.g. 6]. It is clear that this will affect the exoplanets of these stars
in terms of their (magnetic) environment and possible habitability."
"Understanding the magnetic processes in the outer solar atmosphere will also greatly
enhance our understanding of accretion disc coronae and winds. We can expect the same
processes to operate in these magnetically dominated environments as in the solar corona.
As in many other cases, the Sun can serve here as a template and laboratory for other astro-
physical objects."
"The science we propose will also contribute to basic space plasma physics (e.g. current
sheets, reconnection, and instabilities). By imaging the magnetic field in the outer solar at-
mosphere, we can characterise the large- and small-scale structure. This is otherwise only
possible through in situ measurements in planetary magnetospheres (and possibly the he-
liosphere) with large swarms of probes. We can study the cross-scale coupling through one
single solar observatory as proposed here."
10 H. Peter et al.
3 Measuring magnetic fields by remote-sensing methods
"Almost all the information on the magnetic field is contained in the polarisation profiles of
solar spectral lines. In other words, it is contained in the wavelength variation of the Stokes
parameters Q and U (which quantify the linear polarisation) and of the Stokes parameter
V (which quantifies the circular polarisation). Together with the Stokes parameter I (i.e.
the intensity), these Stokes parameters fully characterise any beam of electromagnetic ra-
diation. In order to carry out quantitative investigations of the magnetic fields in the solar
atmosphere, we therefore require telescopes that are equipped with instruments capable of
measuring the four Stokes parameters in suitable lines of the solar electromagnetic spec-
trum. The relevant physical mechanisms that produce polarisation in solar spectral lines are
described next."
3.1 The Zeeman effect
"In the presence of a magnetic field, the spectral lines split into various components with
specific polarisation properties that depend on the angle between the line of sight and the
magnetic field vector. While the circular polarisation signal (caused by the longitudinal com-
ponent of the magnetic field) scales with the ratio R between the Zeeman splitting and the
Doppler width, the linear polarisation signal (caused by the transverse component of the
magnetic field) scales as R2. The Zeeman effect is therefore more prominent in circular po-
larisation than in linear polarisation. Moreover, because R increases with the spectral line
wavelength, the Zeeman effect is much more effective in the IR than in the UV. This makes
it a valuable tool for coronagraphic observations above the limb in IR lines of highly ionised
species, such as Fe XIII at 1074 nm [52]. The circular polarisation can also be measured
in some UV lines from the upper solar chromosphere. This has been demonstrated by the
CLASP-2 suborbital rocket experiment. With a telescope with an aperture of only 27 cm, it
could measure the circular polarisation produced by the Zeeman effect in the Mg II h & k
resonance lines in a plage region."
3.2 Linear polarisation by scattering processes
"The scattering of anisotropic radiation produces linear polarisation in a multitude of solar
spectral lines, without the need of any magnetic field. This especially occurs in many of
the spectral lines that originate in the outer solar atmosphere, where the anisotropy of the
radiation field coming from the underlying solar disc is higher than in the photosphere. The
physical origin of this resonance-line polarisation lies in the fact that the radiative transitions
induced by the incident anisotropic radiation produces atomic level polarisation, that is,
population imbalances and quantum coherence among the magnetic sublevels of degenerate
atomic energy levels. This in turn produces polarisation in the radiation that is re-emitted in
the scattering process."
3.3 The Hanle effect
"The atomic level polarisation is induced by radiation. This polarisation is modified through
the magnetic field; this is called the Hanle effect. Therefore, the Hanle effect also modi-
fies the linear polarisation that is produced by the scattering of anisotropic radiation. For"

of the magnetic field from the surface (at one solar radius) out into the corona. Large spatial variations are
expected. Compiled from different sources [based on 63]."
"the Hanle effect, the degeneracy of the levels is lifted in the presence of a magnetic field,
and the radiation-induced atomic polarisation is modified. The characteristic magnetic field
dependence of the linear polarisation of the scattered spectral line radiation that is caused
thereby is suitable for exploring the outer solar atmosphere. Importantly, the Hanle effect is
sensitive even for magnetic fields that are tangled at sub-resolution scales [e.g. 82]."
"There is a critical magnetic field strength (BH ) for the onset of the Hanle effect. This
is independent of the plasma temperature and of the wavelength of the considered spectral
line. Typically, measurements through the Hanle effect are sensitive in a range of 0.1BH to
10BH of the critical value. For magnetic fields that are significantly above the critical value
B>10BH , the line is saturated. Then the linear polarisation of the emerging spectral line
radiation is sensitive only to the orientation of the magnetic field. The expected magnetic
field in the source region of the observation thus determines the choice of lines with different
critical strengths BH ."
"The magnetic field on the Sun drops dramatically from the surface to the outer atmo-
sphere. The field at the surface reaches several 1000 G, in the chromosphere we expect a
few 100 G, and the field in the corona drops to 1 G and below (see Fig. 4). The Ly-α line of
H I at 121 nm is ideally suited for diagnostics of the chromosphere on the disc and for coro-
nagraphic observations of the corona above the limb. Its critical Hanle value is BH = 53 G.
The Mg II line at 280 nm (BH = 22 G) is also well suited, but it is only visible on the disc.
The critical values of IR lines for coronagraphic observations (e.g. Fe XIII at 1075 nm) are
well below 1 G. This means that they will be in saturation and can only provide the field
orientation. Extreme UV permitted lines for off-limb and on-disk observations (e.g. Fe X
at 17.4 nm) will only provide information on the field orientation (apart from the electron
density) because their critical magnetic field for the onset of the Hanle effect is much larger
than the magnetic strength expected for the solar coronal plasma [55]."
3.4 Magneto-optical effects in strong resonance lines
"In strong resonance lines such as H I Ly-α and Mg II h & k, the joint action of quantum
interference between the sub-levels pertaining to the upper J levels of these lines and the"
12 H. Peter et al.
"correlation effects between the incoming and outgoing photons in the scattering events (par-
tial frequency redistribution) produce very strong Q/I signals in the wings of these lines
[see 9, 10]."
"Without the need of any magnetic field the value of Q/I can be very large in the wings
of strong resonance lines. The magneto-optical terms of the Stokes-vector transfer equation
then introduce magnetic sensitivity in the wings of Q/I and U/I. This happens already for
magnetic fields with strengths similar to those needed for the onset of the Hanle effect.
Such magneto-optical effects are expected to produce measurable magnetic sensitivity in
the wings of the Mg II h & k lines [1, 24] and in the wings of the H I Ly-α line [2]."
"To summarise, the polarisation signals in UV and IR spectral lines are sensitive to the
presence of magnetic fields throughout the whole outer atmosphere. The Hanle effect is
sensitive to the (weak) magnetic fields expected for the upper chromosphere and transition
region because it operates at the line centre where the opacity is high. The magneto-optical
effects that operate in the wings of strong resonance lines are sensitive to the presence of
similarly weak magnetic fields in the underlying chromospheric and photospheric layers
because the opacity in the line wings is lower. The circular polarisation produced by the
Zeeman effect in some UV lines (e.g. Mg II at 280 nm) is sensitive to the longitudinal com-
ponent of the magnetic field in the solar chromosphere. The linear polarisation produced by
scattering in UV lines has been successfully exploited to investigate the solar coronal mag-
netic field [e.g. 66, 65]. From the upper chromosphere and transition region into the corona,
the two sub-orbital rocket flights of CLASP obtained and exploited spectropolarimetric data
in the Ly-α line at 121 nm [37, 83] and Mg II near 280 nm. In permitted (electric dipole) UV
lines and in forbidden (magnetic dipole) IR lines, measurements of the polarisation produced
by atoms in the solar coronal plasma can probe the magnetism of solar coronal structures,
and the solar wind velocity [e.g. 14, 81]."
"When spectropolarimetric measurements in the UV are complemented by IR observa-
tions, new discoveries in solar and stellar physics are facilitated: through the Hanle and
Zeeman effects, the He I triplet at 1083 nm is sensitive to the magnetic field of plasma struc-
tures in the chromosphere and corona. UV lines such as Ly-α at 121 nm and the resonance
and subordinate lines of Mg II (all around 280 nm) are suitable for probing the upper chro-
mosphere."
"A space telescope that is equipped with instruments that are designed to measure the
four Stokes parameters in suitably chosen UV and IR spectral lines will be able to achieve a
true revolution in our empirical understanding of solar magnetism."
4 Integral role of realistic atmospheric models
"The polarisation measurements need to be inverted to derive the magnetic field from ob-
servations. More than a century ago, magnetic fields on the Sun were discovered through
the Zeeman splitting of spectral lines in the strong magnetic field of a sunspot [33]. This
was possible even without analysing the polarisation state of the light. When the geometry
of the magnetic field or the thermal structure of the atmosphere is more complex, the full
information of the polarisation has to be taken into account to reconstruct the full 3D vector
of the magnetic field, i.e. its strength and direction. Not only the Zeeman effect, but also the
Hanle effect has to be considered for the weaker magnetic fields in the outer atmosphere.
This requires an inversion of the observed polarisation data."
"Several inversion codes are available for the chromosphere that include the Zeeman ef-
fect [73, 21]. In the next few years, they will be extended to also cover the Hanle effect, so"
Magnetic Imaging of the Outer Solar Atmosphere (MImOSA) 13
"that all available types of data can then in principle be invertible. Initially, these inversions
will be made in 1D, but will include non-LTE effects (i.e. departures from local thermody-
namic equilibrium). Ultimately, 3D versions will be required, and first steps in this direc-
tion have been taken. Inversion codes have been developed and implemented that take into
account the coupling of neighbouring pixels in the observation [85, 86]. This coupling is
introduced by the point spread function of the instrument."
"A very important role will be played by realistic models of the outer solar atmosphere.
Here a numerical simulation that includes all relevant physical processes provides the evo-
lution of the plasma and the magnetic field in a 3D volume. A forward-modelling code is
then used to calculate the emission, including the state of polarisation, from the simulation
results (see Fig. 5 for an example). The numerical simulations are currently mostly run by
solving the 3D MHD equations (with extensions). Examples are MURaM [67] and Bifrost
[12], both including the radiative transfer problem, or Pencil that allows to model a data-
driven corona [89]. Several 3D non-LTE codes also exist for the forward modelling of the
radiation in spectral lines, e.g. Multi-3D [45] for the intensity and PORTA [87] for all Stokes
parameters. This shows that the basic tools are available even now so that numerical models
can be used to evaluate and improve inversion techniques with which the magnetic field can
be derived from observations."
"Numerical simulations of the outer solar atmosphere are computationally demanding.
They can be included in inversions of spectropolarimetric observations within a few years,
however, and first steps have already been taken [69]. For example, forward-modelling cal-
culations today provide an essential reference to identify and distinguish the impact of vari-
ous physical processes that affect scattering polarisation. This approach is necessarily model
dependent, but the availability of increasingly realistic MHD simulations make it the most
reliable approach to infer information about the magnetism of the outer solar atmosphere."
"Realistic atmospheric models allow us to investigate the parameter space of possible
polarisation signals and thus can show new paths for interpreting the data. In the recent
IRIS mission [22], for instance, numerical models have been an integral part of the data
analysis. By exploring the spectral line profiles that were found in the forward models, the
profiles could be classified and were used to derive physical quantities from features in the
Mg II h and k line profiles [e.g. 61]. Future realistic 3D models will play the same role
for interpreting polarisation data from the outer solar atmosphere. Models like this will in
particular be essential for understanding how the different spectral lines form in different
regions (heights) of the outer atmosphere and how the different lines can be best combined
for a reliable inversion of the magnetic field."
"We proceed with a brief overview of models for the chromosphere and (large-scale)
corona. We also consider future developments."
4.1 Chromospheric models
"Simulations of the solar chromosphere require challenging theory: the energy densities of
magnetic field, plasma, and waves are all of a similar magnitude, which provides a wealth
of dynamics. Radiation cannot be treated as optically thin as in the case of the corona, nor
can the atoms be assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) as in the photo-
sphere. The gas in the chromosphere is dynamic and only partially ionised, so that additional
effects have to be taken into account, such as ambipolar diffusion and time-dependent partial
ionisation."
14 H. Peter et al.
"Fig. 5 Snapshot from a data-driven 3D MHD model of an active region. The model uses the evolving ob-
served photospheric magnetic field to drive the evolution of the solar atmosphere from the photosphere all
the way into the corona. The left panel shows the vertical magnetic field in the photosphere (in the range
of ±500 G) and the right panel the coronal emission as it would be observed by the 171 Å channel of AIA
showing ca. 106 K hot plasma when looking from straight above, i.e. close to disk center. The panels show a
375×300 Mm2 part of the computational domain. The model captures the large-scale structure of the corona
above the modelled active region (AR 12139 from 16. Aug. 2014) quite well. Based on [89]."
"The past decade saw a very fast evolution of chromosphere modelling, and different
models can now account for a range of the required physics, including non-equilibrium
populations [46, 30], non-LTE radiation transfer [13], two-fluid MHD [64], and non-ideal
MHD [56, 38]. With further progress at this pace, we can expect to have reasonably realistic
3D numerical experiments of the solar chromosphere in another decade. In other words, the
required models will be available when they are needed to develop and evaluate improved
inversions to retrieve the chromospheric magnetic field."
4.2 Coronal models
"Numerical models for the large-scale corona potentially involve fewer physical processes
than are required in the chromosphere. The coupling across scales and the loss of collisional
coupling between particles adds to the problem, however. The former requires high spatial
resolution or adaptive grids, the latter means that kinetic models or particle-in-cell simula-
tions are necessary. These effects have been considered, but are still far from being realistic
in the sense of reproducing actual coronal structures. Still, significant progress has been
achieved, e.g. in modelling the dynamics of flares [16]."
"Another complication in the large-scale corona is the integration along the line of sight
of the optically thin emission that prevents simple direct inversions of the magnetic field
[41, 40]. Recent forward models show paths to interpreting coronagraphic measurements
by minimising the difference between synthesised coronal observables and real coronal data
[e.g. 19]. In the same way as for the chromospheric models, we can expect (global) coronal
models to be ready within a decade to assist in the inversion of the polarimetric measure-
ments of the global corona."
Magnetic Imaging of the Outer Solar Atmosphere (MImOSA) 15
4.3 Outlook
"When realistic 3D models of the chromosphere and the corona become available, the assim-
ilation of data into the models will be a powerful tool to better understand the structure of
the outer solar atmosphere and its evolution. The experience of data assimilation in weather
forecasting shows the enormous potential of this technique. Continuously assimilating the
acquired data into the model provides a way to iterate from the measured polarisation maps
towards a correct solution of the magnetic field structure and its evolution. These are ensem-
ble models, therefore the computations require two orders of magnitude more computational
power than current models. With more efficient codes and the expected progress of compu-
tational resources in the next decade, however, this will become feasible. This would then
provide an advanced tool for analysing the polarimetric measurements of the outer solar
atmosphere."
"5 Scientific requirements for measuring the magnetic field in the upper solar
atmosphere"
5.1 Limitations in current approaches
"Measurements of the magnetic field at the surface of the Sun (the photosphere) are currently
routinely performed at high spatial resolution in smaller regions, and with moderate res-
olution when they cover the whole Sun. This is achieved by remote-sensing observations,
mainly through the Zeeman effect (see Sect. 3). However, the magnetic field at only about
1000 km above the surface dominates the gas in terms of energy, i.e. plasma-β becomes
smaller than unity. To understand how the magnetic field governs solar activity above the
surface (in the chromosphere and corona), we require reliable and routine measurements
there as well."
"To estimate the magnetic field in the outer solar atmosphere, we currently mostly have
to take recourse to extrapolations of the magnetic field based on observations of the solar
surface. While this has reached a considerable degree of sophistication, these methods are
not satisfactory because there are limitations in principle [e.g. 23]. Also, it is not possible to
capture the temporal evolution of dynamic phenomena from the chromosphere to the atmo-
sphere at large with extrapolation methods that assume a static or stationary situation. This
prevents further progress in solar atmospheric research because the magnetic field structures
and drives the dynamics in the solar atmosphere, from the chromosphere to the outer corona.
Therefore we need direct observations of the magnetic field not only in the photosphere, but
throughout the whole outer solar atmosphere."
"With the instrumentation we have so far, attempts to measure the magnetic field in the
corona have been more a proof of concept than regular observations. The first of such ob-
servations above the limb using a coronagraphic technique in the IR had very low spatial
resolution and required very long exposure times [52, 51]. While the field progressed, ob-
servations are still sparse and limited to a few sample structures on the Sun. For example, a
post-flare-loop system above the limb has recently been observed in some detail in the IR
[42] and in radio wavelengths [29]. This gave consistent results."
"Observations of the magnetic field in the chromosphere have been obtained in a more
regular fashion, but are mostly limited to the diagnostics in the lines of He I at 1083 nm and
the triplet of Ca II around 854 nm. Observations in these lines are limited in that they do
not provide information on the upper chromosphere, where the magnetic field energetically"
16 H. Peter et al.
"dominates the plasma. Observations in the UV part of the spectrum are required to reach the
upper chromosphere and even higher layers."
"Previous observations on sub-orbital rockets showed the potential of the polarisation
that is measured in the UV in Ly-α and Mg II for the magnetic field measurements in the
chromosphere (see Sect. 3). Polarisation measurements have also been performed for C IV
by UVSP on SMM from space [34, 32] for the hotter layer of the transition region to the
corona. The short rocket observation in Ly-α and Mg II only provided a glimpse of polar-
isation measurements in the UV, however, and the existing measurements in C IV are not
reliable [53]."
"Upcoming and planned space-based solar observatories will not provide polarimetric
information in the UV. They will therefore not provide measurements of the magnetic field
in the uppermost layers of the chromosphere. We propose to close this observational gap in
this paper."
5.2 Scientific requirements
"To measure the magnetic field in the upper atmosphere, we distinguish (a) measurements in
front of the solar disc and (b) measurements above the limb. Observations on the disc will
give access to the small-scale structures in the chromosphere that form the base of the outer
atmosphere and thereby shape the magnetic connection throughout the whole atmosphere
(see Sect. 5.2.1). The off-disc measurements will provide information on the large-scale
structure of the magnetic field, giving a view of the corona similar to what is seen during
a solar eclipse (see Sect. 5.2.2). Finally, the small-scale chromospheric features have to be
connected to the global corona, for which observations in the extreme UV are crucial be-
cause they can also give access to coronal structures when observations are made on the
solar disc (see Sect. 5.2.3). To describe the respective requirements, we restrict the discus-
sion to one example for each case. More than one process that constrains each requirement
in most cases. The scientific requirements for the respective observations are summarised in
Table 1."
5.2.1 Magnetic field in the chromosphere
"The chromosphere is a highly structured and very dynamic part of the solar atmosphere.
Current 1m class ground-based and balloon-borne solar telescopes show features down to
scales smaller than 100 km. The Sunrise telescope, for example, revealed fibrils (Fig. 6) with
widths ranging from 100 to 270 km [28]. These fibrils are generally thought to map the mag-
netic field [35] and are heated when magnetic flux emerges [47]. Current instruments do not
allow us to directly measure the magnetic field in these fibrils, and similar conclusions apply
to other key chromospheric features. This leads to the requirement for an angular resolution
of 0.1′′ for chromospheric magnetic measurements, which corresponds to about 70 km. Only
by achieving this resolution will we be able to reveal the formation and evolution physics of
these chromospheric structures."
"The required temporal resolution is closely linked to the spatial resolution. Essentially,
the time resolution should be equivalent to the time it takes for a perturbation to cross the
resolution element. The relevant speed for magnetic changes is the Alfvén velocity, which
is of the order of 10 to 100 km/s in the chromosphere. Consequently, the observations have
to allow for a temporal resolution of about 1 s."

(d) Visible light (polarised brightness), broad-band observation in the visible.
(e) Faster cadence for imaging-only mode, slower cadence for polarimetric observations."
"Because of the cross-scale coupling, the field of view of the chromospheric observations
has to encompass a whole active region on the Sun. This applies to the observations of the
chromosphere for its own sake and for the magnetic connection through the atmospheric
layers. For example, magnetic flux often emerges and cancels on small scales [18], but it
might still govern the formation and evolution of hot structures in the core of an active region
[17]. The required field of view is therefore 300′′×300′′ to fully cover an active region. This
corresponds to 3% of the visible solar disc."
"The spectral resolution for spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric observations is set by
the expected velocity (dispersion) seen in the spectral lines and by the need to resolve the
polarisation signals, which are often narrower than the intensity profiles of the spectral
lines. The expected velocities in the chromosphere are of the order of 1 km/s and higher,
as we know from existing spectroscopic observations. A spectral resolution corresponding
to 10 km/s is sufficient to determine the shift of an optically thin line (through centroiding).
This corresponds to a spectral resolving power λ/∆λ of 30 000. To resolve features in op-
tically thick chromospheric lines, such as self-absorption in Mg II, an equivalent spectral
resolution is required, as we know from observations with IRIS [22]."
"Line selection is a fundamental question for a spectropolarimetric instrument. Chromo-
spheric lines investigated from the ground for magnetic measurements are mostly from Ca II
and He I. The IR triplet of Ca II 854 nm has been used for quiet Sun and active regions [e.g.
70], while no robust routine observations have been possible in the H and K lines of Ca II
so far. The He I line at 1083 nm has been widely used for magnetic diagnostics [e.g. 76],
even though it is mostly limited to active regions. The He I D3 line at 588 nm has also re-
cently been evaluated during a flare [50]. To interpret the observations, it is important to
perform multi-line inversions. This has been amply demonstrated for photospheric observa-
tions [68]. To apply such techniques to the chromosphere, two of the most prominent and
important lines must be added to the observations set: the Ly-α line of H I at 121 nm and the
Mg II h and k lines near 280 nm. These two lines have proven their potential during rocket
flights of the CLASP instrument (see Sect. 3) and are well studied theoretically. A line from"

"Fig. 6 Fibrils seen in the solar chromosphere in Ca II K. The field of view is only 34′′×14′′ and thus tiny
compared to the solar diameter of about 0.5◦ [based on 35]."
"the transition region into the corona, such as C IV near 155 nm, would also add valuable
information on the connection of the chromosphere to the corona [e.g. 62]. To maximise
the scientific return of the multi-line inversions, the observations must also include visible
and IR lines from the chromosphere, e.g. of Ca II, He I, and visible lines from the photo-
sphere. A gap-less coverage of the atmosphere is possible only then. This is necessary to
fully characterise the magnetic field in the chromosphere."
"Fluctuations of the polarization signal have to be measured with a polarimetric signal-
to-noise ratio of 3×103 to exploit the Hanle and magneto-optical effects in Ly-α and Mg II.
This is based on experience with the CLASP experiment [37] and consistent with theoretical
predictions [e.g. 88]."
5.2.2 Global magnetic field in the corona
"The structures in the global corona are dominated by the streamer structures, coronal holes,
cavities, and, if present, CMEs and their precursors. The main factor in measuring the mag-
netic field in the global corona is the field of view of the coronagraphic instrument. From the
ground (except for rare eclipses) this is rather limited because the light that is scattered in
the Earth’s atmosphere limits the distance from the Sun at which coronagraphic observations
can be carried out. For current ground-based coronagraphs this is less than 0.5 solar radii
(R�) above the limb [COMP, 80]. Most of the large-scale coronal features extend farther out,
however. A larger and more adequate field of view for a coronagraph can only be achieved
by a space-based instrument. The current sheets at the top of the streamers typically start
at below 1 to 2 R� above the limb. The initial acceleration of a CME is also essentially
achieved at these heights. The inner edge of the field of view should cover the low-lying
concentrated current-carrying systems from coronal cavities and active regions. These are
usually found within the first one or two pressure scale heights, the latter being about one
tenth of the solar radius (for a corona at about 1 MK). Consequently, the field of view should
cover 1.1 – 3 R� from disc centre."
"The requirements for spatial resolution are not as strict for the global corona as they are
for the chromospheric observations. The magnetic field expands towards the outer corona,
so that the spatial scales in the outer parts are much larger than near the chromosphere. In
the photosphere magnetic concentrations with a diameter of a few 100 km have magnetic
field strengths of more than 1 kG [43]. Coronal loops with lengths of 100 Mm have field"

"strengths of still more than 5 to 10 G [51]. A 100 Mm long semi-circular loop will reach
only 30 Mm height, which is less than 0.05 R�. In the field of view of the coronagraph
we therefore expect no more than 1 G to a few 10 G [36]. Conservation of magnetic flux
implies that a photospheric flux tube with a diameter of 200 km would then expand to a
cross section of some 2 to 6 Mm, corresponding to up to 8′′. A spatial resolution of about 10′′"
"might be sufficient to characterise the magnetic field in these elementary flux tubes, but finer
threads will be seen in emission, even though the magnetic field structure is significantly
smoother. This is well known for structures in the lower atmosphere and is found in models
[e.g. 62]. The spatial resolution to be achieved in the intensity mapping should therefore
be higher. Thin threads seen in eclipse observations, for instance, show that a resolution
of at least 2′′ is required. In addition, recent imaging observations have revealed plasmoids
of ∼2′′ that form and coalesce into larger plasmoids that expand into a CME bubble [31].
Investigating the dynamics of these plasmoids using coronagraphic observations up to 3 R�
will provide inestimable information on the initial acceleration of CMEs. Combining this,
the coronagraphic observations have to provide an angular resolution of 2 to 10′′, depending
on whether the observations are in intensity only, or if they are used to measure the state of
polarisation to derive the magnetic field."
"The cadence for the coronagraphic observations is governed by dynamic phenomena. A
CME can reach 1000 km/s or even more when it is accelerated from the low corona to about
1 to 2 R� above the limb. Such a transient can cross the field of view of the coronagraph
in about 600 s. In order to capture the acceleration phase, the observational cadence for"
20 H. Peter et al.
"the magnetic field measurements should be at least 100 s. The intensity-only observations
should be acquired faster, so that we can follow the disturbances that cross the resolution
element. This means that the temporal resolution should be in the range of 5 to 100 s, again
depending on the observation mode."
"To derive the magnetic field in coronagraphic observations, ground-based observations
have shown the high potential of IR lines such as Fe XIII near 1075 nm. He I at 1083 nm is
also sensitive to the weak coronal magnetic field [58]. When the Hanle effect is used, UV
lines have very high potential, in particular Ly-α . So far, they have been used successfully
with SOHO/UVCS [39], but without the polarisation capability required to derive the coro-
nal magnetic field. Density information crucial for interpreting the extreme-UV data, which
calls for the additional capability of polarised brightness observations in the visible light, VL
(pB). A coronagraph should therefore cover a wide range of wavelengths from the extreme
UV to the IR."
"The required spectral resolution (or bandwidth) of the instruments can be estimated
based on current instruments for coronagraphic observations in the UV [METIS; 5] and IR
[COMP; 80]. These give an requirement for the bandwidth of the narrow-band imaging of
5 nm in the UV and of 0.1 nm in the IR. A signal-to-noise ratio of 100 is required to measure
the coronal magnetic field in the UV [27, 26] and IR."
5.2.3 Connecting local and global
"Observations at medium resolution are required to understand the cross-scale coupling be-
tween the small-scale features of the chromosphere to the large-scale magnetic features.
These observations also have to show the corona in front of the solar disc in order to con-
nect them to the on-disc chromospheric observations. This can be achieved by imaging in
the extreme UV. Because the (black-body) radiation from the surface is negligible in the
extreme UV, these images will show the corona in front of the disc and above the limb.
One example would be on-disc observations that are performed near the limb. The chromo-
spheric observations (Sect. 5.2.1) would then show the roots of the global coronal magnetic
structure (Sect. 5.2.2), and an extreme-UV observation would show the essential connection
between the two (see Fig. 7)."
"Coronal observations in the extreme UV are routinely performed by AIA on SDO [48].
SWAP on Proba 2 showed that imaging in the extreme UV can also record the corona out
to 2 R� [72]. To ensure sufficient overlap with the coronagraphic observations (Sect. 5.2.2),
the imaging in the extreme UV should cover the corona across the whole disc out to 1.5 R�
(see Fig. 8). This corresponds to a field of view of 0.8◦×0.8◦."
"Coronal features seen in the extreme UV have a distribution of widths, with a peak
around 550 km and a tail to broader features [7]. A spatial resolution of 1′′ should therefore
be achieved; this is slightly better than that of AIA."
"With the same arguments as above, the cadence of the observations should reach 3 s to
follow changes in intensity. Polarimetric observations of the magnetic field can have a lower
cadence of 60 s because the magnetic field evolves slower than the thermal properties of the
corona. The temporal resolution therefore must be in the range of 3 to 60 s."
"A very good choice for the observations is the coronal line of Fe X at 17.4 nm. To isolate
the line, the width of the band has to be 0.35 nm. The emission from this ion shows high
contrast in coronal structures, as is well know from AIA and SWAP. Because the line lies
in the saturated Hanle regime, it will allow determining the direction of the magnetic field
through an analysis of the linear polarisation. Based on an earlier study, the required signal-
to-noise ration is 103 [63]."

"5.3 Instrumentation required to perform measurements of the magnetic field in the upper
atmosphere"
"The two quite distinct measurements requirements are to record the small-scale magnetic
fields that are observed in the chromosphere and the large-scale magnetic field in the solar
corona. They necessitate quite different techniques: the former needs observations on the
disc at high resolution, and the latter coronagraphic observations by occulting the solar disc.
These tasks require two separate instruments. A third instrument is needed to connect the
measurements of these first two instruments. More details and a possible mission scenario
are discussed in Sect. 6."
"1) UV-to-IR telescope with a large aperture. A UV-to-IR telescope with an aperture
of about 3 m is required to achieve the necessary signal-to-noise ratios to derive the magnetic
field in the solar chromosphere from the polarisation measurements. The required spectral
lines in the UV can be recorded only in space, and only the stable space environment will
allow the high-performance observations required in the IR. Equally important, the high
spatial resolution over a large field of view is only possible from a space-based platform that
is not affected by the Earth’s atmosphere."
"2) Extreme UV-to-IR coronagraph. A coronagraph is required to study the large-scale
magnetic field out to 3 R� from disc centre. The large field of view can only be achieved from"
22 H. Peter et al.
"space, even for observations in the IR. UV observations in Ly-α provide high sensitivity to
the magnetic field by use of the Hanle effect. An aperture of 40 cm is required to achieve the
necessary signal-to-noise ratio."
"3) Extreme UV imaging polarimeter. An instrument is required to observe the corona
in front of the disc and above the limb to connect the observations of the other two instru-
ments. This requires an aperture of about 30 cm to achieve the signal-to-noise ratio that is
necessary to also derive the magnetic field direction from polarimetric observations."
6 Mission scenario for measuring magnetic fields throughout the solar atmosphere
"One notable constraint for a possible mission scenario is the size of the telescope for chro-
mospheric observations. Our considerations in Sects. 6.1 and 6.4 will show that this should
have an aperture of 1 to 3 m, which means that this instrument would dominate the configura-
tion of the space observatory. Because of its size, it will have to be part of the spacecraft and
thus be under ESA responsibility. Post-focus instrumentation such as a spectropolarimeter
and an imager can then be considered as payload provided by institutions throughout ESA
member states. The other two telescopes, the coronagraph and the EUV polarimetric imager
(Sects. 6.2 and 6.3), can be mounted on the sides of the main telescope. This ensures that
the coronagraph aperture has an unobstructed view over 2π steradians to fulfil the stringent
stray-light requirements of this instrument."
"We assume that a near-Earth orbit would be adequate for such a mission, even though
a position at L1 would provide a continuous coverage of the Sun and a very stable en-
vironment. Observations from L4 or L5 would provide the highly interesting possibility
of conducting coordinated observations with Earth-based facilities: viewing the Sun at the
same time from two different angles would enable stereoscopic observations. Determining
the orbit that is best suited for the mission will require a careful trade-off study based on the
available technology in data transmission, spacecraft pointing stability, thermal environment
control, and science goals."
"In Sects. 6.1 to 6.3 we provide details of straw-man instruments (cf. Sect. 5.3). In Sect. 6.4
we discuss options for a possible M-class mission scenario."
6.1 Measuring the magnetic field in the chromosphere
"The primary requirement for spectropolarimetric observations is the signal-to-noise ratio
at the spatial and temporal scales to be resolved. Following the arguments presented in
the previous sections, true advances in the study of the magnetic field throughout the solar
chromosphere will be obtained with spectropolarimetric measurements in the key lines Mg h
& k near 280 nm and Ly-α at 121 nm at spatial scales of the order of 0.1′′ (about 70 km)
and temporal scales of the order 1 to10 s. Accurate measurements of the magnetic field at
these scales will be obtained with a signal-to-noise ratio in the Stokes parameters of the
order of 2× 103. Finally, another important requirement is the ability to map the magnetic
field structure over areas that are comparable to typical large-scale magnetic structures, e.g.
active regions (about 300×300′′). A spatial resolution of 0.1′′ requires a spatial sampling
of 0.05′′ per pixel. Thus a field of view of 300×300′′ requires a 6k×6k sensor. This is only
marginally larger than the 4k×4k sensors that are used by SDO and are expected to be easily
available in the next decade."
Magnetic Imaging of the Outer Solar Atmosphere (MImOSA) 23
"Fig. 9 Spectropolarimetric measurements with CLASP from its first sub-orbital flight on 3 Sept. 2015. The
background image shows the chromosphere of the Sun, and the inset displays the slit-jaw filtergram acquired
by CLASP in the Ly-α line at 121 nm. Panels (a) to (e) show the spectrum along the slit in Ly-α in total inten-
sity (left) and in different orientations of the linear polarization [image credit NAOJ, JAXA, NASA/MSFC,
IAC, IAS; taken from https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/news/science/2017/20170518-clasp.html; based on 37]."
"Our estimates for the chromospheric telescope are based on the performances of current
and near-future facilities that are designed to measure the solar magnetic field at high reso-
lution. The suborbital rocket flights of CLASP [37] in particular can be regarded as the true
pathfinders for this mission (see Fig. 9). CLASP included spectropolarimetric and imaging
capabilities (i.e. slit-jaw imagers) to analyse Ly-α and Mg II. The two CLASP flights demon-
strated that the required polarimetric accuracy at the 1′′ spatial and 1 s temporal resolution
can be reached with an aperture of about 30 cm. When we scale this to the 0.1′′ spatial reso-
lution required here, this calls for an effective area that is 100 times larger. When we assume
no (significant) increase in throughput for the whole instrument, this would require a 3 m
class telescope. In the IR, e.g. for observing He I at 1083 nm, the diffraction limit of such an
instrument is about the required spatial resolution of 0.1′′. At the wavelength of Ly-α , the
required resolution of 0.1′′ is less stringent than the theoretical diffraction limit, so that the
design of the telescope will be challenging but possible within the envelope of an L-class
mission. Moreover, the required resolution of 0.1′′ can be maintained over the required large
field of view."
"The science requirements for an instrument like this demand spectropolarimetric obser-
vations at the Ly-α and the Mg II h & k lines, but also in the visible and IR (see Table 1).
Currently available Al-based coatings with high reflectivity in the visible (also required for
the thermal control of the instrument) easily allow observing lines from the IR down to the
UV at about 110 nm. At the required resolving power of ∼ 3× 104 (over two pixels) at"
24 H. Peter et al.
"120 nm, and with a 6k×6k detector, the Ly-α line can be observed simultaneously with
several very important lines such as the Si III and 120.6 nm and the N V lines at 123.8 and
124 nm. The resolving power at the Mg II h & k doublet, on the other hand, would be of the
order of 6×104."
"A separate post-focus instrument would be required to cover the visible and IR lines to
be observed. Here, well-known concepts from existing and upcoming ground-based facili-
ties can be used to reach the required specification. We do not discuss these further."
6.2 Measuring the magnetic field in the off-limb corona
"The instrument for on-disc spectropolarimetry described above should be paired with a
coronagraph capable of observing the large-scale corona. Again, the Ly-α line should be
observed together with IR lines (see Table 1), now in narrow-band polarimetric imaging.
Broad-band measurements of visible-light polarised brightness, called pB, are also essential
for the coronagraph. They will provide the coronal electron density, a basic ingredient for an
analysis based on which the coronagraphic spectropolarimetric observations are interpreted."
"The primary requirements on the instrument design are again the signal-to-noise ratio in
polarimetric measurements and the field of view. The latter should have an inner edge as low
as 1.1 R� to have a significant overlap with the on-disc polarimetric imager (Sect. 6.3) and an
outer edge out to 3 R� to capture the large-scale corona that is not visible from the ground.
The spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution requirements are less stringent than those for
the chromospheric telescope (see Table 1). In terms of coronagraphic performances, any
residual stray light should be lower than the disc brightness by a factor 10−9 in the visible
and IR and 10−7 in Ly-α ."
"The baseline for such an instrument would be a dual-band coronagraph capable of ob-
taining large field-of-view narrow-band polarimetric images in the UV (Ly-α) and in the
visible and IR ranges. The set of visible and IR lines to be considered for would include
Fe XIV at 530.3 nm (“green line”), Fe X at 637.6 nm (“red line”), Fe XI at 789.2 nm, and the
Fe XIII doublet and He I lines around 1080 nm, for instance."
"An instrument such as this has a strong archetype in the Metis coronagraph [5], which
is now flying on Solar Orbiter. With respect to Metis, the proposed instrument will have
polarimetric capabilities in Ly-α and in a selection of visible and IR lines, a field of view
extending down to 1.1 solar radii instead of 1.6, and higher spatial resolution (especially at
Ly-α). Scaling the Metis instrument to the requirements outlined here in Table 1 results in a
coronagraph with an aperture of about 40 cm."
6.3 Measuring the magnetic field in the on-disc corona
"This instrument is mainly required to characterise the magnetic field in the million Kelvin
corona and to provide context and connection information for the chromospheric telescope
(Sect. 6.1) and the coronagraph (Sect. 6.2). This is essentially an improved development
of imagers that were used for SDO/AIA or Proba 2/SWAP, for example, but now with the
capability of recording the polarisation signal."
"The field of view and resolution requirements (Table 1) call for a 6k×6k detector and
a focal length of 4.4 m with 12 µm pixels. With currently available 4k×4k detectors, we
can expect the required detectors to become available in the coming years. A single on-axis
parabolic mirror would meet the resolution requirement, but over a limited field of view, and"
Magnetic Imaging of the Outer Solar Atmosphere (MImOSA) 25
"would be overly bulky. Even though it adds one reflection, the preferred option is therefore a
Ritchey-Chretien telescope. The linear polariser is a 45◦ folding mirror that is located before
the detector."
"The 45◦ polariser is located close to the detector (about 10 mm), and the whole assembly
is rotated to provide the necessary measurements of linear polarisation. A single-mirror
polarising system is required to maximise the photon count in a given exposure time. This
is achieved by a rotating focal plane assembly, which implies that any connectors follow the
movements of the detector. A two-mirror polariser would not require a rotating focal plane
assembly, but would reduce the flux at the focal plane by a factor two."
"To select the main target line of Fe X at 17.4 nm, multi-layer coatings can be optimised
for maximum throughput at 17.4 nm and maximum rejection of other nearby emission lines,
some of which are predicted to show zero or opposite polarisation compared to Fe X. It is
important to reject these lines because they constitute stray light in the polarisation measure-
ment and degrade the measurement signal-to-noise ratio. Such coatings have already been
developed for EUI/Solar Orbiter. Using new techniques for the multi-layer mirror coatings,
we can reach a width of the transmitted band of only 0.35 nm, which is twice as narrow as
bands on current instruments."
6.4 Mission scenario in case of an M-class mission opportunity
"What we outlined so far in this paper calls for an L-class mission. We consider that the
chromospheric telescope with an aperture of up to 3 m is the main cost driver in our mission
profile. When we downsize our mission scenario for an M-class mission, the 3 m telescope
is therefore the first item to consider. Other mission options can also open up when a smaller
main telescope is considered."
"The effect of reducing the size of the chromospheric telescope from a 3 m class to a 1 m
class instrument means cuts in the science return. In addition to a reduced spatial resolution,
the main downgrade would be the sensitivity to the magnetic field, and here in particular in
the UV, where the aperture is essential for reaching the required signal-to-noise ratio. The
smaller telescope will reduce the spatial resolution by more than what is suggested by the
reduction of the aperture (to collect the same number of photons per resolution element),
or the sensitivity to the magnetic field will be reduced, or both. A trade-off study will have
to show possible paths when the aperture needs to be reduced and what effects these would
have for the science goals."
"Even a 1 m class telescope would outperform any currently operational or planned so-
lar space observatory. We can still expect significant advances. The scientific return would
be downgraded from a full characterisation of the magnetic field in the outer atmosphere,
however. We would mostly be able to investigate only bright structures on the Sun, while
the faint features are often essential to understanding the global large-scale connection. This
would affect all of the science goals outlined in Sect. 2 because the magnetic field is present
not only in the bright features, but is volume filling. It would mean that we could only
investigate a fraction of the outer solar atmosphere."
"Downgrading the chromospheric telescope from a 3 m to a 1 m class instrument might
also open new opportunities. For example, one could place a smaller observatory at either
L4 or L5 instead of in Earth orbit (or at L1). In combination with a facility either in Earth
orbit or on the ground, this would give the possibility for stereoscopic observations."
26 H. Peter et al.
7 Technological challenges
7.1 Main telescope: Thermal control and optical performance over the field of view
"Relatively large telescopes that cover the visible to UV range have previously been flown
into space or near-space (stratospheric) environments, for example the 0.5 m telescope on the
Hinode telescope [77] or the Sunrise balloon-borne 1 m telescope [8]. These two instruments
have proven that it is possible to build a UV-to-visible light solar telescope that manages
the solar flux while keeping performances up to the tight requirements (e.g. the Sunrise
telescope is diffraction limited in the visible). In the case of the 3 m telescope discussed here,
a Gregory design with a heat rejection field stop will also have to be used. The telescope can
be seen as a scaled-up version of the telescope on board Sunrise. Because of the size, it
will be challenging but possible, especially when we consider that it does not have to be
diffraction limited."
"The requirement of maintaining the image quality over the large (300′′×300′′) field of
view needs some consideration, however. A simple Gregory design with two powered mir-
rors cannot maintain the required 0.1′′ resolution (two pixels) over the full field of view. A
corrective optical element or a curved focal plane assembly will have to be considered."
"7.2 Data transmission, handling, and storage"
"The number of large-format cameras will be significant: at least three for the chromospheric
telescope, two for the coronagraph, and one for the EUV polarimetric imager. They have
to operate simultaneously with a cadence of down to 1 s, so that even with some loss-less
data compression, this leads to a data rate of the order of 1 Gbit/s (see Fig. 10). A data
rate like this is certainly challenging and will require the use of high-capacity transmission
systems such as the laser communication systems currently under development and testing.
It is likely that such systems are available in one or two decades."
"Large on-board storage units are required that have a capacity to temporarily save 50 TB
or more. This is the equivalent of continuously observing for 8 hours. Such a storage unit
requires an improvement in capacity by a factor of 10 compared to PHI/Solar Orbiter, for
instance, which might be feasible in a decade from now."
"The continuous stream of data at a high rate requires re-thinking the techniques for
processing and archiving data. While the storage of this amount of data might not pose a
significant challenge in a decade, the processing will need significant improvements. Here
machine-learning techniques to be developed in the framework of big-data strategies will
help with the efficient and automated standard processing steps, and may even provide a
(preliminary) data selection."
8 Relation to other space- and ground-based observations
"Synoptic observations of the whole solar disc and the corona (at moderate resolution) are
important to place high-resolution data acquisition as proposed in this paper into context.
Synoptic observations are currently available through a range of space- and ground-based
facilities, for example by SOHO/LASCO, SDO, Proba2, STEREO, Hinode, or GONG+. Be-
cause of the relevance for operational space weather services, it can be assumed that (sim-
ilar) global monitoring observations will remain continuously present in the future (GOES,"
Magnetic Imaging of the Outer Solar Atmosphere (MImOSA) 27
"Fig. 10 Multi-wavelength observation of the solar photosphere and chromosphere. From left to right the maps
recorded by the Sunrise balloon telescope show: UV at 300 nm, Ca II K at 397 nm, Fe I at 525 nm and the
photospheric magnetic field (red and blue are opposite magnetic polarities). The field of view is very small,
ca. 13′′×38′′. We propose to acquire data in multiple lines in a much larger field of view with a continuous
high data rate. This would produce more than 50 TB within 8 hours. Image based on [75]."
"SWFO, ESA Lagrange). This will guarantee that the high-resolution data we propose in this
paper for the time frame of 2035 to 2050 will be supplemented by proper context informa-
tion."
"The near future will see a significant shift in ground-based solar telescopes from the 1 m
class to the 4 m class. Current high-resolution ground-based solar observations (GREGOR,
SST, GST, NVST, ONSET) are complemented by unique high-resolution data from occa-
sional balloon flights (Sunrise), all with apertures from 1 m to 1.5 m. The Daniel K. Inoue
Solar Telescope (DKIST) with 4 m aperture has just seen first light. DKIST observes the so-
lar disc, and has a coronagraphic mode for the innermost part of the corona. Using lines such
as Ca II near 394 nm and 854 nm and He I near 1083 nm, it will explore the magnetic field
in the low chromosphere through on-disc measurements. Observations in Fe XIII at 1075 nm
above the limb will give access to the magnetic field in the very low corona, at only a few
100′′ (less than 0.5 R�) above the limb. A telescope with comparable specifications is pro-
posed by the European solar community (European Solar Telescope, EST), for which first
light is scheduled for the mid- to end-2020s."
"The 3 m class telescope we propose here for a space-based platform will provide a great
leap in scientific exploitation compared to the upcoming 4 m class ground-based telescopes.
The wavelength range can be extended farther into the UV, which is not accessible from the
ground. This is indispensable to obtain access to lines such as Ly-α at 121 nm or Mg II near
280 nm and thus measure the magnetic field in the uppermost parts of the chromosphere. A
complete coverage and a holistic view of the whole outer solar atmosphere becomes avail-
able only then. The high-resolution field of view of ground-based observations will always
be limited by seeing effects that are introduced by the Earth’s atmosphere. With adaptive
optics systems, the corrected high-resolution region is roughly 10′′ across, multi-conjugate"
28 H. Peter et al.
"adoptive optics, might extend this to some 50′′. Only a seeing-free space-based platform
can provide the required large field of view of 300′′ across at constant high resolution, how-
ever. Furthermore, only a space platform can provide stable observing conditions to follow
structures over hours and to minimise the cross-talk between the different polarisation states."
"Coronagraphic measurements from the ground are marred by the inevitable stray light in
the Earth’s atmosphere. Among other effects, this limits the coverage of the field of view to
a maximum of 0.5 solar radii (optimistic estimate) above the limb for DKIST. While DKIST
can observe the coronal magnetic field at a high spatial resolution of about 0.1′′, it will not
be able to investigate the large-scale magnetic field. To reach significantly farther out, we
have to enter space."
"The next important step for the solar community in space is provided by the Solar Orbiter
mission that was launched in February 2020. This mission will address many of the funda-
mental questions in solar physics, in particular those concerning the connection from the
Sun to the heliosphere. However, it will not directly measure the magnetic field in the outer
solar atmosphere. The science questions outlined in this paper in Sect. 2 will remain largely
open after Solar Orbiter. EUVST, a Japan-led high-resolution extreme-UV spectrometer, is
planned to be launched in the late 2020s. This will also lack the capability of investigating
polarisation and thus the magnetic field in the outer solar atmosphere."
"In this paper we suggest to measure the magnetic field to determine what drives the
dynamics in the outer solar atmosphere. The full science return can only be achieved by an
L-class mission. With a downgrade to an M-class mission (see Sect. 6.4), other scenarios
with a broader scope might become possible. One option that could be instigated would
be an L-class mission in the context of Voyage2050 that would combine our suggestion
(downgraded to M-class) with one or more missions in the fields of solar, heliospheric,
magnetospheric, and ionospheric physics as described in other papers in this volume. This
would provide a Grand European Heliospheric Observatory and ensure scientific advances
in the coming decades in a broad scientific context."
9 Conclusions
"The Sun is the star closest to Earth. It is the only star for which we can resolve details on
its surface and in its atmosphere. The outer solar atmosphere from the cool chromosphere
to the hot corona is permeated by a magnetic field that energetically dominates the gas.
The magnetic field controls the level of solar activity. It thus modulates the radiative output
of the Sun throughout the activity cycle, largely governs the emission from the UV to X-
ray radiation, ejects particles and fields from the corona, and drives space weather effects.
Through these magnetic activity effects, the Sun directly impacts the Earth and human life.
Likewise, the magnetic activity of other stars will have an impact on the planets orbiting
these host stars, and it will govern the habitability on these planets."
"Although we can observationally characterise the magnetic field on the solar surface (the
photosphere) reasonably well, we fail to do so for the higher layers. In the overlying chromo-
sphere and in the corona that stretches essentially into interplanetary space, our information
on the magnetic field is mainly indirect. This state of knowledge is highly unsatisfactory be-
cause the magnetic field energetically dominates the plasma in this outer solar atmosphere
and thus largely controls the phenomena that are observed there. Only by knowing the mag-
netic field and its evolution can we unlock the source of heating of the gas to millions of
degrees, understand the shape and brightness of the corona, learn about magnetic reconnec-"
Magnetic Imaging of the Outer Solar Atmosphere (MImOSA) 29
"tion and its effects such as flares and the associated energetic particles and radiation, and
unravel the initiation of large-scale ejections of parts of the solar atmosphere."
"The lack of direct measurements of the magnetic field in the outer solar atmosphere
is a major hindrance to our understanding of the physics of the outer solar atmosphere. If
we could remedy this, we would be able to explain a very wide variety of phenomena. In
essence, we are blind to the main driver of solar activity in the critical layers of the solar
atmosphere."
"By directly measuring the magnetic field in the outer atmosphere of the Sun, we will be
able to address four paramount long-standing questions of solar physics:"
"1. How does the magnetic field couple the different layers of the atmosphere, and how does
it transport energy?"
"2. How does the magnetic field structure, drive and interact with the plasma in the chro-
mosphere and upper atmosphere?"
"3. How does the magnetic field destabilise the outer solar atmosphere and thus affect the
interplanetary environment?"
4. How do magnetic processes accelerate particles to high energies?
"To address these science questions, we have to perform new ground-breaking observa-
tions with a suite of space-based solar telescopes that far exceed current capabilities in terms
of spatial resolution, light-gathering power, and polarimetric performance. This requires in-
struments for different parts of the outer solar atmosphere with sufficiently large apertures."
"a. Large-aperture UV-to-IR telescope. Depending on the mission scenario (M or L), this
telescope of the 1-3 m class is aimed mainly to measure the magnetic field in the chro-
mosphere by combining high spatial resolution and high sensitivity."
"b. Extreme-UV-to-IR coronagraph. A coronagraph that is designed to measure the large-
scale magnetic field in the corona. The required aperture is about 40 cm."
"c. Extreme-UV imaging polarimeter. A 30 cm telescope that combines high throughput in
the extreme UV with polarimetry to connect the magnetic measurements of the other
two instruments."
"All three instruments will perform novel measurements of the magnetic field in the outer
atmosphere that currently cannot be achieved. This solar observatory could be placed in a
near-Earth orbit to maximise the data downlink, or at L4 or L5 to provide stereoscopic
observations of the Sun in combination with Earth-based observatories."
"This mission to measure the magnetic field will unlock the driver of the dynamics in the
outer solar atmosphere. Through this it will greatly advance our understanding of the Sun
and the heliosphere."
