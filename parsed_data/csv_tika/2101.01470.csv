ABSTRACT
"Context. The sub-Jovian or Neptunian desert is a previously-identified region of parameter space where there is a relative dearth of
intermediate-mass planets at short orbital periods.
Aims. We present the discovery of a new transiting planetary system within the Neptunian desert, NGTS-14A.
Methods. Transits of NGTS-14Ab were discovered in photometry from the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS). Follow-up transit
photometry was conducted from several ground-based facilities, as well as extracted from TESS full-frame images. We combine radial
velocities from the HARPS spectrograph with the photometry in a global analysis to determine the system parameters.
Results. NGTS-14Ab has a radius about 30 per cent larger than that of Neptune (0.444 ± 0.030 RJup), and is around 70 per cent more
massive than Neptune (0.092 ± 0.012 MJup). It transits the main-sequence K1 star, NGTS-14A, with a period of 3.54 days, just far
enough to have maintained at least some of its primordial atmosphere. We have also identified a possible long-period stellar mass
companion to the system, NGTS-14B, and we investigate the binarity of exoplanet host stars inside and outside the Neptunian desert
using Gaia."

1. Introduction
"The first generation of wide-field transit surveys, the most pro-
lific of which were SuperWASP (Pollacco et al. 2006) and
HAT-Net (Bakos et al. 2002), unveiled the rich diversity of hot
Jupiters. These planets, although intrinsically rare, have been
discovered in numbers large enough to enable statistical popu-
lation analyses such as those investigating inflation (e.g. Thorn-
gren & Fortney 2018; Sestovic et al. 2018). Transiting hot
Jupiters also remain the best-studied individual planetary sys-
tems, with characterisation observations such as atmospheric
transmission spectroscopy pioneered on these objects (e.g. Sing
et al. 2016)."

"The Kepler (Borucki et al. 2010) and K2 (Howell et al. 2014)
missions, and the ongoing TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite; Ricker et al. 2015) mission subsequently revealed a
large population of small (less than 2 – 3 Earth radii), short-
period planets. In between these two populations, however, lies a
relatively unpopulated region of parameter space, often referred
to as the sub-Jovian or Neptunian desert (Szabó & Kiss 2011;
Mazeh et al. 2016)."
"The Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS; Wheatley et al.
2018) consists of twelve independent 0.2-m telescopes, each
equipped with a red-sensitive 2k × 2k CCD covering eight
square degrees. The survey is optimised for detecting short-
period planets transiting K-dwarf stars, with the goal of detecting
Neptune-sized planets. One of the main drivers for the extremely"

"high-precision photometry achieved by NGTS is the telescope
guiding, which uses Donuts (McCormac et al. 2013) to ensure
sub-pixel pointing precision throughout the duration of an ob-
serving season. This has allowed the detection of significantly
shallower transits than previously achieved from the ground, and
the discovery of planets in the Neptunian desert, such as NGTS-
4b (West et al. 2019)."
"In this paper we report the discovery from NGTS of a tran-
siting planet slightly larger than Neptune orbiting the early K-
dwarf NGTS-14A. In Section 2, we present the host star, and
show that it probably has a bound long-period M-dwarf com-
panion. In Section 3 we present our observations of the system
with both NGTS and other facilities. In Section 4 we charac-
terise the host star, and in Section 5 we perform a joint analysis
of the transit photometry and radial velocities to determine the
system parameters. Finally, we discuss NGTS-14 in the context
of the Neptunian desert in Section 6, and summarise our findings
in Section 7."
2. NGTS-14B
"We list in Table 1 the Gaia positions, proper motions and paral-
laxes (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) for both NGTS-14A and
NGTS-14B, a fainter star which lies just 3.59 arcseconds away
(see Fig. 1). The parallaxes of the two objects are identical to
much less than 1 σ significance, and the proper motions in the
RA direction are compatible at the 2 σ level. We note, however,
that in the Declination direction, the proper motions differ from
each other with a significance of 5.7 σ. We conclude, however,
that these two stars are co-moving, and likely to be gravitation-
ally bound."
"As a test of the statistical significance of finding a com-
panion with similar parallax and proper motions close to our
target, we searched the Gaia DR2 catalogue for all stars lying
within 5◦ of NGTS-14A1 and whose proper motions and par-
allax match those of NGTS-14A to within 6 σ. This search of
an area 2.5 × 107 times larger than the area defined by a radius
equal to the separation between target and putative companion
returned exactly 100 results, excluding NGTS-14A itself. This
implies that the chance of finding such an object within 3′′.6 is
around 4 × 10−6."
"At a distance of 316.7±4.8 pc, the projected separation of the
two stars implies a physical separation of 1137±17 au. If the two
objects are gravitationally bound, this sets a lower limit to the bi-
nary orbital period of around 40 000 yr, assuming a circular orbit.
For a moderately eccentric orbit (0.6), this lower limit is reduced
to around 20 000 yr, which is the orbital period obtained if we
assume that we are observing NGTS-14B at apastron. We note
that the physical separation implied here is an order of magni-
tude smaller than the widest binary that can survive for ∼ 10 Gyr
in the Solar neighbourhood (Jiang & Tremaine 2010)."
"We also note that at a distance of around 320 pc, the appar-
ent discrepancy in proper motions in the declination direction
(1.1±0.2 mas yr−1) corresponds to a physical velocity of around
1.5 km s−1, which could be easily explained by the orbital motion
of the secondary with respect to the primary. We searched the
Digitized Sky Survey for archival imaging, but we found no im-
ages with sufficient angular resolution to resolve the two sources.
A radial velocity measurement of NGTS-14B would provide fur-
ther evidence of whether or not the two stars are really a binary"
"1 Gaia DR2 reports a total of 4.78 × 105 sources within 5◦ of NGTS-
14A."
"Fig. 1. Upper panel: NGTS deep stacked image (2′ × 2′) centred on
NGTS-14A. The Gaia positions of NGTS-14A and NGTS-14B are in-
dicated with a red ’+’ and a blue ’x’, respectively. The pink circle in-
dicates the NGTS photometric aperture, which has a radius of 3 pixels
(15′′). Other Gaia sources are marked with orange triangles. North is
up, and East to the left. Lower panel: Sketch of NGTS-14, showing
the separation of NGTS-14A and NGTS-14B, which are represented
by the same symbols as in the upper panel. NGTS-14B lies on a bear-
ing α = 267.49 degrees from NGTS-14A. The direction of the rela-
tive proper motion of NGTS-14B with respect to NGTS-14A is indi-
cated with the green arrow. The bearing of this proper motion vector is
β = 18.8 ± 9.5 degrees, and its magnitude is 1.18 ± 0.20 mas yr−1."
"pair, but NGTS-14B is too faint to be observed with CORALIE
or HARPS (See Section 3.3)."
"The existence of such binary companions to planet host stars
is interesting, since even at these very large separations, a binary
companion may influence the evolution of the planet. For in-
stance, long-period outer companions can act to maintain a non-
zero planetary orbital eccentricity, even for short-period plan-
ets whose orbits would otherwise be rapidly circularised through
tidal interactions with the host star (e.g. Wu & Murray 2003)."
"NGTS-14B is 4.098± 0.004 magnitudes fainter than NGTS-
14A in the G-band, and 2.17± 0.08 magnitudes fainter in the K-
band. The spectral type of NGTS-14A is estimated to be K1V,
based on the effective temperature derived from spectral analy-
sis, and the tabulation of Pecaut & Mamajek 20132."
"Based on the absolute G-band magnitudes in the aforemen-
tioned table, if NGTS-14A has a spectral type of K1V, then
NGTS-14B is probably an M2.5V star. Alternatively, using the
(G-K) colour, the best-matching spectral types (according to the"

NGTS-14B, respectively. We adopt spectral types of K1V and
M3V for the two stars, and account for the flux contamination of
NGTS-14B in our light curves (Sec. 5.1)."
3. Observations
3.1. NGTS photometry
"NGTS-14A lies in one of the fields observed by NGTS starting
from the commencement of routine science operations in 2016
April. In all, a total of 220 829 observations were made of this
field using a single NGTS telescope, between 2016 April 21 and
2016 December 22. Each image has an exposure time of 10 s,
and a typical cadence of 13 s. The data were reduced using the
NGTS pipeline (Wheatley et al. 2018), which comprises stan-
dard bias subtraction and flat-field correction, followed by aper-
ture photometry based on the CASUtools3 software package. Fi-
nally, systematic effects in the light curves were removed using
the SysRem algorithm (Tamuz et al. 2005)."
"The NGTS light curves are searched for period transit-like
signals using our implementation of the box-fitting least-squares
(BLS) algorithm (Kovács et al. 2002). In the case of NGTS-14A,
a signal consistent with a transiting exoplanet was detected, with
a periodicity of around 3.5 days. After passing several vetting
checks designed to eliminate false positives such as eclipsing
binaries and blended systems (e.g. Günther et al. 2017), we ini-
tiated follow-up observations to confirm the planetary nature of
the system, and to better characterise it."
"We also note that this system received a high planetary prob-
ability of 0.97 from a neural network trained to distinguish be-
tween transiting planetary systems and false positives in NGTS
data (Chaushev et al. 2019)."
3.2. Follow-up photometry
"We used several larger aperture telescopes, as well as multiple
NGTS telescopes, to perform follow-up transit observations. The
motivation of these observations was to confirm the transit, in-
crease the signal-to-noise of our transit photometry to improve
the characterisation of the system, and to improve our knowledge
of the orbital ephemeris by extending the observational baseline."
3.2.1. SAAO 1-m
"We observed a partial transit of NGTS-14Ab on the night of
2019 October 04, from the South African Astronomical Obser-
vatory in Sutherland, Northern Cape using their 1-m telescope.
The telescope was equipped with one of the Sutherland High-
speed Optical Cameras (SHOC; specifically ‘SHOC’n’awe’). A
description of the instrument can be found in Coppejans et al.
(2013). The observations were conducted in I-band, in focus,
with 4 × 4 binning of the CCD, and each of the 960 exposures
had a duration of 20 s."
"The data were bias and flat field corrected via the standard
procedure, using the safphot Python package (Chaushev & Ray-
nard, in preparation). Differential photometry was also carried
out using safphot, by first extracting aperture photometry for
both the target and comparison stars using the SEP package
(Barbary 2016). The sky background was measured and sub-
tracted using the SEP background map, adopting box size and fil-"

"ter width parameters that minimised background residuals, mea-
sured across the frame after masking the stars. Three comparison
stars were then utilised to perform differential photometry on the
target, using a 3.4 pixel (0′′.57) radius aperture which maximised
the signal-to-noise."
3.2.2. EulerCam
"A partial transit of NGTS-14Ab was observed on the night of
2019 August 08 with EulerCam on the 1.2-m Euler-Swiss tele-
scope at La Silla Observatory, Chile. A total of 271 observations
were made in a filter corresponding to the NGTS bandpass, each
with an exposure time of 40 s, giving a cadence of around 52 s.
A slight defocus was applied during the observations. Standard
data reduction and aperture photometry techniques were applied,
using a photometric aperture radius of 19 pixels (= 4′′.085), and
17 comparison stars."
3.2.3. CHAT
"Another partial transit of NGTS-14Ab was observed from
the Chilean-Hungarian Automated Telescope (CHAT), a 0.7-m
robotic telescope installed at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.
The observations were conducted on the night of 2019 Novem-
ber 8, using an i′ filter. The cadence of the light curve is around
180 s and 73 images were obtained spanning airmass values be-
tween 1 and 2. Data was processed with a dedicated pipeline
adapted from a set of routines to process photometric data of
the LCOGT network (e.g. Hartman et al. 2019; Espinoza et al.
2019; Jordán et al. 2019)."
3.2.4. NGTS multi-telescope observations
"In addition to its survey mode, where each telescope observes a
different field to maximise sky coverage, NGTS can also be oper-
ated in a mode where multiple telescopes observe the same target
simultaneously (Smith et al. 2020). This mode is used for follow-
up of shallow transits detected by the NGTS survey, as well as
for TESS targets (Jenkins et al. 2020; Armstrong et al. 2020) and
for other exoplanets transiting bright stars (Bryant et al. 2020)."
"We observed a partial transit of NGTS-14Ab on the night of
2019 November 08 (the same event we observed with CHAT),
using eight of the NGTS telescopes. We obtained a total of 8790
exposures (around 1100 per camera), each with the usual NGTS
exposure time (10 s) and cadence (13 s)."
"The NGTS follow-up data for NGTS-14A were reduced us-
ing a custom photometry pipeline. This pipeline uses the SEP
Python library for both the source extraction and the aperture
photometry (Bertin & Arnouts 1996; Barbary 2016). We do not
apply bias, dark, and flat-field image corrections during the im-
age reduction, as testing showed them to provide no improve-
ment to the photometric precision achieved. We use Gaia (Gaia
Collaboration et al. 2018) to automatically identify compari-
son stars with a similar colour, brightness and CCD position to
NGTS-14A (see Bryant et al. 2020, for more details on the pho-
tometric pipeline)."
3.2.5. TESS
"NGTS-14A falls in Sector 1 of the TESS survey, which was
observed between 2018 July 25 and 2018 August 22, covering
seven transits of NGTS-14Ab. We were able to extract a light
curve from the full-frame images (FFIs) of Camera 1, CCD 2,"

"which have a cadence of 30 minutes. To do this, we used a cus-
tom photometric aperture selected on the basis of a flux thresh-
old, and to minimise blending from other sources. A 15 × 15
pixels area was used for background estimation."
"We ran the BLS algorithm on the TESS data to test if the
planet could have been detected from the TESS data alone. A
peak at around 3.5 d is the highest in the resulting periodogram,
with a significance (following Collier Cameron et al. 2006) of
10.9. This suggests that an exhaustive search of light curves de-
rived from the TESS FFIs could have revealed this system. How-
ever the transit is much less evident in TESS data compared with
the NGTS data. This is primarily due to the fact that NGTS
typically produces higher precision photometry for stars with

servatories, Chile, under programmes 0103.C-0719 and 0104.C-
0588. A total of fifteen measurements were made between 2019
August 03 and 2019 September 20."
"We used the standard HARPS data reduction software to ob-
tain RV measurements of NGTS-14A at each epoch. This was
done via cross-correlation with a K5 binary mask. Bisector-
span, FWHM and other line-profile diagnostics were computed
as well. Using an exposure time of 2700 s we obtained typical
error bars of ∼ 5 m s−1. The resulting radial velocities are listed
in Table 3, and are plotted in Fig. 4."
"The HARPS science fibre has a 1′′ on-sky projection,
and does thus not include NGTS-14B. We co-added the fif-
teen HARPS spectra while weighting each epoch the inverse-
variance. Section 4.1 details the spectral analysis performed on
the stacked spectrum."
4. Stellar characterisation
4.1. Spectral analysis
"The HARPS spectra were co-added, and the resulting spectrum
(S/N ≈ 49) was analysed with the synthesis method (without
the use of wavelets) outlined in Gill et al. (2018). The resulting
parameters are T∗,eff = 5200 ± 85 K, [Fe/H] = 0.12 ± 0.08,
log g∗ = 4.2 ± 0.1 (cgs), and v sin i∗ = 1.2 ± 0.5 km s−1."
4.2. SED fit with ARIADNE
"We fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) of NGTS-14A us-
ing ARIADNE, a python tool written to fit catalogue photometry to
different atmospheric model grids (Fig. 2). It hosts model grids
for Phoenix v2 (Husser et al. 2013), BT-Settl, BT-Cond,
BT-NextGen (Allard et al. 2012; Hauschildt et al. 1999), Castelli
& Kurucz (2003), and Kurucz (1993) convolved with filter re-
sponse functions: UBVRI; 2MASS JHKrms; SDSS ugriz; WISE
W1 and W2; Gaia G, RP, and BP, Pan-STARRS griwyz’ Ström-
gren uvby; GALEX NUV and FUV; TESS; Kepler; and NGTS.
Each synthetic SED is modelled by interpolating grids in T∗,eff-
log g∗-[Fe/H] space with the remaining parameters being dis-
tance, radius, extinction in the V band, and an individual excess"

uncertainties. The priors for T∗,eff , log g∗ and [Fe/H] were taken
from the spectral analysis determined values, for radius and dis-
tance we took the Gaia DR2 reported value, noting that we in-
flated the radius reported error to account for modelling errors
and we applied the Stassun & Torres 2018 correction to the par-
allax, we limited the AV to the maximum line-of-sight taken from
the re-calibrated SFD galactic dust map (Schlegel et al. 1998;
Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011), and finally, each excess noise pa-
rameter has a zero mean Normal distribution as their priors with
a variance equal to five times the size of the reported uncer-
tainty. ARIADNE uses dynesty’s nested sampler for parameter
estimation and calculating the Bayesian evidence for each model
(Speagle 2020). The final step in ARIADNE’s algorithm is calcu-
lating the weighted average of each parameter using the relative
probabilities of each models as weights. For a detailed explana-
tion of the fitting procedure, accuracy and precision of ARIADNE
the reader is referred to Vines & Jenkins (2020). The resulting
stellar parameters are listed in Table 4."
4.3. TIC
"The TESS Input Catalog (Stassun et al. 2019) lists the follow-
ing parameters for NGTS-14A, based on the Gaia DR2 (Gaia
Collaboration et al. 2018) observations: R∗ = 0.856 ± 0.049 R�,
T∗,eff = 5222 ± 128 K. We note that our adopted values are in
good agreement with these TIC values."

"We searched the NGTS survey light curve for periodic signals,
using both a Lomb-Scargle periodogram and a generalised auto-
correlation (G-ACF) method (Gillen et al. 2020). Both methods
revealed a signal with a period of approximately 10 d to be the
most prominent, although given the small amplitude of the puta-
tive signal (≤ 1 mmag), this is not a robust detection."

certainties on the bisector spans are taken to be twice the uncertainty on
the radial velocities."
"From the v sin i∗ derived from the HARPS spectra (1.2 ±
0.5 km s−1) and the stellar radius, we calculate an upper limit
to the stellar rotation period, P∗,rot ≤ 35.5 ± 14.8 d. This value
corresponds to the case where the stellar spin and planet rotation
axes are aligned."
"It is unclear if the 10-d signal is related to rotation, since
it would imply a faster-rotating star than suggested by the
v sin i∗, and would be indicative of a star significantly younger (c.
700 Myr; Rebull et al. 2017; Douglas et al. 2017) than our SED
analysis (Sec. 4.2) implies. At an age less than 1 Gyr, K0 stars
typically exhibit photometric rotational modulation of at least a
few mmag, which would be readily detectable in the NGTS data."
5. Joint fit to photometry and RVs
"We performed a joint fit to the photometry and radial velocities
using the Transit and Light Curve Modeller (TLCM; Csizmadia
2020). In order to reduce the large number of data points in the
NGTS survey photometry, and thus increase modelling speed,
we modelled only those nights of NGTS data where a transit oc-
curred, and we binned the remaining light curve to a cadence of
120 s. This resulted in a total of 2404 NGTS survey data points.
Similarly, the NGTS multi-telescope data were binned to a sin-
gle light curve with a cadence of 120 s. We excluded TESS data
taken far from transit, only modelling that with an orbital phase"
"Article number, page 6 of 11"
A. M. S. Smith et al.: NGTS-14Ab: a Neptune-sized transiting planet in the desert
"between -0.1 and 0.1. The CHAT, SAAO, and Euler light curves
were modelled unbinned and in their entirety."
5.1. Contaminating flux from NGTS-14B
"In all photometric data sets, except that from the SAAO 1-m,
NGTS-14B (Sec. 2) is well within the photometric aperture used
to extract the target flux from the images. To account for this con-
tamination, we calculated the flux ratio of the two components
of NGTS-14, and corrected the affected datasets accordingly. We
find that NGTS-14B contributes around two per cent of the ob-
served flux, and that in the absence of any correction, our value
of Rp/R∗ is biased by around 2σ."
5.2. Stellar limb darkening
"The signal-to-noise ratio of our photometry is not sufficiently
high to precisely constrain the limb-darkening coefficients in
each bandpass in which we observed NGTS-14A. The band-
passes used do not span a particularly large range of wave-
lengths; rather they are fairly similar to each other. We calculated
theoretically expected quadratic limb-darkening coefficients for
each band using the Limb Darkening Toolkit (LDTk) of Parvi-
ainen & Aigrain (2015), which relies on the stellar models of
Husser et al. (2013). The difference between the coefficients for
the different bandpasses is insignificant, much smaller than the
uncertainties on the coefficients we measure for each light curve
individually. Further, we find that our derived system parame-
ters are insensitive to our choice of limb-darkening parameters,
within this range. We therefore opt to fit for a single pair of limb-
darkening coefficients, common to all observed bandpasses. In
TLCM, this is done with the parameters u+ = ua + ub and
u− = ua − ub, where ua and ub are the commonly used quadratic
coefficients."
5.3. Orbital eccentricity
"We also tried fitting for an eccentric orbit, via the additional pa-
rameters"
"√
e sin(ω) and"
"√
e cos(ω), where e is the orbital eccen-"
"tricity, and ω the argument of periastron. Our best-fitting values
are
√"
"e sin(ω) = 0.07 ± 0.27 and
√"
"e cos(ω) = −0.05 ± 0.20,
resulting in e = 0.0074 ± 0.0428 and ω = −54 ± 151 degrees.
The three-sigma upper limit to the eccentricity is 0.11. The very
modest improvement in χ2 of less than 0.4 does not compen-
sate for the much larger Bayesian penalty on having two addi-
tional model parameters. This results in a significantly lower BIC
(Bayesian Information Criterion) for the circular orbital model
(∆ BICcirc−ecc = −5.05). We therefore reject the eccentric model,
and adopt e = 0."
5.4. Additional trend in RVs
"We also tried fitting for a radial acceleration, γ̇, of NGTS-14A.
The presence of such a trend in the RVs is usually indicative of
an additional body in the system (e.g. Smith et al. 2017). We ob-
tained a best-fitting value γ̇ = −9+21"
"−17 m s
−1 yr−1, suggesting that"
"no significant radial acceleration is detected. This is confirmed
by a BIC analysis, where the simpler model with no acceleration
has a smaller BIC value (by 1.2), and is hence preferred."
5.5. Bisector spans
"We observe no evidence for a correlation between either time
and bisector span or bisector span and radial velocity (Fig. 4).
A correlation can indicate that the apparent planetary signal is
caused by a blended eclipsing binary system, or by stellar ac-
tivity (Queloz et al. 2001a). Furthermore, we see no correlation
between radial velocity and the FWHM of the line profile."
"Our joint fit to the photometry and RVs is shown in Figs. 3
and 4, respectively. The resulting system parameters are listed in
Table 5."
6. Discussion
6.1. NGTS-14Ab in the Neptunian desert
"NGTS-14Ab joins a growing number of planets that reside in
the Neptunian desert, a sparsely populated region of parameter
space between the hot Jupiters and the super Earths in the radius
– period plane (Fig. 5). NGTS-14Ab lies within both the desert
as defined by Mazeh et al. (2016), and the smaller region identi-
fied by Szabó & Kálmán (2019), who along with Eigmüller et al.
(2019) have recently investigated the boundaries of the Neptu-
nian desert as a function of host star spectral type."
"Owen & Lai (2018) explain the lower boundary of the desert
as a consequence of photoevaporation – a process that is more
efficient at reducing the size of close-in planets. Further, they
suggest that the upper boundary of the desert is a result of the
fact that only the highest mass planets can be tidally circularised
in the closest orbits, after high-eccentricity migration. NGTS-
14Ab lies among the lower boundaries of the desert computed
by Owen & Lai (2018), which are dependent upon metallic-
ity and core mass. Comparing NGTS-14Ab to their simulations
(which ran for 5 Gy, similar to the age of the system) suggests
that NGTS-14Ab has a core mass of close to 10 M⊕, and that any
additional envelope accreted by the planet during its formation
would have by now been lost to photoevaporation."
"We use the neural network model of planetary interiors de-
veloped by Baumeister et al. (2020) to predict the internal struc-
ture of NGTS-14Ab (Fig. 6), using the planetary mass and radius
(Table 5) as model inputs. Although internal structure is notori-
ously degenerate with mass and radius, this model suggests that
NGTS-14Ab has a significant gaseous envelope. The models of
Howe et al. (2014) suggest that an H2-He envelope constituting
approximately half of the planet’s radius would contribute five
to ten per cent of the planet’s mass, for a core mass of 10 M⊕.
In other words, there is broad compatibility between the models
of Baumeister et al. (2020) (Fig. 6) and the model of Zeng et al.
(2019) with a five per cent (by mass) hydrogen-rich envelope
(Fig. 7, red curve)."
"In Fig. 7, we compare NGTS-14Ab to the other planets that
inhabit ‘Region A’ of Szabó & Kálmán (2019), i.e. those plan-
ets having radii between 0.28 and 0.63 RJup. Planets orbiting
closer than NGTS-14Ab does, such as NGTS-4 b (West et al.
2019) and TOI-132 b (Díaz et al. 2020), tend to be denser be-
cause they have undergone evaporation, and lost much or all
of their primary, hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. The most
extreme example of this is the recently-discovered TOI-849 b
(Armstrong et al. 2020), thought to be the remnant core of a
giant planet. LTT 9779 b (Jenkins et al. 2020) on the other hand,
remains an intriguing exception – how it has apparently retained
its hydrogen-rich envelope is a mystery. NGTS-14Ab appears to
just far enough from its star that it is able to maintain a signifi-
cant atmosphere, resulting in a density similar to those of Uranus
and Neptune."

6.2. Stellar companion
"Motivated by the apparent stellar companion to NGTS-14A
(Section 2), and NGTS-14Ab’s position in the Neptunian desert
(as defined by Mazeh et al. 2016), we conducted a search for
stellar companions to other planet host stars in and around the
desert. The presence of a long-period companion may influence
the evolution of a planetary system, for instance by driving high-
eccentricity migration (Wu & Murray 2003)."
"We used the Gaia DR2 catalogue Gaia Collaboration et al.
(2018) to search for companions to stars that are listed in the
NASA Exoplanet Archive4 as hosting planets with orbital peri-
ods less than ten days, and masses measured to a precision of
less than 50 per cent. We then sub-divided the sample into plan-
ets lying above, in, or below the Neptunian desert (as defined
in the mass-period plane in Mazeh et al. 2016). This resulted in
73 systems in the desert, 339 systems above the desert, and 55
systems (70 planets) below the desert."
"We then queried Gaia DR2, using a cone search centred on
each object, conducted using the astroquery package (Ginsburg
et al. 2019). The radius of the search was chosen individually for
each object, so that it corresponds to a separation of 10 000 au.
We then applied the same technique as used in Section 2 to
search for nearby objects whose parallaxes and proper motions
match the planet host star within nσ. For n = 3, we identified
possible companions to 62 host stars (18.3 per cent) from above
the desert, ten (13.7 per cent) in the desert, and three (5.5 per
cent) below it. Combining the results for above and below the
desert, we find potential companions to 16.5 per cent of host stars
outside the desert, which is statistically indistinguishable from
the proportion inside the desert. These results are summarised in
Table 6."
"4 https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/, accessed
2020 June 17."
"To extend our binarity analysis to companions too close to be
resolved as individual objects in Gaia DR2, we used the renor-
malized unit weight error (RUWE) to the Gaia DR2 astrometric
solutions (Lindegren et al. 2018). A previous analysis conducted
using the RUWE statistic has suggested that there is tentative
evidence for increased binarity among hot Jupiter host stars (Be-
lokurov et al. 2020)."
"We adopt the threshold of RUWE = 1.4 suggested by the
Gaia team for distinguishing between well-behaved solutions
and those where an unseen additional body may impact the as-
trometry5. In Table 6, we report the number of systems for which
the RUWE statistic is greater than 1.4. We fail to find a signifi-
cant difference between the RUWE distributions for objects in-
side and outside the Neptunian desert. There is, however, a hint
of fewer companions below the desert, with no large RUWE val-
ues in this population."
"Finally, we attempted to compare the three populations of
exoplanet-hosting stars with their non-exoplanet host counter-
parts. To do this, for each exoplanet host star, we searched
Gaia DR2 for other nearby stars with similar properties. Specifi-
cally, we required that the G-band magnitude be within 0.25, the
GBP − GRP colour within 15 per cent, and the parallax within a
factor 2 (to exclude giant stars). Where multiple stars were found
to match these criteria, we selected one at random. We then per-
formed the same analysis on these non-exoplanet host stars as on
the hosts; the results are reported in the lower part of Table 6."
"We see fewer potential long-period companions with match-
ing parallax and proper motions amongst the non-host stars, sug-
gesting that the presence of a long-period companion increases
the probability of a star hosting an exoplanet in or above the
desert. Non-well behaved (RUWE > 1.4) astrometric solutions
are more likely to occur around stars not known to host an ex-"

"oplanet, perhaps indicating that short-period binaries are more
common in this population. We note, however, that selection ef-
fects may play a role here, in that short-period binarity of an
exoplanet candidate host star may complicate both photometric
and spectroscopic follow-up, and hence the confirmation of ex-
oplanets orbiting stars with close binary companions."
"Although this binarity analysis is inconclusive, future Gaia
data releases will include the identification of further gravitation-"
"ally bound companions to exoplanet host stars. This may allow
any trends with planet parameters (such as membership of the
Neptunian desert) to be elucidated."
