ABSTRACT
"We studied the accretion disc structure in the doubly imaged lensed quasar SDSS J1339+1310 using r-band light curves and UV-
visible to near-IR (NIR) spectra from the first 11 observational seasons after its discovery. The 2009−2019 light curves displayed
pronounced microlensing variations on different timescales, and this microlensing signal permitted us to constrain the half-light radius
of the 1930 Å continuum-emitting region. Assuming an accretion disc with an axis inclined at 60◦ to the line of sight, we obtained

emission lines, and the continuum luminosity at 1350, 3000, and 5100 Å, led to log (MBH/M�) = 8.6 ± 0.4. Thus, hot gas responsible
for the 1930 Å continuum emission is likely orbiting a 4.0 × 108M� black hole at an r1/2 of only a few tens of Schwarzschild radii."

1. Introduction
"Microlensing-induced variability in gravitationally lensed
quasars allows astronomers to determine the sizes of compact
continuum-emission regions in distant active galactic nuclei (e.g.
Wambsganss 1998). Hence, this extrinsic variability has become
an extremely powerful tool, as evidenced by results for QSO
2237+0305 (e.g. Kochanek 2004; Eigenbrod et al. 2008; Mos-
quera et al. 2013). In particular, visible continuum light curves
of a lensed quasar at redshift z ∼ 1−2 may provide radii for UV
continuum sources in the accretion disc around its central super-
massive black hole (SMBH). To gain a more complete perspec-
tive of the inner accretion flow, it is also necessary to measure the
SMBH mass from spectroscopic data (e.g. Morgan et al. 2018,
and references therein). For a Schwarzschild black hole, its mass
defines the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the gas in
the disc, and thus, it provides information about the relative sizes
of UV continuum sources. Furthermore, using data for 11 lensed
quasars, Morgan et al. (2010) found a physically relevant corre-
lation between disc size and SMBH mass. The precision of this
correlation continues to be improved by the addition of mea-
surements from new lensed quasar systems (Morgan et al. 2018;
Cornachione et al. 2020)."
"Inada et al. (2009) reported the discovery of a set of dou-
bly imaged gravitationally lensed quasars, which included SDSS
? Tables 1 and 3−4 are only available in electronic form at the"

"J1339+1310. The two images (A and B) of this quasar are lo-
cated at the same redshift, zs = 2.231, while the early-type
galaxy G at zl = 0.607 acts as a gravitational lens (Shalyapin
& Goicoechea 2014; Goicoechea & Shalyapin 2016). It is also
thought that stellar mass objects in G act as gravitational mi-
crolenses, strongly affecting image B (Shalyapin & Goicoechea
2014, henceforth Paper I). Thus, SDSS J1339+1310 is very well
suited to the study of its central engine from visible contin-
uum light curves and spectroscopic observations. In order to re-
produce observed microlensing variations via numerical simu-
lations, and measure the SMBH mass, reliable extinction and
(macro)lens models are also required. These models should rely
on robust observational constraints, some of which were pre-
sented in Table 1 of Paper I. In addition to the astro-photometric
solution in the last column of that table, we simultaneously ob-
tained the macrolens magnification1 ratio µB/µA = 0.175 ± 0.015
and the dust extinction ratio �G,B/�G,A = 1.33 ± 0.11 at 5500
Å in the G rest-frame using some emission line cores and nar-
row components of carbon emission lines that presumably come
from very extended regions not affected by microlensing (linear
extinction; Goicoechea & Shalyapin 2016, henceforth Paper II).
In Paper II, we also measured the time delay ∆tAB = 47+5−6 d (A is
leading), which is a critical quantity for accurately isolating the
microlensing-induced variability from the source quasar’s intrin-
sic variability."

instead to avoid any confusion with masses"

"In this paper, we mainly focus on the structure of the in-
ner accretion flow in SDSS J1339+1310. Sect. 2 presents r-band
light curves and UV-visible to near-IR (NIR) spectra spanning 11
years (2009−2019). Our extinction and lens models for the sys-
tem are described in Sect. 3. Sect. 4 is devoted to determining the
mass of the central SMBH, and the r–band microlensing vari-
ability and the size of the corresponding continuum source are
discussed in Sect. 5. Our conclusions appear in Sect. 6. Through-
out the paper, we use a flat cosmology with H0 = 70 km s−1
Mpc−1, ΩM = 0.3, and ΩΛ = 0.7 (Hinshaw et al. 2009)."
2. Observational data
2.1. Light curves in the r band
"Within the framework of the Gravitational LENses and DArk
MAtter (GLENDAMA) project2, whose objective is to perform
and analyse observations of a sample of ten gravitationally
lensed quasars (Gil-Merino et al. 2018), we are conducting an r-
band monitoring of SDSS J1339+1310 with the 2.0 m Liverpool
Telescope (LT; Steele et al. 2004). Light curves basically cov-
ering the first visibility season after the discovery of the double
quasar, as well as four additional seasons in 2012−2015, were
presented in Paper II. Here, we add four new seasons of LT data
(2016−2019) and combine our LT light curves with magnitudes
from other facilities. It is noteworthy that these complementary
data are used to fill the 2010−2011 gap in LT brightness records
and improve the sampling in other monitoring years."

"The updated light curves of SDSS J1339+1310 consist of
241 observing epochs (nights). On the LT, we used the RATCam
Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera and the Sloan r filter
with a central wavelength (CWL) of 6247 Å during 68 epochs,
and the IO:O CCD camera (Sloan r filter with CWL = 6187 Å)
during 145 epochs. The properties of both cameras, exposure
times, and pre-processing tasks were described in Paper II. For
the LT monitoring campaign between 2009 and 2019, the median
value of the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the seeing
disc was 1′′.40. The first part of the Panoramic Survey Telescope
and Rapid Response System project (PS1; Chambers et al. 2019)
also imaged the double quasar in the r band with CWL = 6215
Å. The PS1 Data Release 23 (Flewelling et al. 2020) included
warp frames at six epochs over the 2011−2014 period. Despite
the use of short exposures of only 40 s, the pixel scale of 0′′.258
pixel−1 and good seeing conditions (median FWHM of 1′′.07)
yielded useful photometric data (see below)."
"We also used frames of the lens system taken with the 1.5 m
Maidanak Telescope (MT) on six nights in July and December
2010. These observations were carried out with the SNUCAM
camera and the Bessell R filter (CWL = 6462 Å; Im et al. 2010).
SNUCAM uses a CCD detector with a 0′′.266 pixel−1 scale, and
several 180 or 300 s exposures were obtained at each of the
six epochs. Basic pre-processing tasks were then applied to MT
frames: bias subtraction, trimming, flat fielding, and World Co-
ordinate System mapping. The median FWHM was 1′′.15. In
addition, the science archive of the National Optical Astron-"

three 300 s exposures are available for each observation night.

"Our photometric technique is detailed in Paper II, but we give
a brief outline of main steps here. We obtained quasar fluxes
through point-spread function (PSF) fitting as well as the IRAF
(Tody 1986, 1993) and IMFITFITS (McLeod et al. 1998) soft-
ware programs. The photometric model consisted of two PSFs
(images A and B), a de Vaucouleurs profile convolved with the
PSF (light distribution of G) and a constant sky background, and
it was applied to all LT, PS1, MT, and ST frames. The Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) r-band magnitude of a reference star
was used for calibrating quasar magnitudes, and typical errors
of new LT data were estimated from root-mean-square devia-
tions between magnitudes on consecutive nights (see Paper II).
MT errors were derived from standard deviations of magnitudes
on each observation night, while we adopted the typical errors
in LT records as the PS1 and ST photometric uncertainties. The
11-year light curves are available in Table 1 at the CDS: Column
1 lists the observing date (MJD−50 000), Cols. 2−3 give mag-
nitudes and magnitude errors of A, and Cols. 4−5 give magni-
tudes and magnitude errors of B. These curves are also displayed
in Figure 1. Although we mostly use observations in standard r
bands (in 219 out of 241 epochs), there are data at slightly redder
wavelengths in 22 epochs. This results in an effective, weighted
average wavelength of 6237 Å, which translates to a UV contin-
uum emission at 1930 Å. We also note that the LT data are in
reasonably good agreement with those from PS1 and ST."
"The light curves over the full observing period 2009−2019
were initially used to cross-check the time delay measured in
Paper II. In Appendix A, we confirm the delay based on a shorter"

"monitoring period and show that the adopted error bar is very
conservative."
2.2. UV-visible-NIR spectra
"Spectroscopic observations of SDSS J1339+1310 were also per-
formed between 2009 and 2019. Main details are incorporated
into Table 2, and observing epochs are indicated in Figure 1.
The calibrated SDSS-BOSS spectra are publicly available in
the SDSS database5. However, the BOSS spectrograph collected
light into a 2′′-diameter optical fibre (Dawson et al. 2013), which
was centred on image A in the first epoch and on image B in the
second. Hence, the two-epoch observations do not provide clean
spectra of A or B. For instance, in the first epoch, although the
spectral energy distribution mainly corresponds to A, a signifi-
cant contribution of B and the lensing galaxy is also expected.
We also conducted long-slit spectroscopy with the GTC, the
TNG, and the NOT as part of the GLENDAMA project. The
GTC-OSIRIS observations allowed us to resolve A, B, and G,
and accurately extract their individual spectra (Paper I; Paper II).
Using the R500R grism, the C iv emission line in quasar spectra
appears close to its blue edge, whereas the Mg ii emission line
is located on its red edge. The C iv emission of the quasar is,
however, seen in the central part of the R500B grism wavelength
range. Additionally, our spectroscopic follow-up of both quasar
images with NOT-ALFOSC and TNG-NICS, provided relatively
noisy shapes for the C iv emission line and the first detection of
Hα emission. These recent spectra will be presented in a future
paper and not further considered here."
"The HST Data Archive6 also contains slitless spectroscopy
of SDSS J1339+1310 with the WFC3 instrument. The obser-
vations were made using the G280 grism in the UVIS channel,
and were presented by Lusso et al. (2018). Unfortunately, Lusso
et al. (2018) only displayed resulting spectra for the two quasar
images in their Fig. 2. Thus, we downloaded the HST-WFC3-
UVIS original data and then extracted the quasar spectra that are
plotted in Figure 2. The overall shape of +1st order spectra (la-
belled as A+ and B+) agrees with that of −1st order ones (A−"

"and B−). However, the throughput of the G280 grism is higher
for the +1st order, and the associated spectra are less noisy. We
accordingly take A+ and B+ as our final data. These HST-WFC3-
UVIS spectra are available in tabular format at the CDS: Table
3a includes wavelengths in Å (Col. 1), and fluxes and flux errors
of A in 10−17 erg cm−2 s−1 Å−1 (Cols. 2 and 3), while Table 3b
includes wavelengths in Å (Col. 1), and fluxes and flux errors of
B in 10−17 erg cm−2 s−1 Å−1 (Cols. 2 and 3). The spectral energy
distributions show the C iv emission line around 5000 Å (∼1550
Å in the quasar rest-frame)."
"We also downloaded and analysed observations in the three
arms (UVB, VIS, and NIR) of VLT-XSHOOTER (Vernet et al.
2011). These are publicly available at the ESO Science Archive
Facility7, and details on the observing programme are given in"

"Table 2. For each of the two epochs, we used the 2700 (3×900)
s exposure and a three-component fitting to resolve the spectra
of A, B, and G. Our multi-component extraction technique is ro-
bust and has been recently applied to some lens systems (e.g.
Sluse et al. 2007; Shalyapin & Goicoechea 2017; Goicoechea &
Shalyapin 2019). The model we used can be described in a nut-
shell as follows: three 1D Moffat profiles in the spatial direction
for each wavelength bin. Telluric absorption in the VIS and NIR
arms was also corrected via the Molecfit software (Smette et al.
2015; Kausch et al. 2015). Final calibrated spectra of A, B, and
G on 6 April 2017 are available at the CDS: Table 4 contains
wavelengths in Å (Col. 1), fluxes and flux errors of A (Cols. 2
and 3), fluxes and flux errors of B (Cols. 4 and 5), and fluxes and
flux errors of G (Cols. 6 and 7). The wavelength coverage ranges
from 3050−20700 Å (UVB, VIS, and NIR arms), and the fluxes
and their errors are expressed in units of 10−17 erg cm−2 s−1 Å−1.
These VLT-XSHOOTER spectra are also shown in Fig. 3. In ad-
dition to C iv emission of the quasar in the UVB arm spectra
(top panel), Mg ii and Hβ emissions are also seen around 9000 Å
(∼2800 Å in the quasar rest-frame; middle panel) and 15700 Å
(∼4860 Å in the quasar rest-frame; bottom panel), respectively."
3. Extinction and lens models
"The position on the sky of SDSS J1339+1310 was used to es-
timate its extinction in the Milky Way at three wavelengths of
interest. Based on the results of Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011),
the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database8 provided Milky Way
transmission factors (�MW) of 0.93 at 4362 Å, 0.98 at 9693 Å,
and 0.99 at 16478 Å. These wavelengths correspond to 1350,
3000, and 5100 Å in the quasar rest-frame (see Sect. 4). While
the Galaxy produces equal extinction in both quasar images,
the lensing galaxy gives rise to a differential extinction between
images. According to Paper II, emission lines in GTC-OSIRIS
spectra and a linear extinction law in G (e.g. Prévot et al. 1984)
lead to a dust extinction ratio (ratio between the transmission of
B and that of A) of 1.33 ± 0.11 at 5500 Å in the lens rest-frame.
Additionally, GTC-OSIRIS and VLT-XSHOOTER spectra indi-
cate that Mg ii absorption at the lens redshift is much stronger
in A than in B. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the
lens galaxy’s dust essentially affects image A, which translates
to transmission factors (�G,A) of 0.56 ± 0.09, 0.77 ± 0.06, and
0.86 ± 0.04 for light emission at 1350, 3000, and 5100 Å, re-
spectively (adopting an achromatic transmission factor �G,B = 1
for image B)."
"We also modelled the (macro)lensing mass using observa-
tional constraints in previous papers. We took the image posi-
tions, and the galaxy position, effective radius, ellipticity, and
position angle in the fifth column of Table 1 of Paper I as con-
straints. The image fluxes were also considered to derive lens
models. These fluxes are consistent with the macrolens magni-
fication ratio measured in Paper II (see Sect. 1). The overall set
of constraints allowed us to fit 11 free parameters with d.o.f.
= 0, where ’d.o.f.’ denotes the degrees of freedom. We used
the GRAVLENS/LENSMODEL software (Keeton 2001), adopt-
ing a gravitational lens scenario that consists of three compo-
nents. De Vaucouleurs (DV) and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW;
e.g. Navarro et al. 1996, 1997) mass profiles describe the stellar
(light traces mass) and dark components of the main deflector
G, whereas an external shear (ES) accounts for additional de-
flectors."

"Notes. The ten lens models fit the observational constraints with χ2 ∼ 0 (d.o.f. = 0; see main text). The parameter f∗ represents the luminous mass
of G relative to that for the model without dark matter halo ( f∗ = 1). We list the convergence (κ), stellar to total convergence ratio (κ∗/κ), shear
(γ), and macrolens magnification (µ) for each model and image position. The last column shows the predicted time delay between images for each
model."
"The sequence of DV+NFW+ES models started by assuming
that all mass of G is traced by light, namely constant mass-to-
light ratio model. The free parameters of such a model were the
position, mass scale, effective radius, ellipticity, and position an-
gle of the DV profile, the strength and direction of the ES, and
the position and flux of the source quasar. By progressively de-
creasing the luminous component of G and adding a concentric
dark matter halo, we completed a sequence of ten realistic lens
models with f∗ ranging between 1.0 and 0.1, where f∗ is the mass
of G in stars (DV profile) relative to its maximum value in the
absence of a dark matter halo (we note that f∗ was called fM/L
in several previous papers; e.g. Morgan et al. 2018; Cornachione
et al. 2020). For the f∗ < 1 models, the free parameters were the
common position, ellipticity, and position angle for both compo-
nents of G (DV and NFW profiles), the effective radius of the DV
profile, the mass scale of the NFW profile, the strength and di-
rection of the ES, and the position and flux of the source quasar."
"Some local parameters (at image positions) of the
DV+NFW+ES models are shown in Table 5. The last three
columns of Table 5 give the magnification factor of A and B
for each time delay, so we took the measured delay (∆tAB = 47+5−6
d; Paper II, and discussion in Appendix A) as an additional con-
straint to estimate reliable intervals for µA and µB. First, results
for the models in the range 0.6 ≤ f∗ ≤ 0.8 were used to con-
struct power-law cross-correlations between magnifications and
delays. If y = µA (or µB) and x = ∆tAB, we derived laws y ∝ x−α,
where the power-law index is α ≈ 2. Second, these x-y relation-
ships and the extreme values of the measured delay interval (x =
41 and 52 d) led to µA = 9.4 ± 2.2 and µB = 1.6 ± 0.4."
4. Black hole mass
"For a given broad emission line, it is thought that the line-
emitting gas is distributed within the gravitational potential of
the central SMBH, so there is a relationship between its motion,
the size of the region, and the SMBH mass (MBH; e.g. Vester-
gaard & Peterson 2006, and references therein). The gas motion
is responsible for the emission-line width, while the radius of
the line-emitting region scales roughly as the square root of the
continuum luminosity (e.g. Koratkar & Gaskell 1991; Bentz et
al. 2009). Hence, we aimed to use the single-epoch spectra of
SDSS J1339+1310 in Table 2 to measure the black hole mass
of the quasar. Although there are spectra for the two quasar im-
ages, image B is strongly affected by microlensing. Thus, we"
"only considered image A when estimating MBH. We were pri-
marily interested in the width of the C iv, Mg ii, and Hβ emission
lines, as well as the continuum flux for emissions at 1350, 3000,
and 5100 Å (e.g. Vestergaard & Peterson 2006; Vestergaard &
Osmer 2009). After the de-redshifting of the observed spectra of
A to the quasar rest-frame, λrest = λobs/(1 + zs), if the continuum
flux Fcont,A(λrest) is in 10−17 erg cm−2 s−1 Å−1 and the corre-
sponding luminosity Lcont(λrest) is in erg s−1, then both quantities
are related through the equation"

a multi-component decomposition of its profile in both images.
For clarity, the carbon line profile in A is also depicted in the
top panel of Figure 4. After subtracting the local continuum, the
residual signal is modelled as a sum of three Gaussian contribu-
tions. We focused on the C iv total (broad + narrow) emission
line and calculated the square root of its second moment (σline;
Peterson et al. 2004). The line width was then estimated from the

"= 3978 km s−1. Moreover, the continuum flux at λrest = 1350 Å in
May 2014 reached a level of 5.9 × 10−17 erg cm−2 s−1 Å−1, that
is Fcont,A(1350Å) = 5.9. We additionally considered the HST-
WFC3-UVIS spectrum of A and analysed the region around the
C iv line (see the bottom panel of Figure 4). Thus, we obtained
an independent line width σl = 4294 km s−1 based on HST data.
Despite the fact that both spectra (GTC and HST) yield simi-
lar values of σl, the Fcont,A(1350Å) values in the two observing
epochs were very different. The continuum flux in February 2016
was Fcont,A(1350Å) = 15.6. A dramatic change in the r-band flux
between May 2014 (minimum level) and February 2016 (maxi-
mum level) is also seen in Figure 1. From Eq. (1), accounting for
uncertainties in the dust extinction and macrolens magnification
of image A, we found log[Lcont(1350Å)] = 45.30 ± 0.13 (GTC)
and 45.72 ± 0.13 (HST)."
"Vestergaard & Peterson (2006) derived equations for esti-
mating the central black hole mass in a quasar from the C iv
line width and Lcont(1350Å), and we used their Eq. (8) to ob-
tain C iv-based masses. The spectral observations in May 2014
(GTC) and February 2016 (HST) led to log [MBH(C iv)/M�] ="

"8.62 ± 0.33 and 8.91 ± 0.33, respectively. We have not consid-
ered uncertainties generated by errors in σl and Lcont(1350Å)
since the uncertainty in log [MBH(C iv)/M�] is dominated by an
intrinsic scatter of ±0.33 dex rather than contributions from such
errors. An error of 100 km s−1 in σl propagates to ±0.02 dex in
log [MBH(C iv)/M�], whereas the uncertainties in Lcont(1350Å)
propagate to ±0.07 dex in the logarithm of the mass. Typical
mass logarithms of 8.56 (GTC) and 8.83 (HST) were also in-
ferred from Eq. (2) of Park et al. (2013)."
"Although both C iv-based masses are consistent within er-
rors, and this would permit us to ’confidently’ calculate the av-
erage, we carefully analysed the Mg ii and Hβ emission lines in
the VLT-XSHOOTER spectrum of A in April 2017. These VLT
observations were made at an epoch for which the r-band flux
reached an intermediate level (see Figure 1), and therefore they
may help to decide whether one of the two C iv-based estimates
is relatively biased or not. In Figure 5, we show multi-component
decompositions of the Mg ii and Hβ profiles (see the caption for
details). First, we measured FWHM(Mg ii) = 3984 km s−1 and"

files in SDSS J1339+1310A. The data correspond to VLT-XSHOOTER
observations in April 2017. The original wavelength bins contain a
very noisy signal (lighter blue), so a nine-point median filter is used
to smooth original data (darker blue). In the top panel, after subtracting
a power-law continuum, the residual signal is modelled as a sum of two
contributions, i.e. Mg ii broad emission (Gaussian curve around the ver-
tical dotted line) and Fe ii pseudo-continuum. There is no evidence of a
Mg ii narrow line or an additional very broad component. The contin-
uum windows at 2195−2215 Å and 3020−3070 Å are highlighted using
grey rectangles, and the Fe ii pseudo-continuum is created from the Fe ii
template of Tsuzuki et al. (2006) convolved with a Gaussian function
to account for the Doppler broadening of Fe ii lines. The bottom panel
displays the decomposition in the spectral region around the Hβ emis-
sion. The grey rectangle highlights one of the two windows that we used
to remove a power-law continuum under emission lines (3790−3810 Å
and 5080−5100 Å; Kuraszkiewicz et al. 2002). The residual signal is
decomposed into four Gaussian components: Hβ broad + Hβ narrow +
[O iii] doublet, plus the Fe ii contribution from two individual lines in
the spectral range 4750−5100 Å (e.g. Kovačević et al. 2010). Vertical
dotted lines show the centres of the four Gaussians."

5. Accretion disc size from microlensing variability
"We analysed the r-band light curves using the Monte Carlo anal-
ysis technique in Kochanek (2004). The method is fully de-
scribed in that paper, but we provide a brief summary here. Us-
ing the convergence κ, convergence due to stars κ∗, shear γ, and
shear position angle θγ from each of the models in our sequence
(see Table 5), we generated a set of 40 magnification patterns per
macro model to represent the microlensing conditions at the lo-
cation of each lensed image. Our model sequence has 10 macro
models in the range 0.1 ≤ f∗ ≤ 1.0 (see Sect. 3), so we generated
a total of 400 sets of magnification patterns."
"Each of the 400 realisations was generated randomly using
the inverse ray-shooting technique as described by Kochanek
et al. (2006), the distribution of stellar masses for which were
drawn from the Galactic bulge IMF of Gould (2000) in which
dN(M)/dM ∝ M−1.3. The square magnification patterns repre-
sent a region 40 rE on a side, where rE is the source-plane pro-
jection of the Einstein radius of a 1M� star. With dimensions of
8192 × 8192 pixels, each pixel represents a physical distance of"
"1.60 × 1014〈M∗/M�〉1/2 cm on the source plane, where 〈M∗〉 is
the mean mass of a lens galaxy star."
"We convolved the magnification patterns with a simple
Shakura & Sunyaev (1973) thin disc model for the surface
brightness profile of the accretion disc at a range of source sizes
14.0 ≤ log(r̂s/〈M∗/M�〉1/2 cm) ≤ 18.0. The quantity r̂s is a thin
disc scale radius where the hat indicates that the distance is be-
ing reported in ’Einstein units’ in which quantities are scaled by
a factor of the mean mass of a star in the lens galaxy. For exam-
ple, converting a scale radius or velocity in Einstein units into
a physical unit is accomplished using rs = r̂s〈M∗/M�〉1/2 and
ve = v̂e〈M∗/M�〉1/2, respectively."
"In essence our technique is an attempt to reproduce the ob-
served microlensing variability using a realistic model for condi-
tions in the lens galaxy. We run our model magnification patterns
by a range of model source sizes on a range of trajectories in an
attempt to fit the observed data. According to Bayes’ theorem,
the likelihood of the set of physical ξp and trajectory ξt parame-
ters given the data D is"
"P(ξp, ξt|D) ∝ P(D|ξp, ξt)P(ξp)P(ξt), (2)"
"where P(ξt) and P(ξp) are the prior probabilities for the trajectory
and physical variables, respectively. In a given trial, we chose
the velocity randomly from the uniform logarithmic prior 1.0 ≤
log[v̂e/(〈M∗/M�〉1/2 km s−1)] ≤ 5.0. We evaluated the goodness-
of-fit with the chi-square statistic in real time during each trial,
and for computational efficiency we aborted and discarded any
fit with χ2/d.o.f. ≥ 1.6 since they do not contribute significantly
to the Bayesian integrals. We attempted 107 Monte Carlo fits per
set of magnification patterns for a grand total of 4 × 109 trials.
Of those trials, ∼ 105 met our χ2 threshold, and the remainder of
our analysis was performed on those solutions. In Figure 6, we
display examples of five good fits to the observed microlensing
variability."
"We generated a statistical prior for the effective veloc-
ity between source, lens and observer using four components."

ing the northern (vO,n = −110.7 km s−1) and eastern (vO,e =

sight to the target. Following Bolton et al. (2008), we estimated

the peculiar velocity of source and lens using their redshifts, fol-

"carried out an analogous Bayesian integral to find the probabil-
ity density for the source size in Einstein units, dP(r̂s)/d log(r̂s),
which we display in the left panel of Figure 8."
"Now, to convert our result from Einstein units to true phys-
ical units, we developed a probability density for the mean mi-
crolens mass 〈M∗〉 (see the right panel of Figure 7) by convolv-
ing the prior on ve with the probability density on v̂e from the
simulation since v̂e = ve〈M∗/M�〉−1/2. To find the probability
density for the source size in physical units, dP(rs)/d log rs, we
convolved the probability density for 〈M∗〉 with that of r̂s. As-
suming an inclination angle of 60◦, we display the resulting dis-
tribution for the half-light radius (r1/2) in the right panel of Fig-
ure 8. In Fig. 8, we also show the probability density for r1/2
using an assumed uniform prior on the mean microlens mass
0.1 ≤ 〈M∗/M�〉 ≤ 1.0. While the two results are fully consistent,
we promote the measurement without the uniform mass prior,
the expectation value for which is log{(r1/2/cm)[cos i/0.5]1/2} =
15.4+0.3"
"−0.4. This measurement is the half-light radius of the quasar
continuum source at the rest-frame effective wavelength λrest =
1930 Å (see the end of Sect. 2.1)."
"We also investigated the impact of uncertainty in the
time delay on our measured microlensing sizes. We repeated
our microlensing analysis at both the lower and upper 1σ
bounds of the time delay, 41 and 52 d. We found size
measurements of log{(r1/2/cm)[cos i/0.5]1/2} = 15.5+0.3−0.4 and
log{(r1/2/cm)[cos i/0.5]1/2} = 15.4+0.3−0.3, respectively. These are
fully consistent with the size measurement for the 47-d delay,
demonstrating that time delay uncertainty has a small impact on
the size."
6. Conclusions
"We measured the virial mass of the SMBH at the centre of SDSS
J1339+1310 using optical-NIR spectra of image A. This resulted
in log (MBH/M�) = 8.6 ± 0.4. Our black hole mass estimate is
robust against the choice of the emission line and continuum lu-
minosity, and it takes into account the macrolens magnification,
and the dust extinction in the Milky Way and lensing galaxy.
Additional disregarded effects (e.g. extinction in the quasar host
galaxy and microlens magnification) are expected to play a sec-
ondary role or even offset each other. While it is difficult to ac-
curately quantify these effects, when correction factors ranging
from 2/3 to 3/2 are applied to the denominator of Eq. (1), changes
in the logarithm of the mass (<∼ 0.1 dex) are well below its un-
certainty. There are previous efforts to obtain virial black hole
masses from samples of lensed quasars (e.g. Peng et al. 2006;
Greene et al. 2010; Assef et al. 2011). The sixth and eighth
columns of Table 5 in Assef et al. (2011) show black hole mass
estimates based on Balmer lines for a sample of twelve objects.
A quarter of the 12 lensed quasars harbour SMBHs with a typi-
cal mass ≤ 4.5 × 108M�, and SDSS J1339+1310 belongs to this
population of light objects."
"For a black hole of mass MBH = 4.0 × 108M�, the gravi-
tational radius is rg = GMBH/c2 = 5.9 × 1013 cm. This black
hole mass also determines the ISCO radius of the gas in a
Schwarzschild geometry, which amounts to rISCO = 3.5 × 1014
cm. In addition, the observed microlensing variability in the
r band allowed us to constrain the half-light radius of the re-
gion where the UV continuum at 1930 Å is emitted. We found
log{(r1/2/cm)[cos i/0.5]1/2} = 15.4+0.3−0.4, leading to a radial size of
about 2.5 × 1015 cm ∼ 7 rISCO for i = 60◦. Therefore, although
UV observations are required to resolve the ISCO around the
SMBH powering SDSS J1339+1310, our microlensing analy-"
"sis resolves gas rings that are relatively close to the inner edge
of the accretion disc. Moreover, using the simple thin-disc the-
ory of Shakura & Sunyaev (1973), our two measurements (MBH
and r1/2) yielded an Eddington factor log (L/ηLE) = 0.8 ± 1.3
for i = 60◦. Despite the large uncertainty, the central value of
this factor is consistent with a reasonable radiative efficiency
η ≈ 0.16 (L/LE)."
"In Figure 8, we also display the probability density for the
half-light radius of the accretion disc in SDSS J1339+1310
scaled to λrest = 2500 Å according to the standard thin-disc
physics (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). The expectation value
for the 2500 Å half-light radius log{(r1/2/cm)[cos i/0.5]1/2} =
15.5+0.3"
"−0.4 is at 21−107 rg for an inclination of 60
◦. This 1σ inter-"
"val is barely consistent with the prediction of the accretion disc
size - black hole mass relation (Morgan et al. 2010) as updated
by Morgan et al. (2018)"
"log[r1/2/cm] = (16.24± 0.12) + (0.66± 0.15) log(MBH/10
9M�),"
"which predicts an accretion disc half-light radius at 2500 Å
of 106 ≤ r1/2/rg ≤ 243 for a black hole of mass MBH =
4.0×108M�. The minor discrepancy could easily be explained by
the scatter in the SDSS J1339+1310 black hole mass estimate. If
the disc is more edge-on than our 60◦ assumption, the inclination
correction would also bring the measurement into closer agree-
ment with the Morgan et al. (2018) scaling relation. However, it
is important to realise that very high inclinations are unlikely in
the presence of a dusty torus surrounding the gas disc (Antonucci
1993).

V. N. Shalyapin et al.: Resolving the inner accretion flow towards the central supermassive black hole in SDSS J1339+1310"
"Appendix A: Time delay through the updated
dataset"
"The light curves of the two images of SDSS J1339+1310 display
significant parallel variations on long timescales (see Fig. 1).
Therefore, long-timescale variations must be closely related to
quasar physics, providing an opportunity to estimate the time
delay between A and B. We focused on the most densely sam-
pled seasons, and as such, data in 2010−2011 were excluded for
the time delay analysis. A reduced chi-square minimisation was
then used to match the light curves of both images. In addition
to a time delay ∆tAB, we considered a magnitude offset ∆mAB
for each of the nine seasons in 2009 and 2012−2019. These sea-
sonal offsets account for long-timescale extrinsic (microlensing)
variability. Our technique is fully described in Sect. 5.1 of Paper
II, and it relies on a comparison between the curve A and the
time-shifted and binned curve B. The time-shifted magnitudes
of B are binned around the dates of A, and the semisize of bins
is denoted by α."
"For α = 20 d, in Table A.1, we compare the best solution
in Paper II and the new best solution through the updated light
curves. The combined light curve for this new solution is also
shown in the nine panels of Fig. A.1. As expected, there is a good
agreement between the global trends of both images. Although
a reasonably good agreement is also seen within some particular
season (e.g. 2009, 2015 and 2018), short-timescale microlens-
ing variability is present (e.g. intra-seasonal events/gradients in
2013−2014, 2016 and 2019). This rapid extrinsic variability is
not taken into account in our reduced chi-square minimisation
(see discussion below). From standard bins with α = 20 d, we
also found a 47-d solution that is practically as good as the one
in the third column of Table A.1. Additionally, using 1000 pairs
of synthetic curves (see Paper II), we derived best solutions for
α = 15, 20, and 25 d. The distribution of 3000 delays resulting
from simulated light curves and a reasonable range of α values,
permited us to estimate uncertainties. Only delays within the in-
terval from 46 to 50 d have an individual probability greater than
10%, leading to an overall probability of 85%, and hence a con-
servative 1σ measurement ∆tAB = 48 ± 2 d. This delay interval
basically coincides with the 1σ measurement from the seasonal
microlensing model in Paper II (∆tAB = 47+2−1 d)."
"In Paper II, we also tried to account for all extrinsic vari-
ability using cubic splines and the PyCS software (Tewes et al.
2013; Bonvin et al. 2016). However, such a method did not pro-
duce very robust results because it was not originally designed
to model extrinsic variations that are as fast as or faster than in-
trinsic ones (Tewes et al. 2013). Despite this fact, we obtained
a 1σ confidence interval ∆tAB = 47+5−6 d using simulated light
curves and a weak prior on the true time delay (i.e. it cannot
be shorter than 30 d or longer than 60 d). Hence, the spline-
like microlensing model led to a significantly enlarged error bar,
which is adopted in this paper. We think this 1σ interval is ex-
aggeratedly large, and thus very conservative. First, considering
only long-timescale extrinsic variability, a decade of monitoring
observations with the LT and other telescopes strongly supports
an error bar covering the delay range of 46−50 d (see above).
This model exclusively has one non-linear parameter (time de-
lay) and is appropriate. It accounts for extrinsic variations that
distort the apparent long-term intrinsic signal, while the short-
term extrinsic signal is assumed to be an extra-noise. Second,
when all extrinsic variability is modelled, one deals with a com-
plex non-linear optimisation, which may yield local minima, de-
generacies, and so on. We have not yet found a fair way to si-
multaneously fit the delay and all microlensing activity. Despite"

are positive because we use the opposite sign to that in Paper II."
