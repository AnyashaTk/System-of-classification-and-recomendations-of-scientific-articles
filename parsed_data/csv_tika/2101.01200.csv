"Transient non-Gaussian noise in gravitational wave detectors, commonly referred to as glitches,
pose challenges for detection and inference of the astrophysical properties of detected signals when
the two are coincident in time. Current analyses aim toward modeling and subtracting the glitches
from the data using a flexible, morphology-independent model in terms of sine-Gaussian wavelets
before the signal source properties are inferred using templates for the compact binary signal. We
present a new analysis of gravitational wave data that contain both a signal and glitches by simul-
taneously modeling the compact binary signal in terms of templates and the instrumental glitches
using sine-Gaussian wavelets. The model for the glitches is generic and can thus be applied to a
wide range of glitch morphologies without any special tuning. The simultaneous modeling of the
astrophysical signal with templates allows us to efficiently separate the signal from the glitches, as
we demonstrate using simulated signals injected around real O2 glitches in the two LIGO detectors.
We show that our new proposed analysis can separate overlapping glitches and signals, estimate
the compact binary parameters, and provide ready-to-use glitch-subtracted data for downstream
inference analyses."
I. INTRODUCTION
"During the first half of their third observing run (O3a),
the advanced ground based gravitational wave (GW) de-
tectors LIGO [1] and Virgo [2] observed an astrophysi-
cal transient signal about every 5 days of data [3]. The
large detection rate increases the chance of observing an
event while one of the detectors experiences transient non
Gaussian noise, also known as instrumental glitches. In-
deed, this scenario has come to pass for one event from
the second observing run (O2) [4] and 8 events from the
first half of the third observing run [3]."
"Such coincidences are expected to become even more
frequent in the coming years. Planned improvements in
the detectors’ sensitivity will be directly reflected by an
even larger rate of astrophysical discoveries [5]. More-
over, O3a was characterized by an increase in the rate
of glitch occurrence in the two LIGO detectors, a trend
that might persist during the fourth observing run (O4)
as the decreased average detector noise might help reveal
weaker sources of transient noise. For example the rate of
glitches in the LIGO Livingston detector increased from
0.2 per minute in O2 to 0.8 per minute in O3a [3]."
"The presence of a non Gaussian noise feature in the
data, a glitch, poses challenges for nearly all inference
analyses. GW inference is based on a model for the de-
tector noise, expressed through the likelihood function.
In the absence of glitches, detector noise is colored and
Gaussian to a very good approximation [6], with a spec-
trum that is described through the noise power spectral
density (PSD). The above considerations give rise to a
Gaussian likelihood function whose variance is the noise
PSD, a choice that is almost ubiquitous [7, 8]. Different"
"choices for estimating the PSD or treating its uncertainty
can result in different functional forms for the likelihood,
but they are all based on the assumption of colored Gaus-
sian noise [9, 10]."
"Since instrumental glitches violate the basic assump-
tions of GW inference, they need to be effectively miti-
gated before the data are analyzed. One option is to re-
move the offending data all together [4, 11–13], which can
be done quickly, allowing for low latency estimation of
source parameters that enable followup observations [4].
The downside of this approach is that part of the astro-
physical signal is lost making it prohibitive for binary
black hole (BBH) signals whose duration is comparable
to the glitch duration. In order to avoid signal, and thus
information loss, another option is to model the glitch
and regress it from the data, leaving behind not only the
astrophysical signal but also the Gaussian noise. This
approach is the topic of the current study1."
"The wide variety of glitch morphologies, and even vari-
ations within a certain glitch type, make constructing ex-
act models for glitches challenging [21]. A more flexible
approach is based on BayesWave [22, 23] which models
various components of the GW data in a morphology-
independent way. Non-Gaussian features in the data
are modeled in terms of sums of sine-Gaussian wavelets
whose number and parameters are marginalized over with"
"1 An independent effort to mitigate the effect of broadband and/or
nonstationary detector noise is based on information from auxil-
iary sensors [14–20]. This approach does not remove entire data
segments either and thus is not expected to lead to loss of infor-
mation."

"a suite of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Re-
versible Jump MCMC (RJMCMC) [24] samplers. Coher-
ent features (i.e. features that appear in all detectors in a
manner consistent with an astrophysical signal originat-
ing from a specific sky location) are modeled by a single
sum of wavelets that is projected onto the detector net-
work; these features are interpreted as having an astro-
physical origin. Incoherent features are instead modeled
by independent sums of wavelets in each GW detector
and are interpreted as instrumental glitches. The PSD
of the Gaussian noise is also modeled in terms of splines
and Lorentzians using an algorithm sometimes known as
BayesLine [6, 25]. BayesWave and BayesLine are fully
integrated and we will refer to the combined analysis with
the name BayesWave in this paper."
"Modeling instrumental glitches with BayesWave and
subtracting them from the data in order to make ready-
to-use data for downstream inference has been a stan-
dard step of LIGO/Virgo analyses since O2 [3, 4]. The
GW signal from the first binary neutron star (BNS)
coalescence detection, GW170817, overlapped with a
glitch in the LIGO Livingston detector approximately
1.1s before coalescence [4]. The glitch was modeled with
BayesWave’s glitch model in terms of a sum of wavelets
and removed from the data, a procedure documented and
released in [26]. Despite the glitch overlapping with the
actual astrophysical signal, the subtraction process was
robust against inadvertently removing the signal together
with the glitch. The reason is that the specific glitch was
short in duration (less than a second) and extended in
frequency, unlike the signal that lasted for about 2 min-
utes in the detector sensitive band. As such, the sine-
Gaussian wavelets that would fit the glitch and the signal
are distinct in terms of their time-frequency features; the
wavelets that model the glitch are short and hence do
not model the long-lasting BNS signal. This procedure
was further shown to not introduce biases in the astro-
physical parameter inference of the underlying signal by
analyzing simulated signals injected on instances of the
same glitch type in LIGO Livingston data [27]."
"Motivated by the success of this first attempt at glitch
mitigation and in preparation for the increased detection
rate of O3, BayesWave was extended to be able to si-
multaneously model both the signal and the glitch [23].
Both signals and glitches are modeled with a sum of sine-
Gaussian wavelets, the only difference being that the sig-
nal is coherent across the detectors in the network, while
the glitch is not. The analysis effectively uses data from
all detectors available to determine which part of the non
Gaussian data are coherent (and would thus correspond
to an astrophysical signal), and which part is incoherent
(and would thus correspond to an instrumental glitch).
The combined signal+glitch analysis was applied to one
O3a detection [3], enabling glitch mitigation even for data
that contained short-duration BBH signals."
"The signal+glitch analysis models compact binary co-
alescence (CBC) signals in terms of wavelets, and is thus
agnostic to the signal morphology. However, accurate"
"models exist for CBCs in terms of solutions to the Ein-
stein field equations that are routinely used both for de-
tection and parameter estimation. In this paper we take
another step toward efficient separation of CBCs and
glitches by constructing an analysis that simultaneously
models the CBC signal in terms of CBC templates and
the glitch in terms of sine-Gaussian wavelets. Similar to
the initial glitch-only analysis and the subsequent sig-
nal+glitch analysis, we also model and marginalize over
the detector noise PSD. We test our analysis using public
O2 data that contain common glitch types and simulated
CBC signals. We demonstrate that we can efficiently sep-
arate the glitch from the CBC, estimate the CBC param-
eters, and provide ready-to-use glitch-subtracted data for
downstream inference analyses."
"The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II
we describe the updates to the standard BayesWave algo-
rithm in terms of the CBC analysis. In Sec. III we apply
our analysis to simulated signal overlapping with known
detector glitches from O2 data. In Sec. IV we analyze
a selection of detected signals, namely GW170817 and
GW150914. Finally, in Sec. V we conclude and point to
future work."
II. GENERAL ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION
"The combined BayesWave algorithm is presented in de-
tail in [23] and here we describe only the features relevant
to our study. BayesWave simultaneously models signals,
glitches, and Gaussian noise in GW data by means of
different models. The signal model describes astrophysi-
cal signals through a sum of Morlet Gabor wavelets that
are coherent across the detector network. The number
of wavelets and the parameters of each are marginalized
over, as are the extrinsic parameters that determine how
the signal is projected in each detector. The glitch model
describes instrumental glitches with an incoherent sum
of Morlet Gabor wavelets whose number and parameters
are again marginalized over. Glitch power in each detec-
tor is described by an independent sum of such wavelets.
The noise model describes the Gaussian noise PSD with
a broadband spline model and sharp Lorentzians. As
above, the number of spline points and Lorentzians as
well as their parameters are marginalized over."
"In order to sample the multidimensional posterior den-
sity of all models, BayesWave uses a blocked Gibbs sam-
pler that takes turns between sampling each model with
completely independent MCMC or RJMCMC samplers.
This includes (i) an RJMCMC that samples the signal
and glitch wavelet parameters, (ii) an MCMC that sam-
ples the signal extrinsic parameters, and (iii) an RJM-
CMC that samples the splines and Lorentzians for the
noise PSD. Each sampler in turn updates its parame-
ters for a predetermined number of iterations, typically
O(102), while all other parameters are kept fixed. For ex-
ample, the extrinsic sampler updates the extrinsic signal
parameters while the wavelet parameters and noise PSD"
"are kept constant. Once the predetermined number of
updates has been reached, the extrinsic sampler returns
its current parameters and the noise sampler begins up-
dating the noise model while keeping the wavelet and
extrinsic parameters fixed. This process of alternating
sampling between different blocks of model parameters
is repeated for O(104) iterations."
"The construction of the algorithm in terms of a blocked
Gibbs sampler makes adding further models and sam-
plers straightforward. In the current version described
in [23], the astrophysical signal is modeled with coherent
sine-Gaussian wavelets that allow us to describe signals
with a large level of flexibility. We extend BayesWave’s
blocked Gibbs sampler by adding one more element,
namely a model of the signal in terms of quasicircular
CBC waveforms. In fashion with the existing implemen-
tation, the MCMC that samples the posterior distribu-
tion for the CBC parameters is completely independent
from the remaining code samplers. The result is a flexi-
ble algorithm that can be used with any combination of
CBC, signal2, glitch, and noise models for the detector
data."
"The CBC model is integrated with LALSimulation [28]
and can operate with any nonprecessing model available
there3. The eleven parameters of a spin-aligned quasicir-
cular CBC signal, namely the four intrinsic parameters
(the two masses and spin magnitudes) and seven extrin-
sic parameters (the time of coalescence, the phase of co-
alescence, two sky location angles, the polarization angle
and the inclination angle the distance), are updated in
overlapping blocks. Common to both blocks is the phase
of coalescence since BayesWave’s extrinsic sampler up-
dates the overall phase of the signal as described in [23].
The CBC MCMC sampler updates the four intrinsic pa-
rameters, the time of coalescence, the phase of coales-
cence, and the distance. The existing extrinsic sampler
in BayesWave updates the two sky angles, the polariza-
tion angle, the inclination angle, and the phase of co-
alescence while holding all other parameters fixed. We
use standard priors for all parameters: uniform over the
detector-frame masses and spin magnitudes, uniform in
time and phase, and uniform in luminosity volume."
"The CBC sampler is custom and not based on any
existing samplers used in LIGO-Virgo parameter estima-
tion. The CBC sampler is taken from the recently devel-
oped QuickCBC [29] analysis pipeline. A closely related"
"2 We retain the original model names in BayesWave, hence the
signal model refers to the wavelet signal model, while the CBC
model refers to the model in terms of CBC templates. Both
models target astrophysical signals. Since we do not use the
signal model in the remainder of the paper, we trust that this
will not lead to confusion."
"3 Both the sampling and the jump proposals for the CBC param-
eters are constructed to expect the signal amplitude and phase
from the waveform generator. There is therefore no fundamental
limitation to non-precessing signals and we plan to extend our
analysis to include the effect of spin-precession in the future."
"sampler [30] has been developed for analyzing data from
the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. The
CBC sampler is a replica exchange (parallel tempered)
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PTMCMC) algorithm that
uses a mixture of proposal distributions. The default
collection of proposals are: Gaussian jumps along eigen-
vectors of the Fisher information matrix, scaled by the
reciprocal of the square root of the corresponding eigen-
value; differential evolution using a rolling history array
at each temperature, updated every 10 iterations and
holding 1000 past samples; and small, Gaussian jumps
along each parameter direction. Each chain carries its
own Fisher information matrix, which is updated peri-
odically. The Fisher and differential evolution proposals
are effective at exploring parameter correlations, while
the small jumps prevent the chains from getting stuck in
regions where the Fisher matrix becomes ill-conditioned."
"The CBC sampler is not optimized for blindly find-
ing signals, so it is best to initialize the sampler with
a good starting solution for the source parameters such
as the output from a CBC search pipeline, or the in-
jected parameters for a simulated signal. Alternatively
the sampler can be initialized using a custom built CBC
search algorithm from the QuickCBC [29] analysis pipeline
that has been incorporated into the BayesWave prepro-
cessing steps. The search is broken into two stages, a
rapid network-coherent search with analytic maximiza-
tion over extrinsic parameters, followed by a fast MCMC
over the extrinsic parameters using a likelihood function
that precomputes the waveform inner products [31]. This
procedure returns the starting point for all 11 CBC pa-
rameters. More details about the initial search step and
discussion of its robustness against instrumental glitches
are presented in [29]."
III. SIMULATED SIGNALS
"We test the efficacy of separating CBCs from glitches
with our CBC+glitch model by selecting 3 common glitch
types from O2 data [32, 33] that are known to have an
adverse effect on searches for CBCs [3]. We then add sim-
ulated CBC signals consistent with a BBH with detector-
frame masses of 36M� and 29M� and vanishing spin at
different times with respect to the glitch. All simulated
signals have a signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of 15. We use
the IMRPhenomD [34, 35] waveform model both for simula-
tion and recovery as implemented in LALSimulation [28].
We then analyze the data from the two LIGO detectors
with our CBC+glitch+noise model, where the coherent
signal is modeled by the CBC template, the glitch is mod-
eled by incoherent wavelets, and the noise PSD is mod-
eled with splines and Lorenzians. Spectrograms for the 3
glitches are shown in Fig. 1: blip glitch (left), scattered
light (middle), and blue mountain (right). Further de-
tails and run settings for each type of glitch are shown in
Table I."

A. Glitch type 1: Blip
"Blip glitches are one of the most common glitch types
for the two LIGO detectors. They are characterized by
short duration, and hence pose a challenge for the de-
tection of high mass BBH signals [36]. Their origin is
largely unknown. Figures 2-5 show our results for sim-
ulated signals injected at different times with respect to
a blip glitch in the LIGO Hanford detector during O2.
Details about the glitch, including its GPS time, and the
run settings are presented in Table I. A spectrogram of
the data containing the glitch is given on the left panel
of Fig. 1, where the short duration and large frequency
extent are shown."
"The whitened data and reconstructions for the CBC
signal and the glitch are shown in Fig. 2 where we plot the
90% credible intervals for each reconstruction in LIGO
Hanford (top) and LIGO Livingston (bottom). The
glitch is easily visible in LIGO Hanford as a short dura-
tion ∼ 15σ noise excursion. No glitch power is identified
in LIGO Livingston at that time, but the CBC signal is
clearly identified. This allows us to separate the corre-
sponding coherent CBC signal in LIGO Hanford from the
instrumental glitch, even when the latter overlaps with
the merger phase of the signal (left panel). The glitch re-
construction is also consistent across the three simulated
signals, suggesting that the glitch model is not fitting any
part of the CBC signal."
"Source parameters for the simulated CBC are pre-
sented in Figs. 3 and 4 both for the CBC+glitch+noise
analysis and a CBC+noise analysis for selected recov-
ered parameters for the leftmost simulated CBC sig-
nal together with the injected values with black crosses
or vertical lines as appropriate. Figure 3 shows the
mass ratio q, the effective spin χeff, and the detector"
"frame chirp mass M, while Fig. 4 shows the luminos-
ity distance and the cosine of the inclination angle. In
all cases the posterior distributions recovered under the
CBC+glitch+noise model are consistent with the in-
jected parameters, though the marginalized posteriors do
not peak at the injected values, as expected from infer-
ence of signals in Gaussian noise. For reference, we show
posteriors under the CBC+noise model in orange that
assumes that the data are consisted of just a CBC signal
and Gaussian noise, without any provision for a glitch.
Since this assumption is violated by the presence of the
blip glitch, the resulting posteriors are expected to be
biased compared to the true parameters and the orange
contours in Figs. 3 and 4 quantify this bias. We find that
the extrinsic parameters that are primarily determined
by the signal amplitude are more biased than the intrin-
sic ones that are measured through the GW phase, as
also discussed in [37]."
"The separation of the CBC signal from the glitch
demonstrated in Fig. 2 can be used to produce ready-to-
use deglitched data for downstream inference analyses, as
was done in [3]. An estimate of the glitch reconstruction
(the median or a fair draw from the glitch model poste-
rior) is subtracted from the data to produce strain data
that contain only the CBC signal and Gaussian noise.
The result of the glitch subtraction is shown in the spec-
trograms of Fig. 5 that show the LIGO Hanford data
before (left) and after (middle) the subtraction of a fair
draw glitch reconstruction for the leftmost injection of
Fig. 2. The left panel includes both the chirping signal
and the blip glitch, while only the former is visible in the
middle panel. The right panel shows the data after a fair
draw from both the CBC and the glitch models has been
subtracted, resulting in residual Gaussian noise only."

B. Glitch type 2: Scattered light
"Glitches caused by scattered light in the interferome-
ter became particularly prominent during O3 [3]. Unlike
the blip glitches studied above, scattered light glitches
have a longer temporal duration of a few seconds and
are characterized by arches in a time-frequency spectro-
gram [38, 39], as depicted in the middle panel of Fig. 1.
We inject simulated signals on an instance of such a glitch
in LIGO Livingston and analyze the data from both
LIGO detectors with our CBC+glitch+noise model. De-
tails of the glitch and the run settings are given in Table I.

The longer duration helps the noise model determine the

also increase the maximum quality factor Qmax of the
wavelets due to the glitch’s long duration."
"Figure 6 shows the data and reconstructed CBC and
glitch models. We zoom in around the CBC signals,
though the glitch extends beyond the time range plotted.
In all cases the CBC signal is separated from the glitch,
aided by the presence of a coherent signal in LIGO Han-
ford. The glitch reconstruction is also consistent for all 3
simulated signals, as expected for runs on the same glitch.
The reconstruction exhibits oscillations at around 32Hz
and 16Hz, consistent with expectations from the glitch
spectrogram. Figure 7 shows posterior distributions for

the glitch having been regressed, leaving only the chirp-
ing signal behind. The right panel corresponds to data
where a fair draw from the CBC model has further been
subtracted and is consistent with Gaussian noise."
C. Glitch type 3: Blue mountain
"The final type of glitch we consider is the blue moun-
tain; the spectrogram of the LIGO Hanford instance of
a blue mountain glitch we consider is shown in the right
panel of Fig. 1. The glitch has a duration of multiple sec-
onds and is characterized by higher frequencies ∼ 200Hz.
We inject simulated signals at different times relative to
the glitch and again analyze data from the two LIGO de-
tectors with the CBC+glitch+noise model with settings
shown in Table I. Due to the large glitch duration we
have to increase the length of the analyzed segment even
further to 16s. Despite the glitch’s overall long duration,
we do not find it necessary to increase the wavelet max-
imum quality factor Qmax, as the glitch is composed of
short individual bursts of power, each of which is mod-
eled by individual wavelets with a small quality factor."
"Figure 9 shows the whitened data and credible inter-
vals for the whitened CBC and glitch reconstruction in
each detector for each of the injected signals. Due to the
large glitch duration, the signals are injected sufficiently
wide apart that the reconstruction plots show non over-
lapping parts of the data and the glitch. The glitch re-
constructions are therefore not expected to match. As"
"expected from the glitch spectrogram, the glitch is char-
acterized by a series of short high frequency bursts, each
of which is modeled by different wavelets within our glitch
model. Figure 10 shows posterior distributions for se-
lected source parameters for the left-most injection in
blue, as well as the injected parameters. In all cases the
recovered parameters are consistent with their injected
values, suggesting that the presence of the glitch does
not incur biases on the inferred source properties if the
two are modeled simultaneously. As before, we also plot
results from a CBC+noise run that neglects the glitch
in the data in orange and again find small biases by the
presence of the glitch in the source intrinsic parameters."
"The glitch subtraction process is detailed in Fig. 11
that again shows spectrograms of the original data con-
taining both the glitch and the signal (left), data after a
fair draw glitch model has been subtracted (middle), and
data after both the glitch and the fair draw CBC model
have been removed (right). As before, data from the mid-
dle panel could be used for further data processing. The
right panel shows data where a model for both the glitch
and the CBC have been subtracted. Even though the ma-
jority of the glitch power is absent (compare the left and
right panels), some small non Gaussian power might be
left behind. The reason for this is that the blue mountain
glitch is manifested as individual short bursts of glitch
power, which our flexible analysis attempts to model
completely independently. Indeed, the glitch model for
this run uses O(70) wavelets. Each of these wavelets,
needs to model sufficient non-Gaussian power in the data
in order to overcome the parsimony penalty incurred by
adding more parameters to the model. As such, we ex-
pect that some of the weaker “bursts” of the glitch will
not be recovered. Possible ways to alleviate this are dis-
cussed in Sec. V."
IV. GRAVITATIONAL WAVE EVENTS
"As a further demonstration of our CBC+glitch+noise
model, we also analyze two astrophysical events,
GW170817 [4] and GW150914 [40] whose data are avail-
able from GWOSC [32, 33]. Though not the main focus"

"of this paper, the analysis presented below also provides
an estimate of the effect of marginalizing over the noise
PSD has on the inferred astrophysical parameters. More
details about this effect will be presented in a separate
study."
A. GW170817
"Perhaps the most known instance of a GW signal over-
lapping with an instrumental glitch is GW170817 [4].
Inference on the GW170817 source properties is per-
formed on data where the glitch in LIGO Livingston
has been modeled with BayesWave’s glitch-only model"
"and subtracted. Analysis of simulated signals suggests
that this procedure leads to unbiased inference, while
any analysis on data that contain the glitch results in
highly biased source parameters [27]. Both versions of
the data are publicly available, both with and without
the glitch [26], so we analyze them both with different
models. We use data from the LIGO Hanford and the
LIGO Livingston detectors and analyze 64s of data from
16Hz to 2048Hz using the IMRPhenomD NRTides wave-
form model that includes finite-size effects [41]. We em-
ploy our CBC+glitch+noise model on the data with the
glitch and the CBC+noise model on data where the glitch
has already been subtracted. For the CBC+glitch+noise
case we use GlitchBuster [23] to provide a quick fit to
the glitch and use that as a starting point for our glitch
model during sampling."
"Credible intervals for the signal and glitch reconstruc-
tions are shown in Fig. 12 for each detector for∼ 150ms of
data around the glitch. Despite its high SNR, GW170817
had a relatively low amplitude, so the LIGO Hanford
plot has been zoomed in to make the signal visible. The
LIGO Livingston data are dominated by the glitch, peak-
ing at ∼ 150σ relative to the background detector Gaus-
sian noise. The signal is not visible in the LIGO Liv-
ingston data given the plotting scale. Figure 13 shows
selected source parameters obtained from data both with
and without the glitch. We find consistent results, show-
ing that our combined CBC+glitch+noise analysis can
faithfully fit the CBC signal and the glitch simultane-
ously, without the need for the two step process of first
removing the glitch and then reanalyzing the data."
B. GW150914
"The first GW signal directly detected by the LIGO
detectors, GW150914 [40], did not overlap with an in-
strumental glitch [42]. However, since it is one of the
best studied and loudest signals, we select it as a demon-
stration of our analysis on data without glitches. Our"

"glitch model has the flexibility to use no glitch wavelets,
we therefore expect many samples in the glitch model
posterior to contain exactly zero glitch power. We an-
alyze 4s of data starting at 16Hz and with a sampling
rate of 2048Hz. We perform two runs, one with the
CBC+glitch+noise model and one with the CBC+glitch
model using otherwise identical settings."
"Relevant results are shown in Figs. 14 and 15 where as
before we plot the CBC and glitch reconstructions of the
CBC+glitch+noise model in the two detectors and the
recovered source parameters. The CBC reconstruction of
Fig. 14 is consistent with previous results [43]. The glitch
reconstruction is too small to identify in the scale of the
plot, as we find that 86% and 14% of our posterior sam-
ples had exactly zero glitch wavelets in LIGO Hanford
and LIGO Livingston respectively. Figure 15 shows the
posterior distribution for selected source parameters of
GW150914 obtained under the CBC+glitch+noise and
the CBC+noise models. The two posteriors yield con-
sistent results, showing that the glitch model does not
affect the CBC parameters when no glitch is present in
the data."
V. CONCLUSIONS
"We construct and validate an analysis of GW data
that simultaneously models astrophysical CBC signals
and instrumental glitches. We test the analysis against
real instances of glitches in the two LIGO detectors from
O2 data and simulated CBC signals injected at different
times with respect to the glitch. We find that our analy-
sis can separate the two, and provide both estimates for
the CBC source parameters and glitch-subtracted data
for subsequent analyses. The glitch model we employ is
a sum of sine-Gaussian wavelets that is not tuned to any
specific glitch type and morphology; it can thus handle
even novel glitch types that might first appear during
O4. Even though this flexibility is desirable given the
unpredictable and evolving nature of glitches, the effi-
cacy of glitch subtraction can be improved by employing
targeted priors for different glitch types. One such exam-
ple would be a prior that anticipates arches at frequency
multiples in the case of scattered light glitches. We leave
such targeted priors to future work."
"Our analysis considered only simulated BBH sig-
nals, though we also present an analysis of the BNS
GW170817. We expect overlapping CBCs and glitches
of similar duration to be a worse-case-scenario due to"

carry out a larger scale study of our CBC+glitch analysis
that includes more glitch types and CBC classes, such as
BNSs and lower mass BBHs. Additionally, the analysis
presented here did not make use of GlitchBuster [23]
to provide initial fits to the glitch, apart from the
GW170817 case. In the future we plan to investigate
interfacing GlitchBuster and BayesWave in more de-
tail, in the hopes that an efficient starting point for"
"the glitch model during sampling will decrease the sam-
pler’s convergence time and result in ready-to-use glitch-
subtracted data more quickly. We hope that our analysis
will contribute to robust and efficient glitch mitigation
against the increased event rate anticipated in O4; our
goal is to facilitate analysis of as much data as possible
and maximize the science output of the upcoming obser-
vations."

"FIG. 14. Credible intervals for the glitch (orange) and the
CBC (blue) signal reconstruction for GW150914. Shaded
regions correspond to 90% credible intervals, while in grey
dashed lines we plot the data whitened with a fair draw PSD
from our noise model posterior. The top row corresponds to
LIGO Hanford while the bottom row corresponds to LIGO
Livingston. Our glitch model recovers essentially no incoher-
ent power coincident with the astrophysical signal and there-
fore the reconstruction is not visible in the scale of the plot."

spond to the CBC+noise model. The two sets of results are
