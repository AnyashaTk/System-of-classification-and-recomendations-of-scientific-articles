ABSTRACT
"We study the outer regions of the Milky Way globular cluster NGC 6981 from publicly available BV photometry and new Dark
Energy Camera (DECam) observations, both reaching nearly 4 mag below the cluster main sequence (MS) turnoff. While the BV data
sets reveal the present of extra-tidal features around the cluster, the much larger field of view of DECam observations allowed us to
identify some other tidal features, which extend from the cluster toward the opposite direction to the Milky Way center. These cluster
structural features arise from stellar density maps built using MS stars, once the cluster color-magnitude diagram was cleaned from
the contamination of field stars. We also performed N-body simulations in order to help us to understand the spatial distribution of
the extra-tidal debris. The outcomes reveal the presence of long trailing and leading tails mostly parallel to the direction of the cluster
velocity vector. We found that the cluster has lost most of its mass by tidal disruption during its perigalactic passages, that lasted
nearly 20 Myr each. Hence, a decrease in the density of escaping stars near the cluster is expected from our N-body simulations,
which in turn means that stronger extra-tidal features could be found out by exploring much larger areas around NGC 6891."

1. Introduction
"Globular clusters formed in external galaxies and then gravi-
tationally stripped off by the Milky Way - usually called ac-
creted globular clusters - are expected to show evidence of extra-
tidal features, like tidal tails, azimuthally irregular stellar halos,
clumpy extended structures (Carballo-Bello et al. 2014; Vander-
beke et al. 2015; Kuzma et al. 2016; Piatti & Carballo-Bello
2020). During the last few years, deep enough wide-sky photo-
metric surveys have allowed to explore the outermost regions of
a number of globular clusters, which resulted in the detection of a
variety of extra-tidal structures around them. For instance, tidal
tails have been very recently identified in NGC 362 (Carballo-
Bello 2019), NGC 1851, NGC 2808 (Carballo-Bello et al. 2018;
Sollima 2020), 4590 (Palau & Miralda-Escudé 2019), 5139
(Ibata et al. 2019), 5904 (Grillmair 2019), among others. These
globular clusters are now enlarging the list of nearly 15 globular
clusters with detected tidal tails (e.g., Pal 5; Odenkirchen et al.
2001)."
"Koppelman et al. (2019) associated 7 globular clusters to the
accreted Helmi streams (Helmi et al. 1999) based on their kine-
matic properties: NGC 4590, 5024, 5053, 5272, 5634, 5904, and"
? e-mail: andres.piatti@unc.edu.ar
"6981. Massari et al. (2019) added Pal 5, Rup 106, and E 3 in the
candidates list based on their orbital properties and a less restric-
tive selection criterion. However, the membership of E 3 to this
group was recently questioned by Forbes (2020). All of them
have prograde orbital motions. According to the recent classifi-
cation of globular clusters carried out by Piatti & Carballo-Bello
(2020) from studies focused on their outermost regions, we find,
among those associated to the Helmi streams, 3 globular clus-
ters with observed tidal tails (NGC 4590, 5904, Pal 5), 2 with
extra-tidal features that are different from tidal tails (NGC 5053,
5634), and 3 without any signatures of extended stellar density
profiles (NGC 5024, 5272, Rup 106). Recently, Carballo-Bello
et al. (2020) has confirmed the presence of tidal tails emerg-
ing from E 3 using Gaia DR2 data. The outermost regions of
NGC 6981 have been studied by Grillmair et al. (1995) from
photographic photometry hardly reaching down the main se-
quence turnoff (see, also, Amigo et al. 2013). They estimated
a tidal radius of 8.3′ and found no signature of clear tidal tails."
"NGC 6981 is identified as lying on a sequence of possibly
accreted globular clusters in the age-metallicity diagram, which
coincides with the Kraken clusters (Kruijssen et al. 2019). As
can be inferred, the different proposed progenitors of NGC 6981
points to the need for further refinement in the different selection"

"procedures (Piatti 2019). The ratios of the cluster mass lost by
tidal disruption of the Milky Way gravitation field to the initial
cluster mass (Mdis/Mini) computed by Piatti et al. (2019) result
to be relatively small for the 6 Helmi streams globular clusters
mentioned by Koppelman et al. (2019) with studies of their out-
ermost regions (0.04 ≤Mdis/Mini ≤ 0.15). Pal 5 and Rup 106 have
Mdis/Mini = 0.24, while NGC 6981, 0.41. The Mdis/Mini ratio was
used by Piatti et al. (2019) as an indicator for tidal field strength.
They studied the relationship between Mdis/Mini, the semimajor
axes and the eccentricity of the globular clusters’ orbits (see their
figure 1), and found that clusters with relatively high Mdis/Mini
are either clusters with orbit eccentricities >∼ 0.7 or semimajor
axes <∼ 3 kpc. Nevertheless, a puzzling population of clusters
with intermediate eccentricities and short semimajor axes is ob-
served, also with relatively high orbital inclinations."
"In this study, we focus on NGC 6981 with the aim of finding
out some trails of tidal tails that can explain the large amount
of mass lost by the interaction with the Milky Way gravitational
field. In section 2 we describe the analysis carried from pub-
lic data sets, while in Section 3 we perform a similar analysis
from our own more spatially extended observations. Section 4
discusses the present outcomes, while Section 5 summarizes the
main conclusions of this work."
2. Public data handing
"We searched for available unexplored public wide-field photom-
etry to build stellar density maps from faint cluster main se-
quence (MS) stars, which are suitable for uncovering extra-tidal
structures. The homogeneous Johnson BV photometry published
by Stetson et al. (2019) for NGC 6981, with typical internal and
external uncertainties of the order of a few millimagnitudes, re-
sulted to be the most appropriate one. The field-of-view is ∼
0◦.6 × 0◦.8, centered on the cluster, which allows us to exam-
ine out to nearly 2 times the cluster tidal radius (0◦.12; Harris
1996, 2010 Edition). The reddening variation across the clus-
ter field is shown in Fig. 1, with E(B − V) color excess retrieved
from Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011) provided by the NASA/IPAC"

the cluster MS and another to redder colors are indicated in red."

= 3,5,7, and 9 are also shown, which reflect significance levels."
"Infrared Science Archive1. Although the cluster field is not af-
fected by differential reddening, we preferred to employ dered-
dened color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) by correcting the V
mags and B − V colors using the E(B − V) color excesses asso-
ciated to the positions of the stars in the sky. Figure 2 shows the
intrinsic CMDs for a cluster region (0◦.05 ≤ r ≤ 0◦.12) compared
to a star field region with equal cluster area, located far from the
cluster."

"We devised two segments along the cluster MS (see Fig. 2)
where we perform star counts. Both segments are contaminated
by the presence of field stars, so that we first applied the proce-
dure proposed by Piatti & Bica (2012) to statistically eliminate
them. The method compares the distribution of MS stars within
the devised segments, spread across the cluster field, with that of
a reference star field. For this purpose, we adopted as a reference
star field the area delimited by the dashed lines in Fig. 1 and the
data set boundary, where we assumed that the stellar density, and
the distribution in V mag and B−V colors of those stars are repre-
sentative of the field stars projected along the line-of-sight of the
cluster. We subtract from each segment a number of stars equal
to the corresponding one in the reference star field. The distri-
bution of magnitudes and colors of the subtracted stars from the
cluster CMD needs to resemble that of the reference star field.
With the aim of avoiding stochastic effects caused by very few
field stars distributed in less populated CMD regions, we started
finding stars to eliminate within a cell of (∆V0, ∆(B − V)0) ="

centered on the cluster indicates the cluster tidal radius, while the white
box represents the area of the Stetson et al. (2019)’s photometry (see

arrows represent the direction of the motion of the cluster and that to-
ward the Galactic center, respectively."
"(1.0 mag,0.5 mag) centered on the magnitude and color values
of each reference field star. Thus, it is highly probable to find a
star in the cluster CMD with (V0,(B − V)0) values within those
boundaries around the (V0, (B−V)0) ones of each field star. In the
case that more than one star is located inside that cell, the closest
one to the center of that (V0, (B−V)0) cell is subtracted. The pho-
tometric errors are also taken into account while searching for a
star to be subtracted from the cluster CMD. With that purpose,
we iterate up to one thousand times the comparison between the
(V0,(B − V)0) values of the reference field star and those of the
stars in the cluster CMD. If a star in the cluster CMD falls inside
the defined cell for the reference field star, we subtract that star.
The iterations were carried out by allowing the (V0, (B−V)0) val-
ues of the star in the cluster CMD takes smaller or larger values
than the mean ones according to their respective errors."
"Figure 3 (upper panels) depicts the observed stellar density
maps built for the two MS segments using the scikit-learn
software machine learning library (Pedregosa et al. 2011) and
its gaussian kernel density estimator (KDE). We employed a
grid of 100×100 boxes onto the cluster area and used a range
of values for the bandwidth from 0.005◦ up to 0.040◦ in steps
of 0.005◦ in order to apply the KDE to each generated box. We
adopted a bandwidth of 0.020◦ as the optimal value, as guided
by scikit-learn. We also estimated the background level us-
ing the stars distributed within the reference field star area. We
divided this area in boxes of 0◦.10 × 0◦.10 and counted the num-
ber of stars inside them. We randomly shifted the boxes by 0◦.05
along the R.A. and Dec. directions and repeated the star count-
ing. Finally, we derived the mean value using all the defined
boxes. As for the standard deviation, we performed a thousand
Monte Carlo realizations using the stars located in the reference"

"field star area, which were shifted along ∆(R.A.)×cos(Dec.) or
∆(Dec.) randomly (one different shift for each star) before re-
computing the density map. The color scale in Fig. 3 repre-
sents the absolute deviation from the mean value in the field
in units of the standard deviation, that is, η = (signal − mean
value)/standard deviation. We have painted white stellar densi-
ties with η > 10 in order to highlight the least dense structures."
"We additionally considered the devised segment located to
redder colors in the cluster CMD (the box centered at (B−V)0 ≈
1.5 mag), which represents a composite field star population, and
applied the same cleaning procedure. We found that the resulting
cleaned stellar density map does not contain any visible struc-
ture above 1η, which means that the residuals of the cleaning
technique are negligible. Therefore, we assume that any stellar
enhancement remaining in the stellar density maps built from the
cleaned cluster CMD is an intrinsic cluster feature. The result-
ing field star decontaminated stellar density maps are shown in
the bottom panels of Fig. 3, where extra-tidal features are readily
visible. As expected, more extended extra-tidal features show up
in the case of the lowest-mass segment, as lower-mass stars can
be more easily stripped away from the cluster than their higher-
mass counterparts."
3. Data collection and processing
"With the aim of tracing farther out the cluster extra-tidal
features, we carried out observations (program ID : 2019B-
1003) with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), attached to
the prime focus of the 4-m Blanco telescope at Cerro Tololo
Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). DECam provides a 3 deg2
field of view (see Fig. 4) with its 62 identical chips with a
scale of 0.263 arcsec pixel−1 (Flaugher et al. 2015). We observed
NGC 6981 with the g and r bands, for which we obtained 4 ex-
posures of 600 sec. and 400 sec, respectively. We also observed
3–5 SDSS fields per night at a different airmass to derive the
atmospheric extinction coefficients and the transformations be-
tween the instrumental magnitudes and the SDSS ugriz system
(Fukugita et al. 1996)."
"We processed the images using the DECam Community
Pipeline (Valdes et al. 2014), while the photometry was ob-
tained from the images with the PSF-fitting algorithm of
daophot ii/allstar (Stetson 1987). The final catalog includes
only stellar-shaped objects with |sharpness| ≤ 0.5 to avoid, as
much as possible, the presence of non-stellar sources and back-
ground galaxies in our analysis. daophot ii was also used to add
synthetic stars in our images in order to estimate the complete-
ness of our photometric catalogs. After applying our photometry
pipeline on the images with the created artificial stars included,
we found that the magnitude for a 50% recovery of the artificial
stars added turned out to be 23.4 mag and 23.3 mag for the g and
r bands, respectively."
"The methodology that we employed to build the stellar den-
sity maps followed the steps described in Section 2. We obtained
the reddening free g0 magnitudes and (g−r)0 colors by using the
individual E(B−V) values (see Fig. 4) and the Aλ/AV coefficients
given by Wang & Chen (2019). Fig. 5 illustrates the cluster CMD
we obtained for the main body of the cluster. Two different seg-
ments were devised along the cluster MS and the field star clean-
ing procedure was applied. In this case, we used as the reference
star field the region located outside the large black box drawn in
Fig. 4. Because of the larger area of the DECam FOV with re-
spect to Stetson et al. (2019)’s FOV, we thoroughly monitor the
performance of the cleaning procedure by repeating a thousand
times the search for a star to be subtracted in the cluster area for"
"each star in the reference star field. The position of the subtracted
star in the cluster field was chosen randomly during each simu-
lation of the cleaning procedure. We finally kept those stars that
remained unsubtracted more than 50% of the total number of
cleaning runs. The observed and field star cleaned stellar density
maps for both MS segments are depicted in Fig. 6."
4. Analysis and discussion
"Fig. 6 shows that NGC 6981 has visible extra-tidal structures,
that can be described as a non-rounded extended halo and debris
distributed along the trailing tail. Piatti et al. (2019) computed
the Jacobi radii of the cluster for its peri (1.3 kpc) and apogalac-
tic (26.6 kpc) distances (Baumgardt et al. 2019), which resulted
to be 15.5 pc and 67.7 pc, respectively. If we considered the
present cluster Galactocentric distance of 12.85 kpc, its Jacobi
radius would be ∼ 39.0 pc, or 0◦.13 for its heliocentric distance
of 17.0 kpc. This Jacobi radius resulted to be similar to the tidal
radius compiled by Harris (1996) and drawn with a black circle
in Fig. 6. According to the semianalitical model in Piatti et al.
(2019), who assumed a 50% cluster mass loss by evolutionary
effects (see their eq. 5 and Baumgardt et al. (2019)), the amount
of cluster mass lost by tidal disruption increases up to 41% of
its initial cluster mass, which means that the present remaining
mass of NGC 6981 is nearly 9% of its initial cluster mass."
"The stellar density map built by Grillmair et al. (1995) for
NGC 6981 using stars distributed in an area of ∼ 3◦.3×3◦.3 reveals
the presence of some low-level stellar residuals beyond the clus-
ter tidal radius. Although the authors did not conclude on the
existence of tidal tails, their density map hints for some extra-
tidal structure aligned toward the opposite direction to the Milky
Way center. We note that they used a much shallower photometry
than that used in this work."
"We performed N-body simulations to investigate the ex-
pected tidal features generated only during the last pericentric
passages, i.e. the last 2 Gyr of evolution, because we do not
know how long the cluster has been following the present orbit.
We first put a test particle representing the globular cluster at its
present position and with its present center of mass velocity, and
integrated it backwards in time for a gravitational field model of
the Milky Way. Then, we replaced the test particle with an N-
body system representing the globular cluster, and integrated it
forward in time up to the present epoch, embedded in the same
host gravitational field. At this point, the tidal features developed
by the cluster can be compared with those observed."
"Following Baumgardt et al. (2019), we modeled the Milky
Way with Model I of Irrgang et al. (2013), consisting of a
bulge, a disk and an halo components. In order to compute the
initial conditions at the present epoch we used Astropy (As-
tropy Collaboration et al. 2013, 2018) to convert the observed
R.A., Dec., distance, radial velocity and proper motions given
in Table 1 of Baumgardt et al. (2019) to Galactocentric coor-
dinates. We adopted a Cartesian reference frame (X,Y,Z) with
corresponding velocities (U,V,W) in which the X and U axes
point from the Galactic center towards the opposite direction
of the Sun, Y and V point in the direction of the Galactic ro-
tation at the location of the Sun, and Z and W point towards
the North Galactic Pole. Note that this right-handed frame of
reference differs from the left-handed one used by Baumgardt
et al. (2019). We assumed a distance from the Sun to the Galac-
tic center of d = 8.1 kpc (GRAVITY Collaboration et al. 2018)
and a velocity of the Sun respect to the Galactocentric frame
of (U,V,W)� = (11.1, 252.24, 7.25) km s−1 in agreement with"

"Schönrich et al. (2010) and Reid & Brunthaler (2004). The re-
sulting Cartesian coordinates are listed in Table 1."
"From these initial conditions, we integrated the equations of
motion backwards in time during 1.9 Gyr, an interval chosen
in order to start the forward integration near the apocenter of
the orbit. Fig. 7 shows the projection on the Y − Z plane of this
backward orbit, where we can see a clear 3 : 2 resonance (a
""fish""). The orbit precesses around the Z-axis."
"During the Y > 0 portions of the orbit the cluster moves
almost radially (eccentricity e ≤ 1) deep into the halo with an
inclination ∼ 45◦ with respect to the Milky Way plane. During
the Y < 0 portions, the cluster loops perpendicularly to the disk
with e > 0. Being the pericentric distance only . 1 kpc, the
details of the integrated orbit may not coincide with the real one,
in the sense that phenomena like e.g. dynamical friction are not
taken into account in a test particle integration."
"The globular cluster was modeled with an initial King profile
(King 1966) of total mass M = 2×105 M�, a King radius r0 = 2.8
pc, a King concentration parameter cK = log10(rt/r0) = 1.183
and a central potential W0 = 5.7, using N = 5 × 104 stars of
4 solar masses. With these values, other important parameters
are: tidal radius rt = 42.64 pc, core radius rc = 2.29 pc, and
concentration parameter c = log10(rt/rc) = 1.27. This initial pa-
rameters are in agreement with those compiled by Harris (1996)
and Baumgardt et al. (2019), which are respectively c = 1.23
and rc = 2.33 pc. By fitting these parameters at the end of the
simulation would have required probing initial values in a trial-
and-error approach; therefore, we chose to fix them at the start
of the simulation."
"The cluster was placed at the final position of the backward
integration and then evolved forward with the code Gadget-2"
"(Springel 2005) using a maximum step size of 0.01 Myr and a
softening length of 0.5 pc. We have used a version of the code
that allows external potentials to be included in the simulation,
in our case that of the Galaxy. Also, the adaptive time-step cri-
terion takes into account the presence of this potential (Villalo-
bos & Helmi 2008, Appendix A2.3). Taking into account that the
cluster losses mass in this forward integration due to tidal forces,
the value of the initial mass M was chosen so that the final mass
was close to the observed mass Mobs = 8.7 × 104 M� (Baum-
gardt et al. 2019). In the simulation the final mass turned out to
be Mf = 9.2 × 104 M�. The difference between the mass loss
from the simulation and that of the semianalytical model is ex-
pected, given that they are based on different methodologies and
hypothesis. We refer as ’present’ to characteristics of this final
state."
"Fig. 7 shows that a large stellar stream with both leading and
trailing tails has formed, which explores both disk and halo re-
gions. The point of highest density in the present N-body cluster
was approximated as follows. We started computing the center
of mass of all the particles inside a box with edges rbox = 50rc,
centered at the origin of coordinates. Then we computed a new
center of mass by choosing the particles that lie inside a box with
an edge 1 per cent smaller than the previous one, centered at the
previous center of mass, and iterated this last step two hundred
times. The resulting center of mass turned out to be a good ap-
proximation to the density peak of the distribution. The regions
close to the present N-body snapshot, projected onto the three
coordinate planes are depicted in Fig. 8. The offset of the present
position of NGC 6981 with respect to the point of highest den-
sity of the N-body simulation is as expected: the backward orbit
of the test particle initialized at the position of NGC 6981 is fol-
lowed forward approximately by the center of mass of the full
set of N-body particles, which does not coincide with their peak
density due to the streams. Fig. 9 shows the mass of the N-body
cluster inside a radius equal to the initial tidal radius M(r < rt),
as a function of time. It is readily visible that the cluster loses
stars only at its pericentric passages, each leakage during ap-
proximately 20 Myr."
"To compare the distribution of the N-body particles with the
observed stellar density (see Fig. 6), we projected the former
into the celestial sphere and computed the surface mass den-
sity Σ(∆((R.A.)cos(Dec.),∆(Dec.)), where ∆(R.A.) and ∆(Dec)"
"Article number, page 5 of 8"
A&A proofs: manuscript no. paper
"are the R.A. and Dec. of a point of the sphere with respect to
the position of the highest density peak of the N-body cluster.
In order to highlight the density variations, we have applied an
upper threshold value of Σthres = 5000 M� deg−2; all the pixels
above this value were colored in white. Fig. 10 shows that the
tidal tails extend towards the North-East and the South-West di-
rections, respectively. Notwithstanding the clear streams in the
larger fields, they seem to have disappeared in the smallest one.
This is due to the fact that the stream slowly drifts from the clus-
ter, and the mass loss only happens during very short intervals at
the pericenter passages. Therefore, we expect a gap of streaming
stars near the cluster, widening between pericenter passages."
5. Conclusions
"We analyze the outer regions of the Milky Way globular clus-
ter NGC 6981, with the aim of identifying extra-tidal features.
The cluster caught our attention because it was associated to
the accreted Helmi streams, and deposited in an extremely in-
ner halo orbit, with a relatively high eccentricity and inclination
angle with respect to the Milky Way plane in the current orbital
section. According to Piatti et al. (2019), globular clusters with
orbital parameters similar to those of NGC 6981 have lost rela-
tively more mass by tidal disruption than globular clusters rotat-
ing in the Milky Way disk."
"We started by analyzing BV public data sets, which revealed
the presence of extra-tidal debris distributed around the cluster.
Our DECam observations, which reach nearly 4 mag below the
cluster MS turnoff, confirmed our findings from a wider field of
view. BV and DECam photometries were treated similarly. We
relied on MS stars, particularly the fainter ones, because they
are the first to cross the Jacobi radius once they reach the clus-
ter boundary driven by two-body relaxation. Indeed, we found
that the fainter the range of magnitudes considered, the more ex-
tended the cluster stellar density map."
"In order to monitor any differential change in the stellar den-
sity map caused by cluster stars with distinct brightnesses, we
split the long MS of the cluster into two segments of 2 and 1.5
mag long, respectively, and we analyzed them separately. The
magnitudes and colors of the stars were corrected by individ-
ual interstellar reddening, which slightly varies across the field.
Then, we statistically decontaminated the cluster MS segments
from the presence of field stars, and built stellar density maps
using all the stars that remained unsubtracted after the cleaning
procedure. We built their respective stellar density maps using a
kernel estimator technique, which revealed the presence of extra-
tidal features oriented along the opposite direction to the Milky
Way center."
"N-body simulations were finally performed to help us to un-
derstand the spatial distribution of the extra-tidal debris. In our
simulations, the cluster was represented by an N-body system
evolved during 2 Gyr in the adopted Milky Way potential. The
disrupted stars clearly form long trailing and leading tails, that
are mostly parallel to the direction of the cluster velocity vector,
which is similar to the direction pointing to the Galaxy centre at
the present time. We confirmed a decrease in the density of extra-
tidal stars near the cluster. Also, we found that stronger extra-
tidal features could be found by exploring larger areas around
NGC 6891."
