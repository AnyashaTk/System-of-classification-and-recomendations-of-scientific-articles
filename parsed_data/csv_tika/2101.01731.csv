ABSTRACT
"We present high-resolution optical images from the Hubble Space Telescope, X-ray images from
the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and optical spectra from the Nordic Optical Telescope for a newly-
discovered galaxy cluster, CHIPS1911+4455, at z = 0.485 ± 0.005. CHIPS1911+4455 was discovered
in the Clusters Hiding in Plain Sight (CHiPS ) survey, which sought to discover galaxy clusters with
extreme central galaxies that were misidentified as isolated X-ray point sources in the ROSAT All-
Sky Survey. With new Chandra X-ray observations, we find the core (r = 10 kpc) entropy to be
17+2−9 keV cm"
"2, suggesting a strong cool core, which are typically found at the centers of relaxed
clusters. However, the large-scale morphology of CHIPS1911+4455 is highly asymmetric, pointing to
a more dynamically active and turbulent cluster. Furthermore, the Hubble images reveal a massive,
filamentary starburst near the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We measure the star formation rate
for the BCG to be 140–190 M� yr"
"−1, which is one of the highest rates measured in a central cluster
galaxy to date. One possible scenario for CHIPS1911+4455 is that the cool core was displaced during
a major merger and rapidly cooled, with cool, star-forming gas raining back toward the core. This
unique system is an excellent case study for high-redshift clusters, where such phenomena are proving
to be more common. Further studies of such systems will drastically improve our understanding of
the relation between cluster mergers and cooling, and how these fit in the bigger picture of active
galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback."

1. INTRODUCTION
"Early X-ray observations of the intracluster medium
(ICM) in the center of galaxy clusters revealed cooling
times much shorter than the Hubble time, leading to
the development of the cooling flow model (e.g., Fabian
1994). In this model, hot gas in dense cores should ra-
diatively cool and fuel 100–1000 M�/yr starbursts in the
central brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). However, many
studies have shown that BCGs are only forming stars
at ∼1% of this rate (e.g., McDonald et al. 2018). A
promising mechanism proposed for preventing cooling
of the ICM is AGN heating by jets and bubble-induced
weak shocks (see reviews by Fabian 2012; McNamara &
Nulsen 2012; Gaspari et al. 2020). Evidence supporting
these theories includes the ubiquitous presence of radio
galaxies at the center of clusters (Sun 2009) and the sim-
ilarity between the mechanical energy released by AGN
driven bubbles and the energy needed to quench cool-"

"Galaxy clusters with signatures of cooling in their cen-
ters are often called “cool-core” (CC) clusters, with their
counterparts being referred to as “non cool-core” (NCC)
clusters. Hudson et al. (2010) found that the best way
to segregate the two is to consider their central cooling
time (tcool). Specifically, CC clusters have tcool < 7.7
Gyr, while clusters with tcool < 1.0 Gyr are referred to
as “strong CCs”. A number of observational studies have
found that CCs are mostly found in relaxed clusters while
NCCs reside in dynamically-active clusters. Indeed, all
of the strongest CCs known (based on cooling rate) are
found in the most relaxed clusters (e.g., Phoenix (Mc-
Donald et al. 2012), Abell 1835 (McNamara et al. 2006),
Zw3146 (Edge et al. 1994)). This is also consistent with a
variety of other studies that found star-forming BCGs in
the most relaxed CC clusters (Crawford et al. 1999; Don-
ahue et al. 2010; Molendi et al. 2016; Cerulo et al. 2019).
On the other hand, morphologically-disturbed clusters
(which are likely to be recent mergers) generally have
no evidence for ongoing cooling, suggesting that major
mergers may have the potential to destroy cool cores
(Burns et al. 2008; Poole et al. 2008) through shock-
heating (Burns et al. 1997) and mixing (Gómez et al.
2002)."
"The discovery of CHIPS1911+4455 (Somboonpa-
nyakul et al., in press) runs counter to these estab-
lished norms, since it not only harbors a very blue (star-
forming) galaxy in the center, but also shows a highly-
disturbed morphology on both large (∼200 kpc) and"
2 Somboonpanyakul et al.
"small (∼20 kpc) scales. There are no known nearby
clusters that have properties similar to CHIP1911+4455,
though McDonald et al. (2016) reports a higher fraction
of star-forming BCGs in merging clusters at z > 1. This
implies that CHIPS1911+4455 may provide an avenue
for studying a high-redshift phenomenon in a low-redshift
cluster. To fully understand this system we have ob-
tained new observations in the core of CHIPS1911+4455,
which we will discuss below."
"Throughout this paper, we assume H0 =
70 km s−1Mpc−1, Ωm = 0.3, and ΩΛ = 0.7. All
errors are 1σ unless noted otherwise."
2. OBSERVATIONS
"In this section, we summarize the acquisition and re-
duction of data obtained from the Chandra X-ray tele-
scope, the Hubble Space Telescope and the Nordic Opti-
cal Telescope (NOT)."
2.1. X-ray: Chandra
"CHIPS1911+4455 (OBSID: 21544) was observed in
2019 with Chandra ACIS-I for a total of 30.5 ks. The
data were analyzed with CIAO v4.11 and CALDB v4.8.5
and recalibrated with VFAINT mode for improved back-
ground screening. To look for small-scale structures near
the center of the cluster, images were smoothed adap-
tively, using CSMOOTH8 to achieve a uniform signal-to-
noise ratio over the full image, as shown in the left panel
of Fig. 1."
"The temperature profile was extracted from coarse an-
nuli so that the number of counts per annulus was around
800, which is enough to get well-constrained tempera-
ture measurements (∆kT/kT ∼20%). All spectra were
fit simultaneously with the APEC model for the clus-
ter emission, a second APEC model for the Milky Way
(kT = 0.18 keV), the PHABS model for Galactic absorp-
tion, and the BREMSS model to represent a hard back-
ground (kT = 0.40 keV) from unresolved point sources,
following McDonald et al. (2013). The WSTAT statistic
was used."
"The gas density profile was created by first computing
the 0.7-2.0 keV surface brightness profile. The conversion
from the X-ray surface brightness profile to the emission-
measure profile (EM(r) ="
"∫
npnedl) was calculated as"
"a function of radius based on the best-fit temperature
profile and assuming a collisionally-ionized plasma APEC
model with metallicity 0.3Z�. For more details of the
X-ray analysis, see Somboonpanyakul et al. (2018)."
2.2. Optical: Hubble
"CHIPS1911+4455 was observed for two orbits with
the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) during Cycle 27.
The data include medium band F550M data from the
Advance Camera for Surveys (ACS) and broad band
F110W data from the Wide Field Camera infrared chan-
nel (WFC3-IR). The F550M filter contains both the blue
continuum and the bright [O II] doublet at the redshift
of the cluster, which should both be elevated in star-
forming regions. The F110W filter, on the other hand,
is sensitive to the red continuum, probing the old stellar
populations of the BCG and other cluster members."

2.3. Optical Spectra: Nordic Telescope
"Two optical spectra of the BCG of CHIPS1911+4455
were obtained with the Alhambra Faint Object Spec-
trograph and Camera (ALFOSC) at the 2.56m Nordic
Optical Telescope (NOT) on May 9th, 2019. One of
the spectra was obtained from Grism#4 (R=360, 3200–
9600Å) with 1.3′′ slit for 1500-second exposure. The
other spectrum was a stack of two 1100-second spectra
from Grism#5 (R=415, 5000–10700Å) with 1.3′′ slit at
90◦ from the first spectrum. Wavelength solutions for
the two spectra were calibrated with HeNe and ThAr arc
lamps, respectively, with an absolute calibration uncer-
tainty of 2Å. Masks were applied to remove cosmic-rays
before the 1D spectra were extracted from the 2D spec-
tral images. The 1D spectra were then flat-fielded, and
background-subtracted from off-source regions surround-
ing the 1D extraction region."
3. RESULTS
3.1. CHIPS1911+4455: A Strong Cool Core
"The thermodynamic profiles of CHIPS1911+4455 are
shown in Fig. 2. The electron density at 10 kpc is
0.0884 cm−3, which is among the highest measured to
date (Hudson et al. 2010; McDonald et al. 2017), while
the temperature profile drops from a maximum of ∼8
keV at ∼300 kpc to 4 keV at ∼10 kpc."
"The entropy of the ICM (K ≡ kTn−2/3e ) reflects the
thermal history of a cluster, which is solely affected by
heat gains and losses (Cavagnolo et al. 2009; Panagoulia"
"et al. 2014), while the cooling time (tcool ≡ 32
(ne+np)kT
nenpΛ(T )"
"represents the amount of time required for the ICM to ra-
diate all the excess heat, where Λ(T ) is the cooling func-
tion (Sutherland & Dopita 1993). For CHIPS1911+4455,
the central (r = 10 kpc) cooling time is 98+7−32 Myr, which
is classified as a strong cool core (Hudson et al. 2010).
The deprojected entropy profiles for CHIPS1911+4455,
the Phoenix cluster, and hundreds of clusters from the
ACCEPT survey (Cavagnolo et al. 2009) are shown in
Fig. 3. Both CHIPS1911+4455 and the Phoenix cluster
have entropy profiles that are among the lowest known.
The core (r = 10 kpc) entropy for CHIPS1911+4455 is
17+2−9 keVcm"
"2, which is in the 5th percentile of all clusters
in the ACCEPT survey."
3.2. CHIPS1911+4455: A Major Merger
"There are various ways to quantify the dynamical state
of a cluster, with some of the best combining X-ray data
with information on the galaxy velocities. Lacking the
latter, we restrict ourselves to X-ray-only indicators. The
two particular quantities we consider are the “peakiness”
of the surface brightness profile and the distance be-
tween the center of symmetry on small and large scale
(“symmetry”), following Mantz et al. (2015). The peak-
iness measure is a proxy for the presence of a cool core,
which are typically found in relaxed clusters. A cluster
with high symmetry appears similar on small and large
scales, suggesting that it is dynamically relaxed. Given
that both of these proxies probe the dynamical state of
the cluster, albeit in different ways, it is unsurprising"

points in Fig. 4 show the population of relaxed clusters
in this morphology plane. For CHIPS1911+4455, the
peakiness is measured to be -0.501, which is in the 96th"
"percentile of all clusters, while the symmetry is estimated
to be 0.425, which is in the 7th percentile. The fact that
CHIPS1911+4455 is simultaneously one of the strongest
cool cores and least symmetric clusters known is highly
unusual."
3.3. CHIPS1911+4455: A Starburst BCG
"In Fig. 1, we compare optical and X-ray images of
CHIPS1911+4455. The Hubble images show that the red
emission from old stellar populations is relatively smooth
and symmetric, while the blue emission from the young
stellar populations and cool gas is clumpy, asymmetric,
and extended on >30 kpc scales. In particular, the red
emission shows no elongation towards the galaxies to the"
"north, suggesting that there has not been a recent inter-
action between these galaxies. Given this, and the fact
that the central entropy is amongst the ∼2–3 lowest ever
measured, we propose that the young stars are forming
directly from the cooling ICM. The filamentary complex
structures in the blue emission are similar to the emis-
sion nebula in the Phoenix cluster (McDonald et al. 2019)
and other nearby cool core clusters (e.g., McDonald et al.
2011; Tremblay et al. 2015; Olivares et al. 2019)."
"From the optical spectrum in Fig. 5, we identify sev-
eral bright emission lines, including Hβ and [O ii]. The
relative lack of bright [O iii] compared to [O ii] indicates
that the central galaxy in CHIPS1911+4455 is a mas-
sive starburst and not a bright AGN. We use these emis-
sion lines to estimate the redshift of the central galaxy,
finding z = 0.485 ± 0.005. From the two slit orienta-
tions, we measure [O ii] equivalent widths of 40.9 ± 1.0"

"Å and 43.8 ± 1.0 Å, which are consistent with one an-
other. To convert to flux, we model the spectral energy
distribution (SED) of the galaxy, based on data from
Pan-STARRS (g, i, r, z, and y) (Tonry et al. 2012) and
WISE (w1 and w2) (Wright et al. 2010), with a linear
combination of “young” and “old” stellar populations,
along with dust reddening (Calzetti et al. 2000). The
best-fit SED model is shown in Fig. 5. We estimate a
de-reddened continuum flux at the location of [O ii] of
3.5 ± 0.5 × 10−16 erg s−1 cm−2 Å−1, which we combine
with the EW to estimate the star formation rate (SFR)
of the central galaxy, arriving at 189+25−22 M� yr"
"−1 (Ken-
nicutt 1998)."
"Another way to measure SFR is to use the 24µm emis-
sion since mid-IR fluxes are unaffected by dust extinc-
tion, unlike UV and optical tracers. Instead, mid-IR
emission comes from the reprocessed light by dust, pro-
duced from recently formed stars. Based on the WISE4
flux (∼ 4×10−18 erg s−1 cm−2 Å−1), we estimate the SFR
for the central galaxy to be 143+31−26,M� yr"
"−1, based on
Cluver et al. (2017)."
"Considering both the [O ii] emission line luminos-
ity and the mid-IR continuum, we obtain consistent
SFRs of ∼140–190 M� yr−1, making the BCG in
CHIPS1911+4455 one of the most star-forming BCGs
in the z < 1 Universe (see e.g., McDonald et al. 2018)"
4. DISCUSSION
"It is clear, based on Sections 3.1–3.3, that
CHIPS1911+4455 is a unique system in the nearby uni-
verse (z < 0.5) with an extremely high central SFR, a
strong cool core, and large-scale morphology consistent
with a recent merger. It is common knowledge that, at
low-redshift, the most star-forming BCGs tend to be lo-
cated in the most relaxed, cool-core clusters (Cavagnolo
et al. 2008; Donahue et al. 2010). Whereas, the SFR
in high-redshift BCGs tend to be higher in dynamically
active, non cool-core clusters (McDonald et al. 2016;
Bonaventura et al. 2017). CHIPS1911+4455 may rep-
resent a low-redshift analog of these high-redshift sys-
tems, allowing us to study physical processes that may
have been much more common at early times. Below,
we speculate on possible explanations for the observed
starburst."
"In the precipitation scenario (Voit et al. 2015) for AGN
feeding and feedback, cool clouds condense and can form
stars or fuel AGN feedback when the cooling time (tcool)
is significantly shorter than the timescale for the cloud
to fall to the center of the cluster potential (tff). The lat-
ter timescale is a proxy for the mixing time of the cool-
ing gas. The threshold for thermal instability is usually
taken to be tcool/tff < 10 (e.g., Voit et al. 2015; Gaspari
et al. 2020), but this depends on the medium’s suscep-
tibility to condensation, the slope of the entropy profile,
the amount of turbulence, and the amplitude of entropy
perturbation (Voit et al. 2017; Voit 2018). If a dense,
low-entropy core is perturbed from the center of the grav-
itational potential, the timescale for mixing is increased
while the cooling time remains constant, leading to an
enhancement in thermal instabilities. Further, the sep-
aration of the low-entropy gas from the direct influence
of the central AGN could prevent tcool from increasing.
This displacement of low-entropy gas from the central"

"Fig. 5.— Top left: The 2D spectral image of the BCG of CHIPS1911+4455 from the Nordic Optical Telescope showing that the line-
emitting gas is extended along the slit (vertical) direction. This confirms that the [O II] emission is not coming (exclusively) from a central
AGN, and that the extended emission in Fig. 1 is indicating the presence of cool gas, rather than purely blue continuum from young stars.
Bottom left: The 1D spectrum in the rest frame from the 2D spectral image above. Grey dash lines show the location of well-known
emission lines. The spectrum clearly shows the strong [O II] doublet at 3727Å and the Hα emission line at 6562.8Å. Right: The fitted
spectral energy distribution (SED) model with broad-band optical data (g, r, i, z, and y) from Pan-STARRS and mid-IR from WISE."
"massive galaxy would happen naturally during a merger
(i.e., in CHIPS1911+4455). The X-ray data in Fig. 1
support this scenario, depicting a disturbed cool core
elongated in the north-south direction. While the bulk
of the cool, star-forming gas extends along a southern-
pointing filament, there is a fainter blue filament that
connects the central BCG to the more northern X-ray
peak. This suggests that the northern X-ray peak might
contain low-entropy gas that is dislodged from the loca-
tion of the BCG. The existence of this system – a dynam-
ically active but rapidly cooling core – provides evidence
that mergers may stimulate star formation and enhance
cooling. This process would be especially relevant in the
distant universe when mergers were more common com-
pared to present time (Fakhouri et al. 2010)."
"Closely related to this, in the chaotic cold accretion
scenario (CCA; e.g., Gaspari et al. 2019) turbulence is
a key ingredient to drive direct non-linear thermal in-
stability and extended condensation. During CCA the
global driver can be tied not only to AGN feedback, but
to mergers too, which can stimulate significant amount of
turbulence (e.g., Lau et al. 2017) and density fluctuations
at large injection scales, enabling enhanced condensation."
"In summary, there are multiple ways that a recent
cluster-cluster merger could enhance cooling: by increas-
ing the fall-back time of a low-entropy cloud (lowering
tcool/tff), by physically separating the cool gas and the
heat source (AGN), and by increasing the local turbu-
lence, leading to larger density fluctuations. The inclu-
sion of dynamically-active clusters in the suite of high-
resolution, zoom-in simulations that study the detailed
interplay between radio-loud AGN and the cooling, mul-
tiphase ICM (e.g., Gaspari et al. 2019), is a necessary
next step towards understand the relative importance of
these phenomena."
5. CONCLUSION
"In this work, we present new data from Hubble, Chan-
dra, and the Nordic Optical Telescope. Our findings are
summarized as follows:"
"1. We measure the ICM density in the core (r <
10 kpc) of CHIPS1911+4455 to be 0.09 cm−3,
which is typical for a cool-core cluster. The core
entropy is 17+2−9 keV cm"
"2, which is within the low-
est ten percent for cluster cores from the ACCEPT
samples (Cavagnolo et al. 2009). The low entropy
core is a clear signature of strong cooling in the
center of the cluster."
"2. The X-ray morphology of CHIPS1911+4455 is
highly peaked in the center (96th percentile for
“peakiness”) and very asymmetric (7th percentile
for “symmetry”) compared to a large sample of X-
ray-selected clusters. This contradiction in its mor-
phology between a relaxed (peaky) cluster and a
dynamically active (asymmetric) cluster is highly
unusual, and is rarely observed."
"3. Based on the [O ii] emission line luminosity, we
measure a SFR in the BCG of 189+25−22 M� yr"
"−1.
This is consistent with an estimate based on the
mid-IR continuum of 143+31−26 M� yr"
"−1. This BCG
is among the five most star-forming BCGs in the
low-z Universe. Data from Hubble confirm that this
emission is extended in complex blue filaments near
the BCG, with no evidence for an ongoing merger."
"4. Based on the highly asymmetric X-ray morphology
on small (∼20 kpc) scales, coupled with the excep-
tionally low core entropy, we propose that rapid
cooling in this system may have been triggered by
a dynamical interaction between two similar-mass
clusters. In this scenario, some of the low-entropy
gas from the more massive cluster is dislodged
from the central AGN-hosting galaxy. For the
low-entropy gas separated from the central galaxy,
cooling is more favorable due to the longer mixing
times, enhanced large-scale turbulence and CCA
rain, and lack of a direct heat source (AGN). This
system may provide a link to high-redshift clusters,"
6 Somboonpanyakul et al.
"where previous studies have found an abundance of
star-forming BCGs in dynamically-active clusters."
"CHIPS1911+4455 is the first low-redshift (z < 1)
galaxy cluster with this distinctive characteristic (hosting
a high star-forming BCG and a strong cool-core but hav-
ing a disturbed morphology). The cluster was discovered
by the Clusters Hiding in Plain Sight (CHiPS ) survey be-
cause of its exceptionally bright cool core that appears
to be point-like in previous X-ray cluster catalogs (Som-
boonpanyakul et al. 2018). CHIPS1911+4455 represents
a unique opportunity to understand the relationship be-
tween a merging galaxy cluster and star formation in its
BCG, which, in turn, unravels an alternative method to
form cooling flows and massive starbursts apart from a"
"simple accretion model. This mechanism will become
much more important at high redshift (z > 1) when the
cluster merger rate is significantly higher (Fakhouri et al.
2010; McDonald et al. 2016)."
