ABSTRACT
"Context. Water is an important molecule in interstellar and circumstellar environments. Previous observations of mid-infrared (IR)
rotational lines of OH toward star-forming regions suggest that OH emission may be used to probe the photodissociation of water.
Aims. Our goal is to propose a method to quantify H2O photodissociation and measure the local ultraviolet (UV) flux from observa-
tions of mid-infrared OH lines.
Methods. Cross sections for the photodissociation of H2O resolving individual electronic, vibrational, and rotational states of the OH
fragment are collected. The state distribution of nascent OH following H2O photodissociation is computed for various astrophysically
relevant UV radiation fields (e.g., a single Lyα line or a broadband spectrum). These distributions are incorporated in a new molecular
excitation code called GROSBETA, which includes radiative pumping, collisional (de)excitation, and prompt emission (i.e., following
the production of OH in excited states). The influence of the photodissociation rate of H2O, the spectral shape of the UV radiation
field, the density, the temperature of the gas, and the strength of the IR background radiation field on the integrated line intensities are
studied in detail. As a test case, our model is compared to Spitzer-IRS observations at the tip of the HH 211 bow-shock.
Results. The OH rotational line intensities in the range 9−16 µm, covering rotational transitions with Nup = 18 to 45, are proportional
to the column density of H2O photodissociated per second by photons in the range 114 − 143 nm (denoted as ΦB̃) and do not depend
on other local properties such as the IR radiation field, the density, or the kinetic temperature. Provided an independent measurement
of the column density of water is available, the strength of the local UV radiation field can be deduced with good accuracy, regardless
of the exact shape of the UV field. In contrast, OH lines at longer far-IR wavelengths are primarily produced by IR radiative pumping
and collisions, depending on the chemical pumping rate defined asDB̃ = ΦB̃/N(OH) and on the local physical conditions (nH, TK, IR
radiation field). Our model successfully reproduces the OH mid-IR lines in the 10 − 16 µm range observed toward the tip of the HH
211 bow-shock and shows that the jet shock irradiates its surroundings, exposing H2O to a UV photon flux that is about 5× 103 times
larger than the standard interstellar radiation field. We also find that chemical pumping by the reaction H2 + O may supplement the
excitation of lines in the range 16 − 30 µm, suggesting that these lines could also be used to measure the two-body formation rates of
OH.
Conclusions. The mid-IR lines of OH constitute a powerful diagnostic for inferring the photodissociation rate of water and thus the
UV field that water is exposed to. Future JWST-MIRI observations will be able to map the photodestruction rate of H2O in various
dense (nH& 106 cm−3) and irradiated environments and provide robust estimates of the local UV radiation field."

1. Introduction"
"Oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the interstellar
medium (ISM) after hydrogen and helium. Water is an im-
portant oxygen-bearing molecule in the formation of stars and
planets.Water ice promotes the coagulation of dust grains, from
dense clouds to planet-forming disks (Chokshi et al. 1993; Testi
et al. 2014; Schoonenberg & Ormel 2017), and water vapor is
an important coolant of the gas in warm molecular environments
(Neufeld et al. 1995), particularly in embedded protostellar sys-
tems (Karska et al. 2013). Ultimately, the delivery of water to
young planets and small bodies conditions the emergence of life
as we know it (Chyba & Hand 2005). Following the trail of wa-"
"ter and its associated chemistry from clouds to young forming
planets is a major goal of astrochemistry (van Dishoeck et al.
2014)."
"Infrared (IR) observations, supplemented by chemical mod-
eling, have demonstrated that abundant ice is built at the sur-
face of grains in cold dense clouds, locking in ∼ 25% of the
oxygen (Cuppen & Herbst 2007; Boogert et al. 2015). En route
to the protostellar disk, condensed H2O is released into the gas
phase by passive heating from the accreting protostar (Cecca-
relli et al. 1996) and jet-driven shocks (e.g., Flower & Pineau
des Forêts 2012). Under these dense (nH& 106 cm−3) and warm
(T & 200 K) conditions, oxygen chemistry is then driven by fast"

"neutral-neutral reactions and photodissociation. In this context,
the hydroxyl radical (OH) is a key reactive intermediate between
atomic oxygen and water. The available gas-phase atomic oxy-
gen is converted into OH by the reaction O + H2 → OH + H,
followed by the formation of water through OH + H2 → H2O +
H. OH is destroyed by the latter reaction, by the former reaction
in the backward direction, and by UV photodissociation. Water
is also destroyed either by the backward reaction H2O + H →
OH + H2 or by photodissociation leading mostly to OH."
"The observations of warm H2O and OH vapor toward em-
bedded protostars culminated with the Herschel Space Observa-
tory (van Dishoeck et al. 2011), which outperformed previous
far-IR and submillimeter observatories (e.g., SWAS, Odin, ISO-
LWS). The detection of far-IR OH lines in inner envelopes and
outflows (Wampfler et al. 2010, 2011, 2013; Goicoechea et al.
2015), supplemented by similar detections in prototypical pho-
todissociation regions (Goicoechea et al. 2011; Parikka et al.
2017) and extragalactic sources (Sturm et al. 2011; González-
Alfonso et al. 2012) evidenced the presence of an active warm
oxygen chemistry in dense interstellar environments. One of the
most striking results is the relatively low abundance of gaseous
water found toward most of the protostellar sources, which con-
trasts with the abundant water ice supplied by the infalling en-
velope. In particular, multiple outflow components, which dom-
inate H2O emission, exhibit abundances ranging from 10−7 to
10−5 (Kristensen et al. 2012; Nisini et al. 2013; Kristensen
et al. 2017). Water vapor from envelopes and perhaps embed-
ded disks is typically traced by H172 O and H"

"observed by Herschel-HIFI and (sub)millimeter interferometers
(NOEMA, SMA, ALMA). While Visser et al. (2013) show that
water abundance can be as high as 10−4, most of the protostellar
systems exhibit lower water abundances, typically ranging be-
tween 10−7 and 10−5 (Jørgensen & van Dishoeck 2010; Persson
et al. 2012, 2016; Harsono et al. 2020). Following the dissipation
of the envelope, near- and mid-IR observations from space (e.g.,
Spitzer) and from the ground (e.g., VLT-CRIRES) have unveiled
abundant hot water vapor in the planet-forming regions of Class
II disks (. 10 au, Pontoppidan et al. 2014) but surprisingly dry
Herbig disks (Pontoppidan et al. 2010; Fedele et al. 2011; Walsh
et al. 2015)."
"The solution to this conundrum of low water abundance may
lie in the impact of the ultraviolet (UV) radiation field produced
by the accreting young star or strong jet shocks (V & 40 km s−1).
Observations of hydrides provide evidence of the driving role of
UV irradiation in the chemistry of protostars (Benz et al. 2016).
It has been proposed that the low abundance of H2O in protostel-
lar outflows is the result of the UV photodissociation of H2O va-
por (Nisini et al. 2002, 2013; Karska et al. 2014). The low water
abundance in embedded protostellar disks is generally attributed
to the freeze-out of water (Visser et al. 2009). However, recent
constraints on the thermal structures of Class 0 disk-like struc-
tures may contradict this interpretation (van ’t Hoff et al. 2020)
and require the efficient destruction of H2O or a large opacity of
the dust in the far-IR."
"The impact of UV photodissociation is generally explored by
means of astrochemical models (van Kempen et al. 2010; Visser
et al. 2012; Panoglou et al. 2012; Yvart et al. 2016). However,
the strength of the local UV radiation field incident on disks,
envelopes, and outflows is poorly known, due to the complex
sources of UV emission and the unknown level of dust and gas
attenuation on the line of sight, severely limiting the diagnostic
capabilities. Assessing the exact role of UV photodissociation
of water from astrochemical models based only on molecular
abundances remains highly uncertain."
"Alternatively, the excitation of molecular species provides
in some cases a direct access to their formation and destruc-
tion routes. In irradiated regions, IR lines of H2 and CO from
ro-vibrationally excited levels trace the UV pumping followed
by radiative decay (Krotkov et al. 1980; Black & van Dishoeck
1987) and have been used to probe the photodissociation of these
species (Röllig et al. 2007; Thi et al. 2013). The excitation of
reactive species for which the collisional time scale is compa-
rable to the destruction time scale, carry also key information
on their formation and destruction rates through a process called
”chemical pumping” (Black 1998). So far, the incorporation of
a state-to-state chemistry in models (i.e., models considering the
state distribution of the reagents and the products) have been car-
ried out only for a handful of molecular ions relevant for diffuse
ISM and early universe (Godard & Cernicharo 2013; Stäuber &
Bruderer 2009; Coppola et al. 2013)."
"Mid-infrared observations with Spitzer-IRS toward proto-
stellar outflows and young disks evidenced the presence of a su-
perthermal population of rotationally excited OH with energies
up to Eup ' 28000 K (Tappe et al. 2008, 2012; Carr & Najita
2014). Two decades of extensive quantum calculations supple-
mented by laboratory experiments have permitted the direct in-
terpretation of these observations as the smoking gun of H2O
photodissociation. Specifically, seminal works have shown that
H2O photodissociation through the Ã excited electronic state of
H2O (λ & 143 nm) produces OH in vibrationally hot but rota-
tionally cold states (e.g., Hwang et al. 1999a; Yang et al. 2000;
van Harrevelt & van Hemert 2001), whereas photodissociation
through the B̃ state (114 . λ . 143 nm) produces OH in high
rotational states with levels up to N ' 47 (E ' 45000 K, Harich
et al. 2000; van Harrevelt & van Hemert 2000). The rotationally
excited lines of OH would thus probe the radiative cascade of
OH products following their formation via H2O photodissocia-
tion, a process called ”prompt emission”. If consistently mod-
eled, rotational lines of OH can thus give a direct access to the
photodissociation of H2O. However, a detailed modeling that in-
cludes chemical data accumulated over the past decades is lack-
ing."
"Probing H2O photodissocation in astrophysical environ-
ments may also lead to unique constraints on the local UV irradi-
ation field that H2O is exposed to. The far-UV radiation field is a
key parameter that controls the chemical, physical, and dynam-
ical evolution of circumstellar regions. It regulates the overall
chemistry of disk upper layers (e.g., van Dishoeck et al. 2006;
Walsh et al. 2012) and outflows (Panoglou et al. 2012; Tabone
et al. 2020), the thermal structure of disks (Gorti & Hollen-
bach 2004; Bruderer et al. 2012; Woitke et al. 2016), and the
coupling between the gas and the magnetic field (e.g., Gammie
1996; Wang et al. 2019). The impact of the UV radiation field de-
pends not only on attenuation processes, but also on its spectral
shape. While the interstellar radiation field exhibits a broadband
emission down to 91 nm (Habing 1968; Draine 1978; Mathis
et al. 1983), the UV radiation emitted by accreting nascent stars
(Bergin et al. 2003; Herczeg et al. 2004; Yang et al. 2012;
Schindhelm et al. 2012) or by strong jet shocks (& 40 km s,−1
Raymond 1979; Dopita & Sutherland 2017) is often dominated
by Lyman-α emission, leading to the selective photodissociation
of species that exhibit large photodissociation cross sections at
121.6 nm."
"To date, few robust diagnostics have been proposed to di-
rectly access the local UV radiation field. H2 and CO lines ex-
cited by UV pumping probe only UV photons in narrow lines at
< 114 nm that are rapidly attenuated and are not indicative of
the broadband UV spectrum relevant for the other UV photopro-"

"Benoît Tabone, Marc C. van Hemert, Ewine F. van Dishoeck, John H. Black: OH mid-infrared emission as a diagnostic of H2O UV
photodissociation"
"cesses. Chemical diagnostics have also been proposed but they
rely either on H2 UV pumping (e.g., CN formed from excited
H2, Cazzoletti et al. 2018) or depend on elemental abundance
ratios (e.g., hydrocarbons, Bergin et al. 2016)."
"In this work, we explore the potential of the OH mid-IR
lines for probing H2O photodissociation and the local UV ra-
diation field under a broad range of physical conditions repre-
sentative of dense irradiated environments, such as molecular
shocks, circumstellar media, and prototypical photodissociation
regions (PDRs). To reach this goal, results of quantum mechan-
ical calculations resolving the electronic, vibrational, and rota-
tional states of the OH product following H2O dissociation at
different UV wavelengths are collected. The distribution of the
OH fragments following H2O photodissociation by UV fields of
various spectral shapes are derived. The emerging line intensities
are then calculated using GROSBETA, a new molecular excitation
code that includes prompt emission, radiative decay, collisional
(de)excitation, and IR radiative pumping in a slab approach. For
sake of conciseness, ro-vibrational lines of OH are not studied in
this work."
"In Sect. 2, we present the OH model and the basics of
GROSBETA. The competition of the different excitation processes
on the OH line intensities are studied in detail for H2O photodis-
sociation at Lyα (λ = 121.6 nm) and extended to other UV radia-
tion fields in Sect. 3. In Sec. 4, a method to observationally derive
the amount of H2O photodissociated per unit time, the photodis-
sociation rate of H2O, and the strength of the local UV radiation
field is proposed and applied to Spitzer-IRS observations of the
tip of the HH 211 protostellar bow-shock. Our findings are sum-
marized in Sect. 5."
2. Model
2.1. OH model
2.1.1. Energy levels
"H2O photodissociation can produce OH with high rotational and
vibrational quantum numbers in the X2Π ground and the A2Σ+
first excited electronic states. Our OH model includes the en-
ergy levels provided by Brooke et al. (2016) and Yousefi et al.
(2018) and made available on the EXOMOL database1. Figure 1-
a shows the electronic, vibrational, and rotational levels included
in the model. Regarding the ground electronic state OH(X2Π),
vibrational levels up to 3 = 13 were included. We retained ro-
tational levels that are stable against dissociation and in partic-
ular included energy levels above the dissociation energy of the
OH(X) that are stabilized by the centrifugal barrier (Chang et al.
2019). This corresponds to a quantum number of N = 54 in the
3 = 0 state, where N denotes the rotational quantum number as-
sociated with the motion of the nuclei. Each rotational level is
further split into two spin-orbit manifolds corresponding to pro-
jected quantum numbers of the sum of the electronic orbital and
spin angular momenta of Ω = 3/2 and Ω = 1/2 (see Fig. 1-b).
This results in two rotational ladders with fine-structure levels
characterized by a total angular momentum quantum number of
J = N + 1/2 and J = N − 1/2, respectively. Lastly, each rota-
tional level (N,Ω) is further split by the Λ-doubling into two lev-
els labeled by their spectroscopic parity index2 e/ f . Our model"
"1 http://www.exomol.com/, Tennyson et al. (2016)
2 The spectroscopic parity index is related to the parity p = +/− by
the relation � = p(−1)J−1/2, where � = 1 for e states and � = −1 for f
states."
"includes the fine structure and Λ-splitting of the OH(X2Π)(3,N)
states. Hyperfine structure is not considered in this work."
"Regarding the OH(A2Σ+) state, levels with 3 ≥ 2 are dis-
sociative (van Dishoeck & Dalgarno 1983) and the 3 = 0 with
N ≥ 26 and the 3 = 1 with N ≥ 17 levels are predissociated
(Yarkony 1992). Therefore, we limited the OH(A) levels to lower
N of the 3 = 0, 1 states. The two rotational ladders emerging
from the spin-orbit coupling of the OH(A2Σ+)(3) states were also
taken into account. In the following, the electronic, vibrational,
rotational, fine-structure, and parity states of OH are labeled as
Λ, 3, N, Ω, and �, respectively."
2.1.2. Radiative transitions
"Our OH model includes 54276 radiative transitions with their
corresponding Einstein-A coefficients from Brooke et al. (2016)
and Yousefi et al. (2018). The mid- and far-IR lines of OH origi-
nate from radiative transitions occurring within vibrational states
(∆3 = 0) of the OH(X) state (Fig. 1-c). Figure 1-b shows the ra-
diative transitions that connect levels within a vibrational level of
the X2Π ground state. The radiative transitions with the highest
Einstein-A coefficients are the intra-ladder rotational transitions
N → N − 1 (or equivalently J → J − 1) that preserve the e/f
parity. These transitions give rise to lines from the mid- to the
far-IR (see Fig. 1-c). The cross-ladder transitions connecting the
Ω = 1/2 and Ω = 3/2 states are of two kinds: J-conserving
(∆N = −1) and e/f conserving transitions, and J → J ± 1
(∆N = 0,−2) and e/f parity changing transitions. Einstein-A co-
efficients of the latter two kinds are at least an order of magnitude
lower than intra-ladder transitions and can be used to measure
the opacity of the intra-ladder lines. Lastly, the Λ-doubling tran-
sitions, that lie from centimeter to sub-millimeter wavelengths
are also considered in this work. Rovibrational transitions follow
the same selection rules and any rovibrational transition accom-
panied by any change of vibrational quantum number 3′ → 3′′
is included in this work. Rovibrational lines 3′ = 1 → 3′′ = 0
typically lie at near-IR wavelengths, around 2.7 µm. Transitions
connecting to the OH(A2Σ+) state are electronic dipole allowed
at near UV wavelengths."
2.2. Excitation by H2O photodissociation
"The OH state-specific formation rate associated with the photo-
process"
"H2O + hν→ OH(λ,Λ, 3,N,Ω, �) + H (1)"
can be expressed as
"k(Λ, 3,N,Ω, �) =
∫
λ"
"η(λ,Λ, 3,N,Ω, �)σ̄(λ)I(λ)dλ (2)"
"and measured in cgs units in s−1. In this equation,
η(λ,Λ, 3,N,Ω, �) is the probability of forming OH in a given
state following H2O photodissociation by a photon of wave-
length λ, σ̄ is the total photodissociation cross section ([cm2]) of
H2O→ OH + H at that wavelength, and I(λ) is the photon flux
averaged over all incidence angles ([photon cm−2 s−1 cm−1])."
"We assumed that the fine structure and Λ-doubling states of
OH are equally populated by the photoprocess (1) so that η does
not depend on Ω and �. It is also convenient to define the nascent
state distribution of the OH fragments as"

"The absorption of a UV photon in the range 143 to 190 nm
excites H2O in its first excited singlet state Ã (first absorption
band) and leads to a direct dissociation to OH + H. In this work,
we adopted the OH state-specific cross sections computed by van
Harrevelt & van Hemert (2001) using a wave packet approach.
These data successfully reproduce the total photodissociation
cross section of water in the considered energy range as well
as the OH distributions measured by time-of-flight spectroscopy
techniques (Yang et al. 2000). Figure 2-a shows the distribution
of the OH fragments following photodissociation by a photon of
wavelength λ = 166 nm, where the cross section of the first ab-
sorption band peaks. Throughout the first absorption band, OH
is produced in a rotationally cold (N . 9) but vibrationally hot
state (see also Appendix A). The proportion of vibrationally ex-
cited states increases with photon energy."
"The absorption of a UV photon in the second absorption
band (B̃ state of H2O) results in a nonadiabatic transition, lead-
ing to OH in its ground electronic state and in a direct dissoci-
ation forming electronically excited OH. The second absorption
band produces a broad continuum bump in the photodissocia-
tion cross section of H2O in the range 114 to 143 nm. However,
shortward of 124.6 nm, this dissociation channel coexists with"
"the third and fourth absorption bands that result in sharper peaks
in the photodissociation cross section (see Fig. A.3). As argued
by van Harrevelt & van Hemert (2008), the C̃ and D̃ states are
bound states and predissociated by the B̃ state. We consequently
assumed that these channels lead to the same state distribution
of the OH fragments as that via the B̃ state at the same photon
energy. This is further supported by the agreement between ex-
periments at λ ≤ 124 nm (e.g., Lyα, Harich et al. 2000) and
theoretical work considering only the fragmentation dynamics
from the B̃ state (van Harrevelt & van Hemert 2000, 2008). In
the following, we use the term ""photodissociation through the B̃
state"" to refer to photodissociation in the range 114 to 143 nm.
In order to obtain the relevant OH distributions, we repeated the
quantum wave packet calculations as described in van Harrev-
elt & van Hemert (2000), but using the Dobbyn and Knowles
potential (Dobbyn & Knowles 1997) instead of the Leiden po-
tential since it was found that it gave better agreement with ex-
periments (Fillion et al. 2001). In this wavelength range, H2O
photodissociation also leads to O with a branching ratio com-
puted by van Harrevelt & van Hemert (2008). We used the total
photodissociation cross section measured by Mota et al. (2005)
that includes features due to the C̃ and D̃ states of H2O (see Fig.
A.3). The photodissociation cross section of H2O → OH + H
was then derived by taking into account the branching ratio of
the OH forming channel as described by Heays et al. (2017)."

todissociation by lower energy photons, photodissociation in the
range 114 to 143 nm produces OH(X2Π) with low vibrational
excitation but high rotational excitation. OH is produced pref-
erentially in the ground vibrational and electronic state, and the
resulting rotational distribution within this state peaks around
N = 45, corresponding to an energy level of ' 45000 K. As
shown in Appendix A (see Fig. A.1), the peak in the rotational
distribution increases with the photon energy from N ' 35 up to
N ' 49. The other vibrational states follow a similar rotational
distribution as that of the 3 = 0 state, but their relative contri-
bution is much smaller, with less than 5% of OH produced in
each of the OH(X)(3 ≥ 1) states at Lyα. A fraction of OH is also
produced in the excited electronic state OH(A) for λ < 137 nm.
The rotational distributions of the 3 = 0, 1 states exhibit the same
pattern as that of OH(X) but shifted toward lower N numbers."
"Shortward of λ = 114 nm, photodissociation proceeds via
even more excited electronic states of H2O and systematic quan-
tum calculations are lacking. Time-of-flight spectroscopy indi-
cates that at λ = 115 nm OH distributions are vibrationally hot-
ter than those computed through the B̃ but still rotationally hot
(Chang et al. 2019). Photodissociation shortward of λ = 114 nm
may also produce preferentially atomic oxygen instead of OH.
In this work, we neglected the contribution of OH produced
through photodissociation at wavelengths shorter than 114 nm."
"Our adopted chemical dataset pertains only to water in the
rotational ground state (""cold water""). Experimental data sug-
gest that photodissociation of ""warm water"" could result in a"
"small change in the rotational distribution of OH in the range
N ' 32 − 40 (Hwang et al. 1999b). This change would however
affect only lines coming from N & 32 in the 9 − 10.5 µm range
(see Sec. 3). Additionally, the adopted dataset does not include
the fine-structure and the Λ-doubling states of the OH products.
Recent theoretical investigations suggest that photodissociation
through the B̃ state produces OH preferentially in the A′ symmet-
ric states, that corresponds to the (Ω = 1/2, e) and (Ω = 3/2, f )
states (Zhou et al. 2015). This asymmetry is also expected to
depend on the rotational state of the parent H2O, which is not
considered here. New quantum calculations resolving the fine-
structure and the Λ-doubling state and including the rotational
state of the parent H2O are needed to study in detail the A′/A′′
asymmetry. Our predictions presented in Sec. 3 remain valid by
summing the line intensities over the fine-structure and Λ dou-
blets of each Nup line."
2.3. OH excitation
"When radiative processes dominate, the emitted spectrum of OH
will be governed by the state-specific dissociation rates of H2O
(see Eq. (2)) and by the spontaneous transition probabilities in
the subsequent cascade of vibronic and rotational transitions.
This is called the prompt spectrum of OH. In astrophysically
relevant conditions, excited states of OH can be populated in
steady-state by various other collisional and radiative processes,
and these excited molecules also contribute to an observable
spectrum. Thus the true population of excited OH differs from
the nascent population."
"In this work, the OH level populations and the line intensities
were computed with a new code named GROSBETA (Black et al.
in prep.). This code is based on a single-zone model, following
the formalism presented in van der Tak et al. (2007) and imple-
mented in the RADEX 3 code. Under the assumption of statistical
equilibrium, the local population densities, denoted ni [cm−3],

Tak et al. (2007), the contribution of the lines to the local radia-
tion field was computed following the escape probability method

ture) are fixed, the solution depends only on the value of the ratio

"and Kłos et al. (2007), respectively. The rate coefficients com-
puted by Offer et al. (1994) that include levels up to N = 5 have
been extrapolated to higher N numbers (see Appendix B)."
"The induced radiative rates in Eq. (5) depend upon mean in-
tensities J̄ν at the frequencies of all OH transitions. Thus the ex-
citation model requires a specified ambient radiation field. Pure
rotational and vibration-rotation transitions involve infrared ra-
diation, which we parametrized as a blackbody intensity (Planck
function) at a temperature TIR times a geometrical dilution fac-
tor W. For illustration, we took W = 1. This gives a sim-
ple parametrization of the IR radiation field and a reasonably
good proxy for the local radiation field in the far-IR regime rel-
evant for the IR radiative pumping of pure rotational lines of the
OH(X2Π)(3 = 0) state. The impact of a more complex and real-
istic IR radiation field on the line intensities is briefly discussed
in Sec. 3.1.2. Electronic transitions A − X respond to the near-
ultraviolet. In this work, we neglected the impact of the near-UV
radiative pumping."
"The impact of formation and destruction of OH on its level
population is described by the last two terms in Eq. (4). When
activation barriers can be overcome (TK & 200 K), OH is primar-
ily produced by the reaction of O atoms with H2 and is rapidly
converted into H2O by the reaction with H2. In turn, OH can also
be regenerated from H2O by UV photodissociation or by the re-
action with atomic hydrogen. Photodissociation of OH, which
is generally slower than H2O photodissociation (depending on
the spectral shape of the UV radiation field, see Heays et al.
2017), can also limit the abundance of OH. The formation and
destruction routes are described by the state specific rates Fki and
Dk"
"i , respectively. Their relative importance depends on the exact
physical conditions. A complete model coupling chemistry and
excitation of OH is beyond the scope of the present paper and
for the sake of generality and conciseness, we made a number
of simplifying assumptions to focus on the impact of H2O pho-
todissociation on OH excitation in various environments with a
limited number of free parameters. The possible impact of O+H2
on the excitation of OH is discussed in Sec. 4.2.1. In this work,
we assumed that chemical steady-state holds, so that"
"Fki =

"where F is the total formation rate of OH ([cm−3 s−1]), and

neglected any state selective destruction of OH assuming that
OH is destroyed at the same rate for each state denoted here as
D (i.e.,Di does not depend on i)4. Finally, we assumed that only
H2O photodissociation leading to OH modifies the level popula-
tion of OH, with a state specific rate of Fi = n(H2O)k(i), where
n(H2O) is the number density of H2O and k(i) the state specific
formation rate defined in Eq. (2)."
"Equation (4) can then be rewritten as an equation on the col-

tion fields of various shape that are given in Fig. A.3, including
narrow-band and broadband UV spectra."
"Equation (7) shows that Φ is the relevant parameter that ul-
timately controls the impact of prompt emission on the OH line
intensities. The relation between the strength of the UV radia-
tion field and Φ depends on its spectral shape. For a Lyα UV

In this work we adopt Φ = 107 cm−2 s−1 as a fiducial value and
explore a broad range of values (see Table 1)."
Φ can also be written as
"Φ ≡ DN(OH), (11)"
"whereD ([s−1]) is generally referred to as a destruction rate (see
e.g., van der Tak et al. 2007; Stäuber & Bruderer 2009). Since
chemical steady-state is assumed,D is also connected to the for-
mation rate of OH. If other chemical reactions participate to the
formation and destruction of OH (see Eq. (4)) and if these addi-
tional reactions form and destroy OH in proportion to their local
population densities, then Eq. (7) still holds butD would not be
associated with a destruction rate.D should rather be associated
with a chemical pumping rate equal to the formation rate of the
species by the considered process (in cm−3 s−1) divided by its
particle number density."
"The line intensities were computed taking into account opti-
cal depth effects under the large velocity approximation. When
calculating the line intensities, we assumed that the IR contin-
uum background interacting with the gas is not along the same
line of sight as the observations are taken. That is, the IR field
contributes to the radiative pumping but not to the line forma-
tion. Throughout this work, we present line intensities I in erg

3. Results
"Figure 3 illustrates the difference between OH spectra follow-
ing H2O photodissociation through the Ã and B̃ state. Photodis-
sociation via the H2O Ã state leads to an OH spectrum dom-
inated by far-IR lines coming from low rotational levels. H2O
photodissociation does not impact the mid- and far-IR spectrum
since only collisions and IR pumping contribute to the excitation
of those lines. In contrast, photodissociation through the H2O B̃
state produces additional lines lying in the mid-IR coming from
high-N states (15 . N . 45). These lines are produced by H2O
photodissociation. In this section, we shall identify the physi-
cal quantities that can be retrieved from the intensities of the
mid- and far-IR lines. To do so, an in-depth study of the exci-
tation mechanisms is provided in the case of photodissociation
by Lyα photons (121.6 nm). The impact of a broadband UV ra-
diation field, for which photodissociation proceeds through both
the H2O Ã and B̃ states is then studied."
3.1. Lyman alpha
"As seen in Sect. 2.2, photodissociation of H2O by Lyα photons
produces OH in high rotational states (Fig. 2-b). Figure 4 illus-
trates the influence of the column density of H2O photodisso-
ciated per unit time denoted as Φ and of the column density of
OH, N(OH). The results of a more systematic exploration of the
parameter space are presented in Fig. 5 by focusing on the inten-
sities of three representative rotational lines that will be observed
by JWST-MIRI (see Table 2)."
3.1.1. High-N lines: Prompt emission
"The mid-IR spectrum (λ . 20 µm) is dominated by pure intra-
ladder rotational lines emerging from levels with high rotational
quantum number (N ≥ 14), corresponding to upper energies
> 5000 K. Figure 4 shows that in this wavelength range, the
line intensities are higher for a larger value of Φ (top and mid-
dle panels) but do not depend on N(OH) (top and bottom pan-
els). The relative intensities of the intra-ladder lines depend nei-
ther on N(OH) nor on Φ so we focus on the intensity of the"

tronic state. The density, temperature of the background radiation and
kinetic temperature are fixed to their fiducial values (see Table 1) and

ing from cross-ladder and intra-ladder transitions."

proxy for the intensities of the mid-IR lines. Figure 5 (left pan-
els) shows that the absolute line intensity is directly proportional
to Φ and does not depend on other parameters such as N(OH),
TIR or nH. This is one of the most fundamental properties of
the high-N lines that makes them an unambiguous diagnostic
of H2O photodissociation."
"This very simple result points toward a simple excitation
process. Due to the high energy of the upper levels, IR radia-
tive pumping does not contribute to the excitation of these lines.
De-excitation by stimulated emission by the IR background is
also negligible as long as the photon occupation number is much
smaller than unity in the mid-IR domain, a condition that is ful-
filled over the full parameter space. Due to the very high crit-
ical densities of these levels (ncrit & 1013 cm−3), collisional
(de)excitation is also negligible. Instead, the level populations,
and the intensity of the lines coming from those levels, are set by
the radiative cascade following the formation of OH in high-N
states by H2O photodissociation. The line intensities, or equiva-
lently the number of radiative transitions per unit time between
two excited levels, are then directly proportional to the forma-
tion rate of OH in higher excited states, which is proportional to
the photodissociation rate of H2O. The proportionality between
the mid-IR line intensity and Φ is thus a direct consequence of
the radiative cascade."
"In order to analyze the relative intensity of the mid-IR lines,
it is then convenient to define the normalized and dimensionless"

frequency of the line. As long as the population of the high-N
levels is set by the radiative cascade, IN,Ω,� depends only on the
distribution of nascent OH, or equivalently on the spectral shape
of the UV field, and not on Φ or on any other physical parameter.
Figure 6 shows that IN,Ω,� depends mostly on N and very little
on Ω and �. This is due to the fact that in our model, levels are
assumed to be populated by H2O photodissociation regardless
of their Ω and � states. In the following, we thus omit the refer-
ence to Ω and � and note the normalized line intensity as IN . IN
increases with decreasing N, with a stiff rise between N = 47
and N = 35. This feature is also visible in Fig. 4 where the
line intensities increase with wavelength between 9 and 10 µm.
For 22 ≤ N ≤ 32, IN is rather constant, corresponding also to
a rather flat mid-IR spectra between 10 and 20 µm (see Fig. 4).
This results in suprathermal excitation temperatures that vary be-
tween 2300 K for the lines at λ ' 20 µm up to 13000 K for the
lines at λ ' 10 µm."
"The normalized intensity IN is directly related to the distri-
bution of nascent OH. Interestingly, IN can be interpreted as the
probability that a photodissociation event H2O→ H + OH even-
tually leads to a radiative decay N → N − 1 via the radiative
cascade. As such, IN is necessarily smaller than unity. Because
we assume the spin-orbit and Λ-doubling states to be equally
populated by H2O photodissociation, IN . 1/4. Owing to the"
"selection rules, the rotational cascade within the 3 = 0 state is
dominated by N → N − 1 transitions. Moreover, OH produced
in an electronic level is shown to rapidly decay toward OH(X2Π)
with little change of rotational number. Consequently, the forma-
tion of an OH fragment in an OH(Λ, 3 = 0,N′) state eventually
leads to an intra-ladder transitions N → N − 1, with N ≤ N′. We
plot in Fig. 6 (solid line) an analytical prediction of IN assuming
that transitions N → N − 1 are supplied by the radiative decay
of the OH fragments produced in the 3 = 0 states (see model in
Appendix C). This analytical expression relies only on the dis-
tribution of nascent OH denoted as fi. The model reproduces the
increase in IN with deceasing N well, showing that its global
variation with N is mostly due the fact that more and more OH
fragments are added to the N → N − 1 rotational cascade as N
decreases. The radiative cascade should then rather be seen as
a ”radiative river” that grows by it tributaries. In particular, the
steep increase in IN from N = 47 to 35 is due to the fact that
most of the OH fragments are produced with these N-quantum
numbers (see Fig. 2-b)."
"We also note that for N < 35, our analytical model progres-
sively underestimates IN . This is due to the contribution of the
OH fragments produced in vibrationally excited states that are
not included in our first analytical model. In Fig. 6 (dashed line)
we show the analytical prediction of IN assuming that any OH
produced in an OH(Λ)(3,N) state immediately decays toward the
OH(X2Π)(3 = 0,N−1) state. The model overestimates IN show-
ing that vibrationally excited states tend to undergo rotational
transitions within 3 ≥ 1 vibrational states before decaying to the
3 = 0 state."
"In other words, the spectral shape of the normalized intensity
IN is set by the population of nascent OH following photodis-
sociation of H2O. Our two simple analytical models, which rely
only on the knowledge of the distribution of the OH fragments
fi, allow one to bracket IN ."
3.1.2. Low-N lines
"Figure 4 shows that, in contrast to the mid-IR lines, the far-
IR lines (λ > 40 µm) do not depend on the column density
of H2O photodissociated per unit time Φ but on N(OH). The
same conclusions apply to the cross-ladder transitions apparent
from 20 µm to 114 µm. All these lines arise from N . 6 levels
(Eup . 1200 K) and trace the bulk population of OH that is not
excited by the radiative cascade from high-N levels. Because of
the high optical depth of the intra-ladder lines, we focus in the
following on the optically thin cross-ladder transition at 24.6 µm
that arises from a N = 5 level (see Table 2). Figure 5 (right)
shows for a broader range of parameters that the intensity of this
line does not depend on Φ but on N(OH), TIR, and nH. Prompt
emission is always negligible and the line intensity is the result
of a competition between collisional (de-)excitation and IR ra-
diative pumping."
"Figure 5 (lower right panel) highlights three distinct excita-
tion regimes as a function of density. At low density, the intensity
does not depend on the density but on TIR. In this regime, labeled
by ­, levels are exclusively populated by IR radiative pumping.

"with TIR. For an IR radiation field that deviates from a black-
body, the excitation of the OH(X2Π)(3 = 0,N) levels is more
complex. In this general case, the radiation brightness temper-
ature Trad varies with wavelength across the far-IR spectrum of
OH (λ . 120 µm). As a rule of thumb, the line intensity is then
bracketed between our predictions with an undiluted blackbody
at a value of TIR that lies between the minimum and maximum
values of Trad."
"At intermediate density, the intensity increases with nH. For
our fiducial values of TIR and TK, it corresponds to densities be-
tween 108 and 1010cm−3. In this regime, labeled by ®, collisions
contribute to the excitation of the levels. However, line inten-
sities also depend on TIR, showing that IR radiative pumping is
also relevant. Since the density is smaller than the critical density
of the upper energy level (nH∼ 1011cm−3), the de-excitation of
the level is via radiative decay. Interestingly, the critical density
above which collisions contribute to the excitation of the levels
depends on TIR and on TK. It is lower for a lower TIR(Fig. 5, bot-
tom right) or for a higher TK (not shown here). By comparing the
rates of collisional excitation with the IR radiative pumping rate,
collisions take over from IR radiative pumping in the excitation
of a given N-level for"

"hνN/kB(1/TK−1/TIR), (15)"
"where νN denotes the frequency of the N → N − 1 radiative
transition, nγ is the photon occupation number, and where we
assume hνN � TIR for the second term. With ncrit having a weak
dependence on TK, the critical density above which collisions
take over from IR radiative pumping depends on the contrast
between the temperature of the gas and that of the radiation field."
"Finally, above the critical density of the upper energy level
(ncrit ' 1011cm−3), the line intensity converges toward its LTE
value. In this regime, labeled by ¯, collisions control the exci-
tation and the de-excitation of the level and Eq. (14) gives the
intensity of the optically thin line by substituting TIR by TK."
"One has to keep in mind that when IR radiative pumping is
relevant for the excitation of a level, the geometry of the source
turns out to be of great importance for the formation of the line
coming from this level. We recall that the line intensities pre-
sented in this work are computed assuming that the IR back-
ground does not contribute to the line formation process. If the
background IR field does contribute to the observed emission,
lines can be weaker or seen in absorption (see OH lines observed
by Wampfler et al. 2010, 2013). Collisions can also play a role in
the formation of the line even when negligible in the excitation of
the levels. Models incorporating specific source geometries are
beyond the scope of this work and have already been explored
to analyze low-N OH lines observed by Herschel toward pro-
tostars and photodissociation regions (Goicoechea et al. 2011;
Wampfler et al. 2013)."
3.1.3. Intermediate-N lines
"We have shown in Section 3.1.1 that the high-N rotational lines
excited by prompt emission are proportional to Φ and can thus be
used to probe the photodissociation of H2O. In contrast, low-N
lines do not depend on Φ and trace the bulk population of OH. It
is thus of a great importance to determine if a line coming from
an intermediate-N level is indeed excited by prompt emission or
by other processes such as IR radiative pumping or collisions."
"Figures 7-a and b show that the intermediate−N line at
27.4 µm, which originates from a N = 10 level, shares features
of low-N and high-N lines. This complex excitation pattern is"
"the result of the competition between prompt emission, IR ra-
diative pumping and collisions. Figure 7-c summarizes the dom-
inant excitation processes as a function of the density nH and the
chemical pumping rate D = Φ/N(OH) for the fiducial values of
TIR and N(OH)."
"For high values of the chemical pumping rate, the line in-
tensity normalized by N(OH) is proportional to D (Fig. 7-a).
This corresponds to the right part of the parameter space shown
in Fig. 7-c. In this regime, the excitation of the upper energy
level is dominated by prompt emission (regime ¬) and we re-
cover the result obtained for the high-N lines that the line in-
tensity is proportional to Φ = DN(OH) (Sec. 3.1.1). Figure 7-a
shows that below a critical value of the chemical pumping rate,
denoted here as Dcrit, the intensity does not depend on D as IR
radiative pumping or collisions take over from prompt emission.
This corresponds to the left region of the parameter space (Fig.
7-c). The excitation of the line as a function of the density then
follows a pattern similar to that found for low−N lines (Fig. 7-
b). At low density, the excitation is dominated by IR radiative
pumping (regime ­) whereas at higher density collisions pro-
gressively take over (regime ®). We find that for the fiducial val-
ues of TIR and TK, collisions contribute to the excitation of the
line above nH' 108 cm−3. However, we recall that the effect of
collisions on levels with N & 5 is highly uncertain due to the lack
of quantum calculations of collisional rate coefficients for these
levels. In other words, the parameter space is divided into two
regions: a region dominated by prompt emission for which re-
sults found in Sec. 3.1.1 apply, and a region dominated by other
excitation processes for which results found in Sec. 3.1.2 apply."
"The boundary between the two regions is defined by Dcrit
(green line Fig. 7-c). Its value depends on the parameters that
control the thermal and radiative excitation of OH, namely nH,
TK, and TIR. For example, Fig. 7-a shows that Dcrit increases
from ∼ 2 × 10−9 to ∼ 2 × 10−8 s−1 by increasing the density
from nH=107 to 109 cm−3. SinceDcrit quantifies the competition
between thermal or radiative excitation and prompt emission, it
also depends on the upper energy level of the line. We derive in
Appendix E simple estimates of Dcrit as a function of the ex-
citation conditions (nH, TIR, and TK) for any rotational level.
In particular, we show that the schematic view of the parame-
ter space proposed in Fig. 7-c remains valid for the low-N lines
for which the boundary is shifted to the right, and for high-N
lines, for which the boundary is shifted to the left by orders of
magnitudes."
3.1.4. Summary
"The integrated intensities of the lines coming from high-N levels
(N & 20) are proportional to the column density of H2O pho-
todissociated per unit time and do not depend on other physical
parameters. The shape of the mid-IR spectrum is only set by the
distribution of the nascent OH and we define a normalized inten-
sity of the intra-ladder lines, denoted as IN (Fig. 6). The cross-
ladder and intra-ladder rotational lines coming from low-N lev-
els (N . 6) are populated by IR radiative pumping or collisions
and are thus tracing the bulk population of OH. Intermediate-
N lines can be either excited by prompt emission, IR radiative
pumping and/or collisions (see Fig. 7-c)."

3.2. Other UV radiation fields
3.2.1. State distribution of the OH fragments
"Figure 8 shows the state distribution of the OH fragments fol-
lowing H2O photodissociation by UV radiation fields of vari-
ous spectral shapes. As shown in Section 3.1.1, the OH(A)(3,N)
states decay toward the ground electronic state with little change
of N. We consequently plot only the sum of the rotational distri-
bution of OH(X) and OH(A) as defined by"
"f̃i = f (X, 3,N) +
1
2"
"f (A, 3,N), (16)"
"where the factor 12 stands for the different degeneracies between
OH(A)(3,N) and OH(X)(3,N) states. The distribution of nascent
OH computed from Eqs. (2) and (3) results from photodissoci-
ation at various wavelengths. As shown in Sec. 2.2, the distri-
bution of the OH fragment η(λ, i) depends markedly on the UV
wavelength (see Fig. A.1). One of the most prominent differ-
ences is between photodissociation longward of λ = 143 nm,
that produces OH(X) in low-N states, and photodissociation
shortward of this value that produces OH(X) in high-N states and
a small fraction of electronically excited OH(A) with N ≤ 27.
The distribution of OH following H2O photodissociation by a
broad UV radiation field reflects the relative contribution of the
different photodissociation channels. The fraction of photodisso-
ciation that proceeds through the two channels is given in Table
3."
"We first study the effect a radiation field representative of the
UV spectrum emitted by an accreting T Tauri star that includes
a UV continuum plus emission lines (see Fig. A.3). As shown
by Bergin et al. (2003) and Schindhelm et al. (2012), Lyα emis-
sion dominates over the continuum emission with ∼ 90% of H2O
photodissociation done by Lyα photons. It results in a state dis-
tribution that is similar to that produced by a pure Lyα radiation
field (Fig. 8-a). Contribution of H2O photodissociation through
the H2O Ã state (λ ≥ 143 nm), that represents ∼ 10% of the total
photodissociation rate, is however seen at N ≤ 6."
"In contrast, a standard UV interstellar radiation field (ISRF)
has a smooth and rather flat spectral distribution (Fig. A.3). H2O
photodissociation then proceeds through a broad wavelength
range and results in a distribution of OH fragments that exhibits
features of both photodissociation through the H2O Ã and B̃ state
(Fig. 8-b). Photodissociation through the B̃ state creates a peak
in the rotational distribution around N = 41 similar to that pro-
duced by photodissociation by Lyα, though somewhat smoother.
OH(A) states are produced with a broad range of rotational quan-
tum numbers, which results in a small bump in the rotational dis-
tribution that is perceptible in the range N = 10 − 27. We note
that a significant fraction of the OH(A) products are dissociative
and therefore not visible in Fig. 8-b. Photodissociation through
the H2O Ã state, that represents 46% of the total photodissocia-
tion rate, yields to a prominent peak at low-N numbers."
"A UV radiation field with a blackbody shape at T = 10000 K
has the steepest UV slope. Most of H2O photodissociation pro-
ceeds through the Ã state (82%). The resulting distribution of
nascent OH is then dominated by low-N numbers whereas the
bump at N ' 40 is reduced accordingly (Fig. 8-c)."
"In other words, the state distribution of OH following H2O
photodissociation by a broad UV spectrum exhibits a bump at
high-N number and a peak at low-N number. The amount of
OH produced with high-N numbers is globally proportional to
the fraction of photodissociation occurring through the B̃ state
(λ < 143 nm)."

3.2.2. Mid-IR lines
"As shown in the case of H2O photodissociation by a Lyα radia-
tion field, mid-IR lines are proportional to Φ. The same conclu-
sion applies for any UV radiation field and we show in Fig. 9
the mid-IR spectrum emitted by OH for the UV radiation fields
explored in this work, for the same value of Φ."
"The mid-IR line intensities depend markedly on the shape of
the radiation field. The main difference resides in the absolute
line intensity between 10 and ∼ 20 µm. For example, line inten-
sities are ∼ 5 times weaker for a blackbody at 104 K than for a T
Tauri radiation field. As seen in the case of a Lyα radiation field,
mid-IR lines are fueled by the radiative decay of OH produced
in high-N states. The absolute mid-IR line intensities are then
proportional to the fraction of OH produced in a rotationally ex-
cited state, which is also proportional to the column density of
H2O photodissociated through B̃ state ([cm−2 s−1]) as defined by"

do not depend on other parameters such as TIR or nH."

In other words, the absolute intensity of mid-IR lines traces
the amount of H2O photodissociated through the B̃ state (λ <
143 nm). It follows that the absolute intensity is, to a first approx-
imation, only proportional to ΦB̃, regardless of the exact shape
of the UV radiation field."
"The other difference resides in the relative intensity of the
lines, that reveals the precise shape of the rotational distribution
of nascent OH fragments. This is best seen in Fig. 10. The in-
crease in the line intensities from Nup = 46 down to Nup ∼ 35
is steeper for T Tauri and Lyα radiation fields than for the other
two. These differences are due differences in the exact shape of
the rotational distributions of the OH(X) fragments shown in Fig.
8. In the case of T Tauri and Lyα radiation fields, the peak at
high-N is more pronounced than for the broadband UV spectra.
The differences in the rotational distributions at lower N, that are
mostly due to differences in the OH(A) distributions, result in mi-
nor differences in the line intensities in the range Nup = 25− 15."
3.2.3. Low and intermediate-N lines
"Regarding far-IR lines and cross-ladder mid-IR lines, that
emerge from N . 6 levels, we find that the integrated intensities
depend neither on the shape of the UV radiation field nor on Φ.

markers correspond to lines belonging to the Ω = 1/2 and Ω = 3/2
ladders, respectively. Λ-doublets are indiscernible in this plot. In this
regime, rotational levels are only populated by the radiative cascade
of OH photofragments and IB̃N,Ω,� , depends only on the shape of the
adopted radiation field."
"This is a surprising result since UV radiation fields with a signif-
icant flux longward of 143 nm, produce OH with low rotational
quantum numbers. Our finding indicates that the contribution of
this rotationally cold population of nascent OH to the excitation
of low-N levels within 3 = 0 is negligible compared to infrared
pumping or collisions. The only population of nascent OH that
affects the intensity of the rotational lines are the one produced
with a high rotational number, typically N & 15. However, we
note that for much lower IR radiation fields and lower densities,
these lines might be fueled by prompt emission (see Fig. 7-c,
regime ¬). In that case, we expect to have a competition pattern
between excitation via the H2O Ã state and the B̃ state."
"As studied in the case of photodissociation by a Lyα radia-
tion field, intermediate-N lines can be excited either by prompt
emission or IR radiative pumping and/or collisions. For a given
set of physical parameters {TIR, TK, nH}, the transition between
prompt emission and the other excitation processes is controlled
by the chemical pumping rate D ≡ Φ/N(OH) as summarized
in Fig. 7-c. The analysis proposed in Sec. 3.1.3 can be general-
ized to any UV radiation field by simply substituting D by DB̃
as defined by"
"= Φ
B̃/N(OH). (19)"
"We note that for the explored UV radiation fields, this adaptation
has little impact on the transition between prompt emission and
the other excitation processes."
4. Discussion and application to HH 211
"In this section, we present a method for observationally inferring
the photodissociation rate of H2O and deducing the local UV
radiation field. As an illustration, our model is applied to the
Spitzer-IRS observations of the apex of the HH 211 bow-shock
published by Tappe et al. (2008)."
4.1. Diagnostics
4.1.1. Column density of H2O photodissociated per second
"Our results show that the absolute intensities of the intra-ladder
lines in the mid-IR are proportional to the column density of
H2O photodissociated per second via the B̃ state, denoted as ΦB̃
(see Fig. 10). To our knowledge, the only alternative process that
can also excite the rotational levels of energy Eup ≥ 20000 K is
the electron impact dissociation of H2O (Beenakker et al. 1974;
Bodewits et al. 2019). In some situations, such as disks around
young stellar objects where there might be a source of energetic
electrons (& 10 eV), the high-N OH lines would thus trace the
destruction of H2O via both e-impact and UV photodissocia-
tion. Complementary diagnostics, such as lines emerging from
the triplet electronic states of H2 or CO that can be excited effi-
ciently by electron impact but not by UV absorption, can help to
determine if OH lines might also trace the electron impact dis-
sociation of H2O. In this context, the predictions presented in
this work remain valid as long as the destruction rate of H2O by
UV photodissociation dominates over destruction by e-impact, a
condition that is generally satisfied in irradiated regions."
"Consequently, the mid-IR lines of OH(X)(3 = 0) provide a
robust measurement of the column density of H2O photodisso-
ciated in the range 114 to 143 nm. This key quantity can be ob-
servationally derived using the relation"
"=
IN,Ω,�"
"hνIB̃N,Ω,�
, (20)"
"with IB̃N,Ω,� provided in Fig. 10 and in Appendix D. As shown
above, IB̃N,Ω,� depends little on the spectral shape of the UV radi-
ation field, and, in the absence of any other information, ΦB̃ can
still be derived with a high accuracy (∼ 10%). Interestingly, the
time scale associated with the radiative cascade is about 10 ms,
which is short compared with relevant dynamical time scales.
Therefore, the value of ΦB̃ should be considered as an instanta-
neous measurement of the photodissociation activity. If the emit-
ting region is unresolved, the derived value of ΦB̃ depends on the
assumed source size as for any determination of a column den-
sity. Strictly speaking, the total flux integrated over a region on
the sky gives the total number of H2O molecules photodissoci-
ated per second in that region."
4.1.2. Spectral shape of the UV radiation field
"The small deviations in the relative line intensities could be used
to constrain the spectral shape of the radiation field (see Fig. 9
and 10). In particular, our results show that a Lyα dominated ra-
diation field produces a steeper increase in the photon line inten-
sities with decreasing Nup. However, detecting these small dif-
ferences in the intensities in the range 9 to 11 µm requires an ac-
curate relative flux calibration. In fact, the 10 µm silicate feature
plays a significant role in the dereddening of the fluxes at visual
extinctions AV & 10. In that perspective, the relative intensity
of the lines between ' 9 and 10 µm in regions with high ex-
tinction should be interpreted with caution since the exact shape
of the extinction curve varies significantly with Av (Chapman
et al. 2009; McClure 2009; Hensley & Draine 2020). We posit
that a significant extinction in the mid-IR hampers the diagnos-
tic capabilities of the OH lines to securely constrain the shape of
the local UV radiation field. The impact of the rotational excita-
tion of the parent H2O may also complicate the interpretation of"

A&A proofs: manuscript no. tabone_MvH_EvD_JB
"the relative line intensities and detailed quantum calculations are
needed to propose robust diagnostics based on the exact shape
of the OH mid-IR spectrum."
4.1.3. Photodissociation rate of H2O
"Our work shows that the detection of mid-IR lines of OH is
prime evidence for the presence of H2O, in particular in envi-
ronments where the H2O column density is limited by strong
UV fields. If an independent measurement of the local UV radi-
ation field can be observationally obtained, the column density
of H2O that it exposed to the UV field can be deduced as"
"N(H2O) =
ΦB̃"
"kB̃
, (21)"
"where kB̃ is the photodissociation rate in s
−1 associated with H2O"
"→ OH + H through the H2O B̃ state.
Conversely, the OH emission can be used to measure the"
"photodissociation rate kB̃ by measuring the column density of
water N(H2O):"
"kB̃ =
ΦB̃"
"N(H2O)
, (22)"
"where ΦB̃ is measured from the mid-IR lines of OH (see Eq.
(20)). This quantity being a ratio between a column density and
ΦB̃, it does not depend on the assumed source size."
"The measurement of N(H2O) is challenging and may be the
major source of uncertainty in the determination of kB̃. Besides
the uncertainties that plague the determination of the column
densities, the variation of the UV field and of the number density
of H2O along the line of sight may be an important bias. Indeed,
irradiated environments exhibit a layered structure with physical

of the radiation field or shocks. Because the OH mid-IR lines are

field, our predictions can be directly extended to any physical

"with nH2O(z) the local number density of H2O and kB̃(z) the local
photodissociation rate of H2O through the B̃ state. ΦB̃ being a
quantity integrated along the line of sight, a spatial variation of
the UV radiation field and of nH2O(z) does not affect its measure-
ment. On the contrary, kB̃ is a local quantity and Eq. (22) should
be applied with caution. Considerations on the geometry and on
the viewing angle of the source may also help."
4.1.4. Local UV field
"Our model shows that the OH mid-IR lines trace the photodis-
sociation of H2O by photons in the range 114 − 143 nm. As
such, mid-IR OH lines carry information on the local UV ra-
diation field in this range. In the following, we note F B̃UV , the
photon flux integrated between 114 and 143 nm, which is F B̃UV =
6 × 107 cm−2 s−1 for a Draine radiation field. The photodissoci-
ation rate kB̃ is the integral over the wavelength of the local UV
radiation field multiplied by the photodissociation cross section:"

"Strictly speaking, the conversion between kB̃ and the local UV
flux F B̃UV should then rely on the knowledge of the shape of the
UV radiation field. However, for the considered radiation fields,
the intensity weighted cross section averaged between 114 and
143 nm varies only by a factor of ∼ 3 and is about σ ' 6 ×

with a typical uncertainly of about a factor of three.
4.2. Application to HH 211
"The Spitzer-IRS observations of the apex of the young proto-
stellar jet HH 211 provide one of the best examples of highly
rotationally excited OH. Figure 11 shows the unique sequence
of superthermal OH emission lines unveiled from 10 µm down
to 30 µm coming from rotational levels between N = 34 to
N = 9. The association between OH mid-IR emission and ongo-
ing H2O photodissociation is further supported by the detection
of a compact Hα emission by Walawender et al. (2006), tracing
a strong UV emitting shock in the close vicinity of the OH emis-
sion. Complementary observations of H2 rovibrational emission
(2.12 µm, Hirano et al. 2006) and in the sub-millimeter domain
unveiled a complex structure of multiple molecular bow-shocks
encompassing the strong shock (Tappe et al. 2012)."
4.2.1. Diagnostics from N > 20 lines
"From the Spitzer-IRS spectrum published by Tappe et al. (2008),
we measure a flux of the OH line at 14.6 µm of F = 3.5 × 10−15
erg s−1 cm−2 in an aperture of Ω = 1.9 × 10−9 sr. This line
emerges from the N = 20 level of the OH(X)(3 = 0) state
and corresponds to an intensity integrated over solid angle of
I = 2.3 × 10−5 erg s−1 cm−2 (see Eq. (12)). Figure 10 indicates
that the conversion factor for each component of the quadruplet
is ∼ 0.2, regardless the spectral shape of the radiation field. At
Spitzer-IRS spectral resolution (R ' 600 for the short–high mod-
ule), the Λ-doublet and the fine-structure is however not spec-
trally resolved. Equation (20) then yields a column density of
H2O photodissociated per unit time of"
"4 × 0.2hν
= 2.1 × 108 cm−2 s−1, (26)"
"where the factor 4 stands for the sum over the four components
of quadruplet, and ν is the frequency of the line. This corre-
sponds to a total number of H2O molecule photodissociated per
second of 4 × 1041 molecule s−1."
"Figure 11 (top panel) compares a synthetic spectrum of OH
produced by a Lyα radiation field with the Spitzer-IRS spectrum
between 10 and 16 µm. We recall that in this wavelength range,
the spectrum depends only on ΦB̃ and not on nH, TK or TIR. Our
model reproduces well the sequence of the lines coming from
N = 31 down to N = 14."
"The higher three lines lying in the range 10-10.5 µm are over-
estimated by the model. The extinction correction (Av = 10 mag,
Walawender et al. 2006) cannot explain this discrepancy since
the extinction curve used by Tappe et al. (2008) tends to overesti-
mate the extinction at 10 µm. An ISRF UV radiation field, which
produces relatively weaker line fluxes shortward of 11 µm does
not significantly improve the fit. Alternatively, we posit that the
rotational state of the parent H2O could modify the rotational
distribution above N ' 30. JWST observations with a higher"

"emission in slower shocks passively illuminated by the stronger
dissociative shock is also possible (see models of Melnick &
Kaufman 2015; Godard et al. 2019). Spatially resolved obser-
vations with JWST-MIRI of both OH mid-IR lines and atomic
lines that trace fast dissociative shocks such as [NeII] at 12.8µm
or [Ni II] at 6.6µm (Hollenbach & McKee 1989) are required to
distinguish the two possible scenarios."
4.2.2. Evidence of additional chemical pumping routes
"Figure 11-b shows that the OH lines coming from lower N lev-
els are detected with the Spitzer-IRS long-high module. In par-
ticular, the cross-ladder transition at 28.9 µm is well reproduced
by our GROSBETA model with a column density of N(OH) =
2 × 1013cm−2, assuming a density of nH= 5 × 107cm−3 and a
temperature of TK= 1300 K derived from the H2O lines. This
model is illustrative since the emission of the OH cross-ladder
line might originates from a different layer of gas but its suggests
a N(OH)/N(H2O) ratio of about ' 0.9. This value lies in the up-
per part of the range 10−3 to 0.8 typically derived toward proto-
stellar outflows, and is higher than those derived toward warm
inner envelopes (Wampfler et al. 2011; Goicoechea et al. 2012,
2015). Interestingly, our derived ratio of ' 0.9 is closer to that
estimated in low AV regions of the Orion Bar (& 1, Goicoechea
et al. 2011). This further supports the driving role of UV pho-
todissociation in preventing the full conversion of OH into H2O
and in maintaining a relatively high N(OH)/N(H2O) ratio un-"
"Article number, page 15 of 22"

"der warm conditions. Interestingly, detailed models of molecu-
lar shocks do predict that both, fast dissociative shocks and pas-
sively irradiated slow shocks exhibit high N(OH)/N(H2O) ratios
(Neufeld & Dalgarno 1989; Godard et al. 2019; Lehmann et al.
2020)."
"For this set of GROSBETA parameters, the intra-ladder rota-
tional lines longward of λ = 18 µm are underestimated by our
GROSBETA model by up to a factor of eight. As shown in Sec.
3.1.3, these intermediate-N lines (9 < N < 15) are excited either
by prompt emission, or by IR radiative pumping or collisions. In
HH 211, the IR background detected by Spitzer-IRS is too weak
to have a significant impact on the excitation of these levels. In
fact, for the selected set of parameters, the excitation is domi-
nated by prompt emission (right part of the schematic diagram,
Fig. 7-c). One could invoke collisional excitation to take over
from prompt emission and increase the intensities of the intra-
ladder transitions. This can be achieved by either decreasing the
chemical pumping rate D or by increasing nH and/or TK (i.e.,
increasing Dcrit, see Fig. 7-c). Because Φ = DN(OH) is con-
strained by the lines in the range 10 to 16 µm, the intensity
of the chemical pumping rate D can only be decreased by in-
creasing N(OH). However, increasing N(OH), nH or TK would
increase the intensities of the cross-ladder transitions, which are
already well reproduced by our model. In other words, collisions
or IR radiative pumping cannot reconcile our models with obser-
vations."
"Interestingly, in this wavelength range, Λ doublets are spec-
trally resolved and show an asymmetry between A′ and A′′ Λ-
doublet states of about a factor of 1.5-2. As discussed by Carr &
Najita (2014), this further supports the minimal impact of colli-
sional (de)excitation since collisions might eliminate asymmetry
in the population. This suggests that the intermediate-N transi-
tions reveal another excitation process that is not included in our
model."
"The reaction H2+O can produce OH in rotationally and
vibrationally excited states and supplement the excitation of
intermediate-N levels. In particular, experimental data show that
the reaction"
"H2 + O(
1D)→ OH + H (28)"
"produces OH with rotational number between N = 10 and 25
with a large fraction produced in 3 ≥ 1 and a propensity to
the A′ states (Liu et al. 2000). Interestingly, the discrepancy be-
tween our predictions and the Spitzer-IRS spectra increases from
N ∼ 16 down to N ∼ 9. The case of chemical excitation by
reaction (28) can be treated in a similar way as we described
the excitation of OH following H2O photodissociation (see Sec.
3.1.1). In the case of H2O photodissociation, the line intensities
are given by the column density of OH formed by H2O photodis-
sociation. Similarly, reaction (28) will increase the line intensi-
ties in proportion to the number of OH produced per second via
this reaction. The discrepancy between the model and the ob-
servations suggests that the formation rate of OH via Eq. (28)
is about 6 times larger than that via H2O photodissociation. In-
terestingly, at the density derived by our non-LTE analysis of
H2O lines, O(1D) would be converted into OH instead of de-
caying via the radiative transition at λ =6300 Å. However, this
scenario requires an efficient production of O(1D), either by OH
or H2O photodissociation, or by collisional excitation. Still, the
estimated column density ratio OH/H2O appears to be too low
for OH photodissociation to take over from H2O photodissocia-
tion in the excitation of OH mid-IR lines. Moreover, at Lyα, only
∼ 10% of the water photodissociation ends in O(1D) (Slanger &
Black 1982; van Harrevelt & van Hemert 2008), a fraction that"

ternatively, the reaction between O(3P) and vibrationally excited
H2, known to be present at the tip of the bow-shock, could lead to
OH in rotationally (and vibrationally) excited states (Gorti et al.
2011; Carr & Najita 2014). These additional chemical pumping
routes could also impact the excitation of even lower-N lines.
Further modeling combining OH excitation and chemistry is re-
quired to clarify the excitation of the intermediate-N lines."
4.3. Perspectives with JWST-MIRI
"JWST-MIRI will provide a unique view in the mid-IR regime by
combining spectroscopic and imaging capabilities (Rieke et al.
2015; Wright et al. 2015). At the observed wavelength range
(5 − 28 µm), JWST will be able to detect pure rotational lines
coming from N ≥ 10 and cross-ladder lines coming from N ≥ 5,
allowing for detailed studies of the excitation of OH across the
full rotational ladder. In this section, we focus on the high-N ro-
tational lines."
"Up to now, OH mid-IR lines tracing H2O photodissociation
have been detected toward three protostellar outflows (Tappe
et al. 2012) and a large number of protoplanetary disks (Pontopp-
idan et al. 2010; Salyk et al. 2011; Carr & Najita 2011, 2014). We"

photodissociation"
"predict that the jump in sensitivity will extend the detectability of
high-N lines to other irradiated environments. Since the line in-
tensities depend on the local abundance of H2O and on the local
radiation field, only astrochemical models designed for specific
sources can robustly predict mid-IR line intensities. However,
the detectability of the mid-IR lines as a function of the physi-
cal conditions can be explored with simple chemical arguments.
The line emissivity per hydrogen atom depends on x(H2O)G0,
where x(H2O) is the H2O abundance with respect to the total
density of H atoms and G0 the local UV flux (see Eq. (23)). In
warm and irradiated environments (fast shocks, disk surface lay-
ers, low AV depths of prototypical PDRs), one can assume that
H2O is destroyed by photodissociation and formed in the gas
phase by two-body reactions so that x(H2O) ∝ nH/G0. For cooler
regions, for which H2O vapor is produced by photodesorption or
by gas-phase ion-neutral routes, the scaling is expected to be dif-
ferent. Therefore, at least for warm environments, the emissivity
of the OH lines per total hydrogen is expected to scale with the
density. This may explain why superthermal OH emission has
been detected by Spitzer in dense environments and remains un-
detected is classical photodissociation regions (Goicoechea et al.
2011). We thus posit that high-N lines could be detected by
JWST-MIRI in more diffuse regions. Observation of dense clas-
sical PDRs such as the Orion bar or NGC 2023 should be con-
sidered as primary targets. In even more diffuse environments,
such as translucent clouds, we expect OH mid-IR lines to re-
main undetected where we estimate Φ ' 103 − 104 cm−2 s−1
(Flagey et al. 2013), corresponding to line intensities as low as
∼ 10−12 − 10−11 erg s−1 cm−2 sr−1."
"The sensitivity of JWST will also allow us to probe the mid-
IR emission in deeply embedded protostars. At high extinction
(AV & 20), the OH lines in the range 13-15 µm will be par-
ticularly suited to minimize the IR extinction. The OH mid-IR
emission can then constitute a unique tool to unravel the poorly
known physical and chemical structure of young protostellar
disks. Regarding protostellar jets and outflows, it will allow us to
test if the low water abundance derived from Herschel observa-
tions is due to UV photodissociation or other physical processes
(Karska et al. 2014)."
"The spatial resolution provided by mapping capabilities will
also be crucial to constrain the emitting region of OH and map
the photodissociation of H2O. For dense environments, maps of
N(H2O) can be built from pure rotational lines of H2O lying typ-
ically longward of 20 µm (Eup . 1200 K) or ro-vibrational lines
and used to construct maps of the local UV radiation field (see
Eq. (25))."
"The Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-MRS), with
its relatively high spectral resolution (R ∼ 2000 − 3000) will
provide a valuable astrophysical view of H2O photodissocia-
tion that will challenge current quantum calculations. Figure 12
shows a synthetic spectrum at MIRI-MRS spectral resolution.
First, MIRI-MRS will give access to the OH lines in the range
9-10 µm that are directly populated by H2O photodissociation
(35 < Nup < 46, see also Fig. 8). The Λ-doublets up to Nup = 40
and the fine-structure up to Nup = 29 will be spectrally resolved.
This information will help to further constrain the shape of the
UV radiation field and understand the impact of the rotational
state of the parent H2O. New quantum calculations, including the
rotational state of H2O, and the fine-structure and the Λ-doubling
of the OH product, are warranted."
5. Conclusion
"In this work, we explore the potential of the OH(X)(3 = 0,N)
mid-IR emission to probe H2O photodissociation. To reach this
goal, results from quantum mechanical calculations resolving
the electronic, vibrational and rotational state of the OH product
following H2O photodissociation at different UV wavelengths
are collected. The distribution of the OH photofragments is then
calculated for UV fields of various spectral shapes and included
in a new radiative transfer code called GROSBETA. The impact of
prompt emission (i.e., formation of OH in excited states follow-
ing H2O photodissociation), collisional excitation and radiative
pumping is extensively studied."
The main conclusions of this study are:
"1. The mid-IR emission of OH in the range 9-16 µm is an unam-
biguous tracer of H2O photodissociation. The mid-IR emis-
sion is the result of the rotational radiative cascade of OH
photofragments within the 3 = 0 state. As such, the detection
of these lines constitutes a prime evidence for the presence
of active H2O chemistry. In particular, the line intensities are
directly proportional to the column density of H2O photodis-
sociated per second by photon in the range 114 − 143 nm,
denoted as ΦB̃. The conversion factors between the line in-
tensities and ΦB̃ is provided for each rotationally excited line
and for UV radiation fields of various shapes in Fig. 10 and
in Appendix D. These conversion factors depend little on the
exact spectral shape of the UV radiation field."
"2. Provided a measurement of the column density of the irradi-
ated water is known, the photodissociation rate by photons
in the range 114−143 nm can be inferred (see Eq. (22)). The
UV flux can then be deduced with good accuracy, regardless
of the shape of the UV radiation field. Alternatively, provided
an estimate of the strength of the local UV radiation field is
available, the column density of H2O can be derived."
"3. The precise state distribution of the OH fragments depends
on the spectral shape of the UV radiation field and results
in small differences in the shape of mid-IR spectrum of OH.
This suggests that the relative line intensities, if accurately
measured, can be used to derive constraints on the spectral
energy distribution of the UV radiation field."
"4. The lower rotational levels, probed either by cross-ladder ro-
tational lines shortward of 30 µm, or by far-IR rotational
lines, are excited by IR radiative pumping or collisions. We
provide criteria to determine if a rotational level of an inter-
mediate energy (typically Eup = 3000 K,N ' 10) is excited
by prompt emission or thermal processes."
"5. As a test case, our model is applied to an irradiated region
located at the tip of the HH 211 protostellar jet. Our simple
single-zone model reproduces the Spitzer-IRS spectrum in
the range 11-16 µm and shows that water is exposed to a UV
photon flux that is about ∼ 5×103 times larger than the stan-
dard UV interstellar radiation field. Discrepancies between
our predictions and the observations at longer wavelength
suggest that additional chemical pumping processes such as
the reaction H2+O might contribute to the excitation of the
rotational levels between N ∼ 10 − 20."
"6. JWST-MIRI will probe the rotational ladder of OH from
N = 5 up to N ' 45 corresponding to energy levels from
800 K up to 45000 K. We posit that the jump in sensitivity
will unveil OH mid-IR emission in new environments such
as classical photodissociation regions (e.g., Orion bar) and
embedded protostars. Moreover, armed with good spectral
resolution (R ∼ 2000 − 3000), the MIRI-MRS observing
mode will give access to even more excited lines in the range"

Appendix A: Distribution of OH fragments
"In this appendix, we present the state distribution of OH follow-
ing H2O photodissociation as a function of the UV wavelength
implemented in our model. The data stem from the quantum cal-
culations published in van Harrevelt & van Hemert (2000) and
van Harrevelt & van Hemert (2001). For the latter, the calcula-
tions have been repeated using an another potential energy sur-
face that gives better agreement with experiments (see Sec. 2.2).
As discussed in Sec. 2.2, we denote as η(λ,Λ, 3,N) the probabil-
ity to form OH in the state OH(Λ)(3,N) following H2O photodis-
sociation by a photon of wavelength λ. Figure A.1 shows the
rotational distributions of OH as function of the photon wave-
length for different electronic and vibrational states. Figure A.2
gives the vibrational distributions for each electronic state. The
distributions shown in Fig. A.1 and A.2 do not account for the
subsequent dissociation of the OH products. For example, the
OH(A) rotational levels with 3 ≥ 2 are dissociative and are thus
discarded in our excitation calculations."
"In this work, the state distribution of the OH fragments fol-
lowing H2O photodissociation by UV radiation fields of dif-
ferent shapes are computed using Eq. (2) and (3). Figure A.3
presents the spectral shape of the radiation fields adopted in

those used by Heays et al. (2017) and are available at https:

diation field named ""Lyα"" is a single Lyα line (λ = 121.567 nm)
with a Doppler broadening parameter of b = 200 km s−1. The
total photodissociation cross section of H2O leading to OH (Fig.
A.3) is collected by Heays et al. (2017) from Fillion et al. (2003,
2004), Mota et al. (2005), and van Harrevelt & van Hemert
(2008)."
Appendix B: Collisional rate coefficients
"The collisional rate coefficients between OH and H2 computed
by Offer et al. (1994) that include levels up to N = 5 have been
extrapolated to higher N numbers assuming that the downward
rates follow"
"kN→N′ = gN′ae
−b∆E/TK , (B.1)"
"where N and N′ designate the rotational quantum number of the
upper and lower levels, ∆E the energy difference between these
levels and gN′ the degeneracy of the lower energy level. The pa-
rameters a and b are the best fit coefficients of available data at
temperature TK . Collisions with the ortho and para states of H2
have been considered separately. In this work, TK ≥ 500 K and
we adopted the rate coefficient computed at a maximum kinetic
temperature of TK = 300 K by Offer et al. (1994) without any
further extrapolation. The relative proportion of ortho and para
populations of H2 is set to 3. We estimate that the extrapolated
rate coefficients are accurate within a factor of ten. Collisional
(de)excitation involving vibrational and electronic states is not
considered here. Collisional excitation by electrons and H can
also be relevant in certain irradiated environments. However, to
our knowledge, the corresponding rate coefficients have not yet
been computed: Thus, we neglected the contribution of electrons
and H to the excitation of OH."

Appendix C: Analytical model for mid-IR lines
"The link between the state distribution of OH fragments fi (Fig.
2 and 8) and the variation of the line intensities with the upper N
number (see Fig. 6 and 9), quantified here by IN , can be clarified
by a simple analytical model of the radiative cascade. Neglecting
collisional (de)exciatation and radiative pumping, and assuming
that the fraction of OH in rotationally excited states constitutes
a negligible fraction of the total population of OH, the statistical
equilibrium equation (see Eq. (7)) for high-N states yields"

relative population Ni/N(OH) depends only on the Einstein-A

"Fig. C.1. Normalized photon intensity of the OH(X2Π)(3 = 0) intra-
ladder mid-IR lines as a function of the rotational number of the upper
energy level. The intensities are computed for the fiducial parameters
given in Table 1 and for three spectral shapes of the UV field (color
coded), and divided by Φ according to Eq. 13. Circle and triangle mark-
ers correspond to lines belonging to the Ω = 1/2 and Ω = 3/2 ladders,
respectively. Λ-doublets are indiscernible in this plot. In this regime,
rotational levels are only populated by the radiative cascade of OH
photofragments. The solid line is the analytical model assuming that
the intra-ladder lines within the 3 = 0 state are produced by the radia-
tive cascade of OH fragments produced in the 3 = 0 state (Eq. (C.6)).
The dotted line is the analytical model that assumes that any OH pro-
duced in a vibrational state instantaneously decays toward the ground
vibrational state with a negligible change of its rotational number (see
Eq. (C.7))."
"the mid-infrared spectrum is independent of Φ, is a characteristic
feature of the radiative cascade."
"The radiative matrix Mi j in Eq. (C.1) can be greatly re-
duced by noting that the radiative decays of the N levels within
the X2Π(3 = 0) state are dominated by pure rotational N →
N − 1 transitions. Moreover, excited electronic states are found
to rapidly decay to the ground electronic state with little change
of their vibrational and rotational quantum number. By neglect-
ing the contribution of vibrationally excited levels to the popu-
lations of OH(3 = 0,N) and assuming that all OH photofrag-
ments produced in the OH(A2Σ+) (3 = 0,N) state decay imme-
diately to the OH(X2Π) (3 = 0,N) state, Eq. (C.1) applied to the

"Thus, according to our analytical model, the normalized inte-
grated photon intensity IN corresponds to ĨN , the probability
to form an OH photofragment in a 3 = 0 state with a rota-
tional number N′ larger than N. In particular, the line intensities
N → N − 1 do not depend on the Einstein-A coefficients. This
equation reflects the fact that any OH produced in an excited ro-
tational level N′ will eventually decay through the N → N − 1
transition with N ≤ N′. Because each rotational state of OH is
split into two spin-orbit substates that are further subdivided into
two Λ-doubling states, ĨN ≤ 1/4, as seen in Figs. 6 and C.1."
"As discussed in Sec. 3.1.1 and further shown in Fig. C.1,
our model underestimates the line intensities computed with
GROSBETA. This indicates that the radiative decay from vibra-
tionaly excited levels contributes to the population of X2Π(N, 3 =
0) levels. In order to take into account the contribution of vi-
brationaly excited levels, we assume that any OH produced
in a vibrationally excited state immediately decays toward the
X2Π(3 = 0) state with no change of the rotational number. This
leads to a normalized integrated photon intensity of"

"This model always overestimates the line intensities (dashed
lines, Figs. 6 and C.1). This is due to the fact that for N & 15,
Einstein-A coefficients of rovibrational transitions are smaller
than those of pure rotational transitions. Thus, an OH fragment
produced in a 3 > 0 state tends to decay through the intra-ladder
transition within its nascent vibrational state before decaying to
the 3 = 0 state with a lower N number than its nascent one. Be-
low N ' 25, the analytical model reproduces well the computed
intensities as all levels produced in higher N numbers in 3 > 0
have decayed toward the 3 = 0 states. The lines emerging from
N < 25 are thus tracing the production of OH in high rotational
states, even though the decay of electronically excited OH in the

Appendix D: Conversion factors
"Table D.1 gives the line intensities of the OH mid-IR lines in the
pure radiative cascade regime normalized by ΦB̃ denoted as IB̃
(see Eq. (18)). The intensity of the Nup → Nup − 1 lines of the
OH(X)(3 = 0) state are summed over the four components of the
quadruplet. IB̃ can be used to convert any line intensity into a
column density of H2O photodissociated per second through the
H2O B̃ state denoted as ΦB̃ using Eq. (20)."
Appendix E: Critical pumping rate
"Figure 7-c summarizes the dominant excitation processes as
a function of the density nH and the chemical pumping rate
D = Φ/N(OH) for a given OH line. The parameter space is
split in two regions: For low values of D, the excitation is dom-
inated thermal and radiative processes whereas for high values
of D the excitation is set by the radiative cascade of the OH
photofragments."

"The boundary between the two regions is defined by Dcrit
(green line Fig. 7-c). Its value depends on the physical condi-
tions of the gas, namely nH, TIR, and TK. For example, Fig. 7-a
shows that Dcrit increases from 2 × 10−9 to 2 × 10−8 s−1 by in-
creasing the density from nH=107 to 109cm−3. We propose here
to derive simple estimates of Dcrit for any rotational level and
any TK and TIR. To do so, we compare the intensity predicted by
a pure radiative cascade (see Eq. (13) and Fig. 6) to that produced
by collisions and/or IR radiative pumping only. In the pure IR ra-
diative pumping regime (regime ­), the line intensity is given by
Eq. (14). This yields to a critical chemical pumping rate above
which prompt emission sets the population of a level N of"

are populated by collisions or IR radiative pumping processes rather
than by prompt emission. Collisions or IR radiative pumping are as-
sumed to populate the levels according to a Boltzmann distribution of a
single temperature Tex. Because Einstein-A coefficients differ between
the two rotational ladders, two Dcrit exist for each N quantum number.
For simplicity, we have assumed IN = 0.25 for all N (see sec. C)."
"where Tex =TIR. This equation can also be directly transposed
to the high density regime for which Tex ' TK (regime ¯). For
intermediate densities, for which both collisions and IR radia-
tive pumping are relevant (regime ®),Dcrit varies smoothly from
Dcrit(TIR) toDcrit(TK) (see Fig. 7-c)."
"Figure E.1 shows Dcrit as a function of the upper N num-
ber of the level and as a function of the excitation temperature.
Dcrit(Tex,N) decreases with N, demonstrating that lines with
higher N are less sensitive to thermal or radiative excitation pro-
cesses and more sensitive to prompt emission. This is mostly due
to the fact that these lines are coming from levels that are much
higher in energy than TK or TIR. For higher temperatures, ther-
mal processes are more efficient at populating higher N levels
resulting in an increase in Dcrit. We also note that the decrease
in Dcrit with N is stiff, showing that for given chemical pump-
ing rate, the transition between lines excited by prompt emission
and lines excited by IR radiative pumping or collisions is well
defined. In particular, we recover the fact that when collision are
negligible and for TIR= 120 K, Dcrit ' 10−9 s−1 for the line
coming from N = 10. In contrast, a chemical pumping rate of at
least 10−4 s−1 is required to excite the line coming from N = 6.
For high-N levels prompt emission dominates for rates as low as
D ' 10−12 s−1. This shows that the schematic view of the pa-
rameter space proposed in Fig. 7-c remains valid for the low-N
lines for which the boundary is shifted to the right, and for high-
N lines, for which the boundary is shifted to the left by orders of
magnitudes."
