ABSTRACT
"Using the near-IR spectroscopy of the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey, we"
investigate the role of local environment in the gas-phase metallicity of galaxies. The local environment
measurements are derived from accurate and uniformly calculated photometric redshifts with well-
"calibrated probability distributions. Based on rest-frame optical emission lines, [NII]λ6584 and Hα,"
"we measure gas-phase oxygen abundance of 167 galaxies at 1.37 ≤ z ≤ 1.7 and 303 galaxies at
2.09 ≤ z ≤ 2.61, located in diverse environments. We find that at z ∼ 1.5, the average metallicity
of galaxies in overdensities with M∗ ∼ 109.8M�, 1010.2M� and 1010.8M� is higher relative to their
field counterparts by 0.094 ± 0.051, 0.068 ± 0.028 and 0.052 ± 0.043 dex, respectively. However, this
metallicity enhancement does not exist at higher redshift, z ∼ 2.3, where, compared to the field galaxies,
we find 0.056 ± 0.043, 0.056 ± 0.028 and 0.096 ± 0.034 dex lower metallicity for galaxies in overdense
environments with M∗ ∼ 109.8M�, 1010.2M� and 1010.7M�, respectively. Our results suggest that, at
1.37 ≤ z ≤ 2.61, the variation of mass-metallicity relation with local environment is small (< 0.1dex),
and reverses at z ∼ 2. Our results support the hypothesis that, at the early stages of cluster formation,
owing to efficient gas cooling, galaxies residing in overdensities host a higher fraction of pristine gas"
"with prominent primordial gas accretion, which lowers their gas-phase metallicity compared to their"
"coeval field galaxies. However, as the Universe evolves to lower redshifts (z . 2), the shock-heated
gas in overdensities cannot cool down efficiently, and galaxies become metal-rich rapidly due to the"
suppression of pristine gas inflow and re-accretion of metal-enriched outflows in overdensities.

1. INTRODUCTION
"Over the last few years, we have made significant"
progress towards developing a comprehensive and self-
consistent model for the formation of galaxies. At each
"step, however, the model is compounded by non-linear"
effects regarding the feedback processes involved and the
parameters deriving them. Gas accretion from the inter-
galactic medium (IGM) supplies cold gas for a galaxy to

build up its stellar population through the gravitational
"collapse of molecular clouds. As the stars form, heavy"
"elements are produced in their hot cores, resulting in"
the chemically enriched material which will be expelled
to the interstellar medium (ISM) through feedback pro-
cesses such as stellar winds (Garnett 2002; Brooks et al.
"2007) and/or supernovae explosions (e.g., Steidel et al."
2010; Martin et al. 2012; Chisholm et al. 2018). Fur-
"thermore, feedback processes can remove part of the en-"
"riched material from galaxies into the IGM (e.g., Heck-"
man et al. 1990; Tremonti et al. 2004; Chisholm et al.
"2018). Thus, gas-phase metallicity is expected to be con-"
nected with most of the galaxy evolutionary processes
"(e.g., gas inflow/outflow and star formation) and can"
be considered as one of the fundamental characteristics
of galaxies that encodes information regarding galaxy
evolution over cosmic time.
A tight correlation has been observed between the gas-
phase metallicity and stellar mass of galaxies (Mass-
"Metallicity Relation, hereafter MZR) out to z ∼ 3.5,
such that galaxies with lower stellar masses have lower"
"metallicities (e.g., Tremonti et al. 2004; Erb et al. 2006;"
Mannucci et al. 2009; Finkelstein et al. 2011; Steidel
"et al. 2014; Sanders et al. 2015, 2020). Moreover, it has"
been found that the MZR evolves with redshift so that
galaxies at a given stellar mass have lower metallicity
"at high redshifts (e.g., Steidel et al. 2014; Maiolino &"
Mannucci 2019; Sanders et al. 2020).
Although a tight correlation has been found between
stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity spanning a wide
"range of stellar masses, other physical properties of"
galaxies could also play a role in contributing to the ob-
"served scatter in this relation. For example, the star for-"
mation rate (SFR) in galaxies controls their metallicity.
"At a given stellar mass, galaxies with lower SFR have"
"higher metallicities (e.g., Mannucci et al. 2010; Sanders"
et al. 2018). Gas accretion from the IGM adds chemi-
"cally poor gas into the ISM of galaxies, which lowers the"
"galaxy’s gas-phase metallicity. On the other hand, cold"
gas infall that provides additional fuel for star formation
"increases the SFR. Therefore, cold gas accretion changes"
the metallicity content of the ISM in a complicated way.
Lilly et al. (2013) introduced a gas regulator model that
expresses the gas-phase metallicity of a galaxy in terms
of the properties of the accreted gas (metallicity and
rate of infalling gas) and SFR. Their model explains
the observationally-confirmed dependence of the MZR
on SFR.
"However, the evolution of the ISM and its metal con-"
"tent does, to a large extent, depend on the properties"
"of the infalling gas which, in turn, is affected by the en-"
vironment where the galaxy resides (Peng & Maiolino
2014; Gupta et al. 2018). Chartab et al. (2020) studied
the environmental dependence of star formation activity
of galaxies in the five widely separated fields of the Cos-
mic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Sur-
vey (CANDELS; Grogin et al. 2011; Koekemoer et al.
"2011) out to z ∼ 3.5. They found that environmental
quenching efficiency evolves with stellar mass such that"
massive galaxies in overdense regions become quenched
more efficiently than their low mass counterparts. This
"suggests that, besides the stellar mass quenching, which"
"is the dominant quenching mechanism at high redshift,"
the environmental quenching is also effective as early as
"z ∼ 3 for massive galaxies (i.e., the quiescent fraction of
galaxies with M∗ ∼ 1011M� are 20% higher (Chartab
et al. 2020) in overdensities than that of field counter-"
"parts at z ∼ 2.8). They also suggest that the growth of
environmental quenching efficiency with stellar mass can"
be explained by the termination of cold gas accretion in
an overdense environment. In the absence of cold gas
"accretion, massive galaxies exhaust their remaining gas"
reservoirs in shorter timescales compared to low mass
"galaxies (see also, Balogh et al. 2016; Kawinwanichakij"
et al. 2017; Fossati et al. 2017; Old et al. 2020). Using
the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their En-
"vironments (EAGLE) simulation, van de Voort et al."
(2017) found a suppression of the cold gas accretion
"rate in dense environments, mostly for satellite galaxies."
Zavala et al. (2019) reported ALMA observation of 68
spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies within two proto-
"clusters at z ∼ 2.2 and found that proto-clusters con-
tain a higher fraction of massive and gas-poor galax-"
ies compared to those residing in the field environment.
They concluded that the environmental quenching exists
"during the early phases of cluster formation (see also,"
Darvish et al. 2016; Nantais et al. 2017; Ji et al. 2018;
Pintos-Castro et al. 2019; Contini et al. 2020; Ando et al.
"2020). However, Lemaux et al. (2020) recently observed"
an enhanced star formation for star-forming galaxies in
"overdensities at z > 2 (see also, Elbaz et al. 2007; Tran"
et al. 2010). All these observations reveal the impor-
tance of the local environment in gas accretion rate and
SFR that govern the gas-phase metallicity of galaxies.
"Moreover, the metallicity of the infalling gas varies in"
"different environments. In the local Universe, it is ob-"
served that the metallicity of IGM gas in cosmic voids
"is < 0.02 Z� (Stocke et al. 2007), while this number is"
"∼ 0.3 Z� for a cluster-like environment (e.g., Mushotzky
& Loewenstein 1997). This is consistent with results"
from the IllustrisTNG simulations (Gupta et al. 2018)
that predict a metal-enhanced infalling gas in a dense
"environment out to z ∼ 1.5. Both pieces of evidence of
lower gas accretion rate and higher metallicity of IGM"
Environmental dependence of the MZR at z = 1.4− 2.6 3
gas in denser environments hint that a part of the scat-
ter on the MZR could be due to the difference in the
environment of galaxies.
The metallicity of galaxies in diverse environments is
extensively studied in the local Universe. Small but sig-
"nificant environmental dependence of the MZR is found,"
"especially for satellite galaxies, such that at a given stel-"
"lar mass, galaxies in overdensities have higher gas-phase"
"metallicities (e.g., Cooper et al. 2008; Ellison et al. 2009;"
Peng & Maiolino 2014; Wu et al. 2017; Schaefer et al.
"2019). Cooper et al. (2008) found that & 15% of the
measured scatter in the MZR is caused by environmen-"
"tal effects. Furthermore, Peng & Maiolino (2014) found"
that galaxies with high metallicities favor denser envi-
"ronments at z ∼ 0. They conclude that higher metallic-
ity of infalling gas in dense environments is responsible"
for the environmental dependence of the MZR.
"Beyond the local Universe (at z & 1), the situation is
unclear. Some studies found evidence of enhanced gas-"
"phase metallicity in low-mass cluster galaxies at z & 1.5
(e.g., Kulas et al. 2013; Shimakawa et al. 2015; Maier"
et al. 2019). Kulas et al. (2013) used Keck/MOSFIRE
observations to compare the gas-phase metallicity of 23
"protocluster members (z ∼ 2.3) with 20 field galax-
ies. They found that the mean metallicity of low mass"
"galaxies (M∗ ∼ 1010M�) in the protocluster is ∼ 0.15
dex higher than that in the field. On the other hand,"
Valentino et al. (2015) reported 0.25 dex lower gas-phase
"metallicity for the members of a z ∼ 2 protocluster
(M∗ ∼ 1010.5M�) compared to field galaxies at the same
redshift. Conversely, some other studies have not ob-"
served significant environmental dependence of the MZR
"at high redshift (e.g., Tran et al. 2015; Kacprzak et al."
2015; Namiki et al. 2019).
With the wealth of near-IR spectroscopy for the star-
"forming galaxies (1.37 ≤ z ≤ 2.61) in the MOSFIRE

"2015), combined with the local environment measure-"
ments (Chartab et al. 2020) derived from accurate and
uniformly calculated photometric redshifts with well-
"calibrated probability distributions, in this paper we in-"
vestigate the effect of the local environment on the gas-
"phase metallicity of galaxies at z ∼ 1.5 and z ∼ 2.3. In
Section 2, we present the details of the MOSDEF sam-"
ple used in this work. We then briefly describe the local
"number density measurements, as a proxy for the envi-"
"ronment, based on the photometric observations of the"
CANDELS fields. We describe sample selection proce-
"dure in Section 3. In Section 4, we investigate the role"
"of the environment in the MZR, followed by the phys-"
ical interpretation of our observations. We discuss our
results in Section 5 and summarize them in Section 6.
"Throughout this work, we assume a flat ΛCDM cos-"

ΩΛ0 = 0.7. All magnitudes are expressed in the AB
"system, and the physical parameters are measured as-"
suming a Chabrier (2003) IMF.
2. DATA
2.1. The MOSDEF survey
MOSDEF is an extensive near-IR spectroscopic survey
conducted over 48.5 nights using the Keck/MOSFIRE
spectrograph (McLean et al. 2012). As a part of the
"survey, ∼ 1500 galaxies in five CANDELS fields (EGS,
COSMOS, GOODS-N, UDS, and GOODS-S) were ob-"
served in three redshift ranges where strong rest-optical
emission lines fall within windows of atmospheric trans-
"mission (400 galaxies at z ∼ 1.5, 750 at z ∼ 2.3, and
400 at z ∼ 3.4). These galaxies are selected from the
3D-HST photometric and spectroscopic catalogs (Skel-"
ton et al. 2014; Momcheva et al. 2016) to a limit-
"ing HST/F160W magnitude of 24.0, 24.5, and 25.0 at"
"z ∼ 1.5, 2.3, and 3.4, respectively. Based on these
magnitude limits, the MOSDEF sample is roughly mass-"
"complete down to M∗ ∼ 109.5M� (Shivaei et al. 2015).
For a full description of the survey strategy, observa-"
"tion and data reduction, we refer readers to Kriek et al."
(2015).
The spectral energy distributions (SED) of MOSDEF
galaxies are fitted using the multiwavelength photomet-
ric data from the 3D-HST survey (Skelton et al. 2014;
"Momcheva et al. 2016). Briefly, the photometric fluxes"
are corrected for contamination caused by strong neb-
ular emission lines measured from the MOSDEF rest-
frame optical spectra. The flexible stellar population
synthesis model of Conroy et al. (2009) is adopted to
build a library of synthetic spectral energy distributions.
Star formation histories are modeled with a delayed ex-
"ponentially declining function (SFR ∝ te−t/τ ), where
t is the age of a galaxy and τ is the star formation"
timescale. Dust attenuation is applied using the Calzetti
et al. (2000) law and solar stellar metallicity is assumed
"for all galaxies. Then, the SED fitting is performed us-"
"ing the FAST code (Kriek et al. 2009), which uses a χ2"
minimization method to find the best-fit stellar popu-
lation model and corresponding properties such as stel-
lar mass and SFR. Corresponding confidence intervals
are computed by perturbing the photometry using the
photometric errors. Redshifts are fixed to their spec-
troscopic values for the SED fitting. The spectroscopic
redshifts and emission line fluxes are measured from the
"extracted 1D spectra, presented in Kriek et al. (2015)."
2.2. Measuring local environment of galaxies
4 Chartab et al.
"To quantify the environment of MOSDEF galaxies, we"
utilize the publicly available catalog of Chartab et al.
(2020) which includes measurements of local density for
"galaxies brighter than HST/F160W ≤ 26 AB mag in all
the five CANDELS fields: GOODS-S (Guo et al. 2013),"
"GOODS-N (Barro et al. 2019), COSMOS (Nayyeri et al."
"2017), EGS (Stefanon et al. 2017), and UDS (Galametz"
et al. 2013).
"As described in Chartab et al. (2020), including both"
the spectroscopic and photometric redshifts for density
measurements can bias the estimates in favor of galax-
"ies with spectroscopic redshifts. Thus, despite the avail-"
"ability of spectroscopic redshifts for ∼ 12% of galaxies
in the CANDELS fields, the environment catalog relies"
on uniformly calculated photometric redshifts (normal-
"ized median absolute deviation σNMAD ∼ 0.02), with
well-calibrated redshift probability distribution func-"
"tions (PDF) (Kodra 2019, D. Kodra et al. in prep)."
The environment catalog has been constructed using the
full photometric redshift PDFs adopting the technique
of boundary-corrected weighted von Mises kernel den-
sity estimation (Chartab et al. 2020). Here we provide
a brief explanation of density measurements.
Taking advantage of the well-calibrated and tested
"photometric redshift PDFs of CANDELS galaxies, the"
"position of galaxies are treated in a probabilistic way,"
such that all the information regarding the position of a
galaxy in redshift space is embedded in its photometric
redshift PDF. The dataset within the CANDELS fields
"is sliced to constant comoving width, ∆χ = 35h−1Mpc"
"(e.g., ∆z = 0.035 at z ∼ 2), which is greater than both
redshift space distortion (Fingers-of-God effect; Jack-"
son 1972) and the photometric redshift PDF resolution
"over the redshift range 0.4 ≤ z ≤ 5. Each galaxy is
distributed over all redshift slices (z-slice) based on its"
"photometric redshift PDF, such that the galaxy has a"
"specific weight in each z-slice. Then, to calculate the lo-"
"cal density in each z-slice, the weighted von Mises kernel"
density estimation is employed. The von Mises kernel is
the spherical analog of the Gaussian kernel where vari-
"ables are angles (e.g., right ascension and declination)"
instead of linear data (Garćıa-Portugués et al. 2013). To
"quantify the environment, density contrast (δ) is defined"
"Σ̄
− 1, (1)"
where Σ is the number density of galaxies at the desired
point and Σ̄ is the average density in the correspond-
ing z-slice. Figure 1 shows an example of the density
"map for one of the z-slices at z ∼ 2.13 in the COSMOS
field. One should note that the probabilistic nature of"

the method allows us to take into account the contribu-
tion of all galaxies (based on their photometric redshift
PDFs) when we create density maps. In Figure 1 we also
include six spectroscopically confirmed overdensities at
"z ∼ 2.1 (Yuan et al. 2014) which were initially discov-
ered from the Magellan/FOURSTAR Galaxy Evolution"
Survey (ZFOURGE) (Spitler et al. 2012). We find that
all six confirmed overdensities in Yuan et al. (2014) are
correctly predicted in the density map. To assign a den-
"sity contrast for each galaxy, the weighted integration"
of the local densities over z-slices has been performed
since a galaxy with a photometric redshift is not local-
ized in redshift space but is distributed over all z-slices
based on its PDF. The densities are also corrected for a
systematic under-estimation near the edge of the survey
footprint using the re-normalization technique.
Environmental dependence of the MZR at z = 1.4− 2.6 5
"In the following section, we cross-match the MOSDEF"
galaxies with the CANDELS photometric catalogs to
find their associated local density measurements. Al-
though we have spectroscopic redshifts for the MOSDEF
"galaxies, we do not pin them in density maps based on"
spectroscopic redshifts to measure their environments.
The density measurements trace the relative position of
galaxies in the survey and are not sensitive to system-
"atic biases that may exist in the photometric redshifts,"
whereas measuring densities based on the photometric
redshifts but defining positions of the MOSDEF galaxies
in density maps by their spectroscopic redshifts leads to
inconsistencies.
3. SAMPLE SELECTION
We select MOSDEF galaxies that have Hα line lumi-
"nosities with S/N ≥ 3. We only include the star-forming
galaxies based on the UVJ rest-frame color selection"
(Muzzin et al. 2013) derived from SED fitting. Objects
that are flagged as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in
the MOSDEF catalog are excluded. The AGNs are iden-
tified based on X-ray emission or IRAC colors. We also
"require that log([NII]/Hα) < −0.3 to exclude optical
AGNs (Coil et al. 2015; Azadi et al. 2017, 2018; Leung"
"et al. 2017, 2019). To have a mass-complete sample, we"
"only consider galaxies with M∗ ≥ 109.5M�. These crite-
ria result in a total of 560 galaxies at 0.78 ≤ z ≤ 2.64.
We then cross-match these objects with the local en-"
vironment catalog of Chartab et al. (2020) within a ra-
dius equal to the FWHM size of HST/F160w band point
"spread function, ∼ 0.2′′. For 23 galaxies, we could not
find a source within the radius of ∼ 0.2′′ in the CAN-
DELS photometry catalogs due to the difference in the"
source identification and photometry extraction between
"the CANDELS and the 3D-HST. Also, 15 galaxies were"
not included in the environment catalog since the cat-
alog is constructed based on specific selection criteria:
"(1) SExtractor’s stellarity parameter < 0.95, (2) requir-"
ing 95% of photometric redshift PDF of the galaxy to
"fall within the redshift range of 0.4 ≤ z ≤ 5, and (3)
brighter than 26 AB mag in HST/F160w band. 14 out"
of 15 missing galaxies in the environment catalog were
incorrectly identified as low-z galaxies or had very broad
photometric redshift PDFs which have not satisfied the
"second criterion, and the other missing galaxy was iden-"
tified as a galaxy with HST/F160w > 26 AB mag in the
CANDELS photometric catalogs that has not satisfied
the third criterion.
Figure 2 shows the comparison between the spec-
troscopic and the CANDELS photometric redshifts of
the sample. The photometric redshift is defined as a
probability-weighted expectation value of the redshift

and CANDELS photometric redshifts of the sample. The
photometric redshift is defined as a probability-weighted ex-
pectation value of the redshift based on the photometric red-
shift PDF. The average uncertainty on photometric redshifts
is displayed in the lower right corner. The normalized me-
dian absolute deviation of the redshift for the sample is 0.03.
Solid blue circles show the final sample used in this work.
The green shaded region corresponds to the lower redshift
bin at z ∼ 1.5, and the pink region shows the highest redshift
bin at z ∼ 2.3. Open circles are either outliers or galaxies
outside the desired redshift ranges."
based on the photometric redshift PDF (Kodra 2019).
We find a value of 0.03 for the normalized median ab-
solute deviation of photometric redshifts. This revali-
"dates the accuracy of photometric redshifts, which re-"
sults in reliable local density measurements. Further-
"more, we removed outlier galaxies with the error > 0.5"
in their photometric redshifts and galaxies out of the
desired redshift range (shown with open circles in Fig-
ure 2). The final sample is divided into two redshift
"bins, 167 galaxies at 1.37 ≤ z ≤ 1.70, and 303 galaxies
2.09 ≤ z ≤ 2.61."
To investigate if our sample is representative of the
full dynamic range of the local environment in the CAN-
"DELS data, we compare the local environmental density"
"of CANDELS star-forming galaxies with M∗ ≥ 109.5M�
at the same redshift range with our sample (the MOS-"
DEF galaxies). We use rest-frame UVJ colors computed
in Chartab et al. (2020) to select a star-forming sub-
sample of CANDELS galaxies. Figure 3 shows the his-
togram of density contrast for MOSDEF galaxies and
for all of the star-forming CANDELS galaxies at the
same redshift ranges. We find that MOSDEF galax-
6 Chartab et al.
"ies cover a wide range of environments, making them"
unique for studying the environmental dependence of
spectroscopic properties of galaxies. There is slight evi-
dence that MOSDEF galaxies reside in relatively denser
environments than the CANDELS star-forming sample
which is expected for most spectroscopic surveys as they
usually maximize the number of sources per mask. How-
"ever, this effect is minimal in MOSDEF since it is an"
"extensive program that covers ∼ 600 arcmin2 at z ∼ 2.3
and ∼ 300 arcmin2 at z ∼ 1.5 (Kriek et al. 2015). Given
the total area of the CANDELS fields (∼ 960 arcmin2),
MOSDEF covers ∼ 30% and ∼ 60% of the CANDELS
area at z ∼ 1.5 and z ∼ 2.3, respectively. This wide
areal coverage translates to diverse environments in our"
"sample, as shown in Figure 3."
We divide the sample into three bins of environment.
Although we find that the local environment distribu-
tion of our sample is well representative of the full CAN-
"DELS galaxies, we do not set the environment binning"
"thresholds based on our sample. Instead, we calculate"
them from all the star-forming CANDELS galaxies at
desired redshift ranges. We find the tertiles which di-
vide the CANDELS sample into three bins of environ-
"ments, each containing a third of the sample. We con-"
"sider galaxies in the lowest tertile (δ < δ 1
3
) as field galax-"
"ies and those within the second tertile (δ 1
3
≤ δ < δ 2"
"3
) as"
"intermediate-densities and the highest tertile (δ ≥ δ 2
3
) as"
overdensities. Table 1 shows the density contrast thresh-
"olds to define the field, intermediate and overdense sam-"
ples along with the sample size and the average density
"contrast, 〈1 + δ〉 at each redshift bin. Our sample in-
cludes ∼ 55 and ∼ 100 galaxies in each bin of the envi-
ronment at z ∼ 1.5 and z ∼ 2.3, respectively (see Table
1)."
Fossati et al. (2015) linked observational local number
density of galaxies to their parent halo masses using a
"stellar mass-limited sample of galaxies (M∗ > 10

halos of these present-day rich cluster progenitors at

Mpc (Chiang et al. 2017), which can be observed within"
"the CANDELS fields. Thus, our last environment bin,"
"so-called overdensity, traces these massive cores of pro-"
toclusters at high redshift which will grow into z = 0
"clusters. However, all the dark matter and baryons that"
will assemble into a z = 0 cluster may be very extended

which can not be captured in small CANDELS fields."

4. RESULTS
4.1. The MZR in diverse environments
Here we use Hα and [NII]λ6584 lines to estimate oxy-
gen abundances of galaxies as an indicator for their gas-
"phase metallicities. However, the [NII]λ6584 emission"
"line is not detected with S/N ≥ 3 for 48 out of 167
and 118 out of 303 galaxies at z ∼ 1.5 and z ∼ 2.3,
respectively. As we discuss later in Appendix A, re-"
quiring [NII]λ6584-detection biases our sample toward
"higher gas-phase metallicities. Therefore, to include"
[NII]λ6584 non-detected galaxies in metallicity measure-
"ments, we create composite spectra by stacking the spec-"
tra of galaxies in bins of stellar mass and environment.
"Following Shivaei et al. (2018), we shift individual"
spectra to the rest frame and then normalize them by
the Hα luminosity. Composite spectra are computed by
averaging the normalized spectra in bins of 0.5 Å consid-
ering the weights of 1/σ2i where σ is the standard devia-
tion of the ith spectra. The uncertainty in the weighted
"average is also obtained using (
∑"
"1

)−"
The resultant composite spectra are normalized to
"the Hα luminosity. Therefore, the average flux ratio"
"of 〈 [NII]λ6584

"〉 is determined by fitting a triple Gaussian
function for [NII]λ6548, 6584 and Hα lines and extract-"

normalized [NII]λ6584 line. We perturb the composite
spectra using their error distributions and estimate the
"average flux ratio for 500 trials. Also, galaxies in each"
bin of stellar mass and environment are bootstrap re-
sampled in each trial to account for sample variance.
The average and standard deviation of 500 trials are
adopted as the flux ratio and its uncertainty.
We determine oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H)) for
the composite spectra using Pettini & Pagel (2004) cal-
"ibration of the N2 =
[NII]λ6584"
"Hα
line ratio,"
12 + log(O/H) = 8.9 + 0.57 log(N2) (2)
The intrinsic uncertainty (1σ dispersion) of the oxy-
gen abundance of an individual galaxy in the calibra-
tion is 0.18. A composite spectrum consists of N galax-
"ies; thus, the intrinsic error in the oxygen abundance of"
"the composite spectrum is 0.18/
√
N (Erb et al. 2006;"
Sanders et al. 2015). To include the N2 calibration er-
"ror in measurements, one can calculate the total vari-"
ance of metallicity by adding the intrinsic variance to
the weighted average variance from the stacks. We do
not include calibration error when reporting the uncer-
"tainty in metallicities. Moreover, the N2 estimator is"
calibrated locally and there is some debate within the
literature regarding the validity of the calibration for
high-redshift galaxies (Kewley et al. 2013; Steidel et al.
"2014; Shapley et al. 2019; Sanders et al. 2020). However,"
"it does not cause a problem for our work, where we study"
the relative metallicities to understand the effect of the
local environment on the metal content of galaxies.
We further separate our sample in different environ-
ments into three bins of stellar mass such that each bin
includes approximately an equal number of galaxies. We
then calculate composite line luminosities for these nine
bins of environments and stellar masses and calculate
composite metallicities. To determine the average MZR
"for each environment (field, intermediate-density, and"
"overdense), we fit a linear function to the composite"
"metallicities and average stellar masses,"
"12 + log(O/H) = β + α log(
M∗

"), (3)"
where α and β are the slope and intercept of the linear
"function, respectively. The best-fit parameters and er-"
"rors are given in Table 2. To estimate errors, we perturb"
metallicities according to their uncertainties and repeat
the fitting process 500 times. We also include best-fit
parameters from Sanders et al. (2018) for the MOSDEF
"galaxies at z ∼ 2.3. Their sample is the same as ours ex-
cept that they have one more constraint on the detection"
(S/N > 3) of the Hβ emission line.

surements for the composite spectra are shown with

compared to the field galaxies, while the trend reverses"

11M� which reside in overdensities have en-
"hanced metallicities by ∼ 0.07 dex compared to their

"MZR, this enhancement is less significant, mostly due to"
a higher fraction of [NII]λ6584 non-detection galaxies in
"the low mass end. At z ∼ 2.3, the average galaxies with
109.5M� . M∗ . 10"
11M� in the dense environment are
"∼ 0.11 dex metal deficient relative to the field galaxies
at the same stellar mass range."
"A notable caveat for studies with a small sample size,"
which is the case for most of the high-redshift spectro-
"scopic samples, is dissimilar stellar mass distributions"
among the galaxies in different environments. It is cru-
cial to have the same stellar mass distributions in dif-
ferent environments to properly study the effect of the
environment on the gas-phase metallicity of galaxies at
a given stellar mass. As we bin the data to find the aver-
"age MZR in diverse environments, different stellar mass"
distributions can result in different average metallicities.
This difference can be misinterpreted as an environmen-
"tal imprint on the MZR. Therefore, before proceeding"
"to a discussion of our results, in the next section, we"
first perform an analysis on a mass-controlled sample of
galaxies where we carefully match the stellar mass dis-
tribution of galaxies in different environments and find
the composite spectra for the mass-controlled sample.
This allows us to properly disentangle the effect of stellar
"mass from the local environment, providing an unbiased"
measurement of environmental trend.
4.2. Mass-controlled sample
The stellar mass distribution of our sample is shown in
"Figure 5. As expected, galaxies in diverse environments"
have different stellar mass distributions. We find that
overdensities tend to have a higher fraction of massive
"galaxies compared to underdense regions. For instance,"
"the median stellar mass of our field sample at z ∼ 1.5
is 109.9M�, while this value for the overdense sample"
"is 1010.25M�. In the highest redshift bin, z ∼ 2.3, the
median stellar masses are 109.93M� and 10"
10.17M� for
"field and overdense galaxies, respectively. It is, there-"
"fore, important to match the stellar mass distribution of"
galaxies in different environments to properly disentan-
gle the effect of the local environment on the gas-phase
metallicity from the stellar mass. As shown in Figure

shows the type of environment and y shows the stellar mass range (”l”: low, ”m”: intermediate and ”h”: high). For example,
Nlh = 7 at z ∼ 1.5 means that each sub-sampled data consists of 7 massive field galaxies at that redshift."
"5, we match the stellar mass distribution of galaxies"
in three environment bins by sub-sampling the galax-
ies such that each environment has the same number
of galaxies at a given stellar mass. We adopt a res-
olution of log(M∗/M�) = 0.1 dex when matching the
"stellar mass distributions. In other words, we draw a"
fraction of galaxies in different environments such that
they have the same stellar mass distributions with 0.1
dex resolution. As there are not unique mass-matched
"sub-samples in different environments, we repeat sub-"
"sampling 500 times. For each trial, we measure the"
composite spectra in the bins of environment and stel-
lar mass using the same procedure described in Section
"4.1. The stellar mass bins of 9.5 ≤ log(M∗/M�) < 10,
10 ≤ log(M∗/M�) < 10.5, and log(M∗/M�) ≥ 10.5 are
adopted. We perturb the resultant composite spectra of"
"each trial according to their uncertainties. Ultimately,"
we construct the final mass-controlled composite spectra
"and their errors, using the average and standard devia-"
"tion of the 500 measurements, respectively."
We do not take into account stellar mass uncertainties
when matching the stellar mass distribution of galax-
"ies in different environments, since the median uncer-"
"tainty of stellar masses in our sample is ∼ 0.05 dex,
which is smaller than the desired resolution in the mass-"
"controlled sample, 0.1 dex."
4.2.1. Metallicity of mass-controlled sample
The composite spectra for the nine bins of stellar
masses and environments for the mass-controlled sam-
"ple are shown in Figure 6. The
[NII]λ6584"
"Hα
estimates"
and gas-phase metallicity (oxygen abundance) for mass-
controlled composite spectra in the nine bins of stellar
masses and environments are presented in Table 3. We
follow the same procedure as described in Section 4.1
to measure the metallicity of galaxies in the bins of en-
vironment and stellar mass from the composite spectra
using the N2 indicator.
We also measure the average stellar masses and SFRs
of the mass-matched samples in stellar mass and envi-
ronment bins. We use SFRs derived from SED fitting
since the dust-corrected Hα luminosity is not available
for 40% of our sample. We avoid imposing a constraint
on the detection of the Hβ emission line needed for dust
"correction, as it decreases our sample size significantly.
The variation of metallicity at fixed M∗ in different en-"
vironments is small (< 0.1 dex) and thus requires large
sample sizes to be detected. Previous studies found that
the SED-derived SFRs for MOSDEF galaxies are in gen-
eral agreement with SFRs derived from dust-corrected
Hα luminosities (Shivaei et al. 2016; Reddy et al. 2015).
The average SED-derived SFRs listed in Table 3 sug-
gest that even though there is evidence for a weak envi-
ronmental dependence of the SFRs for our star-forming
"sample at a given stellar mass, it is not significant due"
to large uncertainties in the SFR measurements. Errors
of SFRs listed in Table 3 include uncertainty in the SFR
of individual galaxies as well as sample variance. A de-
tailed study of the environmental imprints on specific
SFRs of MOSDEF galaxies can properly constrain this
relation. Old et al. (2020) have used [OII]-derived SFRs

Observations of Galaxies in Rich Early Environments

no significant difference between the specific SFR of the
cluster and the field sample at z > 1.3.
"The MZR for the mass-controlled sample at z ∼ 1.5
and z ∼ 2.3 are presented in Figure 7. We emphasize
that the stellar mass distributions in the environment"
bins are similar. This allows us to remove the effect
of stellar mass on metallicity to properly investigate the
"environmental effects. Also, although the mass-matched"
sample has fewer number of galaxies than the whole sam-
"ple, we sub-sample the data 500 times to incorporate"
the contribution of the full sample in measurements. As
"shown in Figure 7, we find that at a given stellar mass,"
the metallicity of galaxies changes with their respective
environments at both redshift intervals considered here.

densities is higher than that of field galaxies, with en-"

above.
"In contrast, at z ∼ 2.3, the average metallicity of
galaxies in overdensities is lower than their field coun-"
terparts. Galaxies in the mass-controlled sample that
"reside in overdensities with M∗ ∼ 109.8M�, 1010.2M�
and 1010.7M�, are metal deficient by 0.056 ± 0.043

(insignificant) and 0.085± 0.034 (2.5σ significance) dex
for galaxies located in the intermediate-density with the"
same stellar masses as above.
Analysis of the mass-controlled samples confirms the
trends already observed for the unmatched sample in
"Figure 4; however, the significance of observed trends is"
more reliable when we control the stellar mass distribu-
tion of the sample. Considering all stellar mass ranges
"(109.5M� . M∗ . 10

"galaxies in overdensities are ∼ 0.07 dex rich in metal
compared to their field counterparts. In contrast, at"
"z ∼ 2.3, average galaxies in overdensities have ∼ 0.07
dex lower metallicities compared to the field galaxies."
Before discussing the physical origin of the observed
"trends in detail, we compare our results with previous"
works in the following section.
5. DISCUSSION
5.1. Comparison with previous works
Only a handful of studies have been conducted to in-
vestigate the role of the environment in the MZR at
z > 1. The bottom panels in Figure 7 show the offset
between the average metallicity of galaxies in overden-
sities (protocluster/cluster) and that of field galaxies as
"a function of stellar mass at both redshift bins, z ∼ 1.5
and 2.3. In these figures, we also include the aforemen-"
"tioned offsets from literature. Our finding at z ∼ 1.5 is
in full agreement with the recent work of Maier et al."
"(2019). They studied a massive cluster at z ∼ 1.5 and
found that, at a given stellar mass, the metallicities of"
galaxies in the inner part of the cluster are higher by
"∼ 0.1 dex than those of infalling and field galaxies. They
suggest that strangulation in the dense cores of clusters"
results in a cold gas removal that enhances the metallic-
"ity. However, Namiki et al. (2019) and Tran et al. (2015)"
found no significant environmental dependence of the
"MZR around z ∼ 1.5. Namiki et al. (2019) compared the
MZR of narrow-band Hα-selected cluster members with"
the field MZR of Stott et al. (2013). Tran et al. (2015)
considered the field sample of Zahid et al. (2014) for the
"comparison. Thus, we also utilize the field samples of"
Stott et al. (2013) and Zahid et al. (2014) to measure the
metallicity offset (shown in Figure 7) for the studies of
"Namiki et al. (2019) and Tran et al. (2015), respectively."
In the studies regarding the environmental depen-
"dence of the MZR, the sample selection bias needs to"
be handled properly to ensure that both field and clus-
ter samples are selected in the same way. For exam-
"ple, Stott et al. (2013) found that Hα emitting galaxies"
selected from High-Z Emission Line Survey (HiZELS)
(Sobral et al. 2013) have remarkably higher metallicity
at a given stellar mass compared to a rest-frame UV-
selected sample of Erb et al. (2006). They argued that
the UV-selected sample of Erb et al. (2006) tends to
have a higher average SFR compared to the HiZELS
"narrow-band selected sample, resulting in a bias against"
"metal-rich galaxies. Therefore, the comparison between"
the MZR of two different works can be biased due to the
"selection criteria. However, this is not an issue when"
the sample is selected uniformly in different environ-
"ments, and measurements are performed consistently."
Shimakawa et al. (2015) studied narrow-band selected
galaxies in two rich overdensities at z = 2.2 and 2.5.
They found that the metallicity of protocluster galaxies
"(M∗ < 10
11 M�) is ∼ 0.15 dex higher than that of field"
"galaxies, which contrasts with our result at z ∼ 2.3. Ac-"

cording to Stott et al. (2013) and discussions included
"in Shimakawa et al. (2015), selection bias is a potential"
concern in their study since different criteria are used
for the selection of protocluster (narrow-band selected)
"and field (UV-selected, Erb et al. 2006) galaxies. This"
concern can be addressed in future studies by comparing
the protocluster MZR of Shimakawa et al. (2015) with
a field MZR of a narrow-band selected Hα emitters at
"z ∼ 2.2.
Kacprzak et al. (2015) and Alcorn et al. (2019) studied"
"the MZR of a protocluster (Yuan et al. 2014) at z = 2.1
and reported no significant environmental effect on the"
"MZR. As shown in Figure 1, we also captured this pro-"
tocluster in the present work. We speculate that the
lack of environmental dependence of the MZR in their
studies can originate from considering all the protoclus-
ter members at the same density contrast. As seen in
"Figure 1, the protocluster includes different components"
and considering that all the members are located in an
overdensity weakens any existing environmental depen-
dence of the MZR.
Valentino et al. (2015) found that cluster star-forming
"galaxies (1010M� ≤ M∗ ≤ 1011M�) are ∼ 0.25 dex
poorer in metals than their field counterparts at z ∼ 2.
We find a similar trend at z ∼ 2.3 with a lower average
metal deficiency of ∼ 0.1 dex. Moreover, Sattari et al. in
prep. studied a massive protocluster at z = 2.2 (Darvish"
et al. 2020) and found that protocluster galaxies with
"M∗ ∼ 109.6 M� and M∗ ∼ 1010.2 M� are 0.03 ± 0.06
and 0.10 ± 0.04 dex metal deficient, respectively, com-
pared to field galaxies. Our findings at z ∼ 2.3 are in
agreement with their results."
"In the presence of limited sample size, unbalanced stel-"
lar mass distribution of galaxies between cluster mem-
bers and the field sample can affect the environmental
"trends. In other words, even in each stellar mass bin"
"(e.g., 9.5 ≤ log(M∗/M�) < 10), the stacked spectra are
biased toward massive galaxies, which are usually de-"
"tected with higher S/N. Therefore, one needs to match"
the shape of stellar mass distributions in different en-
"vironments as described in Section 4.2, and having the"
same average/median stellar mass in the bins of the en-
vironment does not guarantee that the effect of stel-
lar mass on gas-phase metallicity is removed properly.
Kulas et al. (2013) have studied the MZR of a proto-
"cluster at z ∼ 2.3 and reported a 0.1 dex metallicity
enhancement with respect to the field galaxies. We do"
not confirm such trends in the present work. Their field
and protocluster samples are selected consistently (UV-
"selected). However, based on Figure 2 of Kulas et al."
"(2013), we speculate that the metallicity enhancement"
seen in their work can be affected by the significantly
different stellar mass distributions of their protocluster
and field samples.

licity are conducted by comparing MZR for a clus-
ter/protocluster and a sample of field galaxies. How-
"ever, within a given cluster/protocluster, galaxies may"
"have different density contrasts. Thus, quantifying the"
environment using local density is a better approach
to study environmental effect rather than considering
all the members of a cluster/protocluster residing in an
"overdensity. For instance, Maier et al. (2019) found that"
"the metallicity enhancement at z ∼ 1.5 is only observed
for the core (inside half of R200) of a cluster, not for"
infalling protocluster members. Assuming that all the
cluster/protocluster members have similar local densi-
ties weakens any underlying environmental dependence
"of the MZR. In the present work, for the first time, we"
study the gas-phase metallicity of galaxies as a function
of their local density and its evolution with cosmic time
beyond the local Universe. Similar works have been con-
ducted by Mouhcine et al. (2007); Cooper et al. (2008);
Peng & Maiolino (2014) with SDSS sample at z ∼ 0.
5.2. How does the environment affect MZR?
"In this work, we find that galaxies in overdense regions"
have lower metallicity than their field counterparts at
"z ∼ 2.3, but they become more metal-rich as they evolve
to z ∼ 1.5. In other words, the gas-phase metallicity of
galaxies in a dense environment increases by ∼ 0.15 dex
as they evolve from z ∼ 2.3 to z ∼ 1.5 (∼ 1.5 Gyr), but
the metallicity of field galaxies are almost unchanged"
"over this period. It implies that, at high redshift, metal"
14 Chartab et al.
enrichment processes are affected by the environment
where galaxies reside.
Previous studies observed that dense environments at
"the early stage of galaxy cluster formation (z & 2) con-
tain a significant fraction of pristine gas (e.g., Cucciati"
et al. 2014). In the absence of gravitational heating
"processes, gas accretion in overdensities should be more"
"prominent due to their deep potential well. However,"
infalling gas in overdensities with massive halos gets
shock-heated and needs to radiate its kinetic energy to
"accrete into the halo. At high redshifts, where the av-"
erage density of the Universe is higher by a factor of
"(1 + z)3, gas cooling is very efficient (van de Voort &"
Schaye 2012). It is also observed that overdense regions
in the early Universe are not only overdense in galaxies
"but also contain a large fraction of dense gas (e.g., Hen-"
"nawi et al. 2015). Denser gas can cool down faster, fa-"
cilitating the accretion of the metal-poor primordial gas
into galaxies (Kereš et al. 2005; Dekel & Birnboim 2006).
"As a result, the prominent accretion of cold metal-poor"
gas in overdensities dilutes the metal content of ISM in
galaxies at high redshifts. This results in the metal-
poor gas in the galaxies residing in dense environments
"at high redshifts, as observed in the present work at"
"z ∼ 2.3. Valentino et al. (2015) also observed the same
metal deficiency at z ∼ 2 and concluded that the accre-
tion of pristine gas from cluster-scale reservoirs lowers"
the gas-phase metallicity of galaxies in dense environ-
ments compared to their coeval field galaxies.
"In contrast, at the lower redshift, z . 2, the gas can-
not cool down efficiently in overdensities, so the galaxies"
in those regions start to experience cosmological starva-
tion. The lack of pristine metal-poor gas accretion in
cluster members has been observed in different simula-
"tions out to z ∼ 2 (van de Voort et al. 2017; Gupta et al.
2018). Moreover, Gupta et al. (2018) studied chemi-"
cal pre-processing of cluster galaxies in the IllustrisTNG
"cosmological simulation and found that at z = 1.5, clus-"
"ter galaxies receive ∼ 0.05 dex more metal-rich infalling
gas than galaxies in the field. But, this metallicity en-"
hancement disappears at higher redshifts (z > 1.5). At
"z ∼ 2, when galaxies actively form their stars, feed-
back processes should be strong enough to expel part of"
the processed gas into the IGM through the outflows.
"As a result, crowded regions contain pre-processed and"
"metal-enriched gas, which can be then re-accreted to"
the galaxies at lower redshifts. As pre-processed gas has
"higher metallicity, it can cool down faster which facil-"
itates its accretion (Kereš et al. 2005; Dekel & Birn-
"boim 2006). Therefore, we speculate that both effects,"
suppressed primordial metal-poor gas infall and pre-
"processed metal-enriched gas accretion, are essential in"
ramping up metal production in a dense environment
"around z . 2. This can explain our result at z ∼ 1.5,
where we find metallicity enhancement for galaxies in"
overdensities compared to field galaxies.
"In the absence of cold gas accretion, galaxies could"
maintain their SFR unchanged for a period of time as
they start to consume their gas reservoirs. This time
ranges from a few hundred Myr for most massive galax-
ies up to a few Gyr for low-mass galaxies (McGee et al.
"2014; Balogh et al. 2016). However, the dilution of ISM’s"
metal content will be ceased immediately after the ter-
"mination of cold gas accretion. Therefore, the absence of"
"SFR suppression in overdense regions at z ∼ 1.5 for our
star-forming sample does not contradict the observed"
metal enhancement in galaxies residing in overdensities
at that redshift. Given the relatively short cosmic time
"interval between z ∼ 2.3 and z ∼ 1.5 (∼ 1.5 Gyr), galax-
ies with stellar mass range probed in the present work"
"(M∗ < 10
11M�) do not have enough time to consume"
their remaining gas reservoirs after the halt of cold gas
accretion.
Sanders et al. (2018) showed that the MZR varies with
"SFR at z ∼ 2.3, such that the gas-phase metallicity of
galaxies at fixed M∗ is anticorrelated with their SFRs."
"Using SED-derived SFRs, we also find slight evidence"
of enhanced SFR for star-forming galaxies located in
"overdensities. Therefore, the prominent gas accretion"
in overdense regions at high redshifts can explain both
lower gas-phase metallicity and higher SFR of galaxies
"residing in overdensities at z ∼ 2.3. It is worth not-
ing that gas outflows can also play a significant role in"
lowering the gas-phase metallicity of galaxies located in
overdensities and actively forming stars. These outflows
can re-accrete into galaxies at lower redshifts and in-
crease the gas-phase metallicity of galaxies as found in
the present work at z ∼ 1.5.
6. SUMMARY
Using a large near-IR spectroscopic sample drawn
"from the MOSDEF survey, combined with the local"
density measurements from the CANDELS photomet-
"ric survey, we study the environmental dependence of"
"the MZR at z ∼ 1.5 and z ∼ 2.3. We cross-match MOS-
DEF galaxies with the publicly available catalog of local"
density measurements in five CANDELS fields (Chartab
"et al. 2020), and use the N2 =
[NII]λ6584"
"Hα
indicator to"
measure the gas-phase oxygen abundances of 167 galax-
"ies at 1.37 ≤ z ≤ 1.7 and 303 galaxies at 2.09 ≤ z ≤ 2.61.
The samples are labeled as overdense, intermediate-"
"density, and field based on their local density measure-"
ments. We match the stellar mass distribution of our
sample in three different environments to properly dis-
Environmental dependence of the MZR at z = 1.4− 2.6 15
entangle the effects of stellar mass from those related
to the environment. Massive galaxies are mostly found
in overdensities and unmatched underlying stellar mass
distributions between different environments can affect
the strength of the trends or even change the observed
trends in the presence of a limited sample size. For the
"mass-matched sample, our findings can be summarized"
as follows:
"• At z ∼ 1.5, the average metallicity of galaxies in
overdensities with M∗ ∼ 109.8M�, 1010.2M� and
1010.8M� is higher relative to their field counter-"
"parts by 0.094± 0.051 (1.8σ significance), 0.068±
0.028 (2.4σ significance) and 0.052 ± 0.043 (1.2σ
significance) dex, respectively. Also, the metallic-"
"ity enhancements for M∗ ∼ 109.8M� and 1010.8M�
galaxies in intermediate-densities are 0.090±0.052
(1.7σ significance) and 0.077 ± 0.042 (1.8σ signif-
icance) dex, respectively, with being insignificant"
for M∗ ∼ 1010.2M� galaxies.
"• At z ∼ 2.3, galaxies that reside in overdensities
with M∗ ∼ 109.8M�, 1010.2M� and 1010.7M�, have
lower gas-phase metallicity by 0.056± 0.043 (1.3σ
significance), 0.056 ± 0.028 (2σ significance) and
0.096 ± 0.034 (2.8σ significance) dex compared
to their coeval field sample, respectively. This"
metal deficiency is insignificant for galaxies resid-
ing in intermediate-densities except for the mas-
"sive galaxies (M∗ ∼ 1010.7M�), where we found
0.085 ± 0.034 (2.5σ significance) dex metal defi-
ciency compared to field counterparts."
"• Our results suggest that the efficient gas cooling
mechanisms at high redshifts result in the promi-"
nent accretion of primordial metal-poor gas into
the galaxies in overdensities. This cold metal-
poor gas can dilute the metal content of ISM gas
"and lowers the gas-phase metallicity of galaxies,"
"as seen in the present work (z ∼ 2.3). However,
as galaxies evolve to the lower redshifts (z . 2),
the shock-heated gas in overdensities with massive"
"halos cannot cool down efficiently, which prevents"
it from accreting into the galaxy. The termina-
tion of pristine gas accretion in overdensities along
with the accretion of pre-processed gas due to the
strong outflows increase the metallicity of galaxies
"at lower redshifts, z < 2. This scenario can explain"
"our result at z ∼ 1.5, where we find metallicity en-
hancement for galaxies in overdensities compared"
to coeval field galaxies.

APPENDIX
A. THE MZR WITH [NII]λ6584-DETECTION REQUIREMENT
We perform linear regression for individual galaxies (non-stacked) to calculate the best-fit MZR for galaxies with
significant detection (S/N > 3) in [NII]λ6584. We note that requiring detection in [NII]λ6584 introduces a bias to
"our sample toward higher gas-phase metallicities, especially in the low-mass end of the MZR where non-detections are"
"prevalent; however, it is worth investigating the offset between the best-fit MZRs in different environments without"
"considering the contribution of [NII]λ6584 non-detections. We fit a linear model, 12+log(O/H) = Z0+α[log(M∗/M�)−
10], to the MZR of the samples in two extreme environment bins (underdensity and overdensity) considering both"
measurement errors in stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity. Figure A.1 shows the best-fit lines along with 2D-
posterior distributions of the slope and the intercept for the bins of environment. A significant distinction (> 2σ)
between the posterior of fit parameters for the field galaxies and those located in overdensities suggests that the
"metallicity is enhanced at z ∼ 1.5 and suppressed at z ∼ 2.3 for galaxies in overdensities compared to field counterparts.
Based on the best-fit models and their corresponding uncertainties, on average, galaxies in overdensities at z ∼ 1.5
have 0.050 ± 0.024 dex higher gas-phase metallicity compared to coeval field galaxies. The trend reverses at higher
redshift, z ∼ 2.3, such that galaxies residing in overdensities are metal deficient by 0.055 ± 0.025 dex than the field
counterparts. These results are in general agreement with our findings using mass-matched stacked spectra (Figure 7)."
"Moreover, we estimate the intrinsic scatter of the MZR (σint) in both extreme environments at z ∼ 1.5 and z ∼ 2.3.
We assume that the observed scatter (σobs) around the best-fit MZR is σ"
"2
obs = σ"
"2
int +σ"
"2
meas, where σmeas is the average"
"measurement uncertainty. We estimate that the intrinsic scatter of the MZR at z ∼ 1.5 (z ∼ 2.3) is 0.07 (0.07)
and 0.07 (0.10) dex for the field galaxies and those residing in overdensities, respectively, which are consistent with"
"the intrinsic scatter of z ∼ 0 MZR in different environments (Cooper et al. 2008). We note that, although ignoring
[NII]λ6584 non-detections does not change our conclusions, the bias is evident in the low-mass end of the MZR by"
comparing best-fit lines in Figure A.1 with gas-phase metallicities derived from mass-matched stacked spectra (Figure
"7). Therefore, the stacking technique employed in Section 4 is the preferred method as it provides an unbiased MZR"
where the contribution of [NII]λ6584 non-detections are taken into account properly.
"Figure A.1. Similar to Figure 4, but here we ignore [NII]λ6584 non-detection galaxies. The best-fit lines to MZRs are shown
for galaxies with S/N > 3 detection in [NII]λ6584, residing in two extreme environments, overdensity (red) and underdensity
(blue). The shaded regions around the best-fit models show 1σ error in the best-fit lines. Both gas-phase metallicity and stellar-
mass errors are taken into account in regression analysis. Sub-panels show the best value (“+”), 1σ (solid) and 2σ (dashed)
confidence intervals for the two-dimensional posterior distribution of the slope and the intercept, which are considered to be
free parameters of the linear model, 12 + log(O/H) = Z0 + α[log(M∗/M�)− 10]."
