ABSTRACT
"Next-generation experiments allow for the possibility to testing the neutrino flavor oscillation model to very
high levels of accuracy. Here, we explore the possibility that the dark matter in the current universe is made of
two particles, a sterile neutrino and a very light dark matter particle. By using a 3+1 neutrino flavor oscillation
model, we study how such a type of dark matter imprints the solar neutrino fluxes, spectra, and survival prob-
abilities of electron neutrinos. The current solar neutrino measurements allow us to define an upper limit for
the ratio of the mass of a light dark matter particle mφ and the Fermi constant Gφ, such that Gφ/mφ must
be smaller than 1030 GFeV"
"−1 to be in agreement with current solar neutrino data from the Borexino, Sud-
bury Neutrino Observatory, and Super-Kamiokande detectors. Moreover, for models with a very small Fermi
constant, the amplitude of the time variability must be lower than 3% to be consistent with current solar neu-
trino data. We also found that solar neutrino detectors like Darwin, able to measure neutrino fluxes in the low
energy-range with high accuracy, will provide additional constraints to this class of models that complement
the ones obtained from the current solar neutrino detectors.

1. INTRODUCTION
"The origin of dark matter has been a fundamental problem
in physics for almost six decades, during which most of the
proposed solutions assumed that a single massive particle that
interacts weakly with baryons makes all the dark matter ob-
served in the universe (e.g., Wang et al. 2016). Recently, re-
search has emerged where more sophisticated solutions have
been proposed to solve the dark matter problem. One of these
is the possibility of the dark matter being a composite of two
light particles: a light dark matter (LDM) particle φ and a
sterile neutrino νs."
"The existence of such an LDM field can by identified with
a dilation field of an extradimensional extension of the Stan-
dard Model or/and a CP-violating pseudo-Goldstone boson
of a spontaneously broken global symmetry. For some of
these models, φ couples to the Standard Model fields, and
as such it induces periodic time variation in particle masses
and couplings. In such theories the gauge invariance suggests
that the φ should possess an identical coupling constant to
charged leptons, in which case scalar interactions with the
electrons provide a good opportunity for detection through
atomic clocks (e.g., Arvanitaki et al. 2016), accelerometers
(e.g., Arvanitaki et al. 2018), and gravitational wave detectors
(e.g., Lopes and Silk 2014; Graham et al. 2016)."
"Similarly, this φ field can couple to neutrinos. Once again,
these types of interactions generically result in time-varying
corrections to the neutrino masses, neutrino mass differences,
and mixing angles, which can be searched for in the neu-
trino flux signals on present and future experimental neutrino
detectors (Aharmim et al. 2013; Abe et al. 2016; Borexino
Collaboration et al. 2018; Aalbers et al. 2020). If φ cou-
ples weakly to the neutrinos, over a large range of masses,"
IL:ilidio.lopes@tecnico.ulisboa.pt
"it can significantly modify the neutrino oscillations probabili-
ties leading to a distorted survival electron neutrino probabil-
ity function (Berlin 2016; Krnjaic et al. 2018)."
"The motivation for such a model comes from the possibility
of this composite particle physics model resolving two obser-
vational problems:"
"1. The classical cold dark matter model leads to several in-
consistencies with the cosmological observational data,
such as the missing satellite problem and the cusp prob-
lem (e.g., Primack 2009). Light dark matter resolves
such problems if dark matter is totally or partially made
of light scalar particles with a mass of the order of
10−22eV (Hu et al. 2000; Peebles 2000). In hierarchical
models of structure formation, such type of dark matter
is able to explain the flatness observed on the profiles of
the distribution of gas and stars in halos and filaments
(Mocz et al. 2019)."
"2. Although the standard three neutrino flavor model pro-
duces a reasonable good global fit to all the neutrino
data (Esteban et al. 2019), there are now many hints
that point out to the possibility of the existence of a
fourth neutrino. This one does not have any other in-
teraction than gravity and for that reason is known as
a sterile neutrino (Diaz et al. 2019). It was found that
a flavor oscillation model made of the 3 active neutri-
nos plus a sterile neutrino could explain some of the
observed anomalies found on the Short baseline neu-
trino oscillation experiments (Giunti et al. 2012, 2013),
Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (Aguilar et al.
2001), and MiniBooNE Short-Baseline Neutrino Ex-
periment (MiniBooNE Collaboration et al. 2018), as
well as the anomalies related with GALLEX and SAGE
solar-neutrino detectors – the so-called Gallium anoma-
lies (Kostensalo et al. 2019). For instance, Kostensalo"

"et al. (2019) found that the data favour a 3+ 1 neutrino
flavor model with m4 = 1.1eV and mixing matrix el-
ement Ue4 = 0.11."
"One possibility to resolve both problems (neutrino anoma-
lies and structure formation) is to consider that dark matter
is made of a light scalar field that couples to a sterile neutrino
(e.g., Farzan 2019). The interactions of φ and νs could im-
pede the oscillations in the universe and thereby improve the
agreement between the structure formation and cosmological
observations (e.g., Dasgupta and Kopp 2014; Hannestad et al.
2014)."
"If such φ and νs particles exist today, they were produced
abundantly in the early universe. For instance, sterile neu-
trinos can be produced via mixing with active neutrinos
(Dodelson and Widrow 1994), in some scenarios such neu-
trino production is being enhanced by the oscillations be-
tween active and sterile neutrinos (Bezrukov et al. 2019,
2020; de Gouvêa et al. 2020) or by the lepton asymmetry
(Shi and Fuller 1999). The production of light dark mat-
ter can take many forms, such as vector bosons by paramet-
ric resonance production (Dror et al. 2019). For instance,
some models predict a sterile neutrino abundance of Ω2sh"
"0.12
("
"sin2 (2θs)/3.5× 10−9
)"
"(mνs/7keV) where mνs and
θs is the sterile neutrino mass and mixing angle (Kusenko
2009). For the light dark matter field some authors obtained"
"Ω2φ = 0.1

, where ao"
"is a parameter that relates to the initial misalignment angle
of the axion, and ma is the axion mass (Hui et al. 2017;
Niemeyer 2019). Conveniently, we will assume that in the
present-day universe the total dark matter abundance is given
by"
"ΩDMh
2 = Ω2φh"
"2 +Ω2νsh

"where the Ω2φh

ties in the present universe, respectively. For future refer-
ence, we assume that the present-day total dark matter abun-
dance ΩDMh"

and the dark matter density in the solar neighborhood is"

DM"
= 0.39 GeV cm−3 (Catena and Ullio 2010).
"In this paper, we study the impact that this light dark matter
field has in the 3+1 neutrino flavor model. Specifically, we
discuss how the light dark matter field modifies the neutrino
flavor oscillations, and by using the current sets of solar neu-
trino data, we also put constraints in the parameters of such
models and make predictions for the future neutrino experi-
ments."
"The article is organized as follows. In section 2, we discuss
how the light dark matter drives the 3+1 neutrino flavor os-
cillations. In section 3, we present the neutrino flavor oscil-
lation model in the presence of a cosmic light dark matter
field. In section 4, we compute the survival electron neutrino
probabilities for the electron neutrinos produced in the proton-
proton (PP) chain and carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle
solar nuclear reactions. In section 5, we discuss the results
in relation to current experiments and future ones. Finally, in
section 6, we present the conclusion and a summary of our
results."
"If not stated otherwise, we work in natural units in which
c =  h = 1. In these units all quantities are measured"
"in GeV, and we make use of the conversion rules 1m =
5.068× 1015GeV−1, 1kg = 5.610 × 1026GeV and 1sec =
1.519× 1024GeV−1."
"2. LIGHT DARK MATTER AND STERILE NEUTRINOS IN THE
UNIVERSE"
"We assume that in the present universe, the dark matter is
composed of two fundamental particles: a light scalar boson
φ and sterile neutrinos νs, where mφ and mνs are their re-
spective masses (Hannestad et al. 2014). The LDM field φ
couples with the active neutrinos and the sterile neutrino by
a Yukawa interaction gφφνsνs where gφ is a dimensionless
coupling (Farzan 2019). To illustrate this effect, consider an
LDM scalar φ with a Yukawa coupling to active neutrinos.
Then the relevant part of the Lagrangian reads"
"L ⊃ −(mν + gφ)νν +H.c., (2)
where for convenience of representation the flavor indices
have been suppressed. We also assume that the dimensionless
coupling is very small (g ≪ 1). From the Euler-Lagrange
equations of ν and φ, it is possible to show that the effect of
φ on the propagation of the neutrino is equivalent to changing
the neutrino mass frommν to mν+δmν. As we will see later,
this δmν perturbation will induce time variations in the mass-
squared differences and mixing angles of all neutrino flavors
through φ. In principle the Yukawa couplings can have any
structure in the neutrino flavor space. In this work, we will fo-
cus on two convenient scenarios of great interest to neutrino
detectors: mass-square differences and mixing angles (e.g.,
Ding and Feruglio 2020). Moreover, we will also assume
that δmν = gφφ (e.g., Smirnov and Xu 2019)."
2.1. Dark Matter Time-dependent Variation
"The hypothesis that dark matter in the local universe is
made of very light particles leads to the following descrip-
tion: the LDM field φ in the dark matter halo of the Milky
Way is represented by a group of plane waves with fre-
quency ωφ, such that ωφ = mφ(1 + v"
"2
φ/2) where vφ is"
"the virial velocity of the particles in the dark halo. A pop-
ulation of such light particles will smooth inhomogeneities
in the dark matter distribution on scales smaller than the de
Broglie wavelength λdB of these LDM particles. For any
particle, we compute λdB using the relation λdB = 1.24 ×
1022"
"10−23eV/mφ
) ("
"10−3/vφ
)"
"We notice that the kinetic term on ωφ is neglected once the
virial velocity vφ ∼ 10"
"−3 is very small (e.g., Blas et al. 2017).
Therefore, we dropped the corrections related with vφ for the
equation 2. Accordingly, the general form of this LDM field
reads"
"φ(~r, t) = φo cos (mφt+ ǫo) ≈ φo cos (mφt), (3)
where φo and ǫo = ~vφ ·~r are the amplitude and phase of the
wave φ(t), respectively. In this work we consider ǫo ≈ 0.
Moreover, the energy momentum of a free massive oscillat-
ing field has a density given by ρφ = φomφ/2 and a pres-
sure given by pφ = −ρφ cos (2mφt). Although formally
ρφ has an oscillating part proportional to φ(t), because this
component is very small we neglected its contribution in this
analysis (Khmelnitsky and Rubakov 2014)."
"The quantity φo is a slowly varying function of the po-
sition. Conveniently, the amplitude of φ(t) can be written"
"as φo =
√"
"2ρφ(r)/mφ where ρφ(r) = ρ
⊙
DM"
"(Ωφ/ΩDM)
is the fraction of dark matter density in φ particles at the
space-time coordinate ~r. Accordingly, the Sun immersed in
this light dark matter halo will experience a periodic pertur-
bation due to the action of the φ(~r, t), which by the presence
of a Yukawa coupling gφ will exert a temporal variation on
the propagation of all neutrinos. We estimate the dark mat-
ter density number nφ in the solar neighborhood as follows:
if we consider that the main contribution arises from a sin-
gle dark matter particle with mass mφ, then the relevant den-
sity in our case will take the value nφ = ρφ/mφ. If we
assume that all dark matter is made of φ bosons, we have
ρφ = ρ"
= 0.39 GeV cm−3 (Catena and Ullio 2010) and
"mφ = 10
−22 eV then nφ = 3.9 × 1030 cm−3 (particles"
"per centimeter cubed). This value is only 2 orders of magni-
tude smaller than the density of electrons in the Sun’s core,
ne ∼ 6 10"
"31 cm−3 (Lopes and Turck-Chièze 2013). Since
these particles are very light, we assume that there is no ac-
cretion of these particles in the Sun’s core during its evolution
in the main sequence until the present age."
"2.2. Neutrino Time-dependent Dark-matter-induced
Oscillations"
"In the presence of the LDM field φ, the neutrino mass mν,
according to equation 2 (Ding and Feruglio 2020), will re-
ceive a contribution δmν = gφ, such that from equation 3,
we obtain"
"mν
= ǫφ cos (mφt), (4)"
where ǫφ is the amplitude
"ǫφ =
gφ"
"mφmν
="
"2ρ⊙
DM"
"If not stated otherwise, we will assume that all dark matter in
the present universe is made of only LDM particles such that
Ωφ = ΩDM. We observe that ǫφ is a relevant factor even
if φ is a small fraction of the dark matter halo. In particular,
φ will affect the oscillation parameters of all neutrino flavors,
including the sterile sterline neutrinos. If we only take into
account the first order perturbation, thus, the neutrino mass-
squared difference can be written as"
"∆m2ij(t) = m
2
i −m"
"2
j ≈ ∆m2ij,o[1+ 2ǫφ cos (mφt)] (6)"
"where ∆m2ij,o is the standard (undistorted) value and ∆m
2(t)"
"evolves through φ(t) (see Equation 3), with an amplitude ǫφ
(see Equation 5), and a frequencymφ. The mass-squared dif-
ference ∆m2ij between neutrinos of different flavors follows"
"the usual convection (e.g., Lopes 2017) such that ∆m2i1 =
m2i − m"
"2
1 (i =2, 3, 4). In particular for the sterile neutrino,"
"we have ∆m241 = m
2
4 −m"
"2
1 where m4 is the mass of the ster-"
"ile neutrino. Similarly, the mixing angles variation is written
as"
"θij(t) ≈ θij,o + ǫφ cos (mφt), (7)
where θij,o is the standard (undistorted) mixing angle. The
indexes i and j in θij follow a convention identical but not
equal for the mass-squared differences (see Lopes 2018a, and
references therein). Therefore, as first suggested by Krnjaic et"
"al. (2018), the LDM φ(t) impacts the neutrino flavor oscilla-
tions through the modified expressions for the mass-squared
differences (Equation 6) and mixing angles (Equation 7)."
3. LIGHT DARK MATTER AND THE STERILE NEUTRINO MODEL
"In the following section, we consider a 3+1 neutrino flavor
oscillation model to describe the propagation of active neutri-
nos (νe, ντ, νµ) plus a sterile neutrino νs through the solar
plasma. Following the usual notation (νe,ντ,νµ,νs) corre-
sponds to the neutrino flavors, (ν1, ν2, ν3, ν4) are the mass
neutrino eigenstates, and (m1, m2, m3, m4) are the neutrino
masses. The evolution of neutrinos propagating in matter is
described by the see"
"dr
= HΨ ="
"UM2U† + 2EV
)"
"Ψ, (8)"
"where H is the Hamiltonian and Ψ = (νe,ντ,νµ,νs)
T . M2"
"is a neutrino mass matrix, U is a (4 × 4) unitary matrix de-
scribing the mixing of neutrinos and V is the diagonal matrix
of Wolfenstein potentials (Kuo and Pantaleone 1989). M2"
"is defined as M2 = diag{0,∆m221,∆m
2
31,∆m"
"2
41}. The first"
"term of the Hamiltonian describes the neutrino propagation
through vacuum and the second term incorporates the mat-
ter effects or Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effects
(Wolfenstein 1978; Mikheyev and Smirnov 1985). In general,
the Hamiltonian H that drives the evolution of neutrino flavor
must include the Wolfenstein potentials related with φ(t) (Br-
dar et al. 2018)."
"In most studies of three-neutrino flavor models, the authors
are solely interested in the modulation coming from the
square mass differences ∆m2ij(t) (by Equation 6) and mixing"
"angles θij(t) (by Equation 7). For that reason, all neutrinos
are assumed to couple φ(t). As a consequence, their contri-
bution to V cancels out. Hence, it is correct to neglect the
contribution of φ(t) to the Wolfenstein potential (Dev et al.
2020). Nevertheless, here in this 3+1 neutrino flavor model,
as we will discuss later, we include the contribution of φ(t)
in V."
"This 3+1 neutrino flavor model with dark matter is identical
to the standard (undistorted) three-neutrino flavor model (see
Equation 8). However, in this model we included a sterile
neutrino, and the Wolfenstein potentials in V are modified to
take into account the new LDM field φ (Miranda et al. 2015)."
3.1. Neutrino Matter-induced Oscillations
"In the standard three-neutrino flavor model1, the matter po-
tential V takes into account the interaction of active neutrinos
(νe,νµ,ντ) with the ordinary fermions of the solar plasma,
for which the V = diag{Vcc + Vnc,Vnc,Vnc} where Vcc cor-
responds to the weak charged current (cc) that takes into ac-
count the forward scattering of νe with electrons, and Vnc
is the weak neutral current (nc) that corresponds to the scat-
tering of the active neutrinos with the ordinary fermions of
the solar plasma (e.g., Xing 2020). Vnc can be expressed as
Vnc = V"
"e
nc + V"
"p
nc + V"
"n
nc where V"
"j
nc with j = e, p, n are the"
"contributions coming from electrons, protons, and neutrons,
respectively. However due to the electrical neutrality of the
solar plasma, the contribution of Venc and V"
"p
nc canceled out"
"1 In this model, the intermediate particle is an heavy boson, specifically
the Z or W± bosons."

"Vnc = V

"√
2 nn(r). Here GF is the Fermi constant"
"and ne(r) and nn(r) are the number density of electrons and
neutrons inside the Sun. Nevertheless, since Vnc is an univer-
sal term for all active neutrino flavors, and as such does not
change the flavor oscillations pattern, conveniently we write
V = diag{Vcc + 0, 0, 0}. Now, the inclusion of sterile neu-
trinos in the neutrino flavor model alters V (from Equation 8)
by incorporating a new degree of freedom, as a consequence
V = diag{Vcc + Vnc,Vnc,Vnc, 0} (e.g., Giunti and Li 2009;
Maltoni and Smirnov 2016; Xing 2020)."
"Finally, in our 3+1 neutrino flavor model, we include the in-
teraction of active and sterile neutrinos with the dark matter
field φ by means of an intermediate heavy boson I2. These
interactions result from the forward scattering of these neutri-
nos through the LDM field φ, thus V = diag{Vcc + Vnc +
Vνeφ,Vnc + Vνµφ,Vnc + Vντφ,Vnc + Vνsφ}, where Vνiφ
(with νi = νe,νµ,ντ,νs) relates to the neutrino νi. This V
corresponds to a generalization of the Wolfenstein potentials
found in the literature, for which most neutrino flavor models
only take into account the scattering of the sterile neutrinos on
heavy dark matter (Capozzi et al. 2017; Lopes 2018a; Lopes
and Silk 2019)."
"In our model, we opt to assume that all active neutrinos expe-
rience the same interaction with the LDM field φ, such that
their dark matter potentials are the same, such that Vνjφ =
Vνaφ (with j = e,µ, τ), it follows V = diag{Vcc + Vnc +
Vνaφ,Vnc+Vνaφ,Vnc+Vνaφ,Vnc+Vνsφ}. Now, if we sub-
tract the common term Vnc + Vνaφ to the diagonal matrix V,
the latter takes the simple form: V = diag{Vcc, 0, 0,Vνsφ −
Vνaφ − Vnc}."
"The potential Vνiφ (with i = a, s) is given by Vνiφ =
Gνiφnφ where Gνiφ is the equivalent of the Fermi con-"
"2 We assume the boson I has a mass mI identical to Z and W
± bosons."
"stant and nφ is the distribution of dark matter inside the
Sun (Smirnov and Xu 2019). Equally, Vνiφ relates directly"
"with the local density of dark matter ρ⊙
DM"
by the expres-
"sion: Vνsφ = (Gνsφ/mφ)
("
"Ωφ/ΩDM
)"
", where we as-"
"sume the ratio Gνsφ/mφ is a free parameter of the LDM
model. The generalized Fermi constant is defined as Gνiφ =
gνigφ/m"
"2
I where gνi represents the coupling constant of the"
"corresponding neutrino νi, and mI is the mass of the inter-
mediate boson I (Miranda et al. 2015). This expression for
the potential Vνiφ is valid since we assume that m"
"−1
I ≪ R⊙"
"where R⊙ is the solar radius
3 (Smirnov and Xu 2019). In gen-"
"eral, we could expect that the contribution of φ(t) to Vνiφ
could lead to a time-dependent relation, however, as discussed
previously (in section 2.1) and mentioned for the first time by
Khmelnitsky and Rubakov (2014), this is because the oscil-
latory component on the local density relates with v2φ. This
term is minimal, and therefore we neglected it."
"In this preliminary study, without loss of generality, we
choose to simplify V further: since the term Vνsφ − Vνaφ −
Vnc has two Wolfenstein potentials ( Vνaφ and Vνsφ) that ef-
fectively correspond to two new degrees of freedom, both of
these have an identical impact on the neutrino flavor oscilla-
tion model. We choose to simplify the model by assuming that
Vνaφ is much smaller than Vnc. Consequently, V takes the
simplified form: V ≈ diag{Vcc, 0, 0,Vνsφ − Vnc}. For refer-
ence, we note that in the Sun’s core Vnc is always smaller than
Vcc, once ne is more than twice as lager as nn (e.g. Lopes
2018b). This potential is identical to others found in the liter-
ature, for instance in Capozzi et al. (2017) and Lopes (2018a).
Therefore, the matter potential Vνsφ reads Vνsφ = Gνsφnφ
where for convenience of analysis, we choose to define the"
"generalized Fermi constant as Gνsφ = 4
√
2GφGF where"
"Gφ is our free parameter. Since these dark matter particles
have a mass much smaller than 4 GeV, the solar plasma con-
ditions do not allow the accretion of dark matter by the Sun
(e.g., Lopes and Lopes 2019), therefore we will assume that
the distribution of dark matter inside the star is equal to the
value measured for the solar neighborhood nφ (see section
2.1)."
"3.2. Neutrino Flavor Oscillation Model and the Survival
Probability of Electron Neutrinos"
"If we adopt as reference the current experimental set of pa-
rameters for the active neutrinos (e.g., Esteban et al. 2019),
the propagation neutrinos in the solar interior are completely
adiabatic. The same is valid for the 3+1 neutrino flavor os-
cillation model coupled to an LDM field φ considered in this
study. Conveniently, the propagation of neutrinos away from
resonances is well represented by a two neutrino flavor oscil-
lation model. The motivation for such approximation can be
found in Lopes (2018b) and references therein. In such a case,
the electron neutrino flavor oscillation is dominated by the
(ν1,ν2) mass eigenstates and is only slightly affected by the
decoupled (ν3,ν4) eigenstates, since the associated mixing
angles for the latter pair are very small (Kuo and Pantaleone
1986). Moreover, ν3 and ν4 evolve independent of each other
and are completely independent of the doublet (ν1,ν2). In
this limit, as proposed by several authors (e.g, Palazzo 2011;"
"3 As an example, if we consider mI ≈ mZ ≈ 90GeV where mZ is the
mass of the Z boson, then the propagation of neutrinos (like of the neutral"
"current) verifies the condition m−1
I"

model with no time dependence (Gχ ≈ 0) and ǫφ ≈ 0) as a thin dashed

"Blennow and Smirnov 2013), the split of the 3+1 neutrino fla-
vor model into a dominant two neutrino flavor model (νe,νµ)
with additional corrections for ντ and νs significantly sim-
plified the calculation and allowed us to obtain an analytical
solution (e.g., Kuo and Pantaleone 1989)."
"Among the many expressions available in the literature
to compute the survival probability of electron neutrinos
Pe (e.g., Lunardini and Smirnov 2000; Miranda et al. 2015)
in a 3+1 neutrino flavor model developed in the approximate

3.3. Light Dark Matter Impact on Solar Neutrinos
"The survival probability of electron neutrinos (Equation 9)
is a time-dependent function through equations (6), (7) and
(3). Conveniently we define an effective oscillation probabil-
ity 〈Pee(E)〉 that corresponds to an ensemble average of all
the Pee,(E,φ) (Equation 9), as such"
"〈Pee(E)〉 =
∫τφ
0"
"Pee(E,φ)
dt"
"τφ
, (15)"
where τφ = 2π/mφ is the period of the LDM field φ(t).
"The ability of a solar neutrino detector to measure the impact
of the time-dependent LDM field φ(t) on the survival proba-
bility Pee(E,φ) (Equation 9) depends on three characteristic
time scales: the neutrino flight time τν, the time between two
consecutive neutrino detections τev, and the total run time of
the experiment τex. The neutrino flight time is proportional to
the Earth-Sun distance d⊕ such that τν = d⊕/c ≈ 8.2 min
where c is the speed of light. The number of events measured
by a detector varies strongly from one to another."
"The next generation of experiments will have τev much larger
than the pioneer Homestake experiment that only detects a
few events per year (Bahcall and Davis 1976). The forthcom-
ing Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO;
Adam et al. 2015) experiment expects to measure a few tens"
"of neutrinos per day (for instance 200 events per day or
τev ≈ 7 min). The total experimental run time for most solar
neutrino detectors is of the order of a few decades (for in-
stance τex ≈ 10 yr), and future experiments will also have
significant running times. Hence for all models considered in
this study, we assume that solar neutrino detectors will run for
long periods and will collect a large number of events, there-
fore we assume that τev and τex have sufficient small and
large values, respectively."
"In such conditions, the solar neutrino spectra time modula-
tion by φ(t) depends on the period τφ of the LDM field in
comparison to the flight time of solar neutrinos τν. Since
these neutrinos have a τν ≈ 8.2 min, it is possible to
find the value of mφ for which τν = τφ which occurs for
mφ,c = 8.3 10"
"−18 eV. Accordingly, we can define two
regimes for the time modulation of survival probability of
electron neutrinos :"
"1. For τφ > τν (low-frequency regime or low LDM
mass), the time modulation of Pee(E,φ) occurs when
the period of φ(t) is larger than τν. In this case a tem-
poral variation of the neutrino signal may be observed.
This corresponds to a LDM field with a mass such that
mφ 6 mφ,c. Therefore, the LDM field can induce an
observable time variation in neutrino oscillation mea-
surements as periodicity in the solar neutrino fluxes
(Berlin 2016). Obviously, if τφ becomes very large,
the modulation of Pee(E,φ) becomes indistinguishable
from the standard scenario (undistorted case), since the
running time of the experiment is not sufficient to ob-
serve this phenomena. Nevertheless, in our study, the
LDM field has always an mφ > 10"
"−23 eV or a period
τφ > 13 yr. Therefore, it is always possible to probe
such a model with current experimental running times."
"2. For τφ 6 τν (high-frequency regime or high LDM
mass), the change of Pee(E,φ) due to φ(t) is too fast to
be observed as a modulating signal like in the previous
case. This regime occurs for LDM fields with a mass
such that mφ > mφ,c. Nevertheless, the time average
of the ensemble of oscillation probability Pee(E,φ) can
be distorted in such a regime, hence the effect can be
detected as 〈Pee(E)〉 which will deviate from the stan-
dard scenario (Krnjaic et al. 2018). The net effect of
averaging over time induces a shift in the observed val-
ues of Pee(E,φ) relative to its undistorted value."
"Therefore, we can expect to study both regimes in a quite rea-
sonable range of LDM masses using data from the present and
future solar neutrino experiments. In fact, some of the current
solar neutrino detectors have already large statistics and high
event rates that we can use to look for time modulations in
solar neutrinos. Some of these neutrino collaborations have
already searched for regular phenomena with periods varying
from 10 minutes to 10 yr (e.g., Yoo et al. 2003; Aharmim et
al. 2010)."
"In this work, we will study models that will fall in these two
regimes of time modulation. Therefore to satisfy the condi-
tions mentioned above, we decided to analyze the impact of
the LDM field in solar neutrino fluxes for φ(t) with a period
τφ varying from 4 µs to 13 yr or equivalently with a mφ
varying from 10−9 eV to 10−23 eV, which is a range possi-
ble to be scanned by future detectors like Deep Underground"

dent of the local distributions of electrons and neutrons, but
also on the population of dark matter particles in the solar
neighbourhood. This new flavor mechanism (sterile neutri-
nos and LDM field φ) affects all electron neutrinos produced
in the Sun’s core. A detailed discussion about the neutrino
sources inside the Sun, and their specific solar properties, can
be found in Lopes (2013, 2017). The average survival prob-
ability of electron neutrinos for each nuclear reaction in the
solar interior, i.e., Pe,i(E,φ) is computed by"

depends on the mass of the LDM particle. In the following,
we compute the spectra of neutrinos from any specific nu-
clear reaction that we know to be essentially independent of
the properties surrounding solar plasma. Since in the 3+1 neu-
trino flavor model new processes exist to change the survival
probability of electron neutrinos, this will modify the solar
neutrino spectra measured on Earth. These new processes will
alter the conversion rates of νe to other flavors (νµ, ντ and

5. THE SUN: LIGHT DARK MATTER AND STERILE NEUTRINOS

These new parameters are consistent with previous estima-
tions (Esteban et al. 2019; Gonzalez-Garcia et al. 2016). For
the sterile neutrino, we choose the following fiducial values
for the mass-square difference and mixing angles (Gariazzo
et al. 2015, 2016; Capozzi et al. 2017): ∆m241 = 1.6 eV"
"sin2 θ14 = 0.027, sin
2 θ42 = 0.014 and the other mixing an-"
"gle for the sterile neutrinos are fixed to zero. Moreover, we
assume that all phases (δ13,14,34) and other angles related to
the sterile neutrino are equal to zero."
"The present-day internal structure of the Sun corresponds to
an up-to-date standard solar model (SSM) that has a better
agreement with neutrino fluxes and helioseismic data sets.
This solar model was obtained from a one-dimensional stellar
evolution code allowed to evolve in time until the present-
day solar age, 4.57 Gyr, having been calibrated to the val-
ues of luminosity and effective temperature of the present
Sun, of 3.8418 × 1033 erg s−1 and 5777 K, respectively, as
well as the observed abundance ratio at the Sun’s surface:
(Zs/Xs)⊙ = 0.0181, where Zs and Xs are the metal and hy-
drogen abundances at the surface of the star (Turck-Chieze
and Lopes 1993; Bahcall et al. 1995, 2006). This stellar model
was computed with the release version 12115 of the stellar
evolution code MESA (Paxton et al. 2011, 2019). The details
about the physics of this standard solar model in which we use
the AGSS09 (low-Z) solar abundances (Asplund et al. 2009)
are described in Lopes and Silk (2013) and Capelo and Lopes
(2020)."
"Figures 1 and 2 show the impact of the time-dependent mass-
square difference (Equation 6) and mixing angles (Equation
7) on the averaged electron survival probability 〈Pee(E)〉
(Equation 15) for which the LDM field φ has a fixed am-
plitude (Equation 5): ǫφ = 0 or ǫφ = 1.5%. We also show
LDM models for which the sterile neutrino couples to φ with
strength Gφ."
The overall shape of the curve 〈Pee(E)〉 depends on Gφ times
"nφ in the potential Vνsφ or the ratio Gφ/mφ as previously
mentioned. For instance, in a LDM model in which we fix
mφ = 10"
"−9 eV (or nφ), an increase of Gφ from 10
20 to"
"1022 GF leads 〈Pee(E)〉 to vary significantly, as shown in
Figure 1. As expected this change in 〈Pee(E)〉 is more pro-
nounced for high energy neutrinos where the MSW effect is
more significant. If we choose higher values of mφ the results
will somehow be similar (see Figure 1)."
"Evidently, for an LDM model in which mφ decreases by a
certain amount (nφ = ρφ/mφ), the constancy of Gφ/mφ
in Vνsφ implies that Gφ can increase by the same order of
magnitude to obtain the same MSW effect on the 〈Pee(E)〉
curve (see Figure 1). For instance, an LDM model with
mφ = 10"
"−23 eV and Gφ = 10
7GF will have 〈Pee(E)〉 iden-"
"tical to an LDM model with mφ = 10
−9 eV and Gφ ="
"1021GF , since in both LDM models we have the same ra-
tio: Gφ/mφ ≈ 1030. The same argument explains the reason
why the coupling constant between sterile neutrinos and more
massive dark matter particles is much smaller in those models
than in the present study. For instance, this is the case for par-
ticles captured from the dark matter halo by the Sun. Since
over time, the star accreted a significant amount of dark mat-
ter (e.g., Lopes 2018a), for these models Gφ is significantly
smaller than the value found for the present study."
"The most important feature of such a class of LDM models
is the time dependence of the dark matter field φ(t) and its
imprint in the flavor oscillation parameters’ mass-square dif-
ferences (Equation 6) and mixing angles (Equation 7). As pre-
dicted by equation 9, there are many Pee(E,φ) with near sim-
ilar behavior. Figure 1 shows an ensemble of time-dependent
Pee(E,φ) as a pink band. The difference between curves re-
lates to the dependence of the oscillation parameters on time.
In this LDM model it is assumed there is a very negligible in-
teraction between sterile neutrinos andφ (for whichGφ ≈ 0).
The figure also shows 〈Pee(E)〉 (red curve) the time-averaged
of the ensemble of Pee(E,φ) curves that we compute using
equation 15."
"Although there are several parameters that contribute for the
time variability of Pee(E,φ) (Equation 9), the main contri-
butions come from θ21 and θ13. The variability related θ24
is relevant for the high energies. We notice that the contri-
butions coming from ∆m221 and θ32 are much smaller than
all the parameters mentioned above. The amplitude of the
Pee(E,φ) pink band is defined by the value of ǫφ for which
we adopt the fiducial value of ǫφ = 1.5%. It is worth point-
ing out that the Pee(E,φ) band is much larger for low-energy
than for higher-energy values. Moreover, the averaged value
of this ensemble given by 〈Pee(E)〉 is identical to 〈Pee(E)〉
with ǫφ ≈ 0. Figure 2 shows the variability of Pee(E,φ) for
a LDM with different Gφ values. These results are identical
to the model in figure 1. Nevertheless, the LDM model with
the largest Gφ has (an orange) band with a smaller amplitude
around 〈Pee(E)〉. Once again, the band thickness decreases
for neutrinos with higher energy for all these models."
"Figures 3 and 4 compare our predictions with current solar
neutrino data (e.g., Aalbers et al. 2020). These figures show
that LDM models with relatively low values of ǫφ and Gφ are
compatible overall with current solar neutrino data coming
from Borexino, Super-Kamiokande, and SNO. Clearly, this
analysis has also shown that the precision of our current solar
neutrino experiments is not able to distinguish between some"
"of these LDM models. Nevertheless, it is already possible
to put some constraints on these LDM models. For instance,
we found that LDM models with Gφ ≈ 0 must have a ǫφ
smaller than 3% to be consistent with all data, including pp
measurements of the Borexino detector (Borexino Collabora-
tion et al. 2020) (see Figure 3); and any LDM models must
have a ratio Gφ/mφ smaller than 10"
"30, otherwise they be-"
"come inconsistent with pp and 7Be measurements for several
solar detectors (Borexino Collaboration et al. 2020; Agostini
et al. 2019; Borexino Collaboration et al. 2018; Bellini et al.
2010) (see figure 4). Figure 4 shows a LDM model with a
mφ = 10"
"−9 eV and Gφ = 10
22 GF with a ratio Gφ/mφ of"
"the order of 1031 GF (see Figure 4); This ratio is one order
of magnitude larger than the critical Gφ/mφ value of 10"
"discussed in the previous section. Figure 4 also shows that
the variability related with time dependence on Pee(E,φ) de-
creases for large values of Gφ."
"There is another important effect that also contributes to the
time variability of Pee(E,φ). The PP chain and CNO cycle,
nuclear reactions occur at different distances from the cen-
ter of the Sun and each nuclear reaction emits neutrinos in
a well-defined energy range. As a consequence, the electron
neutrinos produced in each specific nuclear reaction will be
affected differently by the MSW effect. As such, this effect
will also contribute to the overall variability of electron neu-
trinos Pee,i(E,φ) (see Equation 16) and their time-averaged
〈Pee,i(E,φ)〉 (see Equation 17).
The time-dependent electron neutrino survival probability
will have a significant impact on the neutrino spectra of the
different nuclear reactions. Accordingly, figures 5 and 6 show
the spectra correspond to two neutrino types: pp and 8B neu-
trinos. An essential difference between these two spectra re-
lates to the thickness of the ǫφ band for a fixed value since
thickness decreases with neutrino energy. Therefore the ǫφ
band is more significant for a pp spectrum than for a 8B neu-
trino spectrum. This is an effect identical to the one discussed
previously for the Pee(E,φ) functions. Therefore, the mea-
surement of solar neutrino fluxes and solar neutrino spectrum
in the energy range below 0.2 MeV will provide the strongest
constraint for such a class of dark matter models. Figure 5 and
6 show the spectra of 8B and pp, if we assume the precision
expected to be attained by the Darwin experiment (Aalbers et
al. 2020). Figure 6 also shows the precision expected for the
Darwin experiment."
6. CONCLUSION
"This article focuses on the impact of LDM on solar neutrino
fluxes, spectra, and survival probabilities of electron neutri-
nos, specifically a dark matter model made of two particles:
a sterile neutrino and an LDM particle. In particular, we de-
scribe how the 3+1 neutrino flavor model is affected by this
type of LDM particles, with an emphasis on how the LDM af-
fects the Wolfenstein potentials. We also study how the dark
matter models affect the survival probability functions of elec-
tron neutrinos related to the different nuclear reactions occur-
ring in the solar interior, and we compute the spectra of two
relevant solar neutrino sources: pp and 8B neutrino nuclear
reactions."
"By studying a large range of dark matter particle masses
(from 10−9 to 10−23 eV) we found that depending on the
mass of these LDM particles and the value of the general-
ized Fermi constant, the shape of electron neutrino survival"
"probability and their spectra can vary with time. We estab-
lish that for LDM particles with low masses (low-frequency
regime), the solar neutrino detectors can observe the elec-
tron neutrino survival probability changing with time. Con-
versely, for dark matter particles with higher masses (high-
frequency regime), this impact can be determined by measur-
ing the time-averaged electron neutrino survival probability."
"It was possible to establish, using data of current solar neu-
trino measurements, that those models with a Gφ/mφ ra-"
"tio smaller than 1030 GFeV
−1 agree with current solar neu-"
"trino data from the Borexino, SNO and Super-Kamiokande
detectors. We also found that for models with a near-
zero constant, the time-variability amplitude must be smaller
than 3%. Such a constraint is equivalent to the condition"
