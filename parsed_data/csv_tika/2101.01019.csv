ABSTRACT
"In the quest to solve the long-standing coronal heating problem, it has been sug-
gested half a century ago that coronal loops could be heated by waves. Despite the
accumulating observational evidence of the possible importance of coronal waves, still
no 3D MHD simulations exist that show significant heating by MHD waves. Here we
report on the first 3D coronal loop model heating the plasma against radiative cooling.
The coronal loop is driven at the footpoint by transverse oscillations and subsequently
the induced Kelvin-Helmholtz instability deforms the loop cross-section and generates
small-scale structures. Wave energy is transfered to smaller scales where it is dissipated,
overcoming the internal energy losses by radiation. These results open up a new avenue
to address the coronal heating problem."

1. INTRODUCTION
"The mechanisms to heat the corona to its multi-million Kelvin temperature have been divided
between DC heating mechanisms and AC heating mechanisms. The DC heating mechanisms are
models generating currents and magnetic reconnection. Given that previous detection of coronal
waves were sporadic events (Aschwanden et al. 1999; Nakariakov et al. 1999), modelling efforts have
mainly gone into 3D DC heating models (Gudiksen & Nordlund 2005; Chen et al. 2014; Carlsson et al.
2016). However, the recent observational evidence for the ubiquitous presence of transverse coronal
waves (Tomczyk et al. 2007; McIntosh et al. 2011; Anfinogentov et al. 2015), motivates a revisiting of
the AC heating mechanisms. Wave heating has been successfully achieved in 1D (Suzuki & Inutsuka
2005) and reduced 3D MHD (van Ballegooijen et al. 2011, 2014) models. Recently, Matsumoto (2018)
extended the 1D wave heating models to 3D, but the model lacked any transverse structuring and"

"thus the waves heat a flux tube without a density-enhanced coronal loop. Recent 3D models with
density-enhanced coronal loops have not been able to sustain the corona (Pagano et al. 2018; Pagano
& De Moortel 2019). This is because the wave heating is insufficient to compete against the strong
radiative cooling of the coronal loops. Since the optically thin radiative cooling directly decreases
the internal energy, it is the key quantity to overcome in coronal heating models."
"The observed transverse waves that show little to no decay (Tian et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012)
are called decayless kink waves (Nisticò et al. 2013). Even though it is still unconfirmed whether
these transverse waves have enough energy for heating the corona (Tomczyk et al. 2007; McIntosh
et al. 2011; Van Doorsselaere et al. 2014), the observed energy flux of transverse oscillations is usually
underestimated because some “dark” energy is hidden in the non-thermal broadening of spectral lines
(McIntosh & De Pontieu 2012; De Moortel & Pascoe 2012; Pant et al. 2019). The decayless waves
are interpreted as being driven at the footpoints by photospheric motions, but the wave energy is
transfered and dissipated in the corona, either through resonant absorption (Hollweg & Yang 1988;
Goossens & Poedts 1992), mode coupling (Pascoe et al. 2012), phase mixing (Pagano & De Moortel
2017), or Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (Browning & Priest 1984; Terradas et al. 2008; Antolin et al.
2015). The latter mechanism cascades the driving energy from large scales to small scales, where it is
dissipated at low Reynolds numbers (Karampelas et al. 2017; Guo et al. 2019b; Afanasyev et al. 2019;
Karampelas et al. 2019a). The resulting loops have a fully turbulent cross-section (Karampelas &
Van Doorsselaere 2018; Antolin & Van Doorsselaere 2019) and show decayless oscillations resembling
observed events (Karampelas et al. 2019b)."
"In this paper, we study the heating effects of transverse oscillations on coronal loops via three
dimensional MHD simulations. Our work is different from the previous ones in the following three
aspects: 1. We explicitly include the radiative cooling in simulations. 2. Our results show that the
dissipation of transverse oscillations is promising to balance the radiative cooling of the coronal loops.
3. As far as we know, we propose a new method estimating numerical viscosity and resistivity in
MHD simulations. The numerical model is presented in Section 2. Section 3 provides the numerical
results, and Section 4 is the discussion and conclusion."
2. NUMERICAL MODEL
"We model the coronal loop as a straight, density enhanced magnetic flux tube in the Cartesian
coordinate. Gravity is ignored. The loop is along z direction, with all physical parameters depending
only on the transverse position x and y. Specifically, density is given by this relation,"
"ρ = ρe + (ρi − ρe) ∗ ζ(x, y), ζ(x, y) =
1"
"2
(1− tanh(b("
"√
x2 + y2/R− 1))), (1)"
"where [ρi, ρe] = [3 × 108, 108]mp cm−3 denote the density in the interior and exterior of the loop,
R = 1 Mm is the loop radius. b is a parameter controlling the width of the transition layer l, which
we choose b = 20, corresponding to l ≈ 0.3R. To study the heating of the loop we set temperature
inside and outside of the loop to be equal, Ti = Te = 1 MK, in order to avoid mixture of plasma with
different temperatures. The magnetic field is along z direction, with the magnetic filed strength inside
of the loop being Bi = 30 Gauss. Stability is ensured by maintaining the total pressure balance. The
Alfvén speed inside of the loop reads vAi ≈ 3778 km s−1."
"Similar to previous works (Pascoe et al. 2010), we trigger kink wave by implementing a time-
dependent transverse velocity driver at the footpoint. The velocity inside of the loop is"
"[vx, vy] = [v0cos(
2πt"
"Pk
), 0], (2)"
and the velocity outside of the loop is
"[vx, vy] = v0cos(
2πt"
"Pk
)R2["
x2 − y2
"(x2 + y2)2
,"
"(x2 + y2)2
], (3)"
"where Pk is the period of the fundamental kink mode. We choose the loop length L = 200 Mm, so
that Pk = 2L/ck = 86.4 s, with ck ≈ 4627 km s−1 being the kink speed. In our simulations we set
v0 = 8 km/s, corresponding to the lower limits of chromospheric observations of the transverse waves
(De Pontieu et al. 2007), which is larger than previously used typical values at the photosphere (e.g.
Karampelas et al. 2017)."
"The simulations are performed using the ideal MHD module of the PLUTO code (Mignone et al.
2007). PLUTO solves the conservative form of the ideal MHD equations (i.e., continuity, momentum,
induction, and energy equations). We use the finite volume piecewise parabolic method (PPM) for
spatial reconstruction, and the second order Runge Kutta for time stepping. The HLLD approximate
Riemann solver is used for flux computation, and a hyperbolic divergence cleaning method (GLM) is
used to keep the magnetic field divergence-free. The simulation domain is [−8, 8] Mm, [−8, 8] Mm,
and [0, 200] Mm in x, y, and z directions. To resolve the small-scale structures as far as possible
in the transverse direction, we use 800 uniform grid points in both the x and y directions, and 100
uniform grids in the z direction, corresponding to a spatial resolution in the x or y direction of
20 km. For the side boundaries (x and y), we use outflow boundary conditions for all quantities. The
transverse velocities at the bottom boundary are given by the driver, and at the top boundary are
fixed to be zero. At both the top and bottom boundary, the z component of velocity is antisymmetric,
while other quantities have zero-gradient boundary conditions. In the simulations, we have ignored
resistivity, viscosity, and thermal conduction. The energy dissipation in our simulation is entirely
caused by numerical dissipation at the grid scales."
3. RESULTS
"To study the heating effects of footpoint driven kink waves in the presence of radiative cooling, we
perform a MHD simulation with the radiative cooling included (radiative simulation hereafter). As
the comparison case, an ideal MHD simulation (adiabatic simulation hereafter) similar to previous
works (Karampelas et al. 2017; Guo et al. 2019b) is also conducted. The setup of the radiative
simulation is the same as the adiabatic simulation initially, but with radiative cooling turned on
when t > 600 s. The radiative cooling function Λ(T ) is tabulated from the Chianti database1"
"(Dere et al. 2019). At the same time when radiative cooling is turned on, in order to maintain the
background corona, we also turn on a temporally and spatially independent constant heating term
across the whole domain H0 = n"

eΛ0, where ne = 10"
"8 cm−3, Λ0 = 2.6 × 10−22 erg cm3 s−1. H0 is
implemented to maintain the background corona via balancing its radiative loss. By having both the
radiative cooling and the background heating, we are in fact analyzing the heating effects after the
KHI has fully developed and only inside the density enhanced coronal loops."

3.1. Loop Dynamics
"For both cases, we run simulations till t = 2000 s (≈ 23Pk). Figure 1 displays the 3D density
structure of the subvolume with ρ ≥ (ρe + ρi)/2, the temperature structure of the subvolume with
T ≥ 1.1 MK, and the forward modeled intensity of the Fe XII 193.5 Å line by FoMo code2 (Van
Doorsselaere et al. 2016) for the radiative simulation at t = 860 s (≈ 10Pk). From Figure 1 and the
related movies we see the formation of a standing kink mode as the result of the footpoint driver.
The loop is distorted first at the boundary due to the velocity shear, and then in the whole loop cross
section as KHI develops. Heating is initiated at the loop boundary and more profound at the loop
boundary than the loop interior, due to strong velocity shear at the boundary and strong radiative
loss at the loop interior. Heating occurs first at the footpoint and only after at the loop apex, making
the intensity enhancement of the Fe XII 193.5 Å line (formation temperature ∼ 1.58 MK) first at
the footpoint and then at the loop apex."
"Figure 2 shows the time-distance maps of density at the mid-plane (a slice at y = 0) of the loop
apex for two simulation cases. We find that the introduction of the radiative cooling does not have
any obvious influence to the evolution of the wave amplitude. The average displacement of the loop
center is around 0.6 - 0.7 Mm in our simulations, which is comparable to the larger amplitude limit
of the observed decayless oscillations (∼ 0.5 Mm from Nisticò et al. (2013) and Anfinogentov et al.
(2015))."
"In order to examine the loop dynamics in more detail, we plot in Figure 3 the density ρ, temperature
T , z-component current Jz, and z-component vorticity ωz at the loop apex (z = 0.5L) and near the
footpoint (z = 0.1L) for both adiabatic and radiative simulations at 860 s (∼ 10Pk). From Figure 3
and the related movie, we find different evolutions at the apex and near the footpoint. At the apex,
the KHI is initiated at the loop boundary due to the strong velocity shear, then develops further to
the extent where the loop cross section is fully deformed. Near the footpoint, where mixing is less
strong, the loop cross section is less deformed than at the apex. As simulations go on, both Jz and
ωz develop. The high temperature regions coincide with the regions of strong current or viscosity.
Jz is much stronger near the footpoint, while ωz is more prominent around the apex, indicating
that numerical resistive heating is stronger near the footpoint, while numerical viscous heating is
more prominent around the apex (Van Doorsselaere et al. 2007; Karampelas et al. 2017). Some high
temperature peaks in the snapshot are also due to the adiabatic effects (Karampelas et al. 2017).
Around the apex, mixing of different regions plays an important role redistributing and equilibrating
the temperature, while near the footpoint, where mixing is less strong, the high temperature regions
are more localized. The radiative cooling results in significantly lower temperatures in both the
apex and near the footpoint. This is because the radiative cooling is proportional to the square of
the density, and thus has most effect on the high density loop interior. However, despite the strong
radiative cooling, also the radiative simulation maintains a temperature above the initial temperature
of 1 MK. For the background corona, the gradual increase of the temperature around the apex is
due to the ponderomotive force (Terradas & Ofman 2004), which is also found in previous numerical
simulations (Magyar & Van Doorsselaere 2016; Karampelas et al. 2019a; Guo et al. 2019a)."
3.2. Volume-averaged Energy Density and Temperature
2 https://wiki.esat.kuleuven.be/FoMo
"In order to investigate the evolution of global energy and temperature, we examine the volume-
averaged energy density and temperature in the subdomain of |x|, |y| ≤ 4 Mm for both simulations.
The variation of internal, kinetic, magnetic, and total energy densities with respect to their initial
values (E(0)) are shown in the top panel of Figure 4. In the adiabatic simulation, the kinetic energy
first increases as the loop is oscillating as a standing kink mode. When KHI has fully deformed the
loop cross section by t ≈ 500 s and small-scale structures are formed, the kinetic energy becomes
saturated. The numerical resistivity and viscosity increase the internal energy and heat the plasma
via dissipating the magnetic and kinetic energy at the grid scales. By inspecting the red solid line
in the top panel of Figure 4, we find that the evolution of internal energy has two stages. When
t < 650 s, the increase rate of internal energy is accelerating, while after t > 650 s, an almost constant
increase rate is seen. This difference is caused by the different dynamic behavior of the loop. The
first stage is during the growth stage of KHI, with an accelerated energy transport from large to small
scales. During the second stage, when KHI has saturated and the loop cross section is fully deformed
and small-scale structures are generated, a constant energy transfer rate is found as indicated by the
straight red solid line."
"In the radiative simulation, when radiative cooling is turned on at t = 600 s, the kinetic energy
is not obviously influenced, while the magnetic and internal energies are changed compared to the
adiabatic ones. As the gas pressure of the loop is decreased by radiative cooling, the inward Poynting
flux at the side boundaries of the simulation increases the magnetic energy of the loop. Due to
the cooling, the internal energy stops increasing and stabilises around a fixed value. Indeed, in this
stage of our configuration, the driver energy input from the footpoint is approximately balancing
the radiative energy losses. To better gauge the heating in the simulation, we examine the volume
averaged temperature in the subdomain, which is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 4. In the
adiabatic case, the temperature increases continuously due to persistent viscous and resistive heating
at the small scales. It also follows the two stage process that we discussed before, with first a steady
increase until the KHI saturates. In the latter stage, the temperature increase in the adiabatic case is
nearly constant. For the radiative simulation, when radiative cooling is switched on, the temperature
remains almost constant in the second, radiatively cooling stage of the simulations. This result
demonstrates that the energy dissipation of small-scale structures can balance the radiative cooling
and maintain a high temperature loop. It also indicates that transverse oscillation dissipation is a
promising mechanism for heating coronal loops."
"To further address the heating effects, it is important to show the internal energy evolution of the
regions where radiative cooling is stronger than background heating. To do this, we select the regions
with ρ ≥ 1.1ρe and show in Figure 5 the results of (a) volume averaged temperature, (b) volume
averaged internal energy density, (c) total volume, and (d) total internal energy of this domain. We
find that the temperature within this domain shows similar trend as in Figure 4, for both adiabatic
and radiative cases. This result shows that the heating effects are promising to balance the radiative
cooling of the denser coronal loop. However, the internal energy density decreases obviously, even in
the adiabatic case, which seems to contradict with the increase of temperature. A similar situation
was already discussed by Magyar & Van Doorsselaere (2016) and Karampelas et al. (2017). The
decrease of the internal energy density is not caused by the energy loss in this domain, but by the
expansion of this domain, as Figure 5(c) shows, due to the development of KHI and the generated"

"vortices. The gradual increase of internal energy in Figure 5(d) is also predominantly caused by the
expansion of the domain."
3.3. Resistive and Viscous Heating Rates
"As mentioned in previous sections, in our model energy dissipation and heating are caused by
numerical dissipation. Numerical resistivity or viscosity can be estimated by conducting a group
of runs including varied physical resistivity or viscosity. In this section, we estimate the numerical
resistivity and viscosity using a different way by taking into account the energy equations."

matches with Em,ideal, but later on obvious difference is seen between the two curves. This is because
numerical resistivity will play a role dissipating magnetic energy when small-scale structures are
generated. We see that ηn remains almost constant after t ≥ 500 s. The averaged numerical resistivity

the kinetic energy density Ek (left side of Eqution 7) and its ideal MHD counterpart Ek,ideal (right
side of Equation 7 without the ¯̄Π terms). The bottom panels of Figure 6 show the results. We find
that the kinetic energy density saturates at around t = 500 s, while its ideal MHD counterpart keeps
increasing. The discrepancy between the two curves is caused by numerical viscosity. The averaged
numerical viscosity in the range of 500 s ≤ t ≤ 2000 s is µn = 1.1×10−4 g/(cm s). The corresponding
Reynolds number is R = lcvc/(µn/ρ0) = 1.7× 105, taking ρ0 = 3× 108mp cm−3 as the density of the
loop interior at the initial state."

"¯̄Π : ∇v. Figure 7(a) shows Dres, Dvis, together with the background heating rate
H0, and the radiative cooling rate, averaged over the domain of |x|, |y| ≤ 4 Mm for the radiative case.
Both the background heating and the radiative cooling are smoothly turned on at t = 600 s. From
Figure 7(a) we see that the cooling rate and background heating rate H0 are several times larger
than both Dvis and Dres. This is mainly because both resistive and viscous dissipations are localized
around the loop while Figure 7(a) is averaged over a domain much larger than the loop size. H0 is
constant, as we mentioned above. The radiative cooling rate is roughly balanced by Dvis, Dres, and
H0. The radiative cooling rate decreases only slightly, meaning that the development of small-scale
structures does not obviously influence the radiative loss of this domain. Figure 7(b) shows the same
quantities but averaged over the domain of ρ ≥ 1.1ρe. This domain is not fixed, rather it expands
as small-scale structures are generated (see Figure 5(c)). The volume expansion obviously decreases
the volume-averaged radiative cooling rate. The radiative cooling rate is also roughly balanced by
Dvis, Dres, and H0. Even though H0 contributes around 30% of the total heating rate in the time
range of 700 s ≤ t ≤ 2000 s, the dissipations from resistivity and viscosity play the major role in the
dynamics and deserve further future studies."
4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
"It is necessary to have some discussion about the thermal conduction, which is not included in our
simulations. Thermal conduction can also cause energy loss of a loop. In our initial setup, the time
scales of a loop cooled down by thermal conduction (τc) and by radiative cooling (τr) can be roughly
estimated by (e.g., Cargill 1994)"
"τc = 4× 10−10

T 5/2"
= 1.2× 104 s (8)
"τr =
2nkBT/(γ − 1)"
"n2Λ(T )
= 5300 s (9)"
"where n = 3 × 108 cm−3 is the loop density, L0 = 100 Mm is the loop half length, T = 1 MK, and
Λ(T ) = 2.6× 10−22 erg cm3 s−1 is the radiative cooling rate at 1 MK. We have τc > τr in our setup,
indicating radiative cooling is more important than thermal conduction, though further analysis is
required."
"Thermal conduction can transport heat along the magnetic field, which may change the temperature
profiles we obtained in this work. Figure 4 shows that heating can globally balance cooling, while"
8 Shi et al.
"Figure 3 shows different temperature profiles around the footpoint and the apex. In Figure 8 we show
the temperatures averaged over five subdomains with the same volume but centered at different z
positions for the radiative case. We find that heating is profound around the apex, while around the
footpoint the temperature decreases because of cooling. Around z = 0.3L and z = 0.7L, heating
and cooling are almost balanced with each other. If thermal conduction is included, the temperature
profile along z direction could be smoothed. In the adiabatic stage of t < 600 s, we obtain a
similar temperature profile as Guo et al. (2019a) in their monolithic case. The small reduction of
the temperature near the footpoint is probably due to the ponderomotive force that can transport
mass from the footpoint to the apex and thus influence the temperature profiles (Terradas & Ofman
2004)."
"Thus, we have proven with our simulations that AC heating mechanisms can be used in 3D MHD
models of coronal loops to heat the coronal plasma compensating for the massive radiative losses.
This was done by comparing an adiabatic simulation with a simulation in which radiative cooling
was switched on. In the latter simulation, the temperature was kept at coronal values, because of the
balance between the dissipation of the input driver flux, the background heating, and the radiative
cooling."
"This model constitutes a proof-of-principle for the AC heating mechanisms which have been pro-
posed half a century ago. Our model opens the door for further exploration of these heating mech-
anisms. This includes models incorporating a chromosphere and transition region who will induce
field-aligned mass flows in response to the turbulent heating and thermal conduction. Moreover, we
can look forward to models encompassing a whole active region heated with MHD waves. More im-
portantly, the models that will build upon our model can be contrasted to earlier DC heating models
for the solar corona. This comparison could in principle indicate which observable effects that can
distinguish the two heating classes in observations."
"Before closing, some remarks are necessary for future studies. Firstly, our current simulations
have energy outflows near the boundary, which could be improved in the future, and secondly, a
parametric study where the wave period is changed spanning and bridging the DC AC transition
would be helpful in determining which heating mechanism is more efficient at least in this model."
