"ABSTRACT
The joint detection of the gravitational wave GW170817, of the short γ-ray burst GRB170817A and of the kilonova AT2017gfo,
generated by the the binary neutron star merger observed on August 17, 2017, is a milestone in multimessenger astronomy
and provides new constraints on the neutron star equation of state. We perform Bayesian inference and model selection on
AT2017gfo using semi-analytical, multi-components models that also account for non-spherical ejecta. Observational data favor
anisotropic geometries to spherically symmetric profiles, with a log-Bayes’ factor of ∼104, and favor multi-component models
against single-component ones. The best fitting model is an anisotropic three-component composed of dynamical ejecta plus
neutrino and viscous winds. Using the dynamical ejecta parameters inferred from the best-fitting model and numerical-relativity
relations connecting the ejecta properties to the binary properties, we constrain the binary mass ratio to q < 1.54 and the
reduced tidal parameter to 120 < Λ̃ < 1110. Finally, we combine the predictions from AT2017gfo with those from GW170817,
constraining the radius of a neutron star of 1.4 M� to 12.2 ± 0.5 km (1σ level). This prediction could be further strengthened
by improving kilonova models with numerical-relativity information."

1 INTRODUCTION
"On August 17, 2017, the ground-based interferometers of LIGO and
Virgo (Abbott et al. 2018a; Aasi et al. 2015; Acernese et al. 2015)
detected the first gravitational-wave (GW) signal coming from a
binary neutron star (BNS) merger, known as GW170817 (Abbott
et al. 2017a). GW170817 was followed by a short gamma-ray burst
(GRB) GRB170817A (Abbott et al. 2017c; Savchenko et al. 2017),
which reached the space observatories Fermi (Ajello et al. 2016) and
INTEGRAL (Winkler et al. 2011) ∼1.7 s after coalescence time.
Eleven hours later, several telescopes started to collect photometric
and spectroscopical data from AT2017gfo, an unprecedented elec-
tromagnetic (EM) kilonova transient (Coulter et al. 2017; Chornock
et al. 2017; Nicholl et al. 2017; Cowperthwaite et al. 2017; Pian
et al. 2017; Smartt et al. 2017; Tanvir et al. 2017; Tanaka et al.
2017; Valenti et al. 2017) coming from a coincident region of the
sky. Kilonovae (kNe) are quasi-thermal EM emissions interpreted as
distinctive signature of r-process nucleosynthesis in the neutron-rich
matter ejected from the merger and from the subsequent BNS rem-"
"nant evolution (Smartt et al. 2017; Kasen et al. 2017; Rosswog et al.
2018; Metzger 2020; Kawaguchi et al. 2020). The follow up of the
source lasted for more than a month and included also non-thermal
emission from the GRB170817A afterglow (e.g., Nynka et al. 2018;
Hajela et al. 2019)."
"The combined observation of GW170817, GRB170817A and
AT2017gfo decreed the dawn of multimessenger astronomy with
compact binaries (Abbott et al. 2017b). From these multimessen-
ger observations it is possible to infer unique information on the
unknown equation of state (EOS) of neutron star (NS) matter, (e.g.
Radice et al. 2017; Margalit & Metzger 2017; Bauswein et al. 2017;
Radice et al. 2018b; Dietrich et al. 2018). Indeed, the EOS de-
termines the tidal polarizability parameters that describe tidal in-
teractions during the inspiral-merger and characterize the GW sig-
nal (Damour et al. 2012; Bernuzzi et al. 2014). It also determines the
outcome of BNS mergers (e.g. Shibata et al. 2005; Bernuzzi et al.
2015a, 2020) and the subsequent postmerger GW signal from the
remnant (e.g. Bauswein et al. 2014; Bernuzzi et al. 2015b; Zappa
et al. 2019; Agathos et al. 2020; Breschi et al. 2019). At the same"

"time, the amount of mass, the velocity, and the composition of the
ejecta are also strongly dependent on the EOS, that has an imprint
on the kN signature, e.g. (Hotokezaka et al. 2013; Bauswein et al.
2013; Radice et al. 2018d,a)."
"The spectrum of AT2017gfo was recorded from ultraviolet (UV)
to near infrared (NIR) frequencies (e.g., Pian et al. 2017; Nakar et al.
2018), and the observations showed several characteristic features.
At early stages, the kN was very bright and its spectrum peaked
in the blue band 1 day after the merger (blue kN). After that, the
peak of the spectrum moved towards larger wavelengths, peaking at
NIR frequencies between five to seven days after merger (red kN).
Minimal models that can explain these features require more than
one component. In particular, minimal fitting models assume spher-
ical symmetry and include a lathanide-rich ejecta responsible for the
red kN, typically interpreted as dynamical ejecta, and another ejecta
with material partially reprocessed by weak interaction, responsible
for the blue component (e.g., Villar et al. 2017b). Numerical rela-
tivity (NR) simulations show that the geometry profiles of the ejecta
are not always spherically symmetric and their distributions are not
homogeneous (Perego et al. 2017a). Moreover, NR simulations also
indicate the presence of multiple ejecta components, from the dy-
namical to the disk winds ejecta (Rosswog et al. 2014; Fernández
et al. 2015; Metzger & Fernández 2014; Perego et al. 2014; Nedora
et al. 2019). Therefore, this information has to be taken into account
during the inference of the kN properties."
"The modeling of kNe is a challenging problem, due to the com-
plexity of the underlying physics, which is affected by a diverse in-
teractions and scales (see Metzger 2020, and references therein).
Together with the choice of ejecta profiles, the lack of a reliable
description of the radiation transport is a relevant source of uncer-
tainties in the modeling of kNe, due to the incomplete knowledge
on the thermalization processes (Korobkin et al. 2012; Barnes et al.
2016) and on the energy-dependent photon opacities in r-process
matter (Tanaka et al. 2020; Even et al. 2020). Current kN mod-
els often use either simplistic ejecta profiles or simplistic radiation
schemes, (e.g., Grossman et al. 2014; Villar et al. 2017b; Coughlin
et al. 2017; Perego et al. 2017a). Given the challenges and uncertain-
ties associated to the theoretical prediction of kN features, Bayesian
inference and model selection of the observational data can provide
important insights on physical processes hidden in the kN signature."
"In this work, we explore model selection in geometrical and ejecta
properties using simplified light curve (LC) models, that nonethe-
less capture the key features of the problem. The inference results
are then employed to derive constraints on the neutron star EOS. In
Sec. 2, we describe the semi-analytical model and the ejecta compo-
nents used in our analysis. In Sec. 3, we recall the Bayesian frame-
work for model selection, highlighting the choices of the relevant
statistical quantities, such as likelihood function and prior distribu-
tions. In Sec. 4, we discuss the inference on AT2017gfo, critically
examining the posterior samples in light of targeted NR simula-
tions (Perego et al. 2019; Nedora et al. 2019; Endrizzi et al. 2020;
Nedora et al. 2021; Bernuzzi et al. 2020) and previous analyses. In
Sec. 5, we discuss new constraints on the NS EOS focusing first on
mass ratio and reduced tidal parameter for the source of GW170817,
and then on the neutron star radius R1.4. We conclude in Sec. 6."
2 KILONOVA MODEL
"In this section, we first summarize basic analytical results and scal-
ing relations that characterize the kN emission, and then describe"
"in detail the models we employ for the ejecta components and LC
calculations."
2.1 Basic features
"Let us consider a shell of ejected matter characterized by a mass
density %, with total mass m and gray opacity κ (mean cross section
per unit mass). The shell is in homologous expansion symmetrically
with respect to the equatorial plane at velocity v, such that its mean
radius is R ∼ vt after a time t following the merger. Matter opac-
ity to EM radiation can be expressed in terms of the optical depth,
τ , which is estimated as τ ' %κR. After the BNS collision, when
matter becomes unbound and r-process nucleosynthesis occurs, the
ejecta are extremely hot, T ∼ 109 K (e.g. de Jesús Mendoza-Temis
et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2016; Perego et al. 2019). However, at early
times the thermal energy is not dissipated efficiently since the envi-
ronment is optically thick (τ � 1) and photons diffuse out only on
the diffusion timescale until they reach the photosphere (τ = 2/3).
As the outflow expands, its density drops (ρ ∝ t−3) and the optical
depth decreases."
"The key concept behind kNe is that photons can contribute to the
EM emission at a given time t if they diffuse on a timescale compa-
rable to the expansion timescales, i.e., if they escape from the shells
outside Rdiff , where Rdiff is the radius at which the diffusion time
tdiff ' Rτ/c equals the dynamical time t (Piran et al. 2013; Gross-
man et al. 2014; Metzger 2020) . In the previous expression, c is the
speed of light. Since tdiff ∝ t−1, a larger and larger portion of the
ejecta becomes transparent with time. The luminosity peak of the
kN occurs when the bulk of matter that composes the shell becomes
transparent. As first approximation, the characteristic timescale at
which the light curve peaks is commonly estimated (Arnett 1982)
as:"
tpeak =
"4πβvc
, (1)"
"where the dimensionless factor β depends on the density profile
of the ejecta. For a spherical symmetric, homologously expanding
ejecta (β ' 3) with mass m = 10−2 M�, velocity v = 0.1 c
and opacity in the range κ ' 1−50 cm2 g−1, which are typical
values respectively for lanthanide-free and for lanthanide-rich mat-
ter (Roberts et al. 2011; Kasen et al. 2013), Eq. (1) predicts a char-
acteristic tpeak in the range 1–10 days (Abbott et al. 2017d)."
"In the absence of a heat source, matter would simply cool down
through adiabatic expansion. However, the ejected material is con-
tinuously heated by the radioactive decays of the r-process yields,
which provide a time dependent heating rate of nuclear origin. An
additional time dependence is introduced by the thermalization effi-
ciency, i.e. the efficiency at which this nuclear energy, released in the
form of supra-thermal particles (electrons, daughter nuclei, photons
and neutrinos), thermalizes within the expanding ejecta (see, e.g.,
Metzger & Berger 2012; Korobkin et al. 2012; Barnes et al. 2016;
Hotokezaka et al. 2018)."
2.2 Light Curves
"The kN LCs in our work are computed using the multicompo-
nent, anisotropic semi-analytical MKN model first introduced in
Ref. (Perego et al. 2017a) and largely based on the kN models pre-
sented in Refs. (Grossman et al. 2014) and (Martin et al. 2015) (see
also Barbieri et al. (2019)). The ejecta are either spherical or ax-
isymmetric with respect to the rotational axis of the remnant, and
symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane. The viewing angle ι"
"MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)"
AT2017gfo: model selection of multi-component kNe 3
"is measured as the angle between the rotational axis and the line of
sight of the observer."
"For each component the ejected material is described through the
angular distribution of its ejected mass, m, root-mean-square (rms)
radial velocity, vrms, and opacity, κ. In axisymmetric models, the
latter quantities are functions of the polar angle θ, measured from
the rotational axis and discretized in Nθ = 30 angular bins evenly
spaced in cos θ. Additionally, within each ray, matter is radially dis-
tributed with a stationary profile in velocity space, ξ(v) such that
ξ(v) ∝ (1− (v/vmax)2)3, where ξ(v)dv is the matter contained in
an infinitesimal layer of speed [v, v + dv], and vmax = vmax(vrms)
is the maximum velocity at the outermost edge of the component.
The characteristic quantities %, v and κ are then evaluated for ev-
ery bin according to the assumed input profiles. For every bin, we
estimate the emitted luminosity using the radial model described in
Ref. (Perego et al. 2017a) and in §4 of Ref. (Barbieri et al. 2020) (see
also (Barbieri et al. 2019)). In particular, the model assumes that the
luminosity is emitted as thermal radiation from the photosphere (of
radial coordinateRph), and the luminosity and the photospheric sur-
face determine the effective emission temperature, Teff through the
Stefan-Boltzmann law. We expect this assumption to be well veri-
fied at early times (with a few days after merger), while deviations
from it are expected to become more and more relevant for increas-
ing time."

ization efficiency tabulated according to Ref. (Barnes et al. 2016).
The heating factor �nr(t) is introduced as in Ref. (Perego et al.
2017a) to roughly improve the behavior of Eq. (2) in the regime
of mildly neutron-rich matter (characterized by an initial electron
fraction Ye & 0.25), (see, e.g. Martin et al. 2015):"
"�nr(t, κ) = [1− w(κ)] + w(κ) �Ye(t) , (3)"
"where w(κ) is a logarithmic smooth clump function such that
w(κ < 1 cm2 g−1) = 1 and w(κ > 10 cm2 g−1) = 0 and the
factor �Ye(t) encodes the dependence on Ye: if Ye < 0.25, then
�Ye(t) = 1, otherwise, when Ye ≥ 0.25,"

[

"4(t/t�−1)

"where t� = 1 day, �min = 0.5 and �max = 2.5.
Furthermore, in order to improve the description in the high-"
"frequency bands (i.e., V , U , B and g) within the timescale of the
kilonova emission, and following Ref. (Villar et al. 2017a), we in-
troduce a floor temperature, i.e. a minimum value for Teff . This is
physically related to the drop in opacity due to the full recombina-
tion of the free electrons occurring when for the matter temperature
drops below Tfloor (Kasen et al. 2017; Kasen & Barnes 2019). Un-
der these assumptions, the condition Teff = Tfloor becomes a good
tracker for the photosphere location. Since kNe are powered by the
radioactive decay of different blends of atomic species, we introduce
in our model two floor temperatures, TNifloor and T"

"magb(n, t) = −2.5 log10 (Fνb(n, t))− 48.6 , (6)"
where νb is the effective central frequency of band b.
2.3 Multi-Component Model
"In order to describe the different properties of AT2017gfo it is nec-
essary to appeal to a multi-component structure for the ejecta pro-
ducing the kN. Different components are characterized by different
sets of intrinsic parameters, m, vrms and κ, and by their angular dis-
tributions with respect to θ."
"Given the angular profiles of the characteristic parameters, the
physical luminosity produced by each component inside a ray is
computed by using the model outlined in the previous section. Then,
the total bolometric luminosity of the ray is given by the sum of the
single contributions, i.e. L(t) ="
"∑

L(k)(t) where k runs over the"
"components. The outermost photosphere is the one that determines
the thermal spectrum of the emission. Once Rph and Teff have been
determined, the spectral flux and the AB magnitudes are computed
according to Eqs. (5) and (6)."
We perform the analysis using two different assumptions on the
"MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)"
4 M. Breschi et al.
"profiles of the source. Initially, we impose completely isotropic pro-
files for every parameter of every ejecta component. These cases
are labeled as isotropic, ‘ISO’. Subsequently, we introduce angular
profiles as functions of the polar angle for the mass and opacity pa-
rameters, while we keep vrms always isotropic. This second case is
labeled as anisotropic, ‘ANI’. In parallel, we explore models with a
different number of components. We always assume the presence of
the dynamical ejecta, while we add to them one or two qualitatively
different disk-wind ejecta components."
"In the following paragraphs, we describe the physical assumptions
on each component and the choice of the prior distributions (see
Tab. 1). Fig. 1 shows a graphical representation of the employed
ejecta components."
"Dynamical ejecta (D). The BNS collision ejects unbound matter
on the dynamical timescale, whose properties strongly depend on
the total mass of the BNS, on the mass ratio and on the EOS (e.g.
Hotokezaka et al. 2013; Rosswog et al. 2013; Bauswein et al. 2013;
Radice et al. 2016; Bovard et al. 2017; Radice et al. 2018c,d). This
ejection is due to tidal torques and shocks developing at the con-
tact interface between the merging stars, when matter is squeezed
out by hydrodynamical processes (Oechslin et al. 2006; Hotokezaka
et al. 2013). The expansion of this ejecta component has a velocity
of roughly vrms ∼ 0.2 c. Moreover, this phenomenon generates a
distribution of ejected mass denser in the regions across the orbital
plane with respect to the region along its orthogonal axis, charac-
terized by larger opacities at lower latitudes. In particular, neutrino
irradiation (if significant), increases the ejecta Ye and prevents the
formation of lanthanides. For the anisotropic analyses, the mass pro-
file is taken to be %(θ) ∝ sin θ, and the opacity profile is take as
a step function in the polar angle characterized by the parameters
(κlow, κhigh), respectively for low- and high-latitudes, with a step
angle θstep = π/4 (see Sec. 3.3). In terms of emitted LC, the de-
scribed ejecta is characterized by a red equatorial component and a
blue contribution at higher latitudes."
"Neutrino-driven wind (N). Simulations of the remnant evolution
in the aftermath of a BNS merger reveal the presence of other ejec-
tion mechanisms happening over the thermal and viscous evolution
timescales (e.g. Metzger et al. 2008; Fernández & Metzger 2013;
Perego et al. 2014, 2017b; Decoene et al. 2020). If the ejection hap-
pens while the remnant is still a relevant source of neutrinos, neu-
trino irradiation has enough time to increase Ye above 0.25, prevent-
ing full r-process nucleosynthesis, especially close to the polar axis.
Detailed simulations (Perego et al. 2014; Martin et al. 2015; Fu-
jibayashi et al. 2018; Fujibayashi et al. 2020) show that a relatively
small fraction of the expelled disk contributes to this component and
its velocity is expected to be vrms . 0.1c. For anisotropic analyses,
the mass profile is taken to be uniform in the range θ ∈ [0, π/3]
and negligible otherwise, while the opacity profile is takes as as step
function in the polar angle, with a step angle θstep = π/3."
"Disk’s viscous ejecta (V). In addition to neutrinos, viscous torques
of dynamical and magnetic origin can unbind matter from the disk
around massive NSs or black holes (Metzger et al. 2010; Metzger
& Fernández 2014; Just et al. 2015). This viscous component is
expected to unbound a large fraction of the disk matter on longer
timescale, reaching m . 10−1M�, with a relatively low velocity,
vrms . 0.05c. The corresponding ejecta are more uniformly dis-
tributed over the polar angle than the dynamical ejecta and the ν-
driven wind ejecta. The presence or the lack of a massive NS in the
center can influence the Ye of these ejecta. Then, all angular pro-"
"files are assumed to be isotropic for this component (Wu et al. 2016;
Siegel & Metzger 2018)."
"We conclude this section by recalling that the main motivation be-
hind the usage of the semi-analytic model presented above is the op-
timal compromise between its robustness and adaptability, essential
to model the non-trivial structure of the ejecta, and the reduced com-
putational costs, necessary to perform parameter estimation studies.
However, it has been showed that simplified models that avoid the
solution of the radiation transport problem can suffer from system-
atic uncertainties (Wollaeger et al. 2018). In particular, the analytical
model presented in (Grossman et al. 2014), on which ours is based,
produces significantly lower light curves. The comparison with ob-
served kN light curves and more detailed kN models showed how
larger nuclear heating rates �0 systematically reduce this discrep-
ancy."
3 METHOD
"In this section, we recall the basic concepts of model selection as
they are stated in the Bayesian theory of probability. Then, we de-
scribe the statistical technique used for the computations of the
Bayes’ factors. As convention, the symbol ‘log’ denotes the natural
logarithm while a logarithm to a different base is explicitly written
when it is used."
3.1 Model Selection
"Given some data d and a modelH (hypothesis) described by a set of
parameters θ, the posterior probability is given by the Bayes’ theo-
rem:"
"p(θ|d,H) = p(d|θ, H) p(θ|H)
p(d|H) , (7)"
"where p(d|θ, H) is the likelihood function, p(θ|H) is the prior
probability assigned to the parameters and p(d|H) is the evidence.
The latter value plays the role of normalization constant and it can
be computed by marginalizing the likelihood function,"
"p(d|H) =
∫"
"p(d|θ, H) p(θ|H)dθ , (8)"
"where the integral is computed over the entire parameters’ space Θ.
In the framework of Bayesian theory of probability, we can com-"
"pare two models, say A and B, by computing the ratios of the re-
spective posterior probabilities, also known as Bayes’ factor,"
"BAB =
p(A|d,HA)
p(B|d,HB)"
Using Eq. (7) we get:
"BAB =
p(d|A,HA)
p(d|B,HB)"
"p(A|HA)
p(B|HB)"
"=
p(d|A,HA)
p(d|B,HB)"
", (10)"
"where we assumed that the data do not depend on the different hy-
pothesis and that different models are equally likely a priori, i.e.
p(A|HA) = p(B|HB). Now suppose that the two models A,B
are respectively described by two sets of parameters θA,θB . Using
the marginalization rule we can write:"
"p(d|I,HI) =
∫"
"p(d|θI , I,HI) p(θI |I,HI) dθI , (11)"
"for I = A,B. The integral in Eq. (11) represents the evidence com-
puted for the hypotheses H ′I = {HI , I}, for I = A,B (i.e. the"
"MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)"
AT2017gfo: model selection of multi-component kNe 5
"involved model becomes part of the background hypothesis). Then,
we obtain that the Bayes’ factor BAB can be computed as"
"BAB =
p(d|H ′A)
p(d|H ′B)"
. (12)
"From the previous results, we understand that if BAB > 1 then
the model A will be favored by the data, viceversa if BAB < 1. It
is important to observe that the Bayes’ factor implicitly takes into
account the so called Occam’s razor, i.e. if two models are both able
to capture the features of the data, then the one with lower number of
parameters will be favored (Sivia & Skilling 2006). In our analysis,
this is a crucial point since different models have different numbers
of parameters."
3.2 Nested Sampling
"In a realistic scenario, the form of the likelihood function is ana-
lytically indeterminable and the parameter space has a non-trivial
number of dimensions. For these reasons, the estimation of Eq. (11)
is performed resorting to statistical computational techniques: we
employ the nested sampling Bayesian technique introduced in
Ref. (Skilling 2006) and designed to compute the evidence and ex-
plore the full parameter space. The uncertainties associated with the
evidence estimations are computed according to Ref. (Skilling 2006)
and increasing the result by one order of magnitude, in order to con-
servatively take into account systematics. The latter are expected
since the model considered for our analyses (as many others) can-
not capture all the physics processes involved in kNe, and it suffers
of large uncertainties in the atomic physics and radiative processes
implementation."
"We perform inference with cpnest (Pozzo & Veitch Pozzo
& Veitch), a parallelized nested sampling implementation. We use
1024 live points and, for every step, we set a maximum number
of 2048 Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations for the ex-
ploration of the parameter space. The proposal step method used
in the MCMC is the same as the one implemented as default in
cpnest software. It corresponds to a cycle over four different pro-
posal methods: a random-walk step (Goodman & Weare 2010), a
stretch move (Goodman & Weare 2010), a differential evolution
method (Nelson et al. 2013) and a proposal based on the eigenvec-
tors of the covariance matrix of the ensemble samples, as imple-
mented in Ref. (Veitch et al. 2015)."
3.3 Choice of Priors
"In our analysis we assume the sky position of the source to be
known and the time of coalesce to be the same of the trigger time of
GW170817 (Abbott et al. 2017a). Furthermore, we do not take into
account the redshift contribution, given the larger systematic uncer-
tainties in the model. We employ the parameters shown in Tab. 1,
that can be divided in three subsets: the intrinsic ejecta parameters

shell, i.e. a single number characterizes the entire profile of the pa-

source,DL and the viewing angle ι. These parameters do not depend
on the physical properties of the source and they are related with the
observed signal through geometrical argumentation."
"The prior distributions for all the parameters are taken uniform
in their bounds, except for the followings. For the extrinsic param-
eters θext = {DL, ι}, we set the priors equal to the marginalized
posterior distributions coming from the low-spin-prior measurement
of GW170817 (Abbott et al. 2019b); For the heating rate factor �0,
we use a uniform prior distribution in log �0, i.e. p(�0|H) ∝ �0−1,
since this parameter strongly affects the LC and it is free to vary in
a wide range. Moreover, we adopt a prior range according with the
estimation given in Ref. (Korobkin et al. 2012). Tab. 1 shows the
prior bounds used for the analysis of the anisotropic cases. For the
isotropic studies, the bounds are identical except for the opacity κ
of dynamical component, where the low-latitude and high-latitude
bounds are joined together."

inal works and to the data reduction techniques can be found. The
index b runs over all considered photometric bands, covering a wide
photometric range from the UV to the NIR, while for each band b
the index i runs over the corresponding sequence of Nb temporal
observations. Additionally, the magnitudes have been corrected for

is in accordance with the residuals introduced in Ref. (Perego et al.
2017a) and it takes into account the uncertainties due to possible
technical issues of the instruments and generic non-stationary con-
tributions, providing a good characterization of the noise 1. For both
geometric configurations, isotropic (ISO) and anisotropic (ANI), we
perform Bayesian analyses using different combinations of compo-
nents, testing the capability to fit the data."
4 RESULTS
"In this section we present the results gathered from the Bayesian
analysis. In Sec. 4.1 we describe the capability of the synthetic LCs
to fit the observed data. After that, in Sec. 4.2, we discuss the es-
timated evidence inferring the preferred model. Finally, in Sec. 4.3,
we discuss the interpretation of the recovered posterior distributions."
4.1 Light Curves
"Figure 2 shows the LCs computed from the recovered maximum-
likelihood parameters for each discussed model. The estimated LCs
are compared with AT2017gfo data for six representative photomet-
ric bands. Moreover, Fig. 3 shows the uncertainties associated with
the estimated LCs, computed over the recovered posterior samples,
for each considered model. Generally, the errors associated with
the near UV (NUV) magnitudes are larger compared with the other
bands, reflecting the lower number of data points in this photometric
region. Furthermore, none of the considered model is able to fully
capture the trend described by the observed data in the Ks band for
time larger then 10 days, within the provided prior bounds. This is
expected from the simplified treatment of the radiation transport and
the approximated heating rate in our models."
"The isotropic models (ISO-D and ISO-DV) give a good fitting
to the data for early times and their LCs capture the general trends
of the data. However, for times larger than ∼8 days, these models
do not capture all the features of the data within the provided prior
bounds. This inaccuracy is particularly evident in the NIR, where the"
"1 Also the work presented in Ref. (Villar et al. 2017b) employs a Gaussian
likelihood, with the inclusion of an additional uncertainty parameter; while,
in Ref. (Coughlin et al. 2017), the authors proposed a likelihood distributed
as a χ2."

"LCs predicted by the ISO-D and the ISO-DV models do not recover
the correct slopes of the data."
"The anisotropic single-component case, ANI-D, is apt at adapt-
ing the model to the different features present in the data, even
for large time-scales. However, it overestimates the kN emission
in the blue band. This inconsistency could be reduced allowing the
high latitude opacity parameter κhigh to lower values. Regarding the
anisotropic two-components models, the ANI-VN gives a good fit-
ting for early times, but the model largely underestimates the data
at times &5 days. This is due to the absence of a fast blue compo-
nent. The anisotropic ANI-DV model gives LCs similar to ANI-D
except for a slight excess of power for time &10 days, especially in
the NIR region, i.e. z,K andKs bands. This behavior could be miti-
gated by reducing the lower bound on the TLAfloor parameter. However,
it could also indicate a significant deviation from the black-body
emission adopted in our model at late times. Furthermore, the ANI-
DV model overshoots the data in the NUV, as it is for the respec-
tive single-component case ANI-D. This can be explained looking at
the recovered value of dynamical ejected mass, which exceeds the-
oretical expectations estimated from NR simulations (Perego et al.
2019; Endrizzi et al. 2020; Nedora et al. 2019; Bernuzzi et al. 2020;
Nedora et al. 2021)(see Sec. 4.3.4). Similar considerations hold for
the anisotropic three-component case ANI-DVN. However, the un-
certainties on the estimated LCs for this model are narrower with
respect to the ones obtained from the ANI-DV, corresponding to
an improvement in the capability of constraining the measurement.
The main improvement of the three-component ANI-DVN model
over the two-component ANI-DV model lies in its ability to better
fit early-times data due to the inclusion of a third component."
4.2 Evidences
"The logarithmic evidences estimated for the considered models are
shown in Tab. 2. The evidence increases with the number of models’
components. This is consistent with the hierarchy observed in the
LC residuals, and the better match to the data for multi-component
models. The only exception is the ANI-NV case, for which the fea-
tures of the data at late times are not well captured due to the absence
of a fast equatorial component. Furthermore, for a fixed number of
components, the anisotropic geometries are always favored with re-
spect to isotropic geometries, with a logBANIISO of the order of 104.
The preferred model among the considered cases is the anisotropic
three-component, in agreement with previous findings, e.g. (Cow-
perthwaite et al. 2017; Perego et al. 2017a; Villar et al. 2017b)."

4.3 Posterior Distributions
"In the following paragraphs, we discuss the properties of the pos-
terior distributions for each model and their physical interpretation.
Table 3 and Tab. 4 show the mean values of the parameters, and
their 90% credible regions, extracted from the recovered posterior
distributions. A general fact is that the marginalized posterior for the
ejected mass of the viscous component is always constrained against
the lower bound 10−2 M�, when this component is involved. More-
over, for the majority of the analyses, the distance parameter is bi-"
"ased towards larger values, inconsistently with the estimates from
Ref. (Abbott et al. 2017a,b), and the heating rate parameter �0 is
generally overestimated comparing with the estimates from nuclear
calculations (Korobkin et al. 2012; Barnes et al. 2016; Kasen &
Barnes 2019; Barnes et al. 2020; Zhu et al. 2020). This behavior
can be explained from Eqs. (2), (5) and (6): DL and �0 are largely
degenerate and both concur to determine the brightness of the ob-
served LCs. Thus, the correlations between these parameters induce
biases in the recovered values. The physical explanation of this ef-"

"posterior distribution for the TNifloor parameter highlights the unsuit-
ability of this model in capturing the features of the observed data."
4.3.2 ANI-D
"For the anistropic single-component model ANI-D, the value of the
ejected mass agrees with the one coming from the ISO-D case.
However, in order to fit the data, ANI-D requires a larger velocity,
∼0.23 c, as shown in Fig. 4. The high-latitude opacity is constrained
around the lower bound 0.1 cm2 g−1 while the low-latitude con-
tribution exceeds above 30 cm2 g−1, that largely differs from the
respective isotropic case, ISO-D. In practice, that is due to the lack
of ejected mass that is balanced with a more opaque environment.
Nevertheless, according to the estimated evidences, this model is
preferred with respect to the isotropic case. The reason is clear from
Fig. 2: the anisotropic model is able to characterize the late-times
features of the data. The heating rate parameter �0 is largely biased
towards larger values with respect to the results of Ref. (Korobkin
et al. 2012), in order to compensate the lack of ejected matter. In-
deed, a larger heating factor �0 leads to brighter LCs, and this effect
is capable to mimic an increase in the amount of ejected matter."
"The posterior distribution for viewing angle ι peaks around 44 de-
grees, inconsistently with the estimations coming from the GRB
analysis (Abbott et al. 2017c; Savchenko et al. 2017; Ghirlanda et al.
2019). Moreover, unlike the ISO-D case, both temperature parame-
ters TNifloor and T"
"LA
floor are well constrained for the ANI-D analysis:"
"these parameters affect mostly the late-times model, modifying the
slope of the recovered LCs. Thus, these terms are responsible for the
improvement in the fitted LCs."
4.3.3 ISO-DV
"Figure 5 shows the posterior distribution for some exemplary in-
trinsic ejecta parameters. For both components, the individual most-
likely value for ejected mass parameter lies around ∼ 10−2 M�, in
agreement with the measurement presented in Ref. (Abbott et al.
2017d). This range of values is slightly overestimating the expec-
tations coming from NR simulations for the dynamical compo-
nent (Perego et al. 2019; Nedora et al. 2019; Endrizzi et al. 2020;
Nedora et al. 2021; Bernuzzi et al. 2020). This could be explained by
considering the effect of the spiral-wave wind (Nedora et al. 2019),
that constitute a massive and fast ejecta on timescales of 10−100 ms.
The spiral-wave wind is not considered as components in our mod-
els because it would be highly degenerate with the dynamical ejecta.
The recovered opacity parameters are roughly 4−5 cm2 g−1. The
velocity of the dynamical component is greater than secular velocity,"

"accordingly with the theoretical expectations. Comparing with other
fitting models, the recovered ejected masses m(D) result smaller
with respect to the analogous analysis of Ref. (Villar et al. 2017b),
while the results roughly agree with the estimations coming from
Ref. (Coughlin et al. 2018). However, it is not possible to perform
an apple-to-apple comparison between these results, due to the sys-
tematic differences in modeling between the semi-analytical model
(used in this work) and the radiative-transport methods employed in
Ref. (Villar et al. 2017b; Coughlin et al. 2018)."
"The temperature parameters, TNifloor and T
LA
floor, are much more"
"constrained comparing with the respective isotropic single compo-
nent case ISO-D, and this is reflected in the improvement of fitting
the different trends of the data in the high-frequency bands. The
marginalized posterior distribution of the inclination angle is coin-
cident with the prior, according with the isotropic description. Fur-
thermore, the biases on the distance DL and the heating parameter
�0 are reduced with respect to the ISO-D, since two-component case
accounts for a larger amount of total ejected mass. Indeed, increas-
ing the number of ejecta components other than the dynamical one,
the overall kN becomes brighter since additional terms, becoming
transparent at larger times, are included into the computation of the
emitted flux. Then, �0 tends towards lower values in order to com-
pensate this effect and fit the data. According with the estimated ev-
idences, the isotropic two-components ISO-DV model is disfavored
with respect to the anisotropic single-component ANI-D. The main
difficulty of ISO-DV is, again, to fit the data at late-times."
4.3.4 ANI-DV
"The ANI-DV model is the second best fitting model to AT2017gfo
among the considered cases. Fig. 5 shows the posterior distribu-
tion for some exemplary intrinsic parameters of the dynamical
and the viscous components. The ejected mass value lies around"
"MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)"
10 M. Breschi et al.
"∼10−2 M�, in agreement with previous estimates (Abbott et al.
2017d). On the other hand, the recovered mass slightly overestimates
the results coming from targeted NR simulations (Perego et al. 2019;
Nedora et al. 2019; Endrizzi et al. 2020; Nedora et al. 2021; Bernuzzi
et al. 2020), similarly to ISO-DV (see Sec. 4.3.3). The velocity is
well constrained around ∼0.23 c. The recovered low-latitude opac-
ity corresponds roughly to 12 cm2 g−1 and high-latitude opacity is
constrained around the lower bound, 0.1 cm2 g−1. This result can be
explained by considering that the mass of the dynamical component
slightly overshoots the NR expectations (Perego et al. 2019; Nedora
et al. 2019; Endrizzi et al. 2020; Nedora et al. 2021; Bernuzzi et al.
2020) (of a factor ∼1.25), and by noticing that the ejected mass
correlates with the luminosity distance and the heating factor (that
are generally biased). This combination generates the overestima-
tion of the data in the NUV region. In order to improve the fitting to
the observed data, the model tries to compensate this effect and the
high-latitude opacity tends to move towards lower values."
"Concerning the viscous component, its velocity results an order
of magnitude smaller than the one of the dynamical ejecta, in agree-
ment with the expectations. This enforce the hypothesis for which
the viscous ejecta contributes mostly to the red kN. The posterior
distribution of opacity parameter peaks around ∼5 cm2 g−1, denot-
ing a medium opaque environment."
"Fig. 6 shows the posterior distribution for the extrinsic parameters.
The temperatures TNifloor and T"
"LA
floor are well constrained respectively"
"around ∼5000 K and ∼700 K. The agreement with Ref. (Korobkin
et al. 2012) on the estimation of the heating factor �0 increases with
respect to the ANI-D case, due to the inclusion of an additional com-
ponent, similarly to what is discussed in Sec. 4.3.3. The posterior for
inclination angle results similar to the ANI-D case, according with
the fact that the viscous component, as we have defined it, does not
introduce further information on the inclination."
4.3.5 ANI-VN
"According to Tab. 2, this ANI-VN is the least likely model among
all anisotropic cases. As previously mentioned, the reason for this
is clear from the LCs. The parameters of the viscous component are
characterized by a slow velocity of ∼6×10−3 c and a low opacity
environment, κ ∼ 0.5 cm2 g−1. On the other hand, the neutrino-
driven wind mass is overestimated compared with aftermath compu-
tations presented in Ref. (Perego et al. 2017a), in order to compen-
sate the lack of overall ejected mass due to the absence of a dynami-
cal component. Moreover, the neutrino-driven wind is characterized
by a realistic velocity of ∼0.1 c, and by a low-opaque environment,
κ ∼ 1 cm2 g−1."
"Regarding the extrinsic parameters, the ANI-VN model is the case
that gives the best agreement with Ref. (Korobkin et al. 2012) in
terms of heating factor. The distance, instead, is recovered around
∼20 Mpc, underestimating the GW distance (Abbott et al. 2017a).
This result could be explained by the lower amount of total ejected
mass and by the lower heating rate compared with the other cases
(see Tab. 3): this lack generates fainter kN that biases the source
to appears closer to the observer in order to fit the data. The TNifloor
parameter takes lower values (∼3300 K) comparing with the ANI-
DV case (∼5000 K), since the model has to fit the data employing a
polar geometry (N) instead of an equatorial ejecta (D). The viewing
angle is biased toward larger values, roughly ∼50 deg, inconsistent
with GRB expectations (Abbott et al. 2017c; Savchenko et al. 2017)."
4.3.6 ANI-DVN
"This is the model that gives the largest evidence, within the provided
prior bounds. Regarding the dynamical and viscous ejecta compo-
nents, the general features are similar to the one of the ANI-DV
case. The dynamical ejected mass is slightly overestimated compar-
ing with NR simulations (Perego et al. 2019; Nedora et al. 2019;
Endrizzi et al. 2020; Nedora et al. 2021; Bernuzzi et al. 2020) of a
factor ∼2. The dynamical component is described by a low opac-
ity environment for high-latitudes (κhigh ∼ 0.1 cm2 g−1) and high
opacity for low-latitudes (κlow ∼ 11 cm2 g−1), in agreement with
NR simulations (Perego et al. 2019; Nedora et al. 2019; Endrizzi
et al. 2020; Nedora et al. 2021; Bernuzzi et al. 2020). These results
approximately agree also with other observational estimations (e.g.,
Villar et al. 2017b; Cowperthwaite et al. 2017; Abbott et al. 2017d;
Coughlin et al. 2018) Furthermore, the ‘D’ component results into
the fasted ejected shell, validating the interpretation that this contri-
bution is generated at dynamic time-scales. On the other hand, the
viscous ejecta is characterized by an average opacity ∼3 cm2 g−1
and by low velocity∼3×10−3 c, an order of magnitude smaller then
the one of the dynamical ejecta. These results agree with the stud-
ies presented in Ref. (Radice et al. 2018c) and they contribute to the
LCs in the optical band."
"Regarding the neutrino-driven wind, the posterior distribution for
its ejected mass m(N) shows a bimodality and this degeneracy cor-
relates with the heating rate parameter �0. This behavior can be seen
in Fig. (7), that shows the marginalized posterior distribution for �0
and for the total ejected mass Mej, defined as"
"Mej =
∑"
"k=D,N,V"
"m
(k)
, (14)"
"where the index k runs over all the involved components. The
marginalized posterior distribution for m(N) has its dominat peak in
proximity of 2.5×10−3 M�, while the secondary mode is located
slightly below 2×10−3 M�. Despite the bimodality, the recovered
values of m(N) are smaller compared with the same parameter ex-
tracted from the ANI-VN analysis. These results are largely consis-
tent with aftermath computations (Perego et al. 2014) and with the-
oretical expectations (Perego et al. 2017a), as it is for the recovered
velocity and opacity parameters."
"Furthermore, also for the ANI-DVN case, the viewing angle is
biased toward larger values, roughly ∼60 deg. The same trend
is shown by the anisotropic three-component model employed in
Ref. (Villar et al. 2017b). The posterior distribution for the TNifloor
parameter peaks around ∼6000 K, while, the temperature TLAfloor is
constrained around the lower bound, 500 K."
5 EOS INFERENCE
"The combination of gravitational and electromagnetic signals com-
ing from the same compact binary merger allows the possibility to
constrain more tightly the intrinsic properties of the system and the
nuclear EOS, in the context of both BNS (e.g., Radice & Dai (2019);
Radice et al. (2018b)) and black hole-NS mergers (e.g., Barbieri
et al. (2019)). In this section, we apply the information coming from
NR fitting formulae (Nedora et al. 2021, 2020) to the posterior dis-
tribution of the preferred kN model (ANI-DVN), in order to infer the
mass ratio and the reduced tidal parameter of the BNS source. Sub-
sequently, we combine the kN and GW results to derive constraints
on the radius R1.4 of an irrotational NS of 1.4 M�."

contribution is the largest source of error in the inference of (q, Λ̃)."
"The posterior distribution in the (q, Λ̃) plane as obtained from
the dynamical ejecta properties fitted to AT2017gfo data is shown
in Fig. 8. The measurement of the tidal parameter leads to Λ̃ =
900+310−780, with a bimodality in the marginalized posterior distribu-
tion, due to the quadratic nature of the employed NR formulae, with
modes Λ̃ ∼ 370 and Λ̃ ∼ 1000. The mass ratio is constrained to
be lower than 1.54 at the 90% confidence level. The uncertainties of
these estimations are larger than those of the GW analyses (Abbott
et al. 2017a, 2019a; Gamba et al. 2020a) and the principal source of
error is the uncertainty of the NR fit formulae."

tional constraints on the nuclear EOS, excluding both very stiff EOS,

2B."
"5.3 Incorporating information from electron fraction and disk
mass"
"We conduct two further analyses, in order to show that the contri-
bution of additional NR information can improve the previous esti-
mation. In the first case, we take into account the contribution of the
electron fraction; while, in the second, we include the information
on the disk mass. These studies are discussed in the following para-
graphs and they are intended to represent proofs-of-principle anal-
yses, since they involve extra assumptions on the ejecta parameters
and their relation with the EOS properties. A more accurate mapping
between these quantities will be discussed in a further study."
5.3.1 Electron fraction
"From NR simulations, it is possible to estimate the average elec-
tron fraction, Ye, of the dynamical ejecta (Nedora et al. 2021, 2020).
This quantity is the ratio of the net number of electrons to the nu-
mer of baryons and it is strictly related with the opacity of the
shell (Lippuner & Roberts 2015; Miller et al. 2019; Perego et al.
2019), since it mostly determines the nucleosynthesis yields in low
entropy, neutron-rich matter. We compute the average opacity κ̄ of a
shell as the integral of the opacity over the polar angle weighted on

eters (q, Λ̃), albeit with large uncertainties (Radice et al. 2018b,d;

slightly reinforces the constraint on the mass ratio posterior, giv-
ing the 90% confidence level for q = 1.18. The distribution of the

6 CONCLUSION
"In this paper, we have performed informative model selection on
kN observations within a Bayesian framework applied to the case
of AT2017gfo, the kN associated with the BNS merger GW170817.
We have then combined the posteriors obtained from the kN obser-
vation with the ones extracted from the GW signal and with NR-
based fitting formulae on the ejecta and remnant properties to set
tight constraints on the NS radius and EOS."
"From the analysis of AT2017gfo, the anisotropic description of
the ejecta components is strongly preferred with respect to isotropic
profiles, with a logarithmic Bayes’ factor of the order of ∼104.
Moreover, the favored model is the three-component kN constituted
by a fast dynamical ejecta (comprising both a red-equatorial and a
blue-polar portion), a slow isotropic shell and a polar wind. For the
best model, the dynamical ejected mass overestimates of a factor
two the theoretical expectation coming from NR simulations (Perego
et al. 2019; Nedora et al. 2019; Endrizzi et al. 2020; Nedora et al.
2021; Bernuzzi et al. 2020). These biases can be explained by con-
sidering the effect of the spiral-wave wind (Nedora et al. 2019) and
taking into account the correlations between the extrinsic parame-
ters. The recovered velocity of the dynamical component agrees with
NR simulations (Perego et al. 2019; Nedora et al. 2019; Endrizzi
et al. 2020; Nedora et al. 2021; Bernuzzi et al. 2020), reinforcing
the interpretation of this ejecta component. The intrinsic properties
of the dynamical ejecta component are in agreement with previous
results (Villar et al. 2017b; Coughlin et al. 2019). Regarding the sec-
ular winds, the neutrino-driven mass and velocity are compatible
with the calculations of Ref. (Perego et al. 2014, 2017a). The vis-
cous component is the slowest contribution and is broadly compati-
ble with the estimates of Ref. (Radice et al. 2018c), that are inferred
from NR and other disc simulations. The viewing angle resulting
from the preferred kN model is larger than the one deduced from
independent analysis (Abbott et al. 2017c; Savchenko et al. 2017;
Ghirlanda et al. 2019), and also different from the one obtained by
previous application of the same kN model (Perego et al. 2017a). In
the latter case, and differently from the present analysis, the profile
of the viscous ejecta was assumed to be mostly distributed across the"

"Under a modeling perspective, current kN description contains
large theoretical uncertainties, such as thermalization effects, heat-
ing rates and energy-dependent photon opacities, e.g. (Zhu et al.
2020). These effects propagate into systematic biases in the global
parameters of the model, as shown in the posterior distributions for
luminosity distance DL and heating rate parameter �0. Hence, the
development and the improvements of kN templates is an urgent
task in order to conduct reliable and robust analyses in the future."
"We use of the preferred kN model to constrain the properties of
the progenitor BNS and the EOS of dense, cold matter. Combining
the kN measurement with the information coming from NR simu-
lations, the ejecta properties are mapped in terms of mass ratio and
reduced tidal deformability of the binary progenitor. Subsequently,
this information is combined with the measurements of the GW data.
The joint kN+GW analysis constrains the reduced tidal parameter to
Λ̃ = 460+210−190 and the mass ratio of the BNS system to be lower than
1.27, at the 90% credible level. Furthermore, the joint analysis pre-
dicts a radius for a NS of 1.4 M� approximately ofR1.4 ≈ 12.2 km
with an uncertainty of ∼500 m at one-σ level. The R1.4 estimation
can be further improved including additional physical information
extracted from the kN model in the inferred model, such as the elec-
tron fraction of the dynamical ejecta and the mass of the disk around
the merger remnant. Figure 12 summarizes ours and the current esti-
mations ofR1.4 extracted from literature (Annala et al. 2018; Radice

2020; Jiang et al. 2020; Essick et al. 2020; Dietrich et al. 2020)."
"In addition to the kN modeling uncertainties discussed above, an-
other source of error of our estimates is the accuracy of the NR for-
mulae. The relations employed here used exclusively targeted data
and simulations with state-of-art treatment of microphysical EOS
and neutrino treatment (Perego et al. 2019; Nedora et al. 2019; En-
drizzi et al. 2020; Nedora et al. 2021; Bernuzzi et al. 2020). How-
ever, the simulation sample is limited to about hundrends of simu-
lations, with fitting errors that could be reduced by considering data
at even higher grid resolutions (Nedora et al. 2020). For example,
assuming all the fit formulae to be exact (i.e. removing all calibra-
tion terms), it will be possible to infer the Λ̃ parameter from a kN
observation with an accuracy of the order of 10, that corresponds to
a constraint on the radius R1.4 of roughly 100 m."
