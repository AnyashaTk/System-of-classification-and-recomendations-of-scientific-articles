ABSTRACT
We present bright [C ii] 158 µm line detections from a strongly magnified and multiply-imaged
"(µ ∼ 20–160) sub–L∗ (MUV = −19.75+0.55−0.44) Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) at z = 6.0719± 0.0004 from
the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS). Emission lines are identified at 268.7 GHz at ≥ 8σ exactly
at positions of two multiple images of the LBG behind the massive galaxy cluster RXCJ0600−2007.
Our lens models, updated with the latest spectroscopy from VLT/MUSE, indicate that a sub region of"
"the LBG crosses the caustic and is lensed into a long (∼ 6′′) arc with a local magnification of µ ∼ 160,
for which the [C ii] line is also significantly detected. The source-plane reconstruction resolves the"
"interstellar medium (ISM) structure, showing that the [C ii] line is co-spatial with the rest-frame UV"
"continuum at the scale of ∼300 pc. The [C ii] line properties suggest that the LBG is a rotation-
dominated system whose velocity gradient explains a slight difference of redshifts between the whole"
LBG and its sub region. The star formation rate (SFR)–L[CII] relations from the sub to the whole
regions of the LBG are consistent with those of local galaxies. We evaluate the lower limit of the faint-
"end of the [C ii] luminosity function at z = 6, and find that it is consistent with predictions from semi"
analytical models and from the local SFR–L[CII] relation with a SFR function at z = 6. These results
imply that the local SFR–L[CII] relation is universal for a wide range of scales including the spatially
"resolved ISM, the whole region of galaxy, and the cosmic scale, even in the epoch of reionization."

1. INTRODUCTION
Galaxy evolution is regulated by several key mech-
anisms in the interstellar medium (ISM) such as disk
"formation, stellar and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feed-"
"back, mass building via star formation and galaxy merg-"
"ers, and clump formations through disk instabilities. Re-"
solving the ISM structure to study local physical prop-
erties in high-redshift galaxies is thus essential in order
to understand the initial phase of galaxy formation and
evolution.
"During the past decades, hundreds of star-forming"
galaxies at z > 6 have been spectroscopically identified
"mainly with Lyα lines (e.g., Iye et al. 2006; Vanzella"
"et al. 2011; Pentericci et al. 2011, 2014, 2018; Shibuya"
"et al. 2012, 2018; Ono et al. 2012, 2018; Finkelstein"
"et al. 2013; Oesch et al. 2015, 2016; Stark et al. 2017;"
Higuchi et al. 2019). The Atacama Large Millime-
ter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) offers a rest-frame far-
infrared (FIR) spectroscopic window for these z > 6
"galaxies, especially with bright fine-structure lines of"
"[C ii] 158 µm and [O iii] 88 µm (e.g., Maiolino et al."
2015; Inoue et al. 2016; Pentericci et al. 2016; Knudsen
"et al. 2016; Matthee et al. 2017, 2019; Carniani et al."
2018; Smit et al. 2018; Bowler et al. 2018; Hashimoto
"et al. 2018, 2019; Tamura et al. 2019; Fujimoto et al."
2019; Bakx et al. 2020). Since heavy elements produced
"in stars are returned into the ISM, the metal gas prop-"
erties traced by the fine-structure lines are good probes
of the star-formation history and related physical mech-
"anisms (Maiolino & Mannucci 2019). In fact, recent"
ALMA spatial and kinematic [C ii]-line studies identify
"signatures of some key mechanisms, including disk rota-"
"tions (e.g., Jones et al. 2017; Smit et al. 2018), galaxy"
"mergers (e.g., Hashimoto et al. 2019; Le Fèvre et al."
"2020), and outflows (e.g., Gallerani et al. 2018; Spilker"
"et al. 2018; Fujimoto et al. 2019, 2020b; Ginolfi et al."
2020). In conjunction with other fine-structure lines of
"[O iii] and [N ii], recent ALMA observations also allow"
us to perform multiple line diagnostics to constrain the
"dominant ionization state of the ISM gas (e.g., Inoue"
et al. 2016; Pavesi et al. 2016; Laporte et al. 2019; No-
vak et al. 2019; Harikane et al. 2020).
There are several challenges related to the FIR spec-
troscopy. The first is sensitivity. While ALMA is
the most sensitive mm/submm telescope and yielding a
large number of new findings about high-redshift galax-
"ies, the detection of FIR fine-structure lines from abun-"
"dant, typical galaxies remains challenging. For exam-"
"ple, to observe a [C ii] line of ∼ 1× 108 L� from z = 6,
about 2-hour observing time is required1. However, such"
a source typically falls in the absolute UV magnitude
"range of MUV ∼ −22.0 – −21.5 mag (see e.g., Table 7
in Hashimoto et al. 2019). This absolute UV magnitude"
"1 Based on CASA Observing Tool calculations to detect the [C ii]
line of 1 ×108 L� with a line width of 200 km s−1 at ≥ 5σ in the
velocity integrated map."
Strongly lensed [C ii] line from a Sub-L∗ Lyman-break galaxy at z = 6.0719 3
"range is ∼ 2–3 times brighter than the characteristic lu-
minosity L∗ in the UV luminosity function at z > 6 (e.g.,"
"Ono et al. 2018), indicating that & 10-hour observing
time is necessary to study the abundant, typical galaxies"
with L∗ or sub-L∗ luminosities. The second challenge is
high spatial resolution observations towards these typi-
cal galaxies. Recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) stud-
ies report that the typical effective radius (re) in star-
forming galaxies at z > 6 is estimated to be < 1 kpc
"(' 0.′′2) (e.g., Holwerda et al. 2015; Shibuya et al. 2015;
Bouwens et al. 2017; Kawamata et al. 2018). The ISM"
structure mostly comparable to the re scale could be re-
solved by ALMA high-resolution observations down to
"the 0.′′02 scale. However, this requires even longer ob-"
"serving times than & 10 hours estimated above just for
the detection of the typical galaxies. The third challenge"
is the requirement of prior spectroscopic redshifts due
to the narrow frequency coverage of ALMA (7.5-GHz
"coverage in a single tuning), which may cause potential"
"biases. In most cases, the prior spectroscopic redshift"
is obtained from Lyα lines. While high-redshift galax-
ies with Lyα spectroscopic redshifts show weak [C ii]
lines at a given star-formation rate (Carniani et al. 2018;
"Harikane et al. 2018, 2020; cf. Schaerer et al. 2020), a"
recent study by Smit et al. (2018) indicates that galax-
ies with no strong Lyα line may emit a strong [C ii] line.
"Because the fraction of Lyα emitters (LAEs; e.g., equiv-"
alent width of Lyα > 25 Å ) is less than 30% among
"star-forming galaxies with MUV ∼ −21.5 mag at z > 6
(e.g., Stark et al. 2011; Treu et al. 2013; Tilvi et al. 2014;"
De Barros et al. 2017; Pentericci et al. 2018; Kusakabe
"et al. 2020), follow-up observations of galaxies only with"
secure Lyα lines will systematically miss a majority of
the representative population at z > 6. An ALMA blind
"line survey is one possible solution, but novel [C ii] line"
emitters z > 6 have not yet been identified due to the
"lack of sufficiently deep and large survey volumes (e.g.,"
Matsuda et al. 2015; Aravena et al. 2016; Yamaguchi
et al. 2017; Hayatsu et al. 2019; Yan et al. 2020; Ro-
mano et al. 2020; Decarli et al. 2020).
"In this paper, we report the blind detection of bright"
[C ii] 158-µm lines from strongly lensed multiple im-
ages of a sub-L∗ galaxy at z = 6.0719 behind the mas-
"sive galaxy cluster RXCJ0600−2007, drawn from ALMA
Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS). Making full use of large"
"ancillary data sets, including HST, Spitzer, and VLT"
"and with help of gravitational lensing magnification, we"
resolve the ISM structures and investigate the spatially
resolved rest-frame UV-to-FIR continuum and the [C ii]
"line properties down to a ' 300 pc scale. This is the first
ALMA study to resolve the ISM properties in a repre-"
sentative (' sub-L∗) galaxy in the epoch of reionization.
The structure of this paper is as follows. In Sec-
"tion 2, we overview the ALCS survey and the data sets"
"in RXCJ0600−2007 as well as strong lensing mass mod-
els of the cluster. Section 3 outlines methods of the"
blind line identification and optical–near infrared (NIR)
properties of the two [C ii] line emitters at z = 6.07. In
"Section 4, we report and discuss intrinsic characteristics"
of these two [C ii] line emitters with the correction of the
lensing magnification. A summary of this study is pre-
"sented in Section 5. Throughout this paper, we assume"
the Chabrier initial mass function (Chabrier 2003) and
"a flat universe with Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, σ8 = 0.8, and"
"H0 = 70 km s
−1 Mpc−1. We use magnitudes in the AB"
system (Oke & Gunn 1983).
2. DATA AND REDUCTION
2.1. ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey
ALCS is a cycle-6 ALMA large program (Project ID:
2018.1.00035.L; PI: K. Kohno) to map a total of 88-
arcmin2 high-magnification regions in 33 massive galaxy
clusters at 1.2-mm in Band 6. The sample is selected
from the best-studied clusters drawn from HST treasury
"programs, i.e., the Cluster Lensing And Supernova Sur-"
"vey with Hubble (CLASH; Postman et al. 2012), Hubble"
"Frontier Fields (HFF; Lotz et al. 2017), and the Reion-"
ization Lensing Cluster Survey (RELICS; Coe et al.
2019). Observations were carried out between December
2018 and December 2019 in compact array configura-
tions of C43-1 and C43-2 fine tuned to recover strongly
"lensed (i.e., spatially elongated), low surface brightness"
sources. The 1.2-mm mapping is accomplished with a
15-GHz wide spectral scan in the ranges of 250.0–257.5
GHz and 265.0–272.5 GHz via two frequency setups
to enlarge the survey volume for line-emitting galaxies.
"The spectral mode of Time Division Mode is used, which"
"achieves the spectral resolution of ∼28 km s−1 through
these frequency setups. A full description of the survey"
and of its main objectives will be presented in a separate
paper (in preparation).
"2.2. RXCJ0600−2007
RXCJ0600−2007 is a massive (∼ 1015M�) galaxy"
cluster at z = 0.43 that is included in RELICS and was
firstly identified in the Massive Cluster Survey (MACS;
"Ebeling et al. 2001). As a part of ALCS, the ALMA ob-"
"servations for RXCJ0600−2007 were performed in Jan-
uary 2019, mapping the central area of 230′′×90′′ in 105
pointings with 46–49 12-m antennae providing baselines"
of 15–456 m under a precipitable water vapor (PWV)
of 0.6–1.3 mm. J0522-3627 was observed as a flux cali-
brator. The bandpass and phase calibrations were per-
formed with J0609-1542.

best-fit single Gaussian."
The ALMA data were reduced and calibrated with the
Common Astronomy Software Applications package ver-
sion 5.4.0 (casa; McMullin et al. 2007) with the pipeline
script in the standard manner. With the CASA task
"tclean, continuum maps were produced by utilizing"
all spectral windows. The tclean routines were exe-
cuted down to the 3σ level. We adopted a pixel scale
of 0.′′15 and a common spectral channel bin of 30 km
s−1. The natural-weighted map achieved a synthesized
"beam FWHM of 1.′′22 × 0.′′95 with sensitivities in the
continuum and the line in a 30-km s−1 width channel"
"of 56.9 and 932 µJy beam−1, respectively. We also pro-"
duced several uv-tapered maps in a parameter range of
"0.′′8×0.′′8 to 1.′′8×1.′′8 to obtain spatially integrated prop-
erties when necessary. Throughout the paper, we used"
the natural-weighted map unless mentioned otherwise.
HST/ACS–WFC3 and Spitzer/IRAC observations
were carried out as a part of RELICS (Coe et al. 2019)
"and Spitzer-RELICS (Strait et al. 2020) surveys, respec-"
tively. HST images were obtained in the F606W (2180
"s), F814W (3565 s), F105W (1411 s), F125W (711 s),"
"F140W (736 s), and F160W (1961 s) filters. The IRAC"
channel 1 (3.6 µm) and channel 2 (4.5 µm) integrations
are approximately 10 hours each. We aligned all of the
HST exposures to sources in the PanSTARRS (DR1)
catalog (Chambers et al. 2016; Flewelling et al. 2016)—
which we verified is consistent with the GAIA DR2
(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) astrometric frame—
and created final mosaics in a common pixel frame
with 50 mas and 100 mas pixels for the ACS/WFC and
WFC3/IR filters respectively. We aligned the individ-
ual Spitzer exposures to the same astrometric frame and
generated final drizzled IRAC mosaics with a pixel scale
of 0.′′5. Further details of the HST (Spitzer) image pro-
cessing with the grizli (golfir) software will be pre-
"sented in Kokorev et al. (in prep). In Figure 1, we"
present the false-color HST image of RXCJ0600−2007.

VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopy of the
"RXCJ0600−2007 field was obtained on 26th January
2018 (ESO program ID 0100.A-0792, P.I.: A. Edge)."
The 0.8-hour observation was split in three exposures
"of 970 seconds each, centered on the brightest cluster"
galaxy (BCG) covering 1 arcmin2 of the cluster core. We
use the standard MUSE reduction pipeline version 2.8.1
(Weilbacher et al. 2014) to create the final data-cube. In
"this process, we used the self-calibration method based"
on the MUSE Python Data Analysis Framework (Ba-
con et al. 2016; Piqueras et al. 2017) and implemented
"in this version of the reduction pipeline. Finally, we ap-"
"plied the Zurich Atmosphere Purge (ZAP, Soto et al."
2016) to remove the sky residuals that were not com-
pletely removed by the MUSE pipeline.
We used the MUSE data cube to build our redshift
"catalog in two steps, similar to Caminha et al. (2017,"
2019). We first extracted the spectra of all sources de-
"tected in the HST imaging, and in a second step, we"
performed a blind search for faint-line emitters. This
"procedure allowed us to measure 76 secure redshifts, of"
which 16 are emission from galaxies behind the clus-
ter. This redshift catalogue was used to identify cluster
members and multiply imaged galaxies that were used
in strong lens mass modeling (see Section 3.3 for more
"details). In Appendix A, we summarize the full spectro-"
scopic sample from MUSE.
3. DATA ANALYSIS
3.1. Line Identification
We conduct a blind line search in the ALMA data
cubes with the channel widths of 30 km s−1 and 60 km
"s−1. First, we produce three-dimensional signal-to-noise"
ratio (S/N) cubes by dividing each channel with its stan-
dard deviation. Here we use the ALMA data cubes be-
fore the primary beam correction. We then search line
candidates in the three-dimensional S/N cube by utiliz-
ing a python-base software of dendrogram (Goodman
et al. 2009) whose algorithm is similar to clumpfind
"(Williams et al. 1994). In dendrogram, we obtain"
an initial candidate catalog of line sources that meet
the following criteria: at least 10 pixels and/or channels
"with a pixel value of ≥ 2 (i.e., S/N ≥ 2). Performing
the same procedure in the negative peaks in the S/N"
"cubes under the assumption that the noise is Gaussian,"
dendrogram evaluates the reliability of the initial line
candidates based on the positive and negative proper-
"ties of the peak S/N histograms, spatially integrated"
"pixel values, and the channel width. This results in"
"two reliable, bright line emitters both at ∼ 268.7 GHz."

We note that these two lines are also robustly identi-
fied with an independent blind line search method of
"González-López et al. (2017). Based on morphological,"
"redshift, and gravitational lens properties of these two"
line emitters obtained in detail analyses in the following
"subsections (Section 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4), we refer to these"
two line emitters as z6.1/6.2 (=z6.1 and z6.2) and z6.3
throughout this paper.
"In Figure 1, we present the ALMA spectra and the"
"velocity-integrated intensity (i.e., moment 0) maps of"
z6.1/6.2 and z6.3. z6.1/6.2 shows an elongated mor-
phology with two peaks in the moment 0 map. Al-
though there is a possibility that a combination of the
diffuse continuum and the noise fluctuation causes mul-
"tiple peaks (e.g., Hodge et al. 2016), we confirm in Ap-"
pendix B that the two peaks in z6.1/6.2 are not caused
by this combination through a realistic simulation. A
single Gaussian fit to z6.1/6.2 and z6.3 in the line spec-
tra is summarized in Table 1. Although we obtain con-
sistent full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) values for
"the line widths between z6.1/6.2 and z6.3, their fre-"
"quency peaks are slightly different by 69 ± 22 km s−1.
After integrating over a velocity range of 1.5 × FWHM,
z6.1/6.2 and z6.3 have S/N values of 9.2 and 8.0 at the"
"peak pixels, respectively. A single elliptical Gaussian fit"
"over a spatial area of 6′′ × 6′′ in the velocity-integrated
maps with the CASA task of imfit yields deconvolved"
"spatial FWHM sizes of 4.′′24× 0.′′82 and 1.′′17× 0.′′29 for
z6.1/6.2 and z6.3, respectively. To obtain the integrated"
"property, here we use a uv-tapered (1.′′0× 1.′′0) map for
z6.1/6.2 in imfit. From line free channels, the contin-"
"uum is also detected in the uv-tapered map (2.′′0× 2.′′0)
at 4.5σ and 2.5σ level from z6.1/6.2 and z6.3, respec-"
tively. We also summarize the imfit results and the
continuum flux density in Table 1. Further analyses for
the continuum emission are presented in N. Laporte et
al. (submitted).
3.2. Optical-NIR Counterparts
"The bright lines of z6.1/6.2 and z6.3 at ∼268.7 GHz
could be CO or [C ii] (e.g., Decarli et al. 2020). To deter-"
"mine which line corresponds to z6.1/6.2 and z6.3, we in-"
vestigate their optical to near-infrared (NIR) properties.
"In the top panel of Figure 2, we show optical-NIR HST"
images around z6.1/6.2 and z6.3. From the line peak
"positions, we identify clear counterparts in the optical-"
"NIR images within a spatial offset of ∼ 0.′′1 for both
z6.1/6.2 and z6.3. Both counterparts have a noticeable"
"dropout feature blueward of ∼ 1µm, and the one near
z6.1/6.2 shows a highly elongated shape aligned with the"
elongated shape in the 268.684-GHz line. In the highly
"elongated object near z6.1/6.2, we identify a compact"
source at the center whose optical-NIR color is distinct
from the other parts of the elongated object and indica-
tive of an overlapping foreground object by chance. We
carefully model and subtract this foreground object (see
Appendix C) to study the elongated object near z6.1/6.2
"in the following analysis. In the northeast from z6.3, we"
also identify a nearby compact object. This has a pho-
"tometric redshift of 0.50+0.05−0.32 (Kokorev et al. in prep.),"
presumably one of the member galaxies of RXCJ0600-
"2007 (z = 0.43), but does not affect the photometry of"
We conduct optical-NIR photometry and spectral en-
ergy distribution (SED) analyses for these counterparts.
We perform the aperture photometry and summarize re-
sults in Table 2. The detail procedure of the aperture
photometry is described in Appendix C. With the aper-
"ture photometry results, we conduct SED fitting using"
the eazy code (Brammer et al. 2008)2. We fit the photo-
metric flux densities and their uncertainties with linear
combinations of templates derived following Brammer
et al. (2008) but adopting Flexible Stellar Population
Synthesis models as the basis (Conroy et al. 2009; Con-
roy & Gunn 2010). We adopt the dust attenuation law
"of Kriek & Conroy (2013) with δ = 0 (i.e., a Calzetti"
et al. 2000 shape with an additional 2175 Å dust fea-
ture).
"In Figure 2, we show probability distributions of pho-"
tometric redshifts for the optical-NIR counterparts of
z6.1/6.2 and z6.3. We find that z6.1/6.2 and z6.3 both
"have peak probabilities close to z = 6.0, in excellent"
"agreement with the bright-line detection at ∼ 268.7 GHz
if it is the [C ii] 158 µm line at z = 6.07. In this case,"
"observed line luminosities Lline (i.e., without the correc-"
tion of the lensing magnification) are estimated to be
"4.5 ± 0.4 ×109 L� and 2.3 ± 0.2 ×109 L� for z6.1/6.2
and z6.3, respectively. With a standard modified black-"
body at z = 6 with a peak dust temperature Td = 38
"K (e.g., Faisst et al. 2020) and a dust emissivity index"
"βd = 1.8 (e.g., Chapin et al. 2009; Planck Collaboration"
"et al. 2011), we also obtain the observed values of rest-"
"frame FIR luminosities LFIR to be 5.8 ± 1.3 ×1011 L�
and 3.3 ± 1.3 ×1011 L� and subsequently line to rest-
frame FIR luminosity ratios to be 7.8 ×10−3 and 6.8
×10−3, for z6.1/6.2 and z6.3, respectively. These ratios
are consistent with the typical range of the [C ii] line"
L[CII] and LFIR ratio (L[CII]/LFIR) among local galaxies
"(e.g., Brauher et al. 2008; Dı́az-Santos et al. 2013), which"
"also supports the bright lines at ∼ 268.7 GHz being the

frame UV (LUV) and LFIR following the work of Bell

Although the z6.3 solution shows a small non-zero prob-
"ability of being at z ∼ 1, we also identify a 3.6-µm excess
feature in both z6.1/6.2 and z6.3 which is often observed"
"in z ∼ 6 galaxies due to the contamination of the strong
[O iii]λ5007 and Hβ lines (e.g., Roberts-Borsani et al."
"2016; Harikane et al. 2018). Therefore, the high-z so-"
"lution at z ∼ 6 is likely favored. Other possibilities
for the bright line along with the high-z solution might"
be CO(16-15) at z = 5.85 and CO(17-16) at z = 6.28.
"However, recent ALMA studies derive constraints on ra-"
"tios of LCO(16−15)/LFIR and LCO(17−16)/LFIR . 3×10−4
among luminous quasars at similar redshifts (Carniani"
et al. 2019). This indicates that Lline/LFIR of z6.1/6.2
and z6.3 are nearly 1.5-dex higher than the typical
"range, strongly disfavoring the possibilities of CO(16-15)
and CO(17-16) lines. We thus conclude that z6.1/6.2"
and z6.3 are [C ii] line emitters at z = 6.07. Note that
we confirm that the [C ii] line solution is further sup-
"ported by the lens models, intrinsic physical properties"
"(see Section 3.4 and 3.5), and follow-up Gemini/GMOS"
spectroscopy (N. Laporte et al. submitted).
"Based on the redshift of z = 6.07, we also examine"
the Lyα line in the MUSE data cube around z6.1/6.2
and z6.3. We do not identify any Lyα features neither
around z6.1/6.2 nor z6.3. With the rest-frame UV lumi-
"nosity, this provides 3σ upper limits of the Lyα equiv-"
alent width (EWLyα) at 4.4 Å and 3.7 Å for z6.1/6.2
"and z6.3, respectively. Given the dust continuum de-"
"tection and the redshift, the absence of the bright Lyα"
line would be ascribed to dust and/or neutral hydrogen
in interstellar and intergalactic media. This emphasizes
the importance of the ALMA blind line search which
enable studies of galaxies irrespective of their Lyα line
properties in particular in the epoch of reionization.
3.3. Mass Model
To study intrinsic physical properties of the [C ii]
"line emitters z6.1/6.2 and z6.3, we construct several"
mass models for the galaxy cluster RXCJ0600–2007
"(z = 0.430), using independent algorithms including"
"glafic (Oguri 2010), Lenstool (Jullo et al. 2007), and"
Light-Traces-Mass (LTM; Zitrin et al. 2015). Multiple
images are selected based on the morphology and col-
"ors of galaxies in the HST images taken with RELICS,"
guided by y mass models. These models also exploit the
MUSE spectroscopic redshift catalog (see Section 2.2)
for redshift information of some multiple image systems
as well as secure identifications of cluster member galax-
ies. These models adopt nearly identical sets of multi-
ple image systems for constructing the mass models and
provide almost consistent predictions for multiple image
positions and magnification factors. A brief summary of
these mass models is also presented in N. Laporte et al.
"(submitted), while full details will be given in a sepa-"
"rate paper (in preparation). In this paper, we adopt the"
mass model of glafic as a fiducial model for our anal-
"yses and here describe its construction below, although"
we also use results of Lenstool and LTM models to
evaluate uncertainties in magnification factors.
We construct the mass model with glafic in the same
manner as in Kawamata et al. (2016). Our mass model
consists of cluster-scale halos and cluster member galax-
ies. We place the cluster-scale halos at the positions of
the three brightest cluster member galaxies in the core of
the cluster. The position of one of the three cluster-scale
"halos is treated as a free parameter, whereas those of"
the other two cluster-scale halos are fixed to the galaxy
positions. The cluster-scale halos are modeled by an el-
"liptical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW; e.g., Navarro et al."
1997) profile. The cluster member galaxies are selected
using both photometric redshifts of galaxies measured

Carlo method. Our best fitting model has χ2 = 20.0 for
17 degree of freedom. Interested readers are referred to
Kawamata et al. (2016) for more specific mass modeling
procedures using glafic.
Note that we do not include the foreground object
"overlapping z6.1/6.2 in our mass models, because of the"
absence of its spectroscopic redshift. We will discuss
the potential contribution of the foreground object to
the morphology and magnification factor of z6.1/6.2 in
Section 4.1.
3.4. Multiple Images
"From all of our mass models, we consistently obtain"
the following two predictions: i) z6.1/6.2 consists of a
"pair of two multiple images of a galaxy at z ∼ 6 be-
hind RXCJ0600-2007, and ii) z6.1/6.2 and z6.3 are also"
multiple images of the galaxy. The prediction of ii) is
consistent with the [C ii] morphology that has two close
"peaks. In fact, we confirm in Appendix D that [C ii] line"
spectra produced at these two peaks show line profiles
"consistent with each other. In addition, almost the same"
optical-NIR SED shapes between z6.1/6.2 and z6.3 in
Figure 2 support the prediction of ii). Although we iden-
tify the slight velocity shift between z6.1/6.2 and z6.3
"by 69 ± 22 km s−1 (see Section 3.1), the offset is much
smaller than the typical FWHM range of the [C ii] line"
"among z ∼ 4–6 galaxies evaluated in the ALPINE survey
(∼120–380 km s−1; Béthermin et al. 2020), suggesting
that the slight velocity shift is explained by the differ-"
ential magnification at different regions of the galaxy.
We thus interpret z6.1/6.2 and z6.3 as multiple images
of the [C ii] line emission at z = 6.07 from a Lyman-
break galaxy (LBG) behind RXCJ0600-2007. Hereafter
we refer to the background LBG as RXCJ0600-z6.
"Subsequently, the different models also predict two"
"additional multiple images of RXCJ0600-z6, the posi-"
"tions of which we present in Figure 1, where we identify"
corresponding optical-NIR objects. We refer to these
potential multiple images as z6.4 and z6.5. Note that
different mass models predict a consistent position for
"z6.4, while they predict different positions for z6.5 with"
"a scatter in a ∼ 12′′ scale. In this paper, we focus an
optical-NIR object as z6.5 predicted by one of our mass"
"models, but it should be regarded as tentative, as we"
will discuss below.
To investigate whether multi-wavelength properties of
these potential multiple images are similar to z6.1/6.2
"and z6.3, we conduct the aperture photometry for z6.4"
and z6.5 in the optical-NIR bands. The detail proce-
dure of the aperture photometry is again described in
"Appendix C. In Table 2 and Figure 3, we summarize"
the photometry results and the optical-NIR colors nor-
"malized by the photometry at the F125W band, respec-"
tively. We find that z6.4 and z6.5 have similar optical-
"NIR SEDs with z6.1/6.2, z6.3 within the errors, consis-"
tent with our mass model predictions as multiple images
"at z ∼ 6. We further perform the optical-NIR SED fit-
ting to z6.4 and z6.5 in the same manner as z6.1/6.2"
"and z6.3. In Figure 2, we also show the optical-NIR"
SED fitting results of z6.4 and z6.5. While the z6.4
"photometry also allows for a z ∼ 6 solution, the possi-
bility of much lower redshifts cannot be excluded due to"
the large uncertainties from its faint property and the
potential contamination of the nearby BCG (see Ap-
pendix C.3). z6.5 has a well-localized peak probability
"at z ∼ 6, though the HST-Spitzer color of z6.5 is much
bluer than seen for the bright images z6.1/6.2 and z6.3."
"In fact, an IRAC source at the location of z6.5 should"
be easily detected if it has with the same color as those
of the other images.
"Because z6.4 falls in the ALCS area coverage, we also"
examine whether the [C ii] line emission is detected from
z6.4 with a frequency consistent with z6.1/6.2 and z6.3.
"In Figure 1, we also show the ALMA Band 6 spectrum of"
z6.4 based on an optimized aperture with a radius of 1.′′5.
We find that z6.4 has a tentative line detection (3.0σ) at
the consistent frequency with z6.1/6.2 and z6.3. More-
"over, z6.4 has an asymmetry line profile (the brighter"
peak at the higher frequency side) which is consistent
with the line profile of z6.3. These results strengthen

consistent SFR estimates of 188 ± 15 M� yr−1 and 120 ± 14 M� yr−1 for z6.1/6.2 and z6.3, respectively. Because the UV
luminosity dominates in both z6.1/6.2 and z6.3, a ±10 K difference in the Td assumption for the LFIR calculation (Section 3.2)
changes these SFR estimates by ∼ 0.1 dex.

µlocal = (observed luminosity of the multiple image) / (local luminosity of the strongly lensed, sub region near the caustic line),
where the sub region corresponds to the dashed rectangle area in Figure 4. The errors are evaluated from the minimum to
maximum range among our independent mass models."
the case that z6.4 is indeed one of the multiple images
of the background LBG.
"Based on these results, we find that the identification"
of z6.4 as one of the multiple images is relatively se-
cure from the consistent predictions of the mass models
as well as the line detection at the consistent frequency.
"On the other hand, from the different predicted positions"
among different mass models and the disagreements in
"the HST-Spitzer color with other multiple images, the"
interpretation of z6.5 being another multiple image is
not secure and should be taken with caution until a spec-
troscopic redshift is obtained in follow-up observations.
"We thus use the positions of z6.1/6.2, z6.3, and z6.4"
as constraints in deriving our best-fit mass models. We
present the critical curve at z = 6.07 from the best-fit
mass model of glafic in the left panel of Figure 1. We
summarize the [C ii] line properties and the SED fitting
results for all these multiple images in Table 1 and Table
"3, respectively."
3.5. Physical Properties of RXCJ0600-z6
The configuration of the multiple images is helpful to
obtain the precise information about the source posi-
tion and its surface brightness profile in the source plane.
Here we estimate the intrinsic two-dimensional (2D) sur-
face brightness profile by fitting the HST images assum-
"ing the fiducial mass model. Specifically, we first pro-"
"duce a 1.′′7 × 1.′′7 cutout HST/F160W image of z6.3.
With a single Sérsic profile model in the source plane,"
"we then obtain the best-fit effective radius re = 1.2

"nate of (RA, Decl.)=(6:00:08.12, −20:07:39.55) based on
standard χ2 minimization. Because we find a degener-"
"acy between re and n, here we restrict the Sérsic index"
to the range of 1 < n < 4 in the fitting. We do not use
z6.1/6.2 and z6.4 for the fitting due to the complicated
morphology and the contamination of the diffuse emis-
"sion from the nearby BCG, respectively. We note that"
here we ignore the clumpy structure of z6.3 for the mo-
"ment, which we will discuss later. We list these best-fit"
Sérsic profile results in Table 4.
"In Figure 4, we show the best-fit 2D Sérsic profile"
in the source plane and its multiple images in the im-
age plane. We find that a single Sérsic profile well
"reproduces not only z6.3, but also z6.4 and z6.1/6.2"
whose elongated shape is interpreted as a result of the
source crossing the caustic line in the source plane and
"stretched over ∼ 6′′ scale in the image plane (e.g.,
Vanzella et al. 2020). This interpretation is consistent"
with the slight difference in the line peak frequencies
and the line profiles between z6.1/6.2 and z6.3 (Sec-
"tion 3.1), because the sub region of the galaxy can have"
different kinematics properties compared to the whole
galaxy. By calculating the ratio of the spatial areas be-
"tween the source and image planes, the magnification"
factors for z6.1/6.2 and z6.3 in our fiducial model (av-
erage of the three independent models) are estimated to
"be ∼150 (163) and ∼35 (21), respectively. The observed
luminosity of z6.1/6.2 is 33 (29) times brighter than the"
intrinsic overall luminosity of RXCJ0600-z6 due to the
strong gravitational lensing effect near the caustic line.
By comparing physical properties of z6.3 and z6.4 that

"erties, we summarize the intrinsic physical properties"

"among z ∼ 6 galaxies estimated in Iyer et al. (2018)
(gray shaded region). We find that RXCJ0600-z6 falls"
on the average relation from the sub to whole regions.
We also find that the relation between the [C ii] line
width and luminosity in RXCJ0600-z6 agrees with the
average value among z ∼ 6 galaxies and the theoretical
prediction (see Figure 10 in Kohandel et al. 2019). The

"of 0.84 kpc also falls in a typical range among z ∼ 6
galaxies with the similar UV luminosity (see e.g., Fig-"

"that RXCJ0600-z6 is an abundant, representative sub-"

physical properties are consistent with independent es-
timates in N. Laporte et al. (submitted) within the er-
"rors, even though the SED fitting strategies are different"
due to the different scopes in the paper.

two-peak morphology in the image plane due to the per-
turbation by the foreground object overlapping z6.1/6.2
which is not included in our fiducial mass model. To
"check this possibility, we include the foreground object"
in our mass model assuming that it is a member galaxy
of the cluster (see Appendix C.2) and find that the two-
"peak structure can indeed be reproduced, if the mass"
associated with the foreground object is comparable or
larger than that expected from the scaling relation of
the luminosity and mass for cluster member galaxies
constrained in our mass modeling. We conclude that
we need more follow-up data including the spectroscopic
redshift of the foreground object in order to discriminate
these two possibilities. We however confirm that both
magnification factors of µlocal and µwhole for z6.1/6.2
"are affected only by ∼1–2 % even if we include the fore-
ground object in the mass model as one of the cluster"
"members or outside of the cluster up to z ∼ 4. The
other foreground object near z6.3 is classified as one of"
the member galaxies of the cluster (Section 3.2) and pre-
dicted to produce the critical curve at the southern east
part of z6.3 in our mass model (see the middle panel of
"Figure 4). However, we find that the [C ii] morphology"

gesting that its lensing effect is negligible for z6.3. We
thus remove this foreground object from the mass model
and the HST map with galfit in the source plane re-

"In the right panel of Figure 6, we present the source"
"plane reconstruction of z6.3 (whole region), where the"
inset panel displays the source plane reconstruction of
z6.1/6.2 (sub region). To match the spatial resolution
"between HST and ALMA, we create a [C ii] map from"
"the de-convolved [C ii] spatial distribution (Section 3.1),"
smooth it with the point spread function (PSF) of the
"HST F160W band, and use this PSF-matched map for"
the source plane reconstruction of the [C ii] line. In
"the right panel, the white ellipses indicate the source"
plane reconstruction of the HST PSF whose FWHM
"is decreased down to ∼ 200 × 100 pc and ∼ 300 × 60
pc around z6.3 and z6.1/6.2, respectively. The other"
color and symbols follow the same assignment as the
"left panel, where we apply the lens correction also to"
the error bars. The error bar of the [C ii] line peak po-
"sition in z6.3 (red square) is decreased down to ∼300
pc. These results indicate that we are able to map the"
ISM view down to a few hundred parsec scale. Note
that our independent mass models consistently suggest
that the two-peak morphology of z6.1/6.2 in the image
plane are the pair of multiple images (Section 3.3) re-
gardless of whether there exists the foreground object
"or not, which thus correspond to one peak in the source"
plane. We confirm that the entire morphology in both
whole and sub regions of the galaxy and the emission
peak positions does not change beyond the errors in the
source plane whether we include or not the foreground
galaxy overlapping z6.1/6.2 in the mass model as one of
the member galaxies of RXCJ0600-2007.
"Firstly from the reconstruction of z6.3, we find on the"
scale of the galaxy that [C ii] line peak shows an offset
"of ' 300 pc from the brightest rest-frame UV clump of
a, but they are consistent at the 1σ error level. With"
"the axis ratio of 0.49 (Table 4), non-parametric measure-"
ments directly on the surface brightness distributions in
the source plane provide re = 1.1 kpc and 2.6 kpc for
the rest-frame UV continuum and the [C ii] line emis-
"sion, respectively, showing the spatially extended [C ii]"
"gas structure by a factor of ∼ 2.4. These results are con-
sistent with the recent ALMA results of Fujimoto et al."
(2020b) for 23 individual normal star-forming galaxies
"at z ∼ 4–6, whereby generally the [C ii] line is spatially
more extended than the rest-frame UV continuum by"
"factors of ∼ 2–3 without a spatial offset beyond ' a 1-
kpc scale. The re value for the rest-frame UV continuum"
is also consistent with the Sérsic profile fitting results of
1.2 kpc in the source plane presented in Section 3.5.
"Secondly from the reconstruction of z6.1/6.2, we find"
in the sub region of the galaxy that the [C ii] line is co-
"spatial with the rest-frame UV continuum again, which"
"is separated by ∼ 1.6 kpc from the peak of the [C ii]
line and rest-frame UV continuum from the whole re-"
gion of the galaxy. We mark the luminosity-weighted
center of the sub region with the black cross labeled e.
"Remarkably, we find, in the independent rest-frame UV"
"continuum map reconstructed from z6.3, that the faint"
clump exists exactly at the position of e whose peak
flux density is also consistent. These agreements in the
properties of the clump e also support the robustness of
our best-fit mass models. We also find that the [C ii]
and rest-frame FIR peaks observed in the image plane
"are reconstructed in the source plane with a ' 1 kpc
offset from the luminosity-weighted center of e. This"
indicates that the faint diffuse emission or further faint
clump near the caustic line is strongly lensed and more
prominently visible in the image plane than the clump
e. Given that RXCJ0600-z6 is quantified with re = 1.2
"kpc in the rest-frame UV continuum (Section 3.5), these"
results indicate that we are witnessing very faint [C ii]
and rest-frame FIR emitting region(s) near the caustic
line beyond the effective radius of the galaxy that is
almost invisible in other multiple images. Because of
the poor significance level of the rest-frame FIR contin-
"uum in z6.3, we cannot conclude whether the rest-frame"
FIR continuum detected in z6.1/6.2 corresponds to the
Strongly lensed [C ii] line from a Sub-L∗ Lyman-break galaxy at z = 6.0719 15
outskirt emission of the whole galaxy or the localized
emission at the sub region of the galaxy.
"Interestingly, the brightest peaks of the [C ii] line and"
the rest-frame FIR continuum in z6.1/6.2 appear on
opposite sides in the image plane (Left bottom panel
"of Figure 6). In z6.1/6.2, the magnification factor is"
generally the same on either side. The clear difference
identified in the [C ii] line strength at the high signif-
icance levels (8.2σ and 5.4σ) suggests the existence of
substructure of the mass distribution along the line-of-
"sight of z6.1/6.2, which is so-called flux-ratio anomaly"
"(e.g., Mao & Schneider 1998). This is consistent with"
our interpretation that the central compact object in the
optical-NIR bands in z6.1/6.2 is the foreground object
which is responsible for this flux-ratio anomaly. How-
"ever, if the [C ii] and rest-frame FIR emitting regions are"
"identical in the source plane, the flux ratio should be the"
same between the [C ii] and rest-frame FIR emission in
the image plane. Although the current error bars of the
"spatial positions are large, this independent observable"
of the flux ratio suggests that the faint [C ii] and rest-
frame FIR emitting regions are physically offset in the
sub region of RXCJ0600-z6. This potential separation
and the detailed ISM structure in RXCJ0600-z6 must
be addressed in future deeper and higher-resolution ob-
servations.
4.2. Kinematics via [C ii]
We also examine the kinematics of RXCJ0600-z6 via
the bright [C ii] line emission. Here we focus on the
[C ii] kinematics of z6.3 to characterize the gas kine-
matics of the whole galaxy. In the left panel of Fig-
"ure 7, we present the velocity-integrated (top), velocity-"
"weighted (middle), and velocity-dispersion (bottom)"
maps of z6.3 in the image plane. We evaluate the root-
mean-square noise level from the data cube and cre-
ate these maps with a three-dimensional (3D) mask of
all signal above the 2σ level. We find that the [C ii]
"line has the velocity gradient from −100 to +45 km
s−1 in east south to west north with its intensity ex-"
"tended up to a radius of ∼ 1.′′4. Assuming the line
width estimate of z6.3 (Table 1) and a potential er-"
"ror of ∼30 km s−1 for the velocity gradient due to the
spectral resolution of our ALMA data cube (Section"
"2.1), we obtain ∆vobs/2σtot = 0.94± 0.26, where ∆vobs
and σtot are the full observed velocity gradient (uncor-"
rected for inclination) and the spatially-integrated ve-
"locity dispersion, respectively. With an approximate"
diagnostic for the classification of rotation-dominated
"and dispersion-dominated systems, ∆vobs/2σtot = 0.4"
"(Förster Schreiber et al. 2009), we find that z6.3 is"
classified as the rotation-dominated system. Note that
the beam smearing effect generally makes the veloc-
ity gradient [dispersion] underestimated [overestimated]
"in spatially low-resolution maps (see e.g., Figure 7 of"
Di Teodoro & Fraternali 2015). This strengthens the
argument that z6.3 is the rotation-dominated system
from the increased ∆vobs/2σtot value without the beam
smearing effect.
"To study the rotation kinematics, we analyze our data"
in the image plane with softwares of 3Dbarolo (Di
Teodoro & Fraternali 2015) and galpak3d (Bouché
et al. 2015) that are tools for fitting 3D models to
emission-line data cubes. In the left panel of Figure
"7, we also show the best-fit 3D model and residual maps"
with 3Dbarolo by assuming three annuli for its tilted
ring fitting algorithm. We find an excellent agreement
on the intensity map and that the residual velocities in
velocity-weighted and velocity-dispersion maps are gen-
erally less than the spectral resolution of our ALMA
"data cube (∼28 km s−1; Section 2.1). Although the
residual in the velocity dispersion is relatively large near"
"the edge of the mask, this is likely because the faint out-"
skirt emission near the edge is masked in some velocity
channels and the observed velocity dispersion is underes-
timated. These results suggest that the [C ii] kinematics
of z6.3 is well reproduced by the best-fit 3D model. We
confirm that an independent 3D modeling of a single ex-
ponential disk with galpak3d also provides the best-fit
"values of the rotation velocity, the velocity dispersion,"
and the inclination fully consistent within errors with
the 3Dbarolo results. We summarize the details for
the 3D modeling and the results in Appendix E.
"In the middle panel, we present the velocity-weighted"
map of z6.3 in the source plane via the reconstruction
in the same manner as Section 4.1. To understand the
"intrinsic picture without the beam smearing effect, here"
"we use the best-fit intrinsic (i.e., resolution free) map"
obtained from galpak3d for the reconstruction. In the
"right panel, we also show the [C ii] radial velocity ex-"
tracted from the three annuli with 3Dbarolo (black cir-
cle) as well as the best-fit (black line) and the 1σ error
(gray shade) of the rotation curve in the tanh formal-
ization obtained from galpak3d. The correction the
lensing magnification is applied to the radius scale. For
"comparison, the spatial and velocity offsets of z6.1/6.2"
are shown with the red triangle in both middle and right
panels. We find that z6.1/6.2 agrees with the velocity
"gradient of z6.3 within the errors, which is consistent"
with our interpretation that z6.1/6.2 is the sub region
of RXCJ0600-z6. This suggests that the clump e in the
sub region of the galaxy (Section 4.1) is likely a small
star-forming region within the rotation disk of the host
galaxy.

Note that we cannot rule out the possibility that the

4.3. SFR and L[CII] Relation

between SFR and L[CII] for z6.1/6.2 and z6.3. For com-
"parison, we also show local and high-redshift galaxy re-"
sults taken from the literature (Malhotra et al. 2001;

relation obtained from local star-forming galaxies in De
Looze et al. (2014). The observed L[CII] of both z6.3 and

FIR luminosity of Bell et al. (2005) scaled to the Chabrier IMF. The previous results from local to high-z star-forming galaxies
are shown with black circles (local LIRGs; Dı́az-Santos et al. 2013), black squares (local dwarfs; De Looze et al. 2014), black

a factor of 1.06 in the same manner as Schaerer et al. (2020). The arrow indicates the 3σ upper limit. The LFIR value in the

"tion, we find that both z6.3 and z6.1/6.2 fall slightly"
"above, but still likely follow the SFR–L[CII] relation of"
the local galaxies within the dispersion. This is consis-
tent with recent ALMA results that the average SFR–
L[CII] relation among high-redshift star-forming galaxies
"at z ∼ 4–9 is well within the intrinsic dispersion of the
local relation (Carniani et al. 2018, 2020; Schaerer et al."
2020). Given that RXCJ0600-z6 is consistent with be-
"ing an abundant, sub-L∗ galaxy at z = 6 (see Section"
"3.5), these results may suggest that the SFR–L[CII] rela-"
"tion, defined by local galaxies, holds from the spatially"
resolved sub-kpc ISM to the whole scales in abundant
galaxies even up to the epoch of reionization.
"To further study the L[CII]–SFR relation, the right"
panel of Figure 8 presents L[CII]/SFR and SFR surface
density (ΣSFR). This relation or another relation be-
tween L[CII]/LFIR and LFIR surface density (ΣLFIR) are
known to have tight anti-correlations where the deficit of
the [C ii] line is explained by the high ionization state in
"the ISM around regions with high ΣSFR or ΣLFIR (e.g.,"
Dı́az-Santos et al. 2013; Spilker et al. 2016; Gullberg
"et al. 2018; Ferrara et al. 2019). Importantly, these rela-"
"tions are not affected by the lensing magnification, be-"
18 Fujimoto et al.
cause the same magnification factor applies to all these
values. We find that z6.1/6.2 shows a higher L[CII]/SFR
"ratio, while both z6.1/6.2 and z6.3 are consistent with"
the trend of the anti-correlation. This indicates that the
difference of ΣSFR causes the difference of the [C ii] line
"luminosity at a given SFR between z6.1/6.2 and z6.3,"
which is likely consistent with the source plane recon-
struction results in Section 4.1: the faint [C ii]-emitting
region of z6.1/6.2 is separated from the bright rest-frame
"UV clumps by ∼1.6 kpc in the source plane, where the
ionization state of the local ISM is thought to be mod-"
erate.
We note that recent ALMA observations show non-
detection results of the [C ii] line from similarly star-
"forming galaxies at z ∼ 4–9 at the same time (see up-
per limits in Figure 8), indicative of the existence of"
galaxies whose L[CII]–SFR relations are different from
those of the local galaxies. Given the requirement of
prior spectroscopic redshift with the Lyα line in most
"cases (Section 3.2), those non-detections might be re-"
lated to recent reports of the potential anti-correlation
"between L[CII]/SFR and EWLyα (Harikane et al. 2018,"
2020; Carniani et al. 2018). In contrast to the most
"cases, RXCJ0600-z6 is identified in the blind survey"
"and its physical properties (rest-frame EWLyα < 4.4
Å ) agrees with the potential anti-correlation reported"
in Harikane et al. (2018). Another lensed galaxy at
z = 6.15 (Calura et al. 2021) also follows the similar
"trend with relatively large rest-frame EWLyα (60 ± 8
Å) and small L[CII]/SFR (∼ 2 × 105). A caution still
remains that Schaerer et al. (2020) report a weak de-"
pendence of L[CII]/SFR of EWLyα. Since the [C ii] line
emissivity depends on the ISM properties such as the
"ionization state, metallicity, and gas density (e.g., Vallini"
"et al. 2015), the different L[CII]–SFR relations could be"
alternatively explained by a larger dispersion of the ISM
properties in high-z galaxies than in local galaxies. The
uncertainties of the SFR estimates might contribute to
the large dispersion in high-z galaxies due to assump-
"tions of the star-formation history, the dust-attenuation"
"curve, and the stellar population age as discussed in Car-"
niani et al. (2020) and Schaerer et al. (2020). Another
recent reports of the extended [C ii] line morphology up
"to a radius of ∼10 kpc (e.g., Fujimoto et al. 2019, 2020b;
Ginolfi et al. 2020; Novak et al. 2020) might be also re-"
"lated to some of those non-detections, because the sur-"
face brightness of the extended emission is significantly
decreased in relatively high-resolution maps (Carniani
"et al. 2020). Based on the visibility-based stacking, the"
secondary extended component up to the 10-kpc scale is
estimated to have the average contribution to the total
line luminosity of ∼ 50 % around star-forming galax-
"ies (Fujimoto et al. 2019) and ∼ 20% around quasars
(Novak et al. 2020) at z ∼ 6. These non-negligible con-
tributions could matter if the request sensitivity is close"
"to the detection limit around the 5σ level. However, this"
is not the case if the carbon in the extended [C ii] gas is
ionized by such as the gravitational energy in the cold
"stream, the shock heating in the outflow and/or inflow"
"gas, and the AGN feedback, instead of the photoion-"
"ization powered from the star-forming regions (see e.g.,"
Section 5 of Fujimoto et al. 2019).
4.4. [C ii] Luminosity Function
A key goal of ALCS is to constrain the number density
of the line emitters. Although the complete blind line
survey results with all 33 fields will be presented in a
"separate paper (in preparation), we can evaluate a lower"
"limit of the [C ii] luminosity function at z ∼ 6 with our
[C ii] line detection from the strongly lensed LBG at"
z = 6.0719.
"To do this, we first measure the effective survey area"
"using mass models for all 33 ALCS clusters at z ∼ 6
constructed in the same manner as described in Section"
"3.3. After the correction of the lensing magnification,"
"we obtain an effective survey area of ∼ 49 (2) arcmin2
at L[CII] = 1.0× 109 (108) L�, assuming the line width
of FWHM=200 km s−1 with the 5σ detection limit. We"
then convert the effective survey area to the survey vol-
"ume, based on the frequency setup in the ALCS observa-"
tions covering the [C ii] line emission at z = 5.974–6.172
"and 6.381–6.602, and derive a lower limit of the [C ii]"
luminosity function at z = 6.
"In Figure 9, we present the number density of [C ii]"
"line emitters at z = 6, including recent [C ii] line studies"
at z > 4 (Swinbank et al. 2012; Matsuda et al. 2015;
Yamaguchi et al. 2017; Cooke et al. 2018; Hayatsu et al.
2019; Yan et al. 2020; Decarli et al. 2020). For com-
"parison, we also present [C ii] luminosity functions from"
semi-analytical models (Popping et al. 2016; Lagache
et al. 2018) and from the observed SFR function (SFRF;
Smit et al. 2016) of optically-selected galaxies. For the
"conversion from SFRF to [C ii] luminosity function, we"
adopt the [C ii]–SFR relation of the local star-forming
galaxies estimated in De Looze et al. (2014). We find
that our lower limit estimate is consistent with both the
semi-analytical results and SFRF. Note that we do not
apply any completeness corrections to our lower limit es-
timate. The incompleteness for strongly lensed sources
with large spatial sizes is generally significant due to its
"low surface brightness (e.g., Bouwens et al. 2017; Kawa-"
mata et al. 2018; Fujimoto et al. 2017). Although the in-
completeness largely depends on the assumption of the
"intrinsic source size, this may indicate that the lower"

and previous results so far obtained. For comparison, we also
present semi-analytical model results (Popping et al. 2016;
Lagache et al. 2018) and SFR function (SFRF; Smit et al.
2016), including the dust correction based on the SMC ex-
tinction law, whose SFR value is converted into L[CII] with
the local [C ii]–SFR relation (De Looze et al. 2014)."
limit could be placed still higher and that the faint-
end of the [C ii] luminosity function might be close to
"SFRF. Indeed, other constraints from the recent [C ii]"
line studies are also consistent with SFRF at the bright
"regime (L[CII] & 10
8.5 L�). Although the brightest-end"
"(L[CII] & 10
9.2 L� ) of SFRF is smaller than the con-"
straints obtained from the SMG studies (Cooke et al.
"2018), this is explained by the absence of such dusty-"
obscured galaxies in the SFRF based on the optically-
"selected galaxies. Therefore, the constraints of the [C ii]"
luminosity function so far obtained are likely consistent
with the prediction from the local SFR–L[CII] relation
and the SFRF at z = 6.
4.5. From ISM to Cosmic Scales
The source plane reconstruction in Section 4.1 unveils
"the ISM structure down to a few hundred parsec scales,"
"where we find that [C ii] line is not displaced beyond a ∼
300-pc from the rest-frame UV continuum from the spa-"
"tially resolved ISM to the whole galaxy. In Section 4.3,"
we find that the SFR–L[CII] relations from the spatially
resolved ISM to the whole galaxy are consistent with
"those of local galaxies. In Section 4.4, we obtain the"
lower limit at the faintest regime of the z = 6 [C ii]
luminosity function. We find that the prediction from
the z = 6 SFR function and the SFR–L[CII] relation
of the local galaxies is consistent with our and previ-
ous constraints on the z = 6 [C ii] luminosity function
in the wide L[CII] range. Given the unbiased aspect of
the ALCS survey and indeed the representative physical
properties of RXCJ0600-z6 among the abundant pop-
"ulation of the low-mass regime of z ∼ 6 star-forming
galaxies (Section 3.5), our results may imply that the"
SFR–L[CII] relation of local star-forming galaxies is uni-
versal for a wide range of scales including the spatially
"resolved ISM, the whole region of the galaxy, and the"
cosmic scale.
5. SUMMARY
"In this paper, we present the blind detection of"
a multiply-imaged line emitter behind the massive
"galaxy cluster RXCJ0600−2007 in a cycle-6 ALMA large
project of ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS). The"
optical–NIR property and our lens model analyses sug-
gest that the emission line is the [C ii] 158 µm line from
"a Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) at z = 6.0719 ± 0.0004
behind RXCJ0600-2007. We study the relation between"
the star-formation rate (SFR) and [C ii] line luminosity
"(L[CII]), the morphology, and the kinematics in the spa-"
tially resolved interstellar medium (ISM) as well as the
"whole scale of the LBG, and provide a lower limit at"
"the faint-end of the [C ii] luminosity function at z ∼ 6,
with help of the gravitational lensing magnification. The"
main findings of this paper are summarized as follows:
1. We perform blind line search for the ALCS data
cube in RXCJ0600-2007 and identify two bright
"lines at ≥ 8σ levels at 268.682 ± 0.011 GHz
and 268.744 ± 0.016 GHz, one of which shows a
strongly lensed arc shape. Both lines have optical–"
NIR counterparts with clear Lyman-break feature
20 Fujimoto et al.
"at ∼9000 Å, indicative of the lines corresponding
to the [C ii] 158 µm at z = 6.07. The optical–"
NIR spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis
shows that probability distributions of their pho-
tometric redshifts are in excellent agreement with
"the [C ii] line redshift, while other possible FIR"
"lines at z ∼ 6 are hard to explain the luminosity
ratio between the line and continuum. We thus"
conclude that these two lines are [C ii] lines.
"2. Our lens models, updated with the latest spectro-"
"scopic follow-up results with VLT/MUSE, suggest"
that these lines arise from a strongly magnified
"and multiply imaged (µ ' 20− 160) Lyman-break
galaxy (LBG) at z = 6.0719 with a circularized"
"effective radius of ∼0.8 kpc and an intrinsic lu-
minosity in the rest-frame UV ∼ 3 times fainter
(MUV = −19.7+0.5−0.4) than the characteristic lumi-
nosity at this epoch. A sub region of the LBG"
crosses the caustic line in the source plane and
"thus stretched into an arc over ∼ 6′′ in the image
plane, for which the [C ii] line is also significantly"
detected. Our lens models also predict another
two multiple images in this field. We identify the
sources at the predicted positions and find that
their optical–NIR colors agree with the other mul-
tiple images of the LBGs. One of them falls in the
"ALCS area coverage, where we detect a tentative"
[C ii] line (3.0σ) at the same frequency as the other
multiple images.
"3. After the correction of the lensing magnification,"
the whole of the LBG and its sub region are char-
"acterized with L[CII] of 1.1
+0.7
−0.5 ×10"
"8 and 0.3+0.1−0.1
×108 L�, SFR of 5.4+4.5−2.9 and 0.8"
"+0.4
−0.2 M� yr"
"−1, and"
"stellar mass (Mstar) of 9.6
+6.0
−4.6 ×10"
"8 and 2.6+0.2−1.0
×108M�, respectively. From the whole to sub re-
gions of the LBG, the SFR and Mstar values falls"
"on the average relation among z ∼ 6 galaxies, in-
dicating that the LBG is an abundant, represen-"
tative galaxy at this epoch.
4. The source plane reconstruction resolves the ISM
"down to ∼100–300 pc. The [C ii] line from the
whole region of the LBG is co-spatial with the"
"rest-frame UV continuum, while the sub region of"
"the LBG is placed ∼1.6 kpc away from the galac-
tic center and bright rest-frame UV clumps. The"
two-peak morphology observed in the [C ii] line
and rest-frame FIR continuum in the arc show a
"∼1 kpc offset from the luminosity-weighted center
of the sub region of the LBG, which likely con-"
sists either of a clumpy structure or a smooth disk
but stretched into the two-peak morphology due
to the perturbation by a foreground galaxy. In
"these two peaks, the [C ii] line and the rest-frame"
FIR continuum exhibit the flux ratio anomaly dif-
"ferently, which suggests that the faint [C ii]- and"
FIR-emitting regions are displaced near the caus-
5. We find that our results in both whole and sub
regions of the LBG fall on the SFR–L[CII] and sur-
face density of SFR (ΣSFR)–L[CII]/SFR relations
obtained in local star-forming galaxies. The sub
region of the galaxy has a lower ΣSFR and a higher
L[CII]/SFR value. This is consistent with the ab-
sence of the bright rest-frame UV clumps around
"the sub region of the LBG that is placed ∼1.6 kpc
away from the galactic center, where ΣSFR is ex-"
pected to be low.
6. We find that the LBG is classified as a rotation-
dominated system based on the full observed ve-
locity gradient and the velocity dispersion of the
LBG via the bright [C ii] line emission. The 3D
modeling with 3DBarolo and galpak3D provide
consistent results for the rotation kinematics that
explains the spatial and velocity offsets of the sub
region of the LBG. We estimate the dynamical
"mass of Mdyn = (3 ± 1) × 109M� and obtain the
gas fraction of ∼ 50–80%."
7. We derive a lower limit on the [C ii] luminosity
function at z = 6. We find that it is consistent
with current semi-analytical model predictions. In
"conjunction with previous ALMA results, we also"
find that constraints on the [C ii] luminosity func-
tion at z = 6 so far obtained agree with the pre-
diction from the SFR–L[CII] relation of local star-
forming galaxies and the SFR function at z = 6.
8. With the blind aspect of the ALCS survey and the
SFR–L[CII] relations from the sub to whole regions
"of the LBG, our results may imply that the local"
SFR–L[CII] relation is universal for a wide range
"of scales including the spatially resolved ISM, the"
"whole region of the galaxy, and the cosmic scale"
"even up to z = 6, which we derive in an unbiased"
manner.

B. TWO-PEAK MORPHOLOGY IN Z6.1/6.2
To check the possibility that the two-peak morphology
of the [C ii] line in z6.1/6.2 is caused by the noise fluc-
"tuation boosted by the underlying diffuse emission (e.g.,"
"Hodge et al. 2016), we perform a mock observation with"
the CASA task simobserve towards z6.1/6.2 in the
same manner as Fujimoto et al. (2020a). Here we assume
the single elliptical Gaussian for the [C ii] line surface
brightness distribution of z6.1/6.2 based on the imfit
results in the uv-tapered map (Section 3.1). We then
obtain the visibility data set through simobserve and
produce the natural-weighted velocity-integrated map of
the [C ii] line. We repeat the mock observation to pro-
"ducing the map 1,000 times. Given that the spatial off-"
"set of ∼ 2.′′0 and the significance levels of 8.2σ and 5.4σ
between the two peaks in z6.1/6.2, we then search mul-"
tiple positive peaks that are located with spatial offsets
"of less than 2.′′5 and detected at ≥ 5.4σ levels, utilizing
SExtractor version 2.5.0 (Bertin & Arnouts 1996). We"
"identify 7 out of 1,000 maps have the multiple peaks that"
meet the above criteria. These results indicate that the
two-peak morphology of the [C ii] line in z6.1/6.2 might
be caused by the noise fluctuation with a probability of
"∼ 0.7%. Note that we find that all multiple peaks iden-
tified in the 7 maps show their flux ratios almost iden-"
"tical, which is different from the two peaks observed in"
"z6.1/6.2 (ratio ∼ 8:5). This indicates that the close sep-
aration as well as the flux ratio of the two peaks observed"
in z6.1/6.2 is hardly explained by the noise fluctuation.
"In fact, we identify only 1 out of 1,000 maps that has a"
flux ratio of multiple peaks similar to the two peaks in
"z6.1/6.2, but with the spatial offset of 4.′′7. Therefore,"
we conclude that the possibility of the noise fluctuation
is negligible in the two-peak [C ii] line morphology of
z6.1/6.2.
C. OPTICAL–NIR PHOTOMETRY
We adopt separate strategies for extracting robust
photometry for the four lensed images as described be-
low to account for the crowded cluster field and varying
"degrees of extended source morphology. In general, we"
model the full IRAC mosaics using a strategy similar to
"that of Merlin et al. (2015), where we use image thumb-"
nails of each source and neighbors taken from the high-
resolution HST/WFC3 F160W image and knowledge of
the WFC3 and IRAC point spread functions (PSFs) to
model the low-resolution IRAC image.
C.1. Images z6.3 and z6.5
The sources of interest in these images are relatively
bright and fairly well separated from their nearest bright
(projected) neighbors (Figure 1). We measure aper-
ture flux densities in each of the HST filters using fixed
D = 0.′′7 apertures centered on the source of interest to
define the colors. To determine the overall flux normal-
"ization, we model the source morphology of the lensed"
image and nearby neighbors using the non-parametric
morphological fitting code Scarlet (Melchior et al.
2018). All of the WFC3/IR images (and their PSFs) are
used to constrain the Scarlet morphological model.
"We scale all of the HST aperture measurements Fap,i
by the aperture correction FS,F160W/Fap,F160W, where"
"FS,F160W is the integral of the Scarlet model evalu-"
"ated in the F160W filter and FS,F160W is the aperture"
measurement in that filter. The photometric uncertain-
ties are measured in the same apertures on the inverse
variance image in each filter. For the IRAC flux densities
"of these images, we subtract all modeled sources other"
than the source of interest and perform aperture pho-
"tometry on this cleaned image using D = 3.′′0 apertures,"
which we correct to the same “total” scale as for HST
using aperture corrections of 1.6 and 1.7 for channels 1
"and 2, respectively, that were derived from a separate"
"bright, isolated source in the field."
C.2. Extended arc image z6.1/6.2
This image is a highly elongated arc extending over
"≈6 arcsec coincident with a foreground compact source
in the center (Figure 1). Here, we model both overlap-"
ping sources in the F160W image as parametric Sersic
profiles using the galfit software (Peng et al. 2010).
For the photometry of the lensed arc and foreground
"image in the WFC3/IR filters, we fit for the relative"
normalizations of the two Sersic components convolved
"with the appropriate PSFs. For IRAC, we convolve"
the model Sersic profiles with the IRAC PSF and fit
for the normalization of the source of interest and all
neighboring sources in the least-squares optimization.
"As for HST, the normalization of the scaled morpho-"
logical components is adopted as the photometric mea-
surement without additional aperture corrections. For
"the optical images where the arc is not readily visible,"
we measure an aperture flux density and its associated
uncertainty within a large rectangle aperture approxi-
"mately 1.′′2× 3.′′0.
Note that the de-blended color of the foreground ob-"
"ject is similar to the color of cluster members, and the"
"best-fit SED shows the photometric redshift at 0.57+0.14−0.17
which is close to the cluster redshift at z = 0.43 (see also"
Laporte et al. submitted). Although this suggests the

"foreground to be one of the cluster members, we do not"
include it in our fiducial mass model due to potential
systematics in the de-blending process. The detail con-
tribution of the foreground object to morphology and
magnification factors of z6.1/6.2 (Section 4.1) must be
investigated after we obtain the spectroscopic redshift
of the foreground object.
C.3. Faint image z6.4
The final faint image of z6.4 is close to the cluster
core and the BCG. Although it is not deblended as a
separate source in our original photometric catalog (and
"associated IRAC model), a source is readily apparent in"
the F160W image (Figure 1). We estimate photometry
of this image by placing fixed D = 0.′′7 and D = 3.′′0
apertures centered on the F160W position in the HST
"and IRAC filter mosaics, respectively, and scale these"
measurements by aperture corrections derived for point
sources.
D. [C ii] SPECTRA OF z6.1 AND z6.2
As a sanity check of our interpretation that one of the
[C ii] line emitters consists of a pair of multiple images
"of z6.1 and z6.2, we compare [C ii] spectra between z6.1"
"and z6.2. In Figure 10, we show the [C ii] spectra of z6.1"
(red line) and z6.2 (blue line) that are normalized to the
peak of z6.1/6.2 (black line). We find that z6.1 and z6.2
have [C ii] line profiles consistent with each other within
"the errors, which agrees with our interpretation of z6.1"
and z6.2 being a pair of multiple images.
E. [C ii] ROTATION MODELING
"In Section 4.2, we find that z6.3 is likely a rotation-"
"dominated system. In Table 6, we summarize the 3D"
"modeling results for the [C ii] line around z6.3 with
3Dbarolo (Di Teodoro & Fraternali 2015) and gal-"
"pak3d (Bouché et al. 2015). For 3Dbarolo, because"
the ALMA beam has a half-width-at-half-maximum
"(HWHM) of ∼ 0.′′45 at the [C ii] line frequency along
the orientation of the velocity gradient, we adopt three"
"(∼ 1.4/0.45) annuli with the width of 0.′′45 for the tilted
ring fitting algorithm. We use the THRESHOLD mask"
"with the 2σ limit for the data cube, and the spatial cen-"
"ter, systemic velocity, rotation velocity (vrot), velocity"
"dispersion (σvel), position angle (PA), and inclination"
(incl.) are used as free parameters in the fitting. The er-
rors are estimated based on the minimization algorithm
"in a Monte Carlo approach. For galpak3d, we adopt"
"the exponential-disk for the flux profile, the Gaussian"
"for the thickness profile, and the tanh formalization of"
"Vmax × tanh(r/rV) for the rotation curve, where Vmax
and rV are the maximum velocity and the turnover ra-"
"dius, respectively. In place of the mask, we use a cutout"
"data cube by 3.′′8 × 3.′′8 and [−120: +120] km s−1 for
the fitting. We set the maximum iteration number of"
"20,000. The spatial center, systemic velocity, flux, re,"
"PA, incl., rV, Vmax, and σvel are used as free parame-"
ters. The errors are evaluated based on a Markov chain
Monte Carlo approach.

"a Inner and outer radii of the tilted rings for 3Dbarolo and
effective radius for galpak3d. The turnover radius is esti-
mated to be 0.′′62 ± 0.′′11 in the tanh formalization for the
rotation curve in galpak3d.
b Line-of-sight projected rotation velocity. We present Vmax
for galpak3d.
c We follow the definition of PA as the orientation from the
y-axis in anti-clockwise, which is different from that of the
original output of 3Dbarolo."
