"We study the general embedding of a P (X,ϕ) inflationary theory into a two-field theory with
curved field space metric, which was proposed as a possible way to examine the relation between
de Sitter Swampland conjecture and k -inflation. We show that this embedding method fits into the
special type of two-field model in which the heavy field can be integrated out at the full action level.
However, this embedding is not exact due to the upper bound of the effective mass of the heavy field.
We quantify the deviation between the speed of sound calculated via the P (X,ϕ) theory and the
embedding two-field picture to next leading order terms. We especially focus on the first potential
slow roll parameter defined in the two-field picture and obtain an upper bound on it."

I. INTRODUCTION
"In inflationary cosmology [1–7], scalar fields have been extensively used for modeling the inflaton field causing an
exponential expansion in the very early universe which sets up the initial condition of the Hot Big Bang. In the
simplest scenario, a period of quasi-de Sitter phase is accomplished by a canonical scalar field slow-rolling down
a plateau potential. The quantum fluctuations based on such a simple model are phenomenologically sufficient to
match with the slightly tilted power spectrum and non-Gaussianity in the latest measurement of the anisotropies of
the cosmic microwave background [8, 9]. Meanwhile, the supposed high energy scale during inflation gives rise to the
question: what beyond standard model theory or quantum gravity theory contains the inflaton field? As the most
prominent candidate of an ultraviolet (UV) complete theory of fundamental interactions, string theory is widely used
to construct the inflaton field.
However, recently the existence of such a simple scalar field with a plateau potential from string theory construction"
"has been put into question. Over the past several years, a series of so-called “swampland” conjectures have been
proposed concerning the consistency of effective scalar field models with a UV completion in a theory of quantum
gravity [10], including the de Sitter Swampland Conjecture and its modified versions [11–13]. The de Sitter Swampland
conjecture states that for a scalar potential V of any consistent theory of quantum gravity, there is a lower bound on
the logarithmic gradient of V (φ)"

"While simple single-field inflation models are in strong tension with the swampland conjectures [14, 15], more com-
plicated models can in principle be consistent. In Ref. [16], Achúcarro and Palma point out that in the multi-field
models, the parameter characterizing the logarithmic gradient of the potential ǫV can largely deviate from the first
Hubble slow-roll parameter ǫ through a large turning rate Ω as"

"Therefore, the de Sitter Swampland conjecture ǫV & O(1) can be satisfied without violating quasi-de Sitter condition
ǫ ≪ 1. For instance, in hyperbolic inflation [17], the inflaton can orbit a steep potential and never slow rolls.
Besides having more than one field, another way to go beyond simple inflationary models is by considering models"
"based on the P (X,ϕ) theory [18, 19], in which the Lagrangian is a general function of the field and its canonical
kinetic term X = −(∂ϕ)2/2. For instance, the well-known Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) inflation [20, 21] motivated by
string theory construction belongs to this category. It is then a natural question to ask how to apply the Swampland
conjectures on this type of model. Some possible methods are proposed aiming to generalize the conjectures themselves
[22, 23]. On the other hand, another rather conservative approach suggested in Ref. [23, 24] and further studied in
Ref. [25] is to embed the P (X,ϕ) theory into a two-field model1 by a general embedding scheme [29]"

"In this paper, we point out that the resulting two-field model of this general embedding method should be considered
as a special type of two-field model with mass hierarchy, in which the heavy field can be integrated out at the full
action level as was done in the gelaton scenario [30, 31]. As a result, the two-field extension has to satisfy the energy
conditions where this embedding is valid. This requirement gives an upper bound of the parameter Λ in the action
(3). Furthermore, we derive ǫV in series expansion of Λ"
"6 and showing that the two β-dependent terms in Eq. (4)
belong to the next leading order. Especially, we conclude that to have a small deviation between the speed of sound
derived from the P (X,ϕ) theory and the corresponding two-field model, those two terms must be small compared to
a leading term proportional to Λ6 in Eq. (95).
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II A and II B, we briefly review the P (X,ϕ) theory and the"
"multi-field inflationary models with curved field space. In Sec. II C, we review the gelaton scenario, a special type
of multi-field model in which the heavy field can be integrated out at the full action level. In Sec. III, we show that
the general embedding method (3) fits into the same category as the gelaton case. To the leading order, both the
turning rate and effective mass of the entropic fluctuations are proportional to a single parameter Λ6, which is the
same parameter used in the action to turn off the kinetic term of the auxiliary field χ. In Sec. IV, we have our main
results. We first show that to correctly relate ǫV to the turning rate Ω, we need to include next to leading order terms
in Λ. We obtain ǫV and the speed of sound cS derived from the embedding two-field model in terms of quantities
defined in P (X,ϕ) to the next leading order. From the condition that the two-field model and P (X,ϕ) should give
similar speed of sound, we conclude that the ǫV can only be dominated by the leading term proportional to Λ"
"6 in a
large turning scenario. Lastly, an upper bound on ǫV of this type of model is given. The conclusion is in Sec. V."

non-canonical, the first potential Hubble parameter ǫV (31) is still well-defined, i.e., ǫV is invariant under the local
field redefinition. Therefore, the de Sitter Swampland conjecture ǫV ∼ O(1) would not be changed by a simple field

"Notice that in general, this mapping is only valid at the perturbation level, since the heavy field is the isocurvature
perturbations, not the field defined in the full action. However, for some special two-field models, the heavy field
can be integrated out at the full action level [30, 31], in which assuming Meff → ∞ is equivalent to turning off the
dynamics of the auxiliary field. In the next subsection, we review the prototype of this type of model named the
gelaton scenario."

out the heavy field, the effective low energy single field action is of the DBI form. Especially, we take the point of
view from Ref. [31] that it can be considered as a special type of multi-field model with curved field space and mass
hierarchy. Related discussion can be found in Refs. [23, 28].

full action, and at the same time makes Meff ≫ H , which is the condition for integrating out the heavy isocurvature

"Since the effective mass of the gelaton (51) is bounded by the energy condition Eq. (52), the value of g cannot be

can obtain the above results (50, 51) without using approximation Eq. (45) by calculating exact results from Eqs.
(26, 27) first, and then taking the leading order in g.
In the next section we will see that the general embedding of a P (X,φ) into a two-field non-linear sigma model"
"also belongs to this category, i.e., making Meff large and turning off the dynamics of the auxiliary field is controlled
by a single parameter. Also we will use the method described above, since later in Sec. IV we will see that the
approximated tangent and normal vectors (45) are insufficient."

S in Eq. (73). When cS → 1, we"
"have M2eff → 0, which indicates the break down of the mass hierarchy, H ≪ Meff . Therefore, both of the degrees
of freedom in the field space are relevant, and cannot be described by an effective P (X,ϕ) theory. In the rest of
the paper, we do not consider cS ≈ 1. Lastly, using Eqs. (57, 69) with χ ≃ X , one can show that the EoM of
Φ from the two-field picture Eq. (28) reduces to the EoM of the P (X,ϕ) theory Eq. (12). Meanwhile, under the
same approximation the relation of the slow-roll parameters in the two-field models, Eq. (25), also reduces to the
corresponding relation in a P (X,ϕ) theory, Eq. (16), so the classical dynamics of the field Φ and the background
evolution are well described by the effective P (X,ϕ) theory.

those with ϕ being the inflationary field. Substituting the above result into Eqs. (52, 53), the bound on M2eff for this

IV. NEXT TO THE LEADING ORDER CALCULATION AND ǫV
"Due to the upper bound of Λ, the embedding picture is not exact. In this section we quantify the effect of a finite
Λ on the embedding picture.
First, in the two-field picture, given a field space metric and potential we are able to calculate the first potential"
slow-roll parameter from Eq. (31) as

. (80)"
"Since Λ is bounded from above in Eq. (76), ǫV cannot be made arbitrarily large by a choice of Λ. Moreover, we will
find that the leading order terms in V 2N is O(Λ6) while V 2Φ is only O(Λ0). For this reason we will need to expand V 2N
out to the next to leading order term in Λ to see the full effect, which means the approximation of the unit tangent
and normal vectors (68) are insufficient. In the following, the strategy is to expand quantities in the two-field picture
out to O(Λ0). Then, we express the relevant parameters in the two-field picture with those in the single-field P (X,ϕ)
theory by using the constraint with O(1/Λ6) correction derived from the EoM of the auxiliary field (58) as6"

whole embedding picture is no longer valid. A detailed calculation of the speed of sound (34) to the next leading order

Interestingly, another recently proposed swampland conjecture, the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture (TCC),"
"also gives an upper bound to the energy scale during inflation [43, 44]. The trans-Planckian censorship conjecture
postulates that any consistent theory of quantum gravity must forbid quantum fluctuations with wavelengths shorter
than the Planck length from being redshifted by cosmological expansion to wavelengths where they become classical
perturbations. In Ref. [45], Lin and Kinney generalize the TCC to certain k -inflation scenario and derive the
corresponding bound on the inflationary energy scale. It is then an interesting subject to compare the energy bounds
derived from different swampland conjectures in the k -inflation scenario."

"In this work we examine the general embedding of a P (X,ϕ) inflationary theory into a two-field theory with curved
field space. By promoting the canonical kinetic term of the field X to an auxiliary field χ and introducing a small
kinetic term to χ, the resulting two-field action is"

special type of two-field model with heavy entropic fluctuations, in which the heavy field can be integrated out at full
action level. In the two-field model generated from this embedding, both the turning rate and effective mass of the
entropic fluctuations are proportional to the single parameter Λ6, which is the same parameter used in the action to
turn off the kinetic term of the auxiliary field.
However, in this type of model, the effective mass of the heavy field is bounded by the cutoff scale of the inflationary"
