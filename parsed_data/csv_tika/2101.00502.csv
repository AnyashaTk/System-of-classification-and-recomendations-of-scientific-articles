ABSTRACT
We report the first results of a systematic investigation to characterize blazar variability power
"spectral densities (PSDs) at optical frequencies using densely sampled (5–15 minutes integration time),"
"high photometric accuracy (.0.2–0.5%) R-band intranight light curves, covering timescales ranging
from several hours to∼15 minutes. Our sample consists of 14 optically bright blazars, including nine BL
Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) and five flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) which have shown statistically"
significant variability during 29 monitoring sessions. We model the intranight PSDs as simple power–
laws and derive the best-fit slope along with uncertainty using the ‘power spectral response’ method.
"Our main results are the following: (1) on 19 out of 29 monitoring sessions, the intranight PSDs show"
"an acceptable fit to simple power-laws at the rejection confidence ≤ 90%; (2) for these 19 instances, the
PSD slopes show a large range from 1.4 to 4.0, consistent with statistical characters of red (slope∼2)
and black (slope≥3) noise stochastic processes; (3) the average PSD slopes for the BL Lacs and FSRQs
are indistinguishable from one another; (4) the normalization of intranight PSDs for individual blazar"
sources which were monitored on more than one occasion turns out to be consistent with one another
"with a few exceptions. The average PSD slope, 2.9±0.3 (1σ uncertainty) is steeper than the red-noise
type character of variability found on longer timescales (many decades to days), indicative of a cutoff in"
the variability spectrum on timescales around a few days at the synchrotron frequencies of the emission
spectrum.

1. INTRODUCTION
Intense emission and rapid flux variability provide
important clues to understand the underlying physi-
"cal process operating in the relativistic, magnetized jets"
of blazar sources. This subset of active galactic nu-
clei (AGN) is comprised of BL Lacertae objects (BL
Lacs) and the high optical polarization flat-spectrum ra-
"dio quasars (FSRQs), with jets launched from a super-"
massive black hole (SMBH)–accretion disk systems(for
"a recent review see, Hovatta & Lindfors 2019). The"
flux variability is observed at all frequencies of the elec-
tromagnetic spectrum on both long-term (decades to
"' day; Ulrich et al. 1997; Aller et al. 1999; Ghosh
et al. 2000; Gopal-Krishna et al. 2011; Goyal et al. 2012;"

two-component broadband spectral energy distribution
is nonthermal radiation arising within the relativistic jet
(Ghisellini & Tavecchio 2008). Within the leptonic sce-
"nario, the particle (electron and positron) pairs, acceler-"
"ated to GeV/TeV energies, produce synchrotron radia-"
tion in the presence of magnetic field at lower frequencies
(radio–to–optical/X-rays) and inverse Comptonization
of the seed photons (same or thermal from the accre-
tion disk) by the synchrotron emitting particles produce
"emission at higher frequencies (X-rays–to–TeV γ−rays).
Alternatively, direct synchrotron radiation by the pro-"
tons accelerated to PeV/EeV energies or the emission
from secondaries can give rise to high energy radia-

"tion within the hadronic scenario (e.g., Blandford et al."
2019). Well–defined flare emission has often been at-
tributed to particle acceleration mechanisms related to
shocks in the jet (Spada et al. 2001; Marscher et al. 2008)
while turbulence can mimic observed fluctuations on
long-term as well as small timescales (Marscher 2014).
Annihilation of magnetic field lines at the reconnection
sites within the jet plasma can also impart energy to
the particles (Giannios 2013; Sironi et al. 2015); this
scenario is supported by the recent detection of minute-
like variability at GeV energies for the blazar 3C 279
"(Shukla & Mannheim 2020). On the other hand, flux"
changes on the intranight timescales have also been as-
sociated with variable Doppler boosting factors related
to changes in the viewing angle of the emitting plasma
"(e.g., Gopal-Krishna & Wiita 1992), although in such a"
scenario frequency–independent variability is expected
"(see, in this context, Pasierb et al. 2020)."
The noise-like appearance of blazar light curves have
prompted efforts to investigate variability power spec-
tral densities (PSDs) which is a distribution of vari-
ability amplitudes over different Fourier frequencies
(=timescale−1). The blazar PSDs are mostly repre-
"sented by power-law shapes defined as P(νk) ∝ ν
−β
k"
where β(=1–3) is the slope and νk is the temporal
frequency which indicate that variability is a corre-
"lated colored–noise type stochastic processes (see, Goyal"
"2020, and references therein). Specifically, β'1, '2 and
&3 are known as long-memory/pink–noise, damped–
random walk/red–noise, and black–noise type stochastic"
"processes while β'0 corresponds to uncorrelated, white–
noise type stochastic process (Press 1978; Schroeder"
1991). For a colored noise–type stationary stochastic
"process, one expects the slope of PSDs to change to 0"
on longer timescales to preserve the finite variance of the
"process, leading to a relaxation timescale beyond which"
the variations should be generated due to uncorrelated
"processes. Moreover, it also means that different random"
realizations of the process will have different statistical
"moments (e.g., mean, sigma) due to statistical fluctua-"
tion of the process itself and not due to the change of
nature of the process which indicates that the process is
weakly non-stationary (Vaughan et al. 2003). Fluctua-
tions resulting from such stochastic processes obey cer-
"tain probability distributions, so the light curves tend"
to produce predictable PSDs. PSD slope and normal-
"ization, as well as the breaks, are of particular interest"
as they carry information about the parameters of the
stochastic process and the ‘characteristic timescales’ in
the system which can be related to physical parame-
"ters shaping the variability, such as the size of the emis-"
sion zone or the particle cooling timescales (Sobolewska
et al. 2014; Finke & Becker 2014; Chen et al. 2016). The
noise-like appearance of light curves has been modeled
where the aggregate flux arises from many cells behind
"a shock (Calafut & Wiita 2015; Pollack et al. 2016, see"
"also, Marscher (2014) who models the flux and polar-"
ization light curves but does not provide PSDs) against
the emission from well-defined flares which could be at-
tributed to single emission zones (Hughes et al. 1985;
Abdo et al. 2010b). The models of Calafut & Wi-
ita (2015) and (Pollack et al. 2016) compute the light
"curves and the PSDs, which are shaped by the combina-"
tion bulk Lorentz factor fluctuations and the turbulence
within the jets. In their hydrodynamic simulations of
"2D jets, the changes in bulk Lorentz factor produce PSD"
slopes in the range 2.1 to 2.9 while the turbulence pro-
"duces PSD slopes in the range 1.7 to 2.3, respectively"
(Pollack et al. 2016). The model of O’Riordan et al.
"(2017), on the other hand, hypothesizes that the turbu-"
lence in the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) shapes
the variability of synchrotron and IC emission compo-
"nents from the jet, with a cutoff of variability power at"
the timescales governed by the light crossing time of the
event horizon of the SMBH.
Unlike the long–term variability timescales where the
slopes of PSDs of multiwavelength variability have been
estimated for large samples of blazar sources (in particu-
"lar, β∼2 for radio and optical and β∼1 for γ−rays, Max-
Moerbeck et al. 2014; Park & Trippe 2017; Nilsson et al."
"2018; Meyer et al. 2019; Goyal 2020), such studies re-"
main scarce on intranight timescales. This is due to the
fact that it requires continuous pointing of an observing
facility to a single target for many hours which is usu-
"ally not feasible due to scheduling constraints, weather,"
"limited photon sensitivity (at high energies), etc. The"
intranight PSD slopes at GeV and TeV energies exhib-
"ited β ∼1 and 2, respectively, for the blazars 3C 279
and PKS 2155−304, respectively, using the Fermi-LAT
and the High Energy Stereoscopic System data, but"
only when the blazars were in a flaring state (Aharo-
nian et al. 2007; Ackermann et al. 2016). Zhang et al.
"(2019) obtained the X-ray PSD slopes of 1.5, 3.1 and"
1.4 using the 40–180 ks long Suzaku observations. In
"another study, Bhattacharyya et al. (2020) obtained in-"
"tranight X-ray PSD slopes equal to 2.7, 2.6, 1.9 and, 2.7"
"for the Mrk 421 and 2.2, 2.8, and 2.9, respectively, for the"
"PKS 2155−304 using the 30–90 ks long XMM–Newton
observations. Goyal et al. (2017) obtained the optical"
intranight PSD slopes in the range 1.5–4.1 for five mon-
itoring sessions of the BL Lac PKS 0735+178. Wehrle
et al. (2013) and Wehrle et al. (2019) obtained the PSD
slopes of blazar sources using the Kepler–satellite in the
range 1.2–3.8 on timescales ranging from half a day to

"PSD slope ∼2.0 using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS)–2 min integration time light curve for"
the blazar 0716+714 at variability timescales between a

"In this respect, a few optical observatories with 1–"
2 m class optical telescopes and fitted with CCDs have
been devoted to blazar/AGN monitoring programs since
"1990 (see, for a review, Gopal-Krishna & Wiita 2018)."
The goal of the present study is to characterize the in-
tranight variability of a large sample of blazars using the
ARIES monitoring program which was carried out be-
"tween 1998 to 2010, the results of which are presented in"
Goyal et al. (2013a). The paper is organized as follows.
Sample selection is given in Section 2 while Section 3
"provides the details on the analysis method, in partic-"
"ular, the derivation of power spectral densities and the"
estimation of best-fit PSD shapes using extensive nu-
merical simulations of light curves. Section 4 provides
the main results while a discussion and conclusions are
given in Section 5.
2. SAMPLE
The blazar light curves studied here are obtained from
the samples of Goyal et al. (2013a) who studied the
intra-night variability properties of different types of ac-
tive galactic nuclei (AGN) using 262 intranight light
curves. The AGNs monitored belong to radio–quiet
"quasar, radio–intermediate quasar, radio–loud quasar"
"and blazar types, including BL Lacs and the FSRQs."
Goyal et al. blazar sample consists of 24 sources mon-
itored on 85 sessions. The details of data gather-
"ing, reduction procedure, generation of differential light"
"curves, and the statistical tests used to infer intranight"
variability are given in Goyal et al. (2013a) which we
"briefly describe here. On each monitoring session, con-"
tinuous CCD observations (>4 hr) of the target were
performed with the integration time of each frame cho-
sen such that the flux measurement could be obtained
with 0.2–0.5% accuracies. The preprocessing (bias sub-
traction and flat fielding) of raw CCD frames were
done using Image reduction and analysis facility
(IRAF) software and the instrumental magnitudes of
the target blazar and the comparison stars on the same
CCD chip were derived using aperture photometry. The
relative instrumental magnitude of the blazar was com-
"puted against one steady ‘star–star’ pair, thereby pro-"

"keeping the difference unaltered. Next, we used F−test
to infer the statistical significance of variability at sig-"
"nificance levels, α= 0.01 and 0.05, corresponding to"
"p value >0.99 and >0.95, respectively. If the value of"
"F−test statistic for a DLC turned out to be more than
the critical value at α=0.05(0.01), the DLCs were as-"
signed a ‘probable variable (confirmed variable)’ status.
If the test statistic turned out to be smaller than the
"critical value atα=0.05 for the DLC, it was assigned a"
"‘non-variable’ status. In the present study, all the mon-"
itoring sessions where both DLCs showed a ‘confirmed
variable’ status are used. We also included two mon-
itoring sessions where one of the two DLCs showed a
‘probable variable’ status while the other showed a ‘con-
firmed variable’ status. The monitoring sessions where
the blazar DLCs showed ‘non-variable’ status are not
used in this analysis as the PSDs of ‘non-variable’ light
"curves will be consistent with β ∼ 0, resulting from fluc-
tuations arising from measurement errors. The above"
criterion reduced the sample to 15 blazars and 34 in-

tranight light curves. We further exclude the BL Lac ob-
ject PKS 0735+178 from the sample as the PSD analysis
of its five intranight light curves has been reported in
"Goyal et al. (2017). Therefore, the current sample con-"
sists of 14 blazars which have shown statistically signif-
icant variability on 29 intranight monitoring sessions1.
Table 1 lists the basic properties of the blazars.
"Next, we converted the differential magnitudes of"
blazars from logarithmic scale to linear scale using the
"relation Fobs=F0×10−0.4×mobs , where F0(=1) is the ar-
bitrary zero point magnitude flux, mobs is the differen-"
tial blazar magnitude relative to one comparison star
and Fobs is the corresponding differential flux density as
it contains the contribution from the steady compari-
son star flux. The errors in were derived using stan-
dard error propagation (Bevington & Robinson 2003)
and scaled by a factor 1.54 to account for the underes-
"timation of the photometric errors by the IRAF (see,"
"for details, Goyal et al. 2013b, and references theirin)."
We note that the differential blazar flux density can
be scaled to proper fluxes using the appropriate F0 for
the R–band and the apparent magnitudes of compar-
ison star used. Figure 1 (panel a) shows flux density
intranight light curves.
3. PSD ANALYSIS
3.1. Derivation of PSDs: discrete Fourier transform
Since the aim of the study is to obtain reliable shapes
"of PSDs, we subject the light curves Fourier transforma-"
tion using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) method
"(see, for details, Goyal 2020, and references therein)."
The fractional rms-squared-normalized periodogram is
given as the squared modulus of its DFT for the evenly
"sampled light curve f(ti), observed at discrete times ti
and consisting of N data points and the total monitoring"
"duration T ,"
"P (νk) =
2T"
"{[
N∑
i=1"
f(ti) cos(2πνkti)
"[
N∑
i=1"
f(ti) sin(2πνkti)
"]2 }
, (1)"
where µ is the mean of the light curve and is subtracted
"from the flux values, f(ti). The DFT is computed for"
evenly spaced frequencies ranging from the total dura-
tion of the light curve down to the Nyquist sampling fre-
"quency (νNyq) of the observed data. Specifically, the fre-"
"quencies corresponding to νk = k/T with k = 1, ..., N/2,"
1 Light curves can be obtained upon request.
"νNyq = N/2T , and T = N(tk − t1)/(N − 1) are consid-
ered. The normalized periodogram as defined in Eq. 1"
corresponds to total excess variance when integrated
over positive frequencies. The constant noise floor level
"from measurement uncertainties is given as (e.g., Isobe"
et al. 2015; Vaughan et al. 2003)
"Pstat =
2 T"
"µ2 N
σ2stat . (2)"
"where, σ2stat =
∑j=N
j=1 ∆f(tj)"
2/N is the mean variance of
the measurement uncertainties on the flux values ∆f(tj)
"in the observed light curve at times tj , with N denoting"
the number of data points in the original light curve.
The intranight light curves are roughly evenly sampled
but the application of the DFT method requires strict
"even sampling of the time series, otherwise, the ‘spectral"
window function’ corresponding to the sampling times
"gives a non-zero response in the Fourier-domain, result-"
"ing in false powers in the periodograms (see, Appendix"
"A of Goyal 2020; Deeming 1975). Therefore, in order"
"to perform the DFT, we obtained the regular sampling"
only by linearly interpolating between the two consecu-
tive observed data points with an interpolation interval
of 1 minute which is roughly 5–15 times smaller than
the original sampling interval (see column 7 of Table 2).
Even though the choice of interpolation interval is arbi-
"trary, we note that it cannot be longer than the mean"
sampling interval. We tested our procedure by also using
an interpolation interval about half of the original sam-
pling interval which did not change the results. We refer
the reader to Goyal et al. (2017) and Max-Moerbeck
et al. (2014) for a discussion on the distortions intro-
duced in the PSDs due to the discrete sampling and
"the finite duration of the light curve, known as ‘red-"
noise leakage’ and ‘aliasing’ respectively. To minimize
"the effects of red-noise leak, the PSDs are generated"
"using the ‘Hanning’ window function (e.g., Press et al."
"1992; Max-Moerbeck et al. 2014). Aliasing, on the other"
"hand, contributes an equal amount of power (around the"
Nyquist frequency) to the periodograms (Uttley et al.
"2002), hence will not distort the shape of PSDs."
"The periodogram obtained using equation (1), known"
"as the ‘raw’ periodogram, provides a noisy estimate of"
the spectral power as it consists of independently dis-
tributed χ2 variables with two degrees of freedom (DOF)
(Timmer & Koenig 1995; Papadakis & Lawrence 1993;
"Vaughan et al. 2003). Therefore, a number of PSD esti-"
mates should be averaged in order to obtain a reliable es-
timate of the spectral power. The periodograms falling
within a factor of 1.6 in frequency range are averaged
with the representative frequency taken as the geomet-
ric mean of each bin (Isobe et al. 2015; Goyal et al. 2017;

riodograms as

. (3)"
This offset is the expectation value of χ2 distribution
"with 2 DOF in log-log space and is equal to −0.25068
which is added to the observed periodograms (Vaughan"
2005).
3.2. Estimation of the spectral shape: PSRESP method
Since the aim of the present study is to derive shapes
"of intranight PSDs, we use the ‘power spectral response’"
"(PSRESP) method (e.g., Uttley et al. 2002; Chatterjee"
et al. 2008; Max-Moerbeck et al. 2014; Isobe et al. 2015;
Meyer et al. 2019; Goyal 2020) which further mitigates
the deleterious effects of red-noise leak and aliasing. In
"this method, an (input) PSD model is tested against the"
observed PSD. The estimation of best-fit model param-
eters and their uncertainties is performed by varying
"the model parameters. To achieve this, a large num-"
ber of light curves are generated with a known underly-
ing power-spectral shape using Monte Carlo (MC) sim-
ulations. Rebinning of the light curve to mimic the
sampling pattern and interpolation is performed for the
DFT application. The DFT of such light curve gives
the distorted PSD due to effects mentioned above. Av-
eraging large number of such PSDs gives the mean of
the distorted model (input) power spectrum. The stan-
dard deviation around the mean gives errors on the mod-
eled (input) power spectrum. The goodness of fit of the
"model is estimated by computing two functions, similar"
"to χ2, defined as"
χ2obs =
"νk=νmax∑
νk=νmin"
[log10 Psim(νk)− log10 Pobs(νk)]2
"∆log10 Psim(νk)
2"
"χ2dist,i ="
"νk=νmax∑
νk=νmin"
"[log10 Psim(νk)− log10 Psim,i(νk)]2"
"∆log10 Psim(νk)
2"
"where logPobs and logPsim,i are the observed and"
"the simulated log-binned periodograms, respectively."
logPsim and ∆logPsim are the mean and the standard
deviation obtained by averaging a large number of PSDs;
k represents the number of frequencies in the log-binned
"power spectrum (ranging from νmin to νmax), while i"
runs over the number of simulated light curves for a
given β.
"Here χ2obs determines the minimum χ
2 for the model"
compared to the data and the χ2dist values determine the
goodness of the fit corresponding to the χ2obs. We note
"that χ2obs and χ
2
dist are not the same as a standard χ"
2 dis-
tribution because log10 Pobs(νk)’s are not normally dis-
tributed variables since the number of power spectrum
estimates averaged in each frequency bin are small (Pa-
"padakis & Lawrence 1993). Therefore, a reliable good-"
"ness of fit is computed using the distribution of χ2dist
values. For this, the χ2dist values are sorted in ascending"
"order. The probability or pβ , that a given model can be"
rejected is then given by the percentile of χ2dist distribu-
"tion above which χ2dist is found to be greater than χ
2
obs"
for a given β (success fraction; Chatterjee et al. 2008). A
large value of pβ represents a good–fit in the sense that
a large fraction of random realizations of the model (in-
put) power spectrum are able to recover the shape of
"the intrinsic PSD. Therefore, this analysis essentially"
uses the MC approach toward a frequentist estimation
of the quality of the model compared to the data. This
is a well-known approach to estimate the goodness of fit
"when the fitting statistic is not well understood (see, for"
"details, Press et al. 1992)."
"In this study, the light curve simulations are per-"
formed using the method of Emmanoulopoulos et al.
(2013) which preserves the probability density function
(PDF) of the flux distribution as well as the underlying
power spectral shape. In addition to assuming the power
"spectral shape, the method requires supplying a value of"
mean and standard deviation (σ) of the flux values to
reproduce the flux distribution and match the variance
(Meyer et al. 2019). We have assumed single power-law
PSDs with a given β (to reproduce the PSD shape) and
supplied mean and σ of the logarithmically transformed
flux values which is found to be an adequate represen-
"tation of flux distribution on shorter (.days) timescales
for a few cases (e.g., H. E. S. S. Collaboration et al. 2010;"
"Kushwaha & Pal 2020). For this purpose, the mean"
and the σ are computed by fitting a Gaussian function
"to the flux distribution. Finally, the measurement errors"
in the simulated flux values were incorporated by adding
a Gaussian random variable with mean 0 and standard
deviation equal to the mean error of the measurement
uncertainties on the observed flux values (Meyer et al.
"2019; Goyal 2020). In such a manner, 1,000 light curves"
"are simulated in the β range 0.1 to 4.0, with a step"
Optical intranight variability PSDs 13
of 0.1 for each observed light curve. For the simulated
"light curve, the periodograms are derived in an identical"
manner as that of the observed light curve (Section 3.1).
The best-fit PSD slope for the observed PSD is given by
the one with the highest pβ value and the uncertainty is
given as 2.354σ of the pβ curve where σ is the standard
deviation of fitted Gaussian. This gives roughly a 98%
confidence limit on the best-fit PSD slope.
Details on the intranight light curves used for the anal-
"ysis and the derived PSDs, along with the best-fit PSDs"
"and the maximum pβ , are summarized in Table 2. Fig-"
"ure 1 presents the analyzed light curves (panel a), the"
corresponding best-fit PSD (panel b) and the probabil-
ity distribution curves (pβ as a function of β; panel c)
for the duration of the light curve down to the mean
sampling intervals for the given light curve. In our anal-
"ysis, we have not subtracted the constant noise floor"
level (shown by the dashed horizontal lines in panel b
"of the figure), as some of the data points are below this"
level. The PSRESP method also allows us to compute
the rejection confidence for the input PSD shape; the
maximum probability lower than 10% means that the
rejection confidence (1–pβ value) is higher than 90% for
"the (input) PSD model. In our analysis, we use pβ<0.1"
"as a rejection threshold for the the model, meaning that"
the input spectral shape does not provide a good fit to
the PSD. The distribution of acceptable PSD slopes is
shown in Figure 2. The mean of a sample is computed
in a straightforward manner while the error on the mean
is computed using the MC bootstrap method as follows.
"For each sample, the β is drawn from a Gaussian distri-"
bution of mean and standard deviation equal to β and
error/2.354 (note that Table 2 reports errors equal to
2.354σ). The mean β is computed. These two steps
are repeated 500 times. The error is given as the stan-
dard deviation of the distribution of mean β values. In
"addition, we provide the νk P (νk) vs. νk curves in Fig-"
"ure 3 for blazars observed on more than one occasion, to"
compare the ‘square’ fractional variability on timescales
probed by our analysis (Goyal 2020).
4. RESULTS
"In this study, we have derived the optical intranight"
"variability PSDs of the blazar sources, covering the tem-"
poral frequency range from 100.52 day−1 to 101.99 day−1
"(timescales corresponding to 7.4 hours and ∼15 min-
utes). The intranight light curves showed modest in-"
tranight variability with peak–to–peak variability am-
"plitudes, >1–15%, occasionally rising to over 15%, over"
the span of observations. Our main results are the fol-
lowing:
"1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4
0"
"Total( =2.9 0.3)
BL Lacs( =3.1 0.3)
FSRQs( =2.6 0.4)"
"Figure 2. Histograms of the best-fit PSD slopes derived for
the entire blazar sample (cyan line; 10 sources and 19 moni-
toring sessions), BL Lacs (red line; seven sources and 13 mon-
itoring sessions), and FSRQs (blue line; three sources and six
monitoring sessions), respectively. The sample mean along
with 1σ uncertainty estimated using the bootstrap method
for different groups is given in parentheses (see Section 3.2)."
1. Out of the 29 intranight light curves analyzed in
"the present study, the PSDs shows an acceptable"
fit to the single power-law spectral shapes for 19
monitoring sessions (see Section 3.2). The maxi-
mum pβ is higher than 10% and reaches as high as
100% for these sessions (column 10; Table 2; panel
c of Figure 1).
"2. For these 19 acceptable PSD fits, the simple"
power-law slopes range from 1.4 to 4.0 (albeit with
a large scatter); consistent with a statistical char-
"acters of red (β∼2) and black (β≥3) noise stochas-
tic processes (Table 2, Figure 2). The mean β"
"turns out to be 2.9±0.3 (1σ uncertainty) for blazar
sources."
3. The computed mean value PSD slopes for the BL
Lac objects (seven sources and 13 light curves)
and FSRQs (three sources and six light curves)
"are 3.1±0.3 and 2.6±0.4, respectively; consistent
with one another within 1σ uncertainty (Figure 2)."
4. The PSD slopes for a few sources whose intranight
PSDs show an acceptable fit to single power-law on
multiple occasions are consistent with each other
(column 9; Table 2).
5. The normalization of the PSDs for the sources
monitored on different epochs turns out to be con-
sistent with each another within 1σ uncertainty for
"the blazars 1156+295, 1219+285. However, one"
order of magnitude change is noted in the normal-
ization of PSDs between 2003 November 19 and

Our PSD analysis using the PSRESP method returns
rejection confidence higher than 90% for 10 out of the
29 analyzed lightcurves. These are: 0235+164 on 1999
"November 12 and 14, and 2003 November 18, 0716+714"
"on 2005 February 1, OJ 287 on 2005 April 12, 1011+496

on 2002 March 16, 3C 279 on 2009 April 20, 1510−089
on 2009 May 1 (Table 2). This is due to the fact that"
"for the majority of these light curves, the intensity vari-"
"ations are essentially monotonic, i.e., a steady rise or fall"
without any other feature over the span of observations.
This means that PSD model with β >4 could fit the ob-
served PSDs better over the temporal frequency range
probed by the observations.
"Next, we note that the reported 98% confidence lim-"
"its on the acceptable best-fit PSD slopes are large, in"
"general (Table 2), and in some cases, larger than the"
"value itself. These are: 0109+224 on 2005 October 29,"
"0420−014 on 2009 October 25, 0806+524 on 2005 Febru-
ary 4, 1011+496 on 2010 February 19, and 1156+295 on"
2012 April 1. A possible cause of this could be the lim-
ited number of data points in the studied light curves
(20–67; column 4 of Table 2). Aleksić et al. (2015) stud-
ied the effects of changing the number of data points in
the light curve and the estimation of the best-fit PSD
slope (and uncertainty) using the long-term multiwave-
"length light curves having ≥30 data points for the blazar
Mrk 421. They note that the location of the maximum"
in the probability distribution curve does not change
"noticeably for different binning factors but the width,"
"shape, and amplitude change significantly; however, it"
is unclear if the broadening of the probability distribu-
tion curve and hence the estimation of the uncertainty in
the best-fit PSD slope is related to the gradual increase
"of binning factors (i.e., a decrease of a number of data"
"points) for different light curves (see, Figure 4 of Aleksić"
"et al. 2015). Also, we note that the reported uncertain-"
ties on the best-fit X-ray intra-night PSD slopes using
"the PSRESP method also show large scatter, despite"
having >300 data points in the examined light curves for
"the AGNs Mrk 421, PKS 2155−304, and 3C 273 (Table
4 of Bhattacharyya et al. 2020). Therefore, we conclude"
that a limited number of data points do not play a sig-
nificant role in assessing the uncertainties of the spectral
shape parameters using the PSRESP method.
5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
We report the first systematic study to characterize
the intranight variability PSD properties comprising of
Optical intranight variability PSDs 15
"14 blazar sources and 29 densely sampled light curves,"
"covering timescales from several hours to ∼15 minutes.
All the analyzed light curves were of duration ≥ 4 hours
(except for the BL Lac 0716+714 for which duration was"
"∼1.5 hr) and could be obtained with measurement accu-
racies .0.2–0.5% in 5–15 minutes of integration time us-
ing the 1–2 m class telescopes irrespective of blazar flux"
"state, sky brightness or atmospheric conditions. The in-"
tranight monitoring sessions were scheduled solely based
on the target’s availability in the night sky for a duration
longer than 4 hours from a given telescope site. There-
"fore, the intranight PSDs are derived irrespective of the"
flux state of a blazar. The slopes show a range from
"1.4 to 4.0, indicating that the variability at synchrotron"
emission frequencies has a statistical character of red to
black–noise stochastic process on intranight timescales
with no signs of cutoff at high frequencies due to mea-
surement noise-floor levels arising due to measurement
"uncertainties. The mean β for the entire sample is ∼2.9,
indicating a steeper than red-noise character preference"
of the variability. Our crude estimates of mean β’s for
the BL Lacs and the FSRQs subclasses (due to the small
number of sources and the intranight light curves ana-
"lyzed) give ∼3.1 and 2.6, respectively. These two esti-
mates are comparable with each other, indicating that"
processes driving the variability occur in non-thermal
jets for these sources and not in the accretion disk which
"could be dominant in FSRQs at optical frequencies (e.g.,"
"Ghisellini et al. 2017, see, however, Mangalam & Wiita"
"1993, for models relating variability due to hot spots or"
instabilities in accretion disk resulting in β =1.4 to 2.1).
The majority of obtained slopes could be reconciled if
the intranight fluctuations are driven by changes in the
"bulk Lorentz factors of the jet, provided that the turbu-"
lence is dominant on smaller than few minutes timescales
"(β∼2.1–2.9; Pollack et al. 2016).
The PSD slopes obtained in this analysis can be di-"
rectly compared with Wehrle et al. (2019) who derived
blazar/AGN PSDs using the Kepler-satellite data with
"long duration (>75 days), nearly uniformly sampled"
light curves with sampling intervals 30 minutes (long–
cadence) and 1 minute (short cadence data for the blazar
"OJ 287), respectively. First, the PSD slopes obtained for"
their sample using the long–cadence data range between
"β ∼1.8 and 3.8 and covers temporal frequencies be-
tween log νk∼-6.5 Hz and ∼-5.0 Hz with the slope tend-
ing to white noise at higher frequencies (timescales ≤18
hours). Second, the PSDs slopes obtained for the BL"
Lacs and FSRQ types are indistinguishable from one an-
other within this frequency range. Their results are com-
"parable to ours (see above), even though our analysis"
cover variability frequencies higher than Kepler’s long–
"cadence data (∼1.5 decades in frequency range down to
sub–hour timescales). Moreover, using short–cadence"
"data for the blazar OJ 287, they obtain β ∼2.8 in the
frequency range log νk = −2.7 Hz to −5.7 Hz with the
PSD flattening to white-noise at νk ≥ 10−2.7 Hz. Our
intranight PSD slopes for the OJ 287, obtained on three"
"separate occasions, are 3.8, 2.9, and 3.1, respectively,"
consistent with their result on overlapping variability
frequencies (Table 2).
"In Goyal et al. (2017), Goyal et al. (2018), and Goyal"
"(2020), based on PSD analyses of long-term variability"
"using decade–long GHz–band radio–to–TeVγ−ray light
curves of a few selected blazar sources, we hypothe-"
sized that the broadband emission is generated in an
extended yet highly turbulent jet. The variability ap-
peared to be driven by a single stochastic process at
synchrotron frequencies but seemed to require the lin-
ear superposition of two stochastic processes at IC fre-
"quencies with relaxation timescales ≥1,000 days and ∼
days, respectively. Stochastic fluctuations in the lo-"
"cal jet conditions (e.g., velocity fluctuations in the jet"
plasma or magnetic field variations) lead to energy dis-
sipation over all spatial scales. The radiative response
of the accelerated particles is delayed with respect to
the input perturbations and this forms the red–noise
segment of the PSD at synchrotron frequencies. At IC
"frequencies, however, due to inhomogeneities in the lo-"
"cal photon population available for upscattering, the ad-"
"ditional relaxation timescale of about ∼ one day, i.e.,
the light crossing time of the emission region, can re-"
"sult in a jet with Doppler boosting factor, 30, forming"
the pink-noise segment of the PSD. The steeper than
red–noise PSD slopes on intranight timescales obtained
in this analysis against the strict red–noise character of
"long–term variability at optical frequencies (β ∼2; Chat-
terjee et al. 2008; Goyal et al. 2017; Nilsson et al. 2018;"
"Goyal 2020), indicate a cutoff of variability power on"
"timescales around ∼days. We note that such a cutoff of
variability power on timescales ∼days have been noted
in the X–ray PSD of the blazar Mrk 421 for which the X-"
"ray emission, although it originates in the non-thermal"
"jet, it is believed that the variability process is driven by"
accretion disk processes (Chatterjee et al. 2018). More-
"over, our conclusion is only tentative, as joint analysis of"
full variability spectrum using long-term and intranight
"data, covering many orders of frequencies without gaps,"
is needed to reach robust conclusions. The normaliza-
tion of PSDs for a few sources which were monitored
on multiple occasions turns out to be consistent with
one another within 1σ uncertainty with a few excep-
"tions. For the blazars 0420−014, OJ 287 and 3C 279,
the normalization changes by one order of magnitude"
16 A. Goyal
between different epochs (Figure 3). This indicates a
hint of non-stationarity of the variability process on in-
tranight timescales (similar conclusions are obtained for
the intranight X–ray variability of the blazar Mrk 421
for which the intranight light curves are modeled as a
non-stationary stochastic process; Bhattacharyya et al.
2020).
"At this point, we note that the duty cycle of in-"
tranight blazar variability at optical frequencies is found
"to be ∼40% when monitored for a duration >4 hours
and measurement accuracies 0.2–5% in few minutes of"
"integration time (Goyal et al. 2013a). Almost always,"
these blazars are variable on longer timescales (>days
to years; Stalin et al. 2004; Sagar et al. 2004; Gopal-
Krishna et al. 2011; Goyal et al. 2012) which exhibits
a red–noise character down to a few days timescales
"(see above). However, ∼60% of the monitoring ses-
sions, these sources turned out to be non-variable at"
short timescales meaning that small-scale flux variabil-
"ity, if present, is below the measurement uncertainties."
"This would imply, occurring intermittently, a cutoff of"
"variability power on timescales longer than ∼0.5 day.
Neglecting these cases clearly introduces a bias in the"
understanding of these results as the PSDs are de-
rived only when the statistically significant variability is
found. The implication would be that the energy dissi-
pation processes within the jet generating the flux varia-
tions on these timescales are transitory in nature and as
such should be taken into consideration when modeling
the jet emission and its variability down to intranight
"timescales (see, in this context, Pollack et al. 2016, who"
derives the PSDs over 5 decades of temporal frequency
range down to days timescale).
"Finally, we note that variability timescales smaller"
than the light–crossing time of the event horizon of the
SMBH provide natural scales for the cutoff of variabil-
ity if the dominant particle acceleration mechanism arise
"from disturbances or instabilities near the jet base (∼16
minutes for a 108 solar mass SMBH; Begelman et al."
2008). Using the black hole masses of blazars studied
"here (column 7; Table 1), the light crossing time of the"
"event horizon ranges from ∼4 minutes for the smallest
SMBH mass of the blazar 1219+285 to ∼2 hours for the
largest SMBH mass for blazars 0420−014, 1156+295,
0806+524, and 3C 279, respectively. These timescales"
"translate to ∼24 seconds–12 minutes in the observer’s
frame assuming typical bulk Lorentz factor, 10, for the"
jet plasma (Lister et al. 2016). Such timescales are not
"covered by us, given the typical sampling intervals ∼5–
15 minutes. This will be explored in future studies with"
dedicated blazar monitoring programs on >2 m aper-
ture telescopes enabling flux measurements down to sub-
percent accuracies in a few seconds of integration time
to reach the smallest energy dissipation sites in jets.
