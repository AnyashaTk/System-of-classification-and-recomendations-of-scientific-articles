"ABSTRACT
We present a measurement of average histograms of line-of-sight velocities over pairs of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Since
the histogram can be measured at different galaxy-cluster separations, this observable is commonly referred to as the stacked
phase-space density. We formulate the stacked phase-space density based on a halo-model approach so that the model can be
applied to real samples of galaxies and clusters. We examine our model by using an actual sample of massive clusters with
known weak-lensing masses and spectroscopic observations of galaxies around the clusters. A likelihood analysis with our
model enables us to infer the spherical-symmetric velocity dispersion of observed galaxies in massive clusters. We find the
velocity dispersion of galaxies surrounding clusters with their lensing masses of 1.1 √ó 1015 ‚Ñé‚àí1ùëÄÔøΩ to be 1180+83‚àí70 km/s at the
68% confidence level. Our constraint confirms that the relation between the galaxy velocity dispersion and the host cluster mass
in our sample is consistent with the prediction in dark-matter-only N-body simulations under General Relativity. Assuming that
the Poisson equation in clusters can be altered by an effective gravitational constant of ùê∫eff , our measurement of the velocity
dispersion can place a tight constraint of 0.88 < ùê∫eff/ùê∫N < 1.29 (68%) at length scales of a few Mpc about 2.5 Giga years ago,
where ùê∫N is the Newton‚Äôs constant."

1 INTRODUCTION
"Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe. The abundance of clusters at different redshifts as a function of
their masses is known to be a powerful probe of gravitational growth in cosmic mass density as well as expansion history of our universe
(e.g. Allen et al. 2011, for a review). Although previous astronomical surveys at different wavelengths have enabled us to construct a large
sample of galaxy clusters, the constraining power of cosmological analyses with clusters is currently limited by the uncertainty in estimates of
cluster masses (e.g. Vikhlinin et al. 2009; Rozo et al. 2010; Mantz et al. 2014; Planck Collaboration et al. 2016b; de Haan et al. 2016; Bocquet
et al. 2019; Abbott et al. 2020). Ongoing and upcoming surveys will further increase the number of galaxy clusters (e.g. Merloni et al. 2012;
Abazajian et al. 2016), allowing us to measure the cluster abundance with a high precision. Hence, an accurate estimate of individual cluster
masses is an important and urgent task in studies of galaxy clusters.
Since the first application to the Coma cluster (Zwicky 1937), kinematics of galaxies in a cluster has been commonly used to infer the"
"cluster mass so far. We refer to the mass estimate by galaxy kinematics as the dynamical mass. The underlying assumption in the dynamical
mass estimate is that the motions of galaxies inside a cluster is a good tracer of the gravitational potential in the system. A set of cosmological
N-body simulations has shown that the velocity dispersion of N-body particles inside cluster-sized halos exhibits a tight correlation to the true
halo masses with a small scatter, regardless of assumed cosmological models (Evrard et al. 2008). In practice, there are several complicating
factors to use the kinematic information of member galaxies as a proxy of the cluster mass. Biviano et al. (2006) have studied possible biases
of the dynamical mass estimate based on the velocity dispersion of member galaxies with a hydrodynamical simulation. They found that the
degree in the mass bias depends on the number of member galaxies used. High-resolution zoom-in simulations of galaxy clusters have revealed
that the scaling relation between the velocity dispersion of galaxies and the true cluster mass can differ from the dark-matter counterpart, and
that the difference depends on the selection of member galaxies (Lau et al. 2010; Munari et al. 2013; Armitage et al. 2018). Besides the bias,"

"Saro et al. (2013) have shown that projection effects of galaxies selected by spectroscopic observations can make the scatter in the scaling
relation larger. White et al. (2010) also found that the velocity dispersion in the line-of-sight direction can be correlated with the orientation of
large-scale structures around clusters.
Apart from the dynamical mass estimate on an individual basis, galaxy kinematics in high-density environments provides a means of testing"
"the theory of gravity. Numerical simulations have shown that velocity statistics of galaxies around clusters have a great potential to test gravity
on non-linear scales (Schmidt 2010; Lam et al. 2012; Hellwing et al. 2014; Zu et al. 2014). For a comprehensive search of modifications of
gravity, it is essential to investigate the kinematics of galaxies outside the virial region of clusters, because a wide class of modified gravity
theories can reduce to General Relativity (GR) in high-density regions (e.g. Baker et al. 2019, for a review). However, galaxy kinematics in the
outskirts of clusters is subject to projection effects on a cluster-by-cluster basis. Wojtak et al. (2011) have demonstrated that a stacking analysis
of the line-of-sight velocity distribution of galaxies around optically-selected clusters can be used to infer the gravitational redshift of light
at scales beyond the cluster virial regime. Lam et al. (2012) have also proposed the velocity dispersion in the stacked distribution at different
galaxy-cluster separations for a robust test of gravity on scales of 1-30 Mpc. The stacked velocity distribution of galaxies around clusters,
referred to as the stacked phase-space density, has drawn much attention as a probe of the average dynamical mass estimate and galactic orbits
in the cluster regime (Wojtak et al. 2009), the physics of star formation quenching (Haines et al. 2015; Adhikari et al. 2019), and large-scale
galaxy infall (Aung et al. 2021; Tomooka et al. 2020).
The stacking analysis of galaxies around clusters in phase space1 contains rich information about structure formation and possible modifi-"
"cations of gravity, whereas its theoretical model is still developing. Wojtak et al. (2009) have developed a theoretical model of the phase-space
density of galaxies inside a cluster by assuming a spherically symmetric system in dynamical equilibrium, while Mamon et al. (2013) have
proposed a fast, efficient method to predict the phase-space density for a given three-dimensional velocity distribution of galaxies in a cluster.
Zu & Weinberg (2013) have studied the pairwise velocity distribution for galaxy-cluster pairs by using a semi-analytic galaxy model, and
have built a phenomenological model of the velocity distribution as a function of galaxy-cluster separation lengths. On the other hand, Lam
et al. (2013) developed a semi-analytic approach based on the halo model (Cooray & Sheth 2002) and the perturbation theory of large-scale
structures. Recently, Hamabata et al. (2019b) have proposed a two-component model of the three-dimensional phase space distribution of halos
surrounding clusters up to 50 ‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc from cluster centres based on N-body simulations.
In this paper, we aim at constraining the velocity dispersion of galaxies within clusters with a measurement of the stacked phase-space"
"density and lensing masses of clusters. For this purpose, we adopt the halo-model prescription as in Lam et al. (2013), while we improve the
previous model so that it can be applied to realistic observational data. In our model, we can include a wide distribution of cluster masses (not
restricted by mass-limited cases), contributions from satellite galaxies in single clusters, and large-scale pairwise velocity statistics between
two halos. We then examine our model with a set of spectroscopic observations of galaxies around low-redshift massive clusters. For the sample
of massive clusters, we use 23 clusters at 0.15 6 ùëß 6 0.30 from the Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS2). For the galaxy sample
around the LoCuSS clusters, we use a highly-complete spectroscopic observation by the Arizona Cluster Redshift Survey (ACReS3). Making
the best use of precise weak-lensing mass estimates of the LoCuSS clusters (Okabe & Smith 2016), we specify key ingredients in our model
such as the cluster mass distribution and the spatial distribution of the ACReS galaxies around the clusters. Through a likelihood analysis, we
infer kinematic information about the ACReS galaxies and compare the simulation-calibrated prediction (Evrard et al. 2008) under a standard
Œõ cold dark matter (ŒõCDM) cosmology. In the end, we study a possible deviation of GR with our measurement of the velocity dispersion of
galaxies with known lensing cluster masses.
The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we describe the observational data of galaxies and clusters used in this paper. We also provide"
"a short summary of N-body simulation data to assess statistical errors of our measurement and calibrate our analytic model in Section 2. In
Section 3, we present an overview of the stacking analysis in phase space, introduce our halo-based model, and set model parameters by using
the observational data. The results are presented in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions and discussions are provided in Section 5. Throughout
this paper, we assume the cosmological parameters which are consistent with the observation of cosmic microwave backgrounds by the Planck
satellite (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016a). To be specific, we adopt the cosmic mass density Œ©m0 = 0.31, the baryon density Œ©b0 = 0.048,
the cosmological constant Œ©Œõ = 1 ‚àí Œ©m0 = 0.69, the present-day Hubble parameter ùêª0 = 100‚Ñé km/s/Mpc with ‚Ñé = 0.68, the spectral index
of primordial curvature perturbations ùëõùë† = 0.96, and the linear mass variance smoothed over 8 ‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc ùúé8 = 0.83. We also refer to log as the
logarithm with base 10, while ln represents the natural logarithm."
2 DATA
"In this section, we describe our observational data set to study the phase-space density of galaxies around massive clusters. Table 1 summarises
the basic property of the cluster sample used in this paper. In addition, we use a public N-body simulation data to estimate our model"
"1 Note that the caustic method (Diaferio & Geller 1997) is closely related to our stacking analysis in phase space. Our theoretical framework can be regarded
as natural extensions of the caustic method. The caustic method measures the velocity dispersion of galaxies as a function of cluster-centric radii ùëÖ, while our
model predicts the distribution of galaxy velocity as a function of ùëÖ.

2.1 LoCuSS
"LoCuSS is a multi-wavelength survey of X-ray luminous clusters at 0.15 6 ùëß 6 0.30 drawn from the ROSATAll Sky Survey cluster catalogues
(Ebeling et al. 1998, 2000; B√∂hringer et al. 2004). The LoCuSS cluster sample consists of 50 clusters and its selection criteria is given by (1)

"‚àöÔ∏Å
Œ©m0 (1 + ùëß)3 +Œ©Œõ with Œ©m0 = 0.3 and Œ©Œõ = 0.7. Full details of the selection"
"function are available in Smith et al. (2016). The sample is therefore purely X-ray luminosity limited and Okabe et al. (2010) shows that the
sample is statistically indistinguishable from a volume-limited sample. The great advantage in the LoCuSS cluster sample is that the precise
estimates of individual weak-lensing masses are available (Okabe et al. 2010; Okabe & Smith 2016). For the mass estimates, we adopt the latest
results in Okabe & Smith (2016), which performed the measurement of weak lensing mass for the LoCuSS clusters with possible systematic
biases of a < 4% level. To be specific, we use the mass estimates based on a fitting of the tangential shear profiles by the Navarro-Frenk-White
(NFW) profile (Navarro et al. 1996, 1997). The fitting has been performed with corrections of the shear calibration and the contamination
of member galaxies (see the fitted results for Table B1 in Okabe & Smith (2016)). Throughout this paper, we define the cluster mass by a
spherical overdensity mass with respect to 200 times the mean mass density in the universe, i.e. ùëÄ200b = 4ùúã/3 √ó 200 √ó ÔøΩÃÑÔøΩm0 ùëü3200b where ÔøΩÃÑÔøΩm0
is the present-day mean mass density and ùëü200b is the halo radius in the unit of comoving distance."
2.2 ACReS
"ACReS is an optical spectroscopic survey programme to observe 30 clusters among the LoCuSS sample with MMT/Hectospec (e.g., Haines
et al. 2015). These 30 clusters were selected from the parent LoCuSS sample on the basis of being accessible to the Subaru telescope on the
nights allocated to ACReS (Okabe et al. 2010). Hence, the cluster selection is not subject to any biases due to the dynamical state of individual
cluster. Target galaxies around the clusters are primary selected by the K-band magnitude of ùëÄ‚àóK (ùëßcl) + 1.5 or brighter, where ùëßcl is the cluster
redshift and ùëÄ‚àóK is the K-band magnitude corresponding to a characteristic galaxy luminosity (Schechter 1976). The selection in ACReS aims
at producing an approximately stellar mass-limited sample down to ùëÄ‚àó ‚àº 2 √ó 1010 ùëÄÔøΩ . Higher priorities are given to target galaxies also
detected at 24`m to obtain a virtually complete census of obscured star formation in the cluster population. For the data set used in this
paper, the spectroscopic observations have been performed across a fixed 52‚Ä≤√ó 52‚Ä≤ field-of-view around each cluster, which corresponds to the"
"MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì?? (2021)"
4 M. Shirasaki et al.
"field-of-view of the UKIRT/WFCam near-infrared imaging data used for the ACReS target selection. Details of the target selection are given
by Haines et al. (2013). Eleven of our 30 clusters were also observed by the Hectospec Cluster Survey (HeCS Rines et al. 2013), providing
redshifts for additional 971 cluster members. Redshifts for further 112, 92 and 49 members of clusters RXJ1720.1+2638, Abell 383 and Abell
209 are included from Owers et al. (2011), Geller et al. (2014) andMercurio et al. (2003), respectively. Because the additional member galaxies
are selected based on optical imaging data, they are not necessarily stellar mass-limited. Nevertheless, we expect that these galaxies do not
affect our results significantly, because they account for only ‚àº 6% of galaxies in the analysis and our theoretical model does not use the
information about stellar masses in a direct manner. In this paper, we only use 23 LoCuSS clusters with the weak-lensing mass inferred by
Okabe & Smith (2016). For our analysis, we only use those redshifts that were classified as secure in the ACReS catalog, meaning that the
measurements were based on the detection of multiple high-significance spectral features. For individual clusters, the numbers of target spectra
and galaxies with secure redshift estimates are shown in Table 1. We use 16701 galaxies around 23 clusters in the stacked analysis."
2.3 hCOSMOS
"To quantify environmental effects around massive clusters, we use the spectroscopic data sets taken in the hCOSMOS survey (Damjanov et al.
2018). The hCOSMOS is the redshift survey of the COSMOS field conducted with the Hectospec spectrograph on the MMT. In the central
1 deg2 of the original COSMOS field, the survey allows us to study > 90% of galaxies with a limiting magnitude of 20.6 in the ùëü band. The
hCOSMOS survey also includes 1701 new redshifts in the COSMOS field. To mimic an observation of field galaxies in ACReS, we impose
the selection in the hCOSMOS data sets by the stellar mass of each galaxy being ùëÄ‚àó > 2√ó 1010 ùëÄÔøΩ over redshifts. This selection leaves 1061
galaxies available in our analysis. We then define the field galaxies around a cluster by randomly setting an angular position in the COSMOS
field and finding the hCOSMOS galaxies around the randomly-selected pseudo-cluster position across a 52‚Ä≤ √ó 52‚Ä≤ field-of-view. This random
process will be repeated as much as needed for statistical analyses. We find that 10,000 random sampling for each cluster is sufficient to obtain
the converged result for the estimate of statistical errors in the stacked phase-space density of galaxies around the clusters in ACReS."
2.4 a2GC simulation
"The hCOSMOS data is used to evaluate effects of field galaxies in our analysis, while it does not contain the information of cluster members. To
evaluate realistic statistical errors in our analysis, we need to populate a mock cluster in the hCOSMOS data. For this purpose, we use a publicly
available halo catalogue at ùëß = 0.19 provided by the a2GC collaboration4. The halo catalogue has been constructed with the largest-volume
run called a2GC-L run, which consists of 81923 dark matter particles in a box of 1.12 ‚Ñé‚àí1Gpc (see Ishiyama et al. 2015, for details of the
simulations). In the simulations, the following cosmological parameters were adopted: Œ©m0 = 0.31, Œ©b0 = 0.048, Œ©Œõ = 1 ‚àí Œ©m0 = 0.69,
‚Ñé = 0.68, ùëõùë† = 0.96, and ùúé8 = 0.83. These are consistent with Planck (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016a). We work with the halo catalogue
produced with the ROCKSTAR halo finder (Behroozi et al. 2013a) in this paper.
We summarise how to evaluate the statistical error in our measurement of the phase-space density by combining the hCOSMOS data and"
"a2GC halo catalogue in Section 3.4.1. We also use the a2GC halo catalogue to study the pairwise velocity between two distinct dark matter
halos on large scales (see Appendix B)."
3 STACKED PHASE-SPACE DENSITY
"In this section, we summarise basics in the analysis of stacked phase-space density of galaxies around clusters. We also describe a theoretical
framework to predict the stacked phase-space density within the halo-model approach (Cooray & Sheth 2002). Similar theoretical models have
been found in the literature (e.g. van den Bosch et al. 2004; More et al. 2009; van den Bosch et al. 2019)."
3.1 Basics
"Let us assume that we have a sample of galaxy clusters with secure redshift measurements. Then consider a case that we perform a spectroscopic
observation of galaxies around individual clusters. Using the sample of clusters and galaxies, we can produce the histogram of the pairwise
velocity between clusters and galaxies. We denote the histogram asH(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ), where ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ is the estimator of the pairwise velocity for a cluster-galaxy
pair. The pairwise velocity ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ is estimated in the rest frame of individual clusters:"

possible selection effects of galaxies as a function of ùíì in Eq. (3). We expect that our results can be less affected by the selection effects, as

"We here summarise a theoretical model ofH(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ) based on a halo-based approach. In the standard halo model (e.g. Cooray & Sheth 2002, for a

"velocity distribution functions of satellites in the clusters. For the ACReS HOD, we basically use the observational results for photometric
galaxies in the Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam survey (Ishikawa et al. 2020), but calibrate the mass dependence in the satellite HOD by fitting the
number density profile of the ACReS galaxies around individual LoCuSS clusters. Throughout this paper, we assume the number density profile
of the ACReS galaxies in clusters can be expressed as a spherical symmetric NFW profile, while we allow the concentration parameter to be
different from the counterpart in underlying mass density. On the velocity distribution of satellites, we adopt a Gaussian velocity distribution.
We set the dispersion in the Gaussian distribution by assuming dynamical equilibrium in the LoCuSS clusters. We also include the velocity
offset in the Gaussian distribution arising from gravitational redshifts of satellite galaxies in clusters. We refer Secion 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 for details

100 kpc in radius. Therefore we ignore the off-centring effect throughout this paper. Furthermore, we assume that the mass density distribution

Eq. (47) is valid only in the spherically-symmetric approximation. The parameter ùõºùë£ describes possible deviations from the solution of the
Jean equation. The deviation can be caused by asphericity of dark matter halos, violation of the dynamical equilibrium, and a modification of
gravity in cluster regimes. As our fiducial model, we set ùõºùë£ = 1 and ùõΩ = 0. When comparing the pairwise velocity histogram of the ACReS
galaxies at a different ùëüùëù with our model in Section 4, we will infer ùõºùë£ and ùõΩ. Note that previous numerical simulations have shown that the
velocity anisotropy of dark matter increases radially from zero in the central region to ‚àº 0.5 in the outer region (e.g. Carlberg et al. 1997; Cole

Zhao et al. 2013; Kaiser 2013). Hence, one requires careful analyses to constrain the modification of gravity with the measurement of ùõºmean.

3.3.4 Two-halo terms
"In our halo-model framework, the histogram of cluster-galaxy pairwise velocities is given by Eq. (3). This theoretical expression includes the
contributions from pairwise velocity distributions for different halos with their masses of ùëÄ and ùëÄ ‚Ä≤ (denoted as ùëÉhh (ùë£, ùíì, ùëÄ, ùëÄ ‚Ä≤)). Precise
modelling of ùëÉhh (ùë£, ùíì, ùëÄ, ùëÄ ‚Ä≤) has been developed in the literature (e.g. Tinker 2007; Lam et al. 2013; Zu & Weinberg 2013; Bianchi et al.
2016; Kuruvilla & Porciani 2018; Cuesta-Lazaro et al. 2020; Shirasaki et al. 2021), while it is still difficult to predict the pairwise velocity PDF
of dark matter halos over a wide range of halo masses. In this paper, we construct numerical templates for the terms including ùëÉhh (ùë£, ùíì, ùëÄ, ùëÄ ‚Ä≤)
based on the simulation data in Section 2.4. To be specific for our modelling of the pairwise velocity histogram, we require the projected
phase-space density of a halo ùëÄ around another halo ùëÄ ‚Ä≤, which is expressed as"

with simulation data in Appendix B. In the end, we found that the two-halo term is subdominant in the expected phase-space density at the
scale less than 3 Mpc. Nevertheless, we include the contribution from the two halo terms in our analysis for the sake of completeness."

3.4.1 Measurements and error estimates
"To compute the histogram from the observational data, we perform a linear-space binning in ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ in the range of ‚àí5000 6 ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ [km s‚àí1] 6 5000with
the bin width of 200 km s‚àí1. When constructing the velocity histogram, we also impose the selection of galaxy-cluster pairs by their projected
separation length ùëüùëù . We work with a linear-space binning in ùëüùëù and set the bin width of Œîùëüùëù = 1 ‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc. For our observational data set, we
choose the outermost bin of ùëüùëù to be 2 < ùëüùëù [‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc] 6 3. We find that it is difficult to study the velocity histogram at ùëüùëù > 6 ‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc with
a fine bin width of ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ, because the sky coverage of field-of-view for individual clusters is limited and the number of available galaxies decreases
at ùëüùëù > 6 ‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc (see figure 2). In addition, interlopers can become more important at ùëüùëù >‚àº 3 ‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc as shown in Figure 2.
We also estimate the statistical uncertainty in our measurement ofH(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ |ùëüùëù) by using random sampling of the hCOSMOS galaxies and dark"
"matter halos in the a2GC simulation. We first select the angular positions of 23 clusters randomly in the survey area in hCOSMOS. Note that we
keep the redshift distribution of randomly-selected pseudo clusters same as the real counterpart. At the position of a given pseudo cluster, we
populate a cluster-sized halo from the simulation. In this process, we randomly select the cluster-sized halo by following the mass distribution
of Eq. (27). We also add (sub)halos around the cluster-sized halo. We impose the selection cut of the (sub)halos around the simulated clusters
with the halo mass greater than 4.7 √ó 1011 ‚Ñé‚àí1ùëÄÔøΩ and separation smaller than ùëü200b. The mass cut of 4.7 √ó 1011 ‚Ñé‚àí1ùëÄÔøΩ is motivated by the
stellar-to-halo mass relation in Behroozi et al. (2013b). After assigning the mock satellites from the simulation, We include the hCOSMOS
galaxies around 23 mock clusters and then perform the measurement ofH(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ |ùëüùëù). We repeat this process 10,000 times and obtain 10,000 sets
of H(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ |ùëüùëù). Finally, we evaluate the statistical error by the covariance matrix of H(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ |ùëüùëù) over 10,000 realisations. Figure 3 shows the cross
correlation coefficient in our covarianceH(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ |ùëüùëù). The correlation among different bins is found to be <‚àº 0.3 for most cases."
3.4.2 Information contents
"Before showing the main results, we summarise information contents in the phase-space density of the ACReS galaxies around the LoCuSS
clusters with our halo model. We compute the derivative of H(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ |ùëüùëù) with respect to our model parameters at different ùëüùëù . The relevant
parameters are listed in Table 2. The results are shown in Figure 4.
First of all, we emphasise that the velocity histogram H(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ |ùëüùëù) is normalised to as"
"‚à´
dÔøΩÃÇÔøΩH(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ |ùëüùëù) = 1 for different ùëüùëù . This means that our"
"measurements ofH(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ |ùëüùëù) contain less information about the number density of the ACReS galaxies. We find that the concentration of satellite
number density profile (or R in Eq. [33]) has a small impact on our prediction of H(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ |ùëüùëù) as long as R is constrained with a level of ‚àº 10%
(see the top three panels in figure 4)."

"Figure 5. Comparison with the observed pairwise velocity histogram and our best-fit model. In each panel, grey points with error bars represent the pairwise
velocity histogram of ACReS galaxies around 23 LoCuSS clusters at different projected separations ùëüùëù . The blue solid line shows our best-fit model, while the
orange dashed line represents the interloper term. Our model assumes that satellite galaxies are in dynamical equilibrium in clusters and the velocity distribution
of the satellites is expressed as a Gaussian function. The width of Gaussian velocity dispersion can be given as a spherical symmetric solution of the Jeans
equation, while we introduce the mean velocity in the Gaussian distribution by considering gravitational redshifts (Cappi 1995). Hence, the width of the observed
velocity histogram can contain the information about the virial velocity dispersion of the ACReS galaxies in the LoCuSS clusters and the anisotropic parameter
of the galaxy orbits. See Section 3.3.3 for details about our model."
"On the other hand,H(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ |ùëüùëù) should have rich information about the kinematics of satellite galaxies. The ùõºùë£ -dependence ofH(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ |ùëüùëù) is easily
understandable, i.e. larger ùõºùë£ makes the histogram broader. We next consider the dependence of the velocity histogram on ùõΩ. The parameter ùõΩ
controls the anisotropy of satellite orbits and it holds ùõΩ = 0 for the isotropic orbit, ùõΩ > 0 for radial orbits, and ùõΩ < 0 entails tangential orbits.
For the radial velocity dispersion ùúéùëü , one can find larger amplitude of ùúéùëü as ùõΩ increases. In the second top panels in figure 4, we show the
ùõΩ dependence becomes more complicated than that of ùúéùëü . For ùõΩ > 0, the line-of-sight velocity dispersion becomes larger than the isotropic
case toward the centre of host halos, while it becomes smaller at the boundary of virial regions (≈Åokas & Mamon 2001). The parameter ùõºmean
controls the amplitude of the gravitational redshift and shiftsH(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ |ùëüùëù) toward the direction of ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ < 0 as ùõºmean increases.
Figure 4 also shows the dependence of the velocity histogram on Œî logùëÄ and ùõºsat. As Œî logùëÄ increases, a typical halo in our cluster sample"
"becomes more massive and then the velocity dispersion in the stacked phase-space density becomes larger. A similar effect can be seen when
the parameter ùõºsat increases, because more massive clusters become relevant to the stacked phase-space density at larger ùõºsat.
It would be worth noting that an asymmetry around ùë£ = 0 in Figure 4 can be explained by the mass dependence of the gravitational redshifts"
"and the velocity dispersion. Our analytic expression of the stacked phase space density includes the integral over halo masses. Even if the
velocity PDF follows a Gaussian for single halos, the stacked phase space density can be (weakly) non-Gaussian after performing the mass
integral.
In summary, two parameters of ùõºùë£ and ùõΩ can change the histogram at ùëüùëù <‚àº 3 ‚Ñé‚àí1ùëÄÔøΩ predominantly. The dependence of H on ùõºùë£ and ùõΩ"
"is different at various ùëüùëù . This indicates that the phase-space analysis of galaxies around massive clusters can bring rich information about
the kinematics of satellites and possible parameter degeneracies would be less important. Nevertheless, we vary six different parameters to
account for possible degeneracies when comparing our model with the measuredH(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ |ùëüùëù)."

prediction. Our halo-based model is summarised in Section 3.3. The most relevant parameters toH in our model are the amplitude of satellite
velocity (ùõºùë£ ) and the anisotropy parameter of satellite orbits (ùõΩ), while we account for other parameters such as the concentration in the
number density profile of satellites (R), the gravitational redshift (ùõºmean), the mass dependence of the number of satellites (ùõºsat), and possible
systematic mass biases in the lensing measurement (Œî logùëÄ). To constrain those model parameters by using our measurements of H(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ |ùëüùëù),

almost unbiased velocity dispersions with respect to the underlying dark-matter counterparts."
4.2 Implications to a modification of gravity
"We here discuss implications of our measurement to a modification of gravity. In GR, the equivalence principle argues that the velocity
distribution of galaxies and matter in clusters should be same as long as dark matter and galaxies are approximated as collisionless objects.
In this section, we assume that the velocity dispersion of galaxies in clusters with their mass of ùëÄ is simply given by Eq. (54) for the GR
prediction. In other words, we assume no velocity biases between galaxies and dark matter in GR. This assumption has been validated with
the recent hydrodynamical simulation (Armitage et al. 2018). In addition, we assume that the weak lensing masses are not affected by the
modifications of gravity. This assumption is not valid in some of modified gravity theories (e.g. Kobayashi et al. 2015). When placing a limit of
modified gravity theories, we vary the lensing mass in the range of ùëÄ = (1.1 ¬± 0.1) √ó 1015 ‚Ñé‚àí1ùëÄÔøΩ . The error in the lensing mass is evaluated
as the standard deviation of the average mass over 23 LoCuSS clusters. Hence, we take into account the 1ùúé uncertainty in the lensing mass
estimate to constrain modified gravity theories.
Table 3 summarises limits for some of modified gravity theories by our measurements. For comparisons, we include representative limits"
based on different astronomical observations in the table.
4.2.1 Modified Poission equation

"‚àá2Œ¶ = 4ùúãùê∫eff ÔøΩÃÑÔøΩm ùõøm ùëé2, (55)
where Œ¶ is the gravitational potential, ùê∫eff is a modified gravitational constant, ÔøΩÃÑÔøΩm is the mean matter density, ùõøm is the constrast of matter
density, and ùëé is the scale factor in the Friedmann‚ÄìLemaitre‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker metric. It would be worth noting that ùê∫eff can depend on time
and spatial coordinates in general. In the limit of GR, it holds that ùê∫eff ‚Üí ùê∫N, where ùê∫N is the Newton‚Äôs constant.

lensing measurement of the LoCuSS clusters can give an estimate of ùúé1D,GR with Eq. (54), our measurement of ùúé1D places a limit of

comparable to one from large-scale structures (e.g. Simpson et al. 2013; Fert√© et al. 2019; Garcia-Quintero et al. 2020), while relevant physical
scales to our measurement is of an order ofMpc and much shorter than typical scales of large scale structures (10-100Mpc). We here caution
that our analysis still ignores possible impacts on lensing masses by the GR modification when constraining ùê∫eff/ùê∫N."
4.2.2 ùëì (ùëÖ) gravity
"ùëì (ùëÖ) gravity is a class of modified gravity theories where the Lagrangian in this theory involves an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar ùëÖ. In
this gravity theory, an additional scalar degree of freedom is given by ùëìùëÖ ‚â° d ùëì /dùëÖ and introduces a fifth force through its field equation. As a
representative example, we adopt the functional form of ùëì (ùëÖ) as proposed in Hu & Sawicki (2007),"

from GR. Note that the model requires ùëìùëÖ < 0 to be stable under perturbations (Hu & Sawicki 2007). The dynamical mass in this model has

4.2.3 DGP braneworld gravity
"Dvali, Gabadadze, and Porrati (DGP) proposed amodel such that our universe is a (3+1)-brane embedded in five-dimensionalMinkowski space
(Dvali et al. 2000). Gravity in this model becomes five-dimensional at scales larger than the crossover scale ùëüùëê , while it is four-dimensional
at scales shorter than ùëüùëê . This model has two branches of homogeneous cosmological solutions on the brane. One is the self-accelerating
branch allowing the late-time acceleration of the universe without introducing a cosmological constant. Another is the normal branch which
needs dark energy to realise the cosmic acceleration at ùëß <‚àº 1. In this paper, we consider the normal branch because cosmological observables
in the self-accelerating branch are in conflict with the data (e.g Fairbairn & Goobar 2006; Maartens & Majerotto 2006; Fang et al. 2008).
The dynamical mass in the normal branch of DGP (nDGP) has been studied in Schmidt (2010), while the lensing mass is not affected by the
modification of gravity in the DGP model (Schmidt 2009). On sub-horizon scales, gravitational force at scales shorter than ùëüùëê is governed by
two potentials of Œ¶N and ùúô, where Œ¶N is the gravitational potential in GR and ùúô represents an additional scalar potential in this model. For a
spherical symmetric halo, an effective gravitational constant in the nDGP model can be expressed as (Schmidt et al. 2010; Schmidt 2010)"

gravitational interaction in galaxy clusters at relevant scales of ‚àº 3Mpc."
5 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS
"In this paper, we measured average histograms of pairwise velocity of galaxies in and around clusters at different projected cluster-galaxy
separations, referred to as the stacked phase-space density. We employed a halo-model forward-modelling approach for the stacked phase-space
density. In our model, we take into account realistic effects on the phase-space density including a wide distribution of cluster masses, satellite
galaxies in single clusters, and large-scale streaming motions between two different dark matter halos. We specified key ingredients in our
model by using the spectroscopic data of galaxies around the LoCuSS clusters (Haines et al. 2015) with precise weak-lensing mass estimates
(Okabe & Smith 2016). We then performed the stacking analysis of phase-space density around the LoCuSS clusters and made a comparison
with our model. A likelihood analysis enables us to infer kinematics of our galaxy sample in the LoCuSS clusters. We found that the velocity
dispersion of our selected galaxies within the virial region is constrained to be 1180+83‚àí70 km/s at the 68% confidence level at the cluster mass
of (1.1 ¬± 0.1) √ó 1015 ‚Ñé‚àí1ùëÄÔøΩ . Our constraint of the galaxy velocity dispersion is consistent with the prediction by dark-matter-only N-body
simulations under General Relativity (Evrard et al. 2008). Because our galaxy selection is designed to be approximately stellar mass-limited,
our finding confirms recent numerical results in Armitage et al. (2018), showing that stellar mass-limited galaxies can be used as a good tracer
of the gravitational potential inside clusters.
Using our measurement of the galaxy velocity dispersion in clusters with known lensing masses, we put a constraint of possible modifications"
"of gravity. If the Poisson equation at scales of Mpc can be modified with an effective gravitational constant ùê∫eff , our measurement can place
a limit of 0.88 < ùê∫eff/ùê∫N < 1.29 with the 68% confidence level at the halo mass of (1.1 ¬± 0.1) √ó 1015 ‚Ñé‚àí1ùëÄÔøΩ and redshift of 0.2, where
ùê∫N is the Newton‚Äôs constant. This constraint is found to be comparable to the previous limits by large-scale structures (e.g. Simpson et al.
2013; Fert√© et al. 2019; Garcia-Quintero et al. 2020). Furthermore, we found that our constraint of the galaxy velocity dispersion in clusters
gives an upper limit of an additional scalar field in ùëì (ùëÖ) gravity to be log | ùëìùëÖ (ùëß = 0.2) | < ‚àí4.57 (68%), where ùëìùëÖ is the scalar field in the
ùëì (ùëÖ) gravity. For the braneworld gravity proposed in Dvali et al. (2000) (known as the normal branch of DGP), our measurement requires the
crossover distance on the brane to be larger than 253 ‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc at the 68% confidence level. Our limits of ùëì (ùëÖ) and DGP gravity models are
broadly consistent with the previous results by measurements of intracluster medium (e.g. Terukina et al. 2014; Wilcox et al. 2015) as well as
the large-scale structures (e.g. Raccanelli et al. 2013).
Our stacking analysis in phase space uses 16071 galaxies around 23 LuCuSS clusters, allowing us to measure the bulk velocity dispersion"
"with a 7% level precision. To further tighten the constraint of modified gravity, future observations of stacked phase-space density need to
increase number of clusters as well as spectroscopic observations of galaxies around each cluster. As the statistical uncertainty becomes smaller,
we require more detailed analysis to test gravity. Possible velocity offsets between BCGs and their host halos induced by mergers (e.g. Martel
et al. 2014) and scale dependences of the velocity anisotropy ùõΩ are not included in our framework. It would be worth noting that small spatial
offsets between BCGs and their host halos do not necessarily imply small velocity offsets (Skibba et al. 2011). The distribution of galaxies at
the edge of cluster boundaries can be more complicated than our model predictions. The sharp truncation in galaxy density profiles at cluster
outskirts has been observed (e.g. More et al. 2016; Chang et al. 2018; Murata et al. 2020; Bianconi et al. 2020), while infall galaxies onto
clusters can have non-Gaussian velocity distributions (Hamabata et al. 2019a; Aung et al. 2021). Our model can not account for these effects
correctly, because the mass accretion history of individual clusters plays an important role in determining properties of galaxies at cluster
outskirts (e.g. More et al. 2015). More spectroscopic observations play a central role in verifying the presence of infall galaxies in and around
galaxy clusters. A joint analysis with stacked weak lensing is promising to explore a broad range of modified gravity models (e.g. Barreira
et al. 2015; Terukina et al. 2015), but a more precise estimation of statistical errors will be demanded."

APPENDIX A: A LIKELIHOOD ANALYSIS FOR THE HALO OCCUPATION DISTRIBUTION OF SATELLITE GALAXIES
"We here summarise how to infer the halo occupation distribution of satellites in single clusters with a likelihood analysis. For this purpose, we
use the scatter plot between the observed number of satellites and lensing masses as in Section 3.3.2 (see Figure 1). We assume that the average
number of satellites in clusters withùëÄ can be given by Eq. (31). Fixing the parameters of logùëÄ0 [‚Ñé‚àí1ùëÄÔøΩ] = 8.63 and logùëÄ1 [‚Ñé‚àí1ùëÄÔøΩ] = 13.5,
we perform a likelihood analysis to constrain ùõºsat for the distribution in ùëÅùëÄ , where ùëÅùëÄ is the observed number of satellites in a cluster.
Assuming that ùëÅùëÄ follows a Poisson distribution, we compute the likelihood function as"

APPENDIX B: TWO HALO TERMS FOR PHASE-SPACE DENSITY BASED ON NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS
"In this appendix, we describe how to estimate the two-halo term in our halo model of phase-space density in Eq. (49). Suppose that we have a
catalogue of dark matter halos in a cubic box with the length on a side being ùêøbox. To estimate Eq. (49) from the halo catalogue, we employ a
distant-observer approximation and set an axis in the simulation box to be the line-of-sight direction.We denote ùë•3 as the line-of-sight direction.
To compute the function Fhh, we perform a binning in ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ, ùëüùëù , ùëÄ , and ùëÄ ‚Ä≤. The bin widths for four quantities are referred to as ŒîÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ, Œîùëüùëù , ŒîùëÄ ,
and ŒîùëÄ ‚Ä≤, respectively. We first find a set of halos with their mass of ùëÄùëñ ‚àí ŒîùëÄ/2 6 ùëÄ < ùëÄùëñ + ŒîùëÄ/2 where ùëÄùëñ is the ùëñ-th mass bin. We refer
these halos as ùëñ-th primary sample. We then count the number of halos with their mass of ùëÄ ‚Ä≤"
"ùëó

"ùëó
+ ŒîùëÄ ‚Ä≤/2 around the ùëñ-th"
"primary sample. We perform the number count over the range of ‚àíùêøbox/2 < ùëü ‚Äñ < ùêøbox/2 by imposing the cut of ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ = [ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩùõº ‚àí ŒîÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ/2, ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩùõº + ŒîÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ/2]
and ùëüùëù = [ùëüùëù,ùõΩ ‚àíŒîùëüùëù/2, ùëüùëù,ùõΩ +Œîùëüùëù/2], Note that we need to count the halo pair as a function of the observed pairwise velocity between two
halos. We work with the periodic boundary condition for the pair counting. For a given pairwise velocity ùë£hh, the observed velocity is set by
ùë£hh + ùêª (ùëß)/(1 + ùëß)ùëü ‚Äñ . Through these processes, we can have a numerical table for the number of pairs as a function of ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩùõº, ùëüùëù,ùõΩ , ùëÄùëñ , and ùëÄ ‚Ä≤ùëó .
Given the table of N(ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩùõº, ùëüùëù,ùõΩ , ùëÄùëñ , ùëÄ ‚Ä≤ùëó ), we estimate Eq. (49) as"

"In the figure, we adopt the fiducial values of our model parameters as listed in Table 2 and assume no interlopers at background/foreground of
clusters. We find that the two-halo terms can be safely ignored in our model, as long as we limit the range of ùëüùëù to be less than ‚àº 3 ‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc."
