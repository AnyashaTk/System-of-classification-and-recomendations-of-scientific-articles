"We study gravitational wave (GW) emission in the strong-field regime by a hierarchical triple
system composed of a binary system placed in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). The
LIGO-Virgo collaboration recently reported evidence for coalescences with this dynamical origin.
These systems are common in galactic centers and thus are a target for the space-based LISA
mission as well as other advanced detectors. Doppler shifts, aberration, lensing and strong amplitude
modulations are features present in the GW signal from these systems, built into our framework
and with no need for phenomenological patches. We find that the binary can resonantly excite the
quasinormal modes of the SMBH, as in the resonant excitation of two tuning forks with matching
frequencies. The flux of energy crossing the SMBH horizon can be significant, when compared with
that from standard extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. Therefore, these triple systems are excellent probes
of strong-field physics and of the BH nature of compact objects."
"Introduction. Since the birth of the gravitational-wave
(GW) era in 2015 [1], dozens of GW events have been
detected [2]. Other detectors will soon join the ground-
based network and further improve our ability to mea-
sure GWs in the 1− 103 Hz frequency range [3, 4]. The
space-based LISA mission will extend detection to the
∼ 10−5 − 10−1 Hz window. GWs with these frequen-
cies are emitted in galactic centers by supermassive black
holes (SMBHs) and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EM-
RIs), but also by cosmological sources [5, 6]. The cover of
such a broad spectrum will allow us to test General Rela-
tivity with unprecedented precision over a wide range of
scales, and to answer questions regarding the nature of
compact objects, of dark matter and dark energy [5, 6]."
"However, recent results question the validity of the
“standard” binary system. During its third observation
run, the LIGO-Virgo collaboration detected three BH bi-
nary coalescences [7–10], unlikely to be composed by two
first-generation BHs [11, 12]. Instead, their components
are thought to be remnants of previous coalescences,
forming what is called a “hierarchical merger” [9, 11–
14]. Generally, these require the presence of a third
body to induce coalescence. The Zwicky Transient Fa-
cility [15, 16] reported an electromagnetic counterpart
to one of these events, GW195021 [17], consistent with
the presence of the BH binary in an active galactic nuclei
(AGN) [18–22], reinforcing the claim that its components
were part of a hierarchical triple system. “Hierarchical”
here refers to the distinct length scales between the orbit
of the BH binary and the one of its center-of-mass (CM)
around the third body. Hierarchical triple systems are
common in a variety of astrophysical scenarios, such as,
globular clusters [13, 23], AGNs [18, 24–26], and other
dense stellar environments [27–29]. Around 90% of low
mass binaries with periods shorter than 3 days are ex-
pected to belong to some hierarchical structure [30–32]."
"The above motivated recent studies on the dynamics
and GW emission in hierarchical triple systems Kozai-
Lidov resonances, in particular, have attracted some at-
tention [33–35]. These describe secular changes in the bi-
nary eccentricity and inclination with respect to the orbit
described by its CM around the third object. This mech-
anism triggers periods of high eccentricity (e ∼ 1) where
GW emission increases significantly, potentially inducing
coalescence in eccentric orbits detectable by LISA [36–
39], which may enter the LIGO-Virgo band still at high
eccentricities [23, 40–42]. Moreover, it can lead to GW
bursts at periapsis [43, 44]. A direct integration of the
equations of motion confirms that GWs from these sys-
tems have unique features [44], which may be detected
indirectly via radio observations of binary pulsars [45].
There are also attempts at modeling the effects of a third
body directly into the waveform. These include Doppler
shifts [46–50], relativistic beaming effects [51, 52], grav-
itational lensing [53, 54] and other dynamical effects in
triple systems caused by the third-body [55–57]."
"Studies so far are restricted to the (post-)Newtonian
regime and cannot capture strong-field effects. Here, we
take a first step towards this direction, and investigate
GWs from binaries around SMBHs. Our methods can
probe resonant excitation of quasinormal modes (QNMs)
in triple systems, and capture for free all of the relativistic
effects which have so far been included at a phenomeno-
logical level only. We adopt units where c = G = 1."
"Setup: Hierarchical triple systems. We are inter-
ested in a setup where a small binary (SB) of compact
objects is in the vicinity of a “large” BH (larger than all
the lengthscales of the SB), as illustrated in Fig. 1. The
SB is taken to be a small perturbation in a background
described by the geometry of the massive BH, which in
vacuum must belong to the Kerr family. We use Boyer-
Lindquist coordinates {t, r, θ, ϕ} [58] in our study and"

"The SB is modeled as composed of two point parti-
cles ±. The SB components also carry each a scalar
charge α in our setup, which allows us to study the
scalar radiation problem and compare to the more com-
plex gravitational setup. Results for energy fluxes or
scalar amplitudes scale in a trivial way with α. Since
we will only discuss normalized quantities, the actual
value of the scalar charge α is not relevant. If τ denotes
the proper time of each point particle along the world

First-order perturbations on the Kerr spacetime are"
"described by Teukolsky’s master equation [59] LsΨ =
Σ T , where L is a second-order differential operator, s
refers to the “spin weight” of the perturbation field (e.g.,
s = 0,±2 for scalars and tensors, respectively), and T is
a spin-dependent source term [59]."
"To compute the source T , we need to prescribe the mo-
tion of the SB. We take the CM at r = R(τ) to either be
static at some fixed radius, to describe a timelike equa-
torial circular orbit around a Kerr BH, or then a simple
plunge. For the SB inner motion, we take elliptic orbits
around the CM, such that"
"ϕ± = ΩCMt± �ϕ sinω0t , θ± = π/2± �θ cosω0t , (2)"
"where �θ, �ϕ � 1 parametrize the two axis of the ellipse
δRθ ≡ �θR, δRϕ ≡ �ϕR of the SB and ΩCM is the angular
velocity of the CM. Note that ΩCM and ω0 are coordinate
frequencies, while the proper oscillation frequency of the
SB, ω′0, is obtained by a rescaling with the time compo-
nent of the 4-velocity of the CM, i.e. ω′0 = U"

"concreteness, we focus exclusively on equal-mass binaries,
m±0 = m0 and a highly eccentric orbit with �θ = 0 (we do
not see any qualitatively new phenomena in the general
case; this particular choice could mimic high-eccentricity
binaries driven by Kozai-Lidov resonances)."
A physical relation between �ϕ and ω0 must be im-
"posed. In the SB’s rest frame, δR′ϕ ∝ 1/(ω′0)2/3, where
the prime refers to proper quantities. For SBs on circular
geodesics, for example, doing the appropriate rescaling

"This relation assumes that the scalar charge α is much
smaller than unity and does not affect the motion of the
SB in any meaningful way."
"We are looking for possible resonances in this triple
system, which may happen when the forcing frequency
equals natural frequencies of the system. There are three"
"FIG. 1. Equatorial slice of a spacetime with a hierarchical
triple system, where one component is a central SMBH. We
place a small binary (SB) of frequency ω0 orbiting the SMBH.
At the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), timelike cir-
cular motion is marginally stable. High-frequency GWs are
(semi-) trapped at the light ring (LR). Such motion is unsta-
ble, and can be associated with the “ringdown” excited during
mergers. Among other effects, here we show that the LR can
be excited by tuning ω0."
"important frequencies in the problem: that of the CM,
that of null geodesics on the light ring (LR), and the an-
gular velocity of the BH horizon ΩH = a/(2Mr+) [60].
Close to the BH all are of orderO(1/M), which in fact are
also of the order of the QNM frequencies of the central
BH [61]. To have Mω0 ∼ 1, we need to ensure δRϕ/m0 ∼
(M/m0)"
"2/3. For a SMBH with M ∼ 104 − 106M�,
like Sagittarius A*, and a SB composed by stellar-mass
BHs with m0 ∼ 1 − 100M�, this would correspond to
δR/m0 ∼ 102 − 104. Therefore, the SB can probe the
central BH while still well within the inspiral phase of its
evolution. Note also that even though Teukolsky’s equa-
tion assumes very large mass ratios, results in the liter-
ature have shown that it is able to reproduce Numerical
Relativity for mass ratios of order 10 [62, 63]. Hence, our
results might extend to the case of an intermediate mass
black holes orbiting SMBHs.
Numerical implementation. We used two different
numerical schemes to solve Teukolsky’s equation. One
works in the time domain, and it smooths the pointlike
character of the SB constituents [64–67]. The other tech-
nique is based on separation of angular variables using
spheroidal harmonics [68] in the frequency domain, where
one can apply standard Green function techniques [69–
73]. Both approaches are well documented and have been
widely tested in the past. Both codes were compared
with analytical estimates in the low-frequency regime,
obtained using matched asymptotic techniques [73–75].
Results from these independent codes are consistent with
each other and with analytical estimates.

as a tuning fork, placing it at some fixed radius, with its
CM fixed with respect to distant observers, and letting
its frequency ω0 vary. In flat space, this system radiates"

"Figure 2 shows the behavior of −2R33 as the SB fre-
quency ω0 changes, for an SB sitting at the ISCO of
a SMBH. The behavior is similar for other modes and
fields. We observe a peak which we identify as a reso-
nant excitation of the ` = m = 3 QNM. As shown in
Table I, the location of the peak is well described by the"
"lowest QNM frequency [61], for general binary locations.
When the SB is placed at the LR, the agreement is ex-
cellent (better than 1% for scalars, and 4% for GWs for
the lowest modes `m modes). Recall that QNMs can
be interpreted as waves marginally trapped in unstable
orbits on the photon-sphere [77]. We therefore arrive at
the first result of this paper: a hierarchical triple system
behaves as a driven harmonic oscillator [78], where the
SB is the external harmonic force and the central BH the
(damped) oscillator."
"This behavior is analogous to the Purcell effect in
quantum electrodynamics [79], describing the enhance-
ment in the spontaneous decay of a quantum emitter in-
side a cavity, when its frequency matches those of the
modes of the field inside the cavity. Our results are con-
sistent with recent findings [80], namely that the spatially
independent (i.e. independent of R) contribution to the
power spectrum in Fig. 2 is described by a Lorentzian
curve R ∝ ω2QNM/(ω"
"2
QNM + 4Q"
"2(ω0 − ωQNM)2), where Q
is the quality factor of the central BH. Our results are
consistent with and extend those of Ref. [81], where res-
onant excitation of QNMs was observed for EMRIs in
eccentric orbits, during passage on the periapsis. The ef-
fect is stronger the closer the particle can get to the LR,
as also conclude in Ref. [82]."
"As a rule of thumb, the flux peaks at lower frequencies
the further the SB is placed from the BH, in agreement
with blueshift/redshift corrections. Note that R smaller
than unity does not imply that the system is emitting
less energy than expected, since a portion of the radia-
tion falls into the BH. Also, a possible CM orbital mo-
tion contributes to a shift in the resonant frequencies by
±mΩCM, fully consistent with our results. The maximum
value of R in the entire (R,ω0) parameter space does not
occur precisely at the LR, but close to it. The maximum
is attained at locations R closer to the horizon for large
`. Finally, the magnitude of the resonance grows with `.
For a fixed CM location R and multipole ` we searched
for ω0 for which sR is a maximum sRpeak. We find an
exponential dependence on `, sRpeak ∼ a+ b exp(c · `), at
large ` with a, b, c constants."
"Total integrated flux. Ours is a mode decomposition
in terms of harmonics of the central BH, thus radiation
has support in higher modes as the binary is placed fur-
ther away from it [68, 83]. In general, therefore, the
lowest modes will not be dominant and one needs to sum
a sufficient amount of modes to understand total fluxes.
Already for a SB at the ISCO of a non-rotating BH we
find that the GW flux at infinity is comparable to that
at the horizon of the SMBH. As seen in Fig. 2, the effect
is more dramatic when spin is included, the flux crossing
the horizon can be orders of magnitude larger than that
at infinity, even including superradiant modes [84]. This
peculiar aspect is due to the similar length scales of the
central BH horizon and the radiation wavelength. GWs
are then efficiently absorbed by the BH, in clear contrast
with the inspiral phase of an EMRI, whose wavelength
is much larger than the BH radius. This is our second"

contribution to the signal. The SB crosses r = 10M at t ∼

"result: hierarchical triple systems where the SMBH occu-
pies a large fraction of the SB’s sky will naturally probe
strong field physics, since the fraction of radiation that
falls into the SMBH is non-negligible. This will be essen-
tial for dynamical evolutions of these systems, particu-
larly when accounting for radiation reaction effects."
"For a fixed radius R, the field has support on higher `
modes as the SB is vibrating at higher frequencies ω0. If
the SB is close enough to the BH, it can resonantly excite
the QNMs, leading to characteristic peaks in the flux
at infinity/horizon, as seen in Fig. 2. These structures
correspond to the single multipolar excitations studied in
the previous section.
Waveforms: Doppler, aberration & lensing. As a
by-product of our methods, we can calculate waveforms
from SBs close to SMBHs, which feature interesting rel-
ativistic effects. Figure 3 shows the GW signal produced
when a SB, of constant proper frequency ω′0 falls radi-
ally from rest into a non-rotating SMBH. The signal is
shown for observers sitting along the merger direction,
podal and anti-podal. The observer aligned with the SB
sees it moving away, and a GW signal that is progres-
sively redshifted both kinematically and gravitationally
(the shifts – barely visible to the naked eye, are present
and agree with expectations). An anti-aligned observer
sees a blueshifted signal. As the SB crosses the LR, the
radiation it emits is semi-trapped and the signal rings
down: the large frequency of the signal is still dictated
by the SB, but is now modulated by a low frequency
(∼ 0.19/M) decay (∼ e−0.1t). The parameters of such de-
cay and low-frequency modulation agree remarkably well
with the frequency and damping time of null geodesics
at the LR. Imprints of the binary nature of the SB are
clearly left on the ringdown stage, that differs visibly
from that generated by a point-mass."

"at the ISCO of a non-rotating BH. These are signals cal-
culated from first-principles. We removed the (linear)
CM contribution, which only induces a low-frequency
modulation. Observers on the equatorial plane see gravi-
tational and Doppler-induced frequency shifts, consistent
with analytical predictions [46, 85] when the CM is mov-
ing towards the observer. The amplitude of the wave
can vary by orders of magnitude because of relativistic
beaming [44, 51, 52] and gravitational lensing [54, 86].
The former focuses the radiation along the direction of
motion, and is significant for fast CM motion. The max-
imum amplitude does not occur precisely when the SB
is moving towards the observer (t ∼ 70M in Fig. 4) but
slightly before, when the SB is still behind the BH with
respect to the observer. This is due to lensing by the cen-
tral BH, which distorts the path taken by GWs and con-
centrates radiation on certain directions, amplifying the
signal [87, 88]. This effect is more relevant for larger fre-
quencies, when the radiation wavelength is much smaller
than the BH radius. On the other hand, observers fac-
ing the plane of motion “face-on” (θ = 0) do not mea-
sure such modulations, since the motion of the CM is
now transverse. The only feature is a modulation in am-
plitude coming from the CM motion (at second order),
which has also been reported in Post-Newtonian studies
of triple systems [44]."
"Discussion. We show that a stellar-mass binary system
(or any other radiator) in the vicinity of a SMBH is an
excellent probe of strong gravity. Under special circum-
stances, which require a fine tuning of the system, the
binary can resonantly excite the modes of the SMBH, of-"
"fering a unique opportunity to probe the Kerr geometry
and the presence of horizons in the cosmos. Even if this
fine tuning is not present, the comparable order of mag-
nitude between the SB’s radiation wavelength and the
SMBH horizon radius leads to an enhancement of energy
absorption by the SMBH for any frequency."
"Such classes of hierarchical triple systems are abun-
dant in AGNs, and thus our results have implications
for GW astronomy, in particular for LISA which is spe-
cially designed to detect GWs originated in galactic cen-
ters [6]. While quantifying a detectability rate for the
resonances we described goes beyond the scope of this
work, we can estimate if a SB can get close enough
before being tidally disrupted due to the Hills mecha-
nism [89–91]. This occurs if the tidal forces induced by
the BH overcome the binary’s self gravity, which hap-"
"pens at a radius Rt ∼ 2δR (M/2m0)
1/3"
". The SB fre-
quency will be related to its separation by the Kepler’s
law ω0 ∼"
"√
2m0/δR3. We thus find Rt . 1/(Mω0)"
"2/3M .
Already for Mω0 = 0.2, we find that tidal disruption
happens at Rt ∼ 5.84M , smaller than the ISCO of a
Schwarzschild BH. Thus, SBs very close to a central BH
and oscillating at relevant frequencies of the system have
astrophysical interest. This is supported by more so-
phisticated numerical works [92]. We neglected spin-spin
effects in the motion of the SB. The corrections are pro-
portional to σ = qJ/m20, with J the angular momentum
of the SB [93]. Again using Kepler’s law, one finds that
corrections to the motion scale like σ ∝ q2/3, which are
extremely small for the systems we consider."
"A follow-up to our work is to study the capacity of GW
detectors to distinguish between these systems and iso-
lated binaries. In particular, it is important to quantify
the systematic errors incurred in parameter estimations
from a signal originated in a hierarchical triple, using GW
templates for isolated binaries. Moreover, it is important
to extend our study to other motions. An interesting
case is a SB describing a high-eccentricity orbit around
a spinning SMBH. Such eccentric orbits can be formed"
"naturally in non-trivial environments [94]. In these or-
bits, the SB gets closer to the LR, which enhances the
resonant excitation of the SMBH [81] and may lead to
manifestations of superradiance [84]. Another interesting
triple system is a pair same-sized BHs and a third lighter
compact object orbiting around them. These spacetimes
have been shown to have global properties not present in
isolated BHs (e.g. global QNMs) [95, 96] and our results
suggest that the lighter object can excite these global
modes."
