ABSTRACT
"NGC 1624-2 is an O7f?p star with a reported probable polar magnetic field strength > 20 kG,
which is the strongest magnetic field ever measured in an O-type star. We study the variability
of the mean longitudinal magnetic field 〈�I〉 and the mean field modulus 〈�〉 to obtain
constraints on its field geometry. Only one magnetic pole is observable over the rotation cycle.
The approximately sinusoidal variation of 〈�I〉 and the ratio of the values of the extrema of
〈�〉 indicate that there is an important component of the field that is dipolar. The 〈�I〉 values
measured over the rotation cycle are in the range from −0.2 to 4.5 kG, whereas the values for
〈�〉 vary between 9 and 12 kG. The 〈�I〉 values obtained using the O iii _7455 emission line
are in the range from 0.4 to 2.3 kG and show a variability pattern similar to that detected for
the absorption lines. The fact that the phase of the 〈�I〉 minimum coincides with the phase of
the 〈�〉 maximum, indicates that the field structure must significantly depart from a centred
dipole. Further, we discuss the nature of the observed variable Stokes+ profiles corresponding
to a longitudinal field of negative polarity detected in the emission He i lines and present the
first MHD numerical simulations of the gas flow in the magnetosphere of this star."

1 INTRODUCTION
"Recent observations indicate that probably only a small fraction
of about 7± 3% of O-type stars with masses exceeding 18 M⊙
(Grunhut et al. 2017) and about 6±3% of early B- and O-type stars
(Schöller et al. 2017) have measurable, mostly dipolar magnetic
fields. Among the polarimetrically studied O-type stars, all five
Galactic stars with Of?p classification possess measurable mag-
netic fields. These stars exhibit recurrent, and apparently periodic,
spectral variations in Balmer, He i, C iii, and Si iii lines, sharp emis-
sion or P Cygni profiles in He i and the Balmer lines, and a strong
C iii blend in emission around 4650 Å (Walborn 1972). The pres-
ence of variable emission in the C iii blend and in HU in Of?p stars
is indicative of circumstellar structure, related to their magneto-
spheres. Previous measurements of the mean longitudinal magnetic
field for the O7f?p star NGC 1624-2 carried out with ESPaDOnS
(Echelle SpectroPolarimetric Device for the Observation of Stars)
at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope between 2012 February 1
and 9 indicated 〈�I〉 = 5.35± 0.5 kG with a polar magnetic field
strength of about 20 kG, which is the strongest magnetic field ever
measured in an O-type star (Wade et al. 2012a). All the other Of?p
stars with studied magnetic field geometries have �pole 6 2.6 kG"

"(David-Uraz et al. 2019). The existence of a giant wind-fed dynami-
cal magnetosphere around NGC 1624-2 was discussed by Petit et al.
(2015). A very recent study by Kurtz et al. (2020) reported the detec-
tion of coherent pulsation modes in NGC 1624-2 based on Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; Ricker et al. 2014) high-cadence
photometry."
"The study of spectral variability using archival optical spec-
troscopic observations indicated E sin 8 6 3 km s−1 and a rotation
period of 157.99± 0.94 d (Wade et al. 2012a). Due to the presence
of the strong magnetic field, slow rotation, and the low projected ro-
tational velocity, a few spectral lines showed magnetic splitting into
Zeeman components corresponding to a maximum mean magnetic
field modulus of about 〈�〉 = 14± 1 kG. Furthermore, Wade et al.
(2012a) reported the detection of reversed Stokes+ profiles associ-
ated with weak, high-excitation emission O iii lines, and suggested
that they may form in the low-velocity plasma confined in closed
magnetic loops above the stellar surface. They measured a longi-
tudinal field 〈�I〉 = 2.58± 0.7 kG, which is by more than a factor
of 2 smaller than the field measured using photospheric absorption
lines. On the other hand, the emission lines He i 5876, 6678, and
7065 exhibited Stokes + profiles with signs consistent with those
of the photospheric absorption lines, but yielding a negative mean
longitudinal magnetic field. Unfortunately, no field measurements
using these lines were presented in the work of Wade et al. (2012a)."

"The He i emission lines are marked in the paper of Wade et al.
as “wind lines”. This expression was already used by Howarth et al.
(2007) for HU, where the authors discuss some lines as contam-
inated by “windy” emission. Several studies of magnetic O-type
stars concluded that these lines are not formed in the wind, but
are possibly resulting from confined circumstellar material (e.g.
Grunhut et al. 2009). In the context of the magnetically confined
wind-shock model, it was suggested that most emission comes
from scattering by the cooling disk and very little from the wind
(Donati et al. 2002)."
"The detected remarkable characteristics of NGC 1624-2 make
it an excellent laboratory to study the impact of a very strong mag-
netic field on the behaviour of different elements in the stellar pho-
tosphere and circumstellar environment. In this work, we discuss
for the first time the magnetic field geometry of NGC 1624-2 based
on the variability of the longitudinal magnetic field measured using
photospheric lines, the longitudinal field measurements using the
emission O iii and He i lines, and the variability of the magnetic
field modulus over the rotation period. Finally, using the NIRVANA
code, we discuss the first magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) numer-
ical simulations carried out to understand the field geometry, mass
distribution, and the gas motions in the vicinity of NGC 1624-2."
2 OBSERVATIONS
"A few polarimetric observations were obtained at the beginning
of 2012 (Wade et al. 2012a) with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarime-
ter installed at the 3.6 m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)
together with one observation from its twin Narval, installed at
the 2 m Bernard Lyot Telescope (BLT) on Pic-du-Midi. Six ad-
ditional ESPaDOnS observations from 2012 September to 2013
January were presented by Grunhut et al. (2017). Subsequently,
sixteen ESPaDOnS observations were obtained between 2013 Au-
gust and 2015 September. They are described in more detail in
David-Uraz et al. (2020). All the ESPaDOnS data are publicly avail-
able in the CFHT Science Archive1 and both ESPaDOnS and Narval
data can be retrieved from the PolarBase2 archive (Petit et al. 2014)."
"Additionally, one Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectro-
scopic Instrument (PEPSI; Strassmeier et al. 2015, 2018) spectrum
has been recorded in linear polarized light in 2017 October at the
2×8.4 m Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) on Mt. Graham, Ari-
zona and one unpolarized spectrum was also obtained with the As-
trophysical Research Consortium Echelle Spectrograph (ARCES;
Wang et al. 2003) on the ARC 3.5 m telescope at the Apache Point
Observatory (APO) on 2019 March 1."
"The logbook of all available observations is presented in Ta-
ble 1. The recorded linear polarization PEPSI Stokes & and *
spectra and the ARCES spectrum were however very noisy, hence
only the Stokes � spectrum was used for measuring the magnetic
field modulus. The resolving power of all archival observations is
∼ 65000, while the spectral resolution of the PEPSI spectrum is
130 000 whereas the ARCES spectrum has a resolution of only
31 500. As most of the spectra have moderate signal-to-noise ratios
((/#) in the Stokes � spectra, mostly in the range of 100–150, some
spectra obtained during the same night or, in one case, during sub-
sequent nights have been combined to increase the signal for the
Stokes+ profiles. However, in cases where the (/# of the spectrum"

with low (/# have been included in the analysis of the line intensity

torted by numerous strong telluric lines in most of the spectra. In
massive magnetic early B-type stars, He and Si are usually inhomo-
geneously distributed on the stellar surface, with the He abundance
spots located close to the magnetic poles and the Si abundance spots
close to the magnetic equator. Thus, to test a possible inhomoge-
neous distribution of Si, we also included in our line mask the Si iv
lines at _4631 and _4654. The available data set allows us, in addi-
tion, for the first time to study the variability of the high-excitation
emission O iii lines and of the emission wind He i lines over the
rotation cycle."
3 MAGNETIC FIELD MEASUREMENTS
3.1 Mean longitudinal magnetic field 〈�I〉
"The mean longitudinal magnetic field is determined by computing
the first-order moment of the LSD Stokes + profile according to
Mathys (1989):"

, (1)"
"where h is the velocity shift from the line centre, in km s−1, and
_0 and 60 are the normalization values of the line weights. We
have adapted for them here the average values of, respectively, the
wavelengths (in nm) and the effective Landé factors of all the lines
used to compute the LSD profile. The results of our magnetic field
measurements using the line mask for the photospheric absorption
lines, including the Si lines, the line mask without the Si lines,
and the measurements using the high excitation emission line O iii
_7455 and the strongest emission lines He i _5876 and He i _6678
are presented in Fig. 1 and in Table 2 in Columns 3 to 7. All
LSD profiles for the selected line masks, as well as Stokes �, + ,
and null profiles for the individual emission lines are shown in
Figs. A1–A6 in the Appendix. The average effective Landé factors
used for the normalization for the line mask including the Si lines
and the mask without the Si lines are 1.55 and 1.24, respectively. The"
"corresponding wavelengths are 5013 and 5224 Å. For the profiles
calculated using all lines and the line list without the Si lines an
integration was made from −120 to +25 km s−1, for O iii _7455
from −70 to +10 km s−1, for He i _5876 and for He i _6678 from
−200 to +150 km s−1."
"In most cases the false alarm probability (FAP) for the field
detections is less than 10−6. According to Donati, Semel, & Rees
(1992), a Zeeman profile with FAP 6 10−5 is considered as a def-
inite detection, 10−5 < FAP 6 10−3 as a marginal detection, and
FAP > 10−3 as a non-detection. Our measurements show that the
〈�I〉 values become lower if the Si iv lines are included in the line
mask. A possible scenario to explain these measurements would
be an inhomogeneous surface element distribution with a region
of Si concentration located closer to the magnetic equator. It is
also possible that we observe a filling of the lines by emission.
Our 〈�I〉 measurements in the range from −0.2 to 4.5 kG obtained
for the sample of the photospheric absorption lines are in good
agreement with the 〈�I〉 values reported by Grunhut et al. (2017),
but disagree with the measurement of 〈�I〉 = 5.35 kG reported by
Wade et al. (2012a). Assuming a limb-darkening coefficient D = 0.3
(Claret & Bloemen 2011) and a centred dipolar magnetic field, we
estimate the dipole strength of NGC 1624-2 �d > 16 kG according
to Equation (1) of Preston (1967). The dashed line in Fig. 1 repre-
sents the best sinusoidal least-squares fit solution for the phase curve
defined by our magnetic field measurements using the line mask for
photospheric absorption lines, without the Si iv lines. The rotation
phase presented in Table 2 in the second column is calculated using
the rotation period of 157.99 d adopted by Wade et al. (2012a) and
the initial epoch for the phase origin HJD0 = 2455955.94±0.21 cor-
responding to the maximum of the longitudinal field phase curve.
The fitted sinusoid has an amplitude �〈�z 〉 = 2132 ± 364 G and"
"a mean value 〈�z〉 = 2063 ± 328 G, thus 〈�I〉max = 4195 G and
〈�I〉min = −69 G."
"Knowing the rotation period, we can estimate the equatorial
velocity and the inclination of the rotation axis of the star 8. Assum-
ing a radius ' = 9.7R⊙ (Petit et al. 2013) and a projected rotation
velocity E sin 8 6 3 km s−1 (Wade et al. 2012a), we obtain 8 6 75◦.
Using the well known relations developed by Stibbs (1950) and
Preston (1967) for a centred magnetic dipole tilted to the rotation
axis by angle V, we estimate an obliquity angle V > 15.5◦ . How-
ever, with E sin 8 = 1 km s−1, we obtain 8 = 19◦ and V = 72◦, i.e.
nearly a flip of the two axes, showing that the exact geometry of the
magnetic field can not be determined with the still too loose con-
straint on E sin 8. The measured values of the longitudinal magnetic
field of NGC 1624-2 with predominantly positive polarity imply
that only one magnetic pole is observable over the rotation cycle.
The dynamic spectra of emission and photospheric lines show a
single-wave variation of their intensity: the intensity of the lines
HU, He ii _6486, He i _5876 and _6678 are the strongest close to
the positive extremum of 〈�I〉 whereas the photospheric absorp-
tion lines of He i, C iv, Si iv, and the emission O iii lines are the
strongest close to the rotation phase 0.5. Examples of the variability
of different lines are presented in Fig. 2."
3.2 Mean magnetic field moduls 〈�〉
"The availability of the variation curve of the mean magnetic field
modulus 〈�〉 allows us to put stronger constraints on the structure
of the magnetic field of NGC 1624-2 as compared to any other mag-
netic O-type star with unsplit lines. Our measurements of 〈�〉, which

"the magnetic field vector, weighted by the local line intensity, are
presented in Table 3 and Fig. 3. The field modulus was calculated
by fitting the magnetically resolved C iv _5812 line with two Gaus-
sian profiles and using the relation given e.g. by Hubrig & Nesvacil
(2007). The uncertainties in the presented 〈�〉 values are due to
the accuracy of the measured wavelengths of the blue and red split
line components. Our measurements indicating a field intensity
between 9 and 12 kG differ from the measurements reported by
Wade et al. (2012a), who reported 〈�〉 = 15 kG for the _5801 line
and 〈�〉 = 13 kG for the _5812 line using the Narval spectrum. This
difference can likely be explained by the Zeeman pattern of the
C iv _5812 line. We interpret in our measurements the splitting as
a pseudo-doublet, which underestimates the strength of the field
modulus."

longitudinal magnetic field shows that the minimum of the mean"
"magnetic field modulus corresponds to the maximum of the mean
longitudinal magnetic field. This indicates that the field structure
must significantly depart from a centred dipole. It is possible that
we see a small shift between the modulus minimum with respect to
the positive extremum of the 〈�I〉, although the fidelity of such a
shift is only barely supported, given the rather large dispersion of
the data points. A future confirmation of the presence of a shift is
necessary, as this would indicate that the magnetic field structure of
NGC 1624-2 slightly departs from a simple dipole."

"Interestingly, we detect in the spectra the forbidden [O i] 6300
and 6363 lines, indicating the presence of low-density atomic ma-
terial in the vicinity of NGC 1624-2. The formation mechanism of
these lines is unclear. It was suggested that they originate from disk
winds or regions where stellar UV radiation impinges on the disk
surface in pre-main sequence Herbig Ae/Be stars (e.g. Finkenzeller
1985; Corcoran & Ray 1997). It is also possible that the forbidden
[O i] 6300 and 6363 lines are formed in magnetospheric accretion
columns (Muzerolle et al. 2004). The variability of the strength of
these lines is presented in Fig. B1. They are the strongest at the rota-
tional phases 0.03 and 0.35 and do not show rotational modulation.
This suggests that they are most likely formed beyond the Alfvén
radius."
"Our analysis of the observations of NGC 1624-2, in the sce-
nario of an oblique magnetic rotator, indicates that stronger emis-
sions in the hydrogen and helium emission lines are detected when
the magnetically-confined cooling disk is seen closer to face-on,
while the emission contribution is reduced when the cooling disk is
seen closer to edge-on (see Fig. 2)."
"No measurements using the He i emission lines were presented
in the study of Wade et al. (2012a). Our 〈�I〉 values are predomi-
nantly negative and, similar to the measurements of other spectral
lines, show clear variability over the rotation period, with the neg-
ative 〈�I〉 extremum observed around phase 0, where the photo-
spheric absorption lines show a positive 〈�I〉 extremum. The distri-
bution of our measurement values over the rotation period obtained
using the He i _5876 and _6678 lines, which are the strongest in the
23%0 − =3� and the 21%0 − =1� series, respectively, is presented
in Fig. 4. The significant data point dispersion and the presence of
two outliers in the measurements of He i _5876 close to the rotation
phase 0.2 is caused by the short-term variability of the line intensity
on a time scale of several days, and is likely a consequence of either
the pulsational variability recently detected by Kurtz et al. (2020)
or a time-variable structure of gas flows within the magnetosphere
(ud-Doula et al. 2013)."
"The origin of the emission in the He i lines in the red spectral
region is not well understood. A long time ago, Auer & Mihalas
(1972) showed that NLTE effects are quite small for He i lines in
the blue-violet region of the spectrum, whereas the red He i lines, in
particular He i _5876 and He i _6678, are strongly affected by depar-
tures from LTE. A large discrepancy between observations and their
NLTE results occurred for He i _5876, where the observed lines are
consistently stronger than computed. However, the presented NLTE
calculations always remained in absorption. Only at the highest tem-
peratures of about 50 000 K the NLTE results predicted that lines
come into emission."

"Several mechanisms were suggested since then to understand
the appearance of the emission observed in these lines. To explain
the emissions in the He i _5876, _6678 lines in the early type star
_ Eri, Smith et al. (1997) suggested that emission can be produced
in a dense slab that is optically thick in the Lyman continuum. To
produce a large enough column density for an observable feature,
the requirement was made that the slab must be cohesive and is
confined in a magnetic loop to resist the acceleration of the ambient
wind."
"The presence of variable Zeeman features corresponding to a
longitudinal field of negative polarity observed in the He i emis-
sion lines, while high-excitation emission O iii lines show the same
polarity as the photospheric absorption lines, is puzzling and cur-
rently difficult to interpret. One alternative hypothesis could be that
the He i Stokes � and + profiles have a composite structure and
present a contribution of several components. In Fig. 5 we present
the Stokes �, + , and null profiles for all three He i emission lines at
two rotational phases. Indeed, depending on the line, the observed
Stokes � profiles indicate a rather complex variable structure con-
sisting of at least two or three components (see also Figs. A4–A6). It
is quite possible that there is a correspondence between the different
parts of the Stokes � profiles and those of the Stokes+ profiles. The
resulting composite Stokes+ profiles would then present just a blend
of the individual Stokes + profiles corresponding to different parts
of the Stokes � profiles. It is noteworthy that for the majority of the
obtained observations, the shape of the Stokes + profiles displayed
in Figs. A4–A6 cannot be explained in terms of the Zeeman effect: if
these profiles are indeed formed in a hydrostatic stellar atmosphere
lacking gradients in velocity and magnetic field as a function of opti-
cal depth (e.g. Sanchez Almeida, Collados & del Toro Iniesta 1989;
López Ariste 2002), they always have the zero-order moment equal"

the areas corresponding to the blue and red parts of the Stokes +

a lower impact of the noise on the shape of the Stokes+ profiles. As
this figure shows, for all three lines the differences between the areas
corresponding to the blue and red parts of the Stokes + profiles are
significant."
"The changes in emission strength of the He lines and the dif-
ferent sign of the longitudinal magnetic field in these lines can also
be understood within the following scenario. For a dipole magnetic
field, the magnetic field lines reverse their orientation at the equa-
tor relative to the pole. If emitting material accummulates in the
magnetosphere at the magnetic equator, it experiences a magnetic
field of opposite orientation to that at the magnetic pole. Thus the
longitudinal magnetic field measured in the He i lines as seen in
emission from the magnetospheric material at the magnetic equator
would have a sign opposite from the longitudinal field measured
from a photospheric absorption line. The extended region near the
equator with an elevated density seems like a plausible source of
circumstellar emission (see Fig. 7 for an illustration). The magnetic
field there has an opposite orientation to that dominating the up-
per hemisphere of the photosphere. Then, as the star rotates, the
longitudinal component of the magnetic field in the emitting re-
gion becomes weaker, and the projected area of the emitting region
diminishes, and possibly becomes partially occulted by the star."

Magnetic field geometry of NGC 1624-2 7
"Another alternative hypothesis could be related to the com-
plex structure of the magnetospheric circumstellar environment of
NGC 1624-2 and the possible presence of a reconnection-driven
emission process. To understand the behaviour of the gas flow and
the mass distribution within the magnetosphere, we carried out first
MHD numerical simulations for this star."
4 MHD NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

strongly alter the gas flow from the star and inhibit mass loss. The

stellar surface at the magnetic equator, '∗ the stellar radius, ¤"" the
mass loss rate with no magnetic field, and 3∞ the terminal velocity

2, [∗ = 1.5× 10"
"4 was found by Wade et al. (2012a), which results
in a value of 11.3'∗ for the Alfvén radius, which indicates the
extent of the magnetically-dominated region. Within that region,
the magnetic field will keep its dipole geometry and gas flowing
from the star at low to mid-latitudes will be trapped. Only gas
originating from the polar caps leaves the system unimpeded along
open field lines."
"To study the field geometry, mass distribution, and gas motions
in the vicinity of the star, we ran a series of numerical simulations.
The general model setup is described in Küker (2017). We used
the NIRVANA MHD code (Ziegler 2008) in spherical polar coordi-
nates. The geometry is axisymmetric with respect to the polar axis
of the magnetic field and the gas is assumed isothermal, with the gas
temperature being the effective temperature of the star. No rotation
is included. As the model does not include cooling, magnetic dif-
fusion has been added with a diffusion coefficient of 1015cm2s−1.
The stellar and wind parameters have been adopted from Wade et al.
(2012a). We thus use a stellar mass of 34 solar masses, a stellar ra-
dius of 10 solar radii and an effective temperature of 35 000 K. The
mass loss rate is 1.6×10−7""⊙yr"
"−1 and the terminal wind velocity
is 2785 km s−1. The start solution is a dipole magnetic field and a

"d =

. (3)"
"A radiative force term after Castor, Abbott & Klein (1975)
with &̄ = 550 and U = 0.55 is used to drive the wind. The parameters
have been chosen such that without the magnetic field a stationary
solution with the correct wind parameters is produced. We then re-
peat the computation with a dipole field included. To limit the cost
in CPU time, the outer boundary of the simulation box is placed at
5 stellar radii and a polar field strength of 4 kG is chosen. While
this is smaller than the observed field strength of 16 kG, it still leads
to an extended region of magnetic confinement with [∗ ≈ 700 and
an Alfvén radius of 5.4 stellar radii. Within the simulation box, the
magnetic field geometry stays close to the original dipolar geometry
and only a fraction of the gas flowing from the stellar surface can
escape the system. The mass loss rate found by Wade et al. (2012a)
is based on a prescription by Vink, de Koter & Lamers (2001) that
does not take the magnetic field into account. It therefore refers"

star. Left: the whole simulation box. Right: zoom into the central region. The
unit of the time stamps is ks."
"to the amount of gas that would leave the system if there was no
magnetic field."
"In the inital phase of the simulation run, the gas flow and
mass density undergo drastic changes. While the gas density at high
latitude drops, gas piles up in the equatorial plane, where a thin disk
forms from which filaments grow that are aligned with the magnetic
field. Figure 7 shows a snapshot of the mass density taken at a time
when the system has reached a semi-stationary state insofar as the
general mass distribution with a high mass concentration at low
to mid latitudes does not evolve much any more. The shape and
length of the individual filaments is highly variable, though, and the
system does not reach a truly stationary state. Note that all the field
lines shown are closed. Compared to the original dipole, the field is
slightly compressed by the gas load but the general field topology
is unchanged. This is generally different for weak surface fields or
at greater distances from the star, where the field lines are stretched
away from the star and a thin disk of outflowing material forms."
"Figure 8 shows a snapshot from a simulation with a weaker
field of 1 kG. The magnetosphere is much less extended both in
radius and latitude and far away from the star the magnetic field
is stretched out into a configuration resembling a split monopole
with a current sheet in the equatorial plane. The gas forms a thin
disk of enhanced mass density in the equatorial plane. The disk is
fragmented and the magnetic field is frozen into the fragments. In
the equatorial plane the magnetic field forms an elongated tail. At
the tip, reconnection occurs and magnetic flux is carried away by the
disk material. We expect a similar picture in case of stronger fields,
but at distances from the star outside our current simulation box.
Note also that for the stronger magnetic field in Fig. 7, the regions
of the stellar surface where open field lines originate is limited to
a small range of latitudes around the poles. We expect this effect
to be even stronger with a dipole field strength as large as 20 kG.
The right panel of Fig. 7 shows a zoom-in to the inner part of the
simulation box."
"At the time shown, the magnetosphere is still forming and the
filaments become longer. Close to the star the mass distribution is"
"MNRAS 000, 1–9 (2020)"

"quite complex, with an increased mass density at low latitudes close
to the stellar surface and blobs of gas at low to mid-latitudes. Within
the filament structure, gas moves back and forth along the field lines
and inward towards the star. The mass distribution is distinctly
asymmetric with respect to the equatorial plane. At this point we
can not predict the final structure and extent of the magnetosphere
but we notice the high mass density at low to mid-latitudes. To
summarize, while there must be strong currents present to exert a
Lorentz force strong enough to trap the gas, we do not find any
changes of the field topology close to the star that would hint at
possible reconnection events in that region."
5 DISCUSSION
"Slow rotators with strong magnetic fields, such as NGC 1624-2,
form dynamical magnetospheres, in which material flows along
closed magnetic field loops from both magnetic poles, colliding
near the magnetic equator and then falling back onto the stellar sur-
face, leading to complex flows in the magnetosphere. NGC 1624-2’s
magnetosphere was estimated to extend to an Alfvén radius 'A of
more than eleven stellar radii, hence trapping 95% of the outflow-
ing wind, much more than other magnetic O stars that have an 'A
of just a few stellar radii (David-Uraz et al. 2019). A much larger
and denser magnetosphere compared to that of any other magnetic
O-type star was also confirmed by Chandra observations, where
the high X-ray luminosity, its variation with stellar rotation, and its
large attenuation are consistent with a large dynamical magneto-
sphere with magnetically confined wind shocks (Petit et al. 2015)."
"NGC 1624-2 is the only magnetic O-type star for which the
variability of both the longitudinal magnetic field and the mean
magnetic field modulus is currently studied. The approximately si-
nusoidal variation of 〈�I〉 and the ratio of the values of the extrema
of 〈�〉 indicate that there is an important component of the field that
is dipolar. The absence of a sign reversal of the mean longitudinal
field over the rotation cycle indicates that only one magnetic pole
is visible over the rotation cycle. Involving the mean field modulus
measurements, we find that the geometrical structure of the mag-"
"netic field of NGC 1624-2 must depart from a centred dipole. A simi-
lar conclusion has been independently obtained by David-Uraz et al.
(2020). Notably, among the eleven magnetic O-type stars with
known 〈�I〉 variation curves,for seven stars, HD 108, HD 37022
(=\1 Ori C), HD 54879, HD 148937, HD 191612, Tr 16-22, and
NGC 1624-2, only one magnetic pole is visible throughout the ro-
tation cycle (Shultz & Wade 2017; Petit et al. 2008; Hubrig et al.
2020; Wade et al. 2012b; Donati et al. 2006; Naze et al. 2016, this
work). This implies that, due to an unfavorable inclination of the
rotation axis, a larger fraction of their surfaces can never be ob-
served, leaving the structure of the field over the invisible surface
only constrained by the assumption of a tilted centred dipole. There
will thus always be a considerable degree of ambiguity left in the
magnetic models of these stars."
"Our 〈�I〉 values measured using He i emission lines are pre-
dominantly negative and, similar to the measurements of other spec-
tral lines, show clear variability over the rotation period, with the
negative 〈�I〉 extremum observed around phase 0, where the photo-
spheric absorption lines show a positive 〈�I〉 extremum. To explain
the presence of variable Stokes + signatures corresponding to a
longitudinal field of negative polarity in these lines, we suggest
three alternative scenarios: one is related to a composite structure
representing the contribution of several components, another one
referring to the complex structure of the magnetospheric circum-
stellar environment of NGC 1624-2 with the possible presence of
a reconnection-driven emission process, and a third one where the
He i emission comes from circumstellar material accumulated in the
equatorial region of the magnetosphere, where the dipolar magnetic
field shows an inverted sign with respect to the pole."
"As of today, magnetic reconnection is best studied in the so-
lar photosphere, but it is not clear how the scenarios developed
for the Sun can apply for massive stars. Although the detection of
a negative longitudinal field inferred from the He i emission lines
was reported about eight years ago, neither magnetohydrodynami-
cal (MHD) simulations nor analytical models have been developed
to provide a description of the magnetospheric structure permit-
ting the reproduction of the observed phenomenon. According to
Owocki et al. (2016) the presence of a huge magnetosphere and a
very strong surface field are prohibitively expensive to model using
numerical MHD. Our MHD numerical simulations show that while
reconnection events indeed occur in magnetospheres of massive
stars and the magnetic flux is carried away by the disk material,
such events take place too far from the stellar surface where He i
emission lines are formed."
"On the other hand, as the shape of the Stokes + profiles of the
He i emission lines displayed in Figs. A4–A6 cannot be explained
in terms of the Zeeman effect, the alternative hypothesis related to
a composite structure of Stokes � and+ profiles presenting the con-
tribution of several components appears currently more promising.
It is possible that future observations of all four Stokes parameters
in these lines will help to disentangle the contribution of different
line components."
