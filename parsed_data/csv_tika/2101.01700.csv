"We all know that in the dense anisotropic interior of the star, neutrino-neutrino forward-scattering
can lead to fast collective neutrino oscillations, which has striking consequences on flavor depen-
dent neutrino emission and can be crucial for the evolution of a supernova and its neutrino signal.
The flavor evolution of such dense neutrino system is governed by a large number of coupled
nonlinear partial differential equations which are almost always very difficult to solve. Although
the triggering, initial linear growth and the condition for fast oscillations to occur are understood
by a well known trick known as ‚ÄúLinear stability analysis‚Äù [1], this fails to answer an important
question ‚Äì what is the impact of fast flavor conversion on observable neutrino fluxes or the su-
pernova explosion mechanism? This is a significantly harder problem that requires understanding
the nature of the final state solution in the nonlinear regime. Moving towards this direction we
present one of the first numerical as well as an analytical study of the coupled flavor evolution of
a non-stationary and inhomogeneous dense neutrino system in the nonlinear regime considering
one spatial dimension and a spectrum of velocity modes. This work gives a clear picture of the
final state flavor dynamics of such systems specifying its dependence on space-time coordinates,
phase space variables as well as the lepton asymmetry and thus can have significant implications
for the supernova astrophysics as well as its associated neutrino phenomenology even for the most
realistic scenario."

"Temporal Behaviour : In the limit ùë° being very large, our numerical analysis suggests that the
fully nonlinear solution of Eq.(1) becomes approximately stationary in time for any ùê¥. [Fig. 3 ]"

to the multipole space [3] we obtain the following set of equations governing the system‚Äôs late time
