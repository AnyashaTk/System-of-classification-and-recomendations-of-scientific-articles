"The characteristics of an extensive air shower derive from both the mass of the primary ultra-high-energy
cosmic ray that seeds its development and the properties of the hadronic interactions that feed it. With its
hybrid detector design, the Pierre Auger Observatory measures both the longitudinal development of showers
in the atmosphere and the lateral distribution of particles arriving at the ground, from which a number of
parameters are calculated and compared with predictions from current hadronic interaction models tuned to
LHC data. At present, a tension exists concerning the production of muons, in that the measured abundance
exceeds all predictions. This discrepancy, measured up to center-of-mass energies of∼ 140 TeV, is irresolvable
through mass composition arguments, constrained by measurements of the depth of the electromagnetic-
shower maximum. Here, we discuss a compilation of hadronically-sensitive shower observables and their
comparisons with model predictions and conclude with a brief discussion of what measurements with the
new detectors of the AugerPrime upgrade will bring to the table."

1. Introduction
"Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays provide access to hadronic interactions at energies well beyond those
achievable with human-made accelerators, albeit only through the measurement and interpretation of the
extensive air showers that they induce. These air showers are initiated in collisions of primary cosmic rays
with nuclei comprising the upper atmosphere. What results is a cascade of billions of particles with a
footprint in excess of 10 km2 at the ground for primaries of the highest energies, which can exceed 1020 eV.
Chains of reactions of secondary mesons and baryons form the hadronic cascade of a shower. Upon losing
sufficient energy, the probability for charged mesons to decay exceeds that of further interaction and muons
are produced. These muons serve as tracers of the hadronic component. The electromagnetic component of
air showers is born and fed predominantly from the decay of neutral pions and rapidly proliferates through
subsequent cycles of pair production and bremsstrahlung."
"Consisting of a hybrid design of fluorescence telescopes overlooking a massive surface detector array, the
Pierre Auger Observatory [1] is the largest detector of extensive air showers in the world. The fluorescence
detector consists of 27 telescopes spread between 4 sites that measure the evolution of extensive air showers
as they traverse the atmosphere towards the ground. It provides a calorimetric measurement of the shower
energy through integration of the measured longitudinal profiles of fluorescence light, which is emitted
by nitrogen molecules following their excitation by passing charged particles overwhelmingly belonging to
the electromagnetic component. The fluorescence detector additionally measures the depth of the shower
maximum 𝑋max, which is a well-studied, mass-sensitive variable that agrees reasonably well in its absolute
value and evolution with energy between models. As the depth of shower maximum inversely scales with
mass, showers induced by primaries of lower mass are statistically distinguishable from those of heavier
mass. Overlooked by fluorescence detector is the massive 3000 km2 surface detector array. Consisting of
over 1600 water-Cherenkov detectors arranged on an isometric triangular grid with 1500 m spacing, this array
samples the lateral distribution of the particles of air showers that arrive at the ground. From the signal and
timing information of each surface detector station, the shower geometry and the energy estimator 𝑆(1000),
i.e. the signal at 1000 m from the shower axis, are reconstructed."
"A deficit in the number of muons predicted by hadronic interaction models was first observed 20 years
ago, and its existence for energies greater than approximately 1016 eV has now been corroborated by a number
of experiments as summarized in [2]. With its various hybrid capabilities and unequaled exposure at the
highest energies, the Pierre Auger Observatory is equipped to measure a number of hadronically-sensitive
air shower observables and has played a key role in confirming and characterizing this deficit. A compilation
of these observables is given here, where it is evident that the measured number of muons exceeds model
expectations to an extent irreconcilable by mass composition arguments constrained by complimentary
measurements of the electromagnetic component of showers."
2. Hybrid measurements
2.1 Top-down
"The signals measured in the water-Cherenkov detectors of the surface detector array derive from both
muons and the electrons and photons of the electromagnetic component of showers. It is not straightforward
to decouple the contribution of each component. For a set of 411 high-quality events measured by both
the surface and fluorescence detectors with energies 1018.8 < 𝐸 /eV < 1019.2 (corresponding to 110 to 170
TeV in the center of mass system), however, a novel so-called ""top-down"" analysis was performed. For
each event, a best-match for the longitudinal profile measured by the fluorescence detector is selected from
batches of shower simulations performed with the primary energy reconstructed by the fluorescence detector.
With a matching simulated shower in hand, the response of the surface detector stations to the particles
reaching the ground may be simulated. The resulting comparison between predicted and measured signals at"

rescaling 𝑅𝐸 . Results are shown for two hadronic interaction models and for the 𝑋max based “mixed” and pure-proton
assumptions on the mass composition. The gray rectangles indicate systematic uncertainties. Figures from [5]."
"1000 m from the shower axis is shown in Fig. 1-left, where it is evident that the measured signal exceeds the
predicted one when assuming the mass composition “mix” which reproduces the measured distributions of
𝑋max. This discrepancy holds for the predictions by the different hadronic interaction models, QGSJetII-04
[3] and EPOS-LHC [4] as well as when assuming a pure proton composition. An increased discrepancy at
larger zenith angles, where the fraction of signal derived from muons is larger, is also visible."
"Two scaling factors may be defined. 𝑅𝐸 allows for a shift in the fluorescence detector energy scale,
whereas 𝑅had pertains to signal deriving from the hadronic component of the showers. Although primarily
from muons, this also includes products of muon decay and a small jet component arising from deeply
penetrating hadrons. Since the electromagnetic component of showers is more strongly attenuated in the
atmosphere than the muonic and the traversed atmospheric depth increases with zenith angle, both scaling
factors can be separately determined given a sizable set of events covering a range of zenith angles. Values
of 𝑅𝐸 and 𝑅had that maximize the likelihood of the signals observed at the ground are obtained and shown
in Fig. 1 (right). The result of the fit indicates that no energy rescaling is necessary. The hadronic signal
in measurements, however, significantly exceeds that predicted by the models. Under the assumption of a
mixed composition, hadronic rescaling of 𝑅had = 1.33 ± 0.16 for EPOS-LHC and 𝑅had = 1.61 ± 0.21 for
QGSJet II-04 are required. Full details of the analysis are covered in [5]."
2.2 Highly Inclined Showers
"For zenith angles \ > 60◦, the electromagnetic component of air showers is heavily attenuated and the
signal in surface detector stations largely derives from muons, facilitating a direct measurement of the muon
content. The lateral distribution for such showers is quite asymmetric due to deflections in the geomagnetic
field and for geometric reasons. The muon density 𝜌` is modeled at each location in the shower plane ®𝑟 as
𝜌` (®𝑟) = 𝑁19 𝜌`,19 (®𝑟; \, 𝜙), where 𝜌`,19 is a parameterization of the simulated muon density of air showers
induced by protons with energies of 1019 eV. Scaling of the density profile of this particular energy by a
factor 𝑁19 is made possible by the fact that the muon density profile has only a very weak dependence on
energy and mass and differs little between hadronic interaction models. Minimizing the bias due to the small
deviations from a universal scaling of the profile shape and dependence of the reference profile on the chosen
hadronic model results in a parameter 𝑅`. The relative muon content 𝑅` is shown as a function of the energy
reconstructed by the fluorescence detector in Fig. 2 (left). The estimated mass composition is evidently at
odds with the 𝑋max-based interpretation, as depicted in Fig. 2 (right). Through the composition interpretation
based on 𝑋max measurements, the measured number of muons clearly exceeds all model predictions. The
full details of the analysis may be found in [6]."

3. Muon Production Depth

be calculated from 𝑧 = 12"
"𝑐 𝑡𝑔
− 𝑐 𝑡𝑔"
")
+ Δ − 〈𝑧𝜋〉, where 𝑡𝑔 is the time delay of muons with respect to"
"a shower front traveling at the speed of light, Δ is the distance between the surface detector station and
the position of the shower plane at the time of measurement, and 〈𝑧𝜋〉 is the average decay length of the
parent meson. The time delay of muons takes into account the first order geometric delay as well as the
parameterized kinematic delay due to sub-luminal muon velocities. Through knowledge of the atmospheric
density profile, the production distance can be converted into a production depth, and the muon production
depth distribution can be constructed for all muons for which the described procedure may be applied. A
fit of the muon production depth distribution with a Gaisser-Hillas function provides the depth at which
the production rate for observable muons reaching the surface is at a maximum 𝑋`max, which is a parameter
defined by both hadronic interactions and mass composition. Fig. 3 shows the evolution of both the mean
value and fluctuations in 𝑋`max alongside model predictions for proton and iron primaries. As with the relative
muon content estimator for inclined showers 𝑅` described in the previous section, the estimated composition
is considerably heavier than that derived from the interpretation using the electromagnetic estimator 𝑋max.
For a full description of the analysis, see [7, 8]."
4. Risetime studies
"The risetime 𝑡1/2 of the signal in a surface detector station is defined as the duration over which the
integrated signal increases from 10% to 50% of its total. Since muons have an earlier average arrival time
than the particles of the electromagnetic shower component, an increase in the number of muons results in a
smaller value for 𝑡1/2."
4.1 Azimuthal asymmetries
"The risetime is largest in the upstream direction of the shower, i.e., where the shower front reaches
the ground the earliest and where the traversed atmospheric depth, and therefore the attenuation of the"

"electromagnetic component, is minimal. The asymmetries of the risetime in the shower plane may be
parameterized with"
"〈
𝑡1/2"
"〉
/𝑟 = 𝑎+𝑏 cosZ +𝑐 cos2Z where Z is the azimuthal angle with Z = 0 in the upstream"
"direction and where 𝑟 is the distance from the shower axis. The asymmetry is non-existent for perfectly
vertical showers and initially increases with increasing zenith angle as the difference in atmospheric depth
traversed by downstream and upstream stations increases. At larger zenith angles, however, the asymmetry
decreases once more as the electromagnetic component of the showers is more attenuated and the less
attenuated muon signal contributes more prominently. The magnitude of the asymmetry is maximal at the
atmospheric depth characterized by sin(\max), which in turn depends on the muon content of the showers
and thus carries information regarding the hadronic interactions and the primary mass at play. For a full
description of the analysis, see [9]."
4.2 Delta method
"Whereas the previous analysis capitalized on the azimuthal asymmetries in the risetime, the delta method
makes use of its dependence on the distance 𝑟 from the shower axis. For the stations in an event, the parameter
Δ𝑖 = (𝑡1/2 − 𝑡bench1/2 )/𝜎𝑡1/2 is calculated, where the benchmark 𝑡"
"bench
1/2 is defined as the mean behavior of the"
"risetime as a function of 𝑟 observed in the data for a given reference primary energy (hence the value
of Δ𝑖 is, by definition, zero at the reference energy), taking into account zenith-angle dependencies. The
uncertainty 𝜎𝑡1/2 is also derived from measurements performed with “twin” stations separated by only around
10 m and thereby effectively sampling the same position on the shower plane. By taking the average Δ𝑖
of participating stations, Δ𝑠 is obtained, which evolves linearly in logarithmic energy. This is analysis is
performed considering different distance ranges from the shower axis. The estimated natural logarithm of
the primary mass as interpreted with two hadronic interaction models may be observed in Fig. 4 alongside
estimations from the depth of shower maximum and the muon production depth. The apparent mass is
compatible with estimations of the risetime asymmetry analysis and can be seen to lie between the the
estimates derived from 𝑋max, based on the purely electromagnetic shower component, and that of the muon
production depth, based exclusively on the muonic shower component. For full details of the analysis, see
[10]."
5. Summary and Outlook
"The estimated primary mass based on the depth of shower maximum 𝑋max, an observable derived from
the electromagnetic component of showers, is at odds with estimations based on the muonic component. A
compilation of analyses made possible with the hybrid capabilities of the Pierre Auger Observatory were
presented here and indicate a deficit in the number of muons predicted by hadronic interaction models."

and with the risetime-based delta method. Figures from [10].
"Resolving the deficit in model predictions of the number of muons requires an increase in the energy
routed to the hadronic component of extensive air showers. Although increasingly disfavored, this could
occur in the initial, highest energy interactions, where exotic phenomena could play a role. Alternatively,
this routing could be achieved over many generations of shower development."
"The large-scale upgrade to the Pierre Auger Observatory [11], termed AugerPrime, will increase its
sensitivity to hadronic interactions and the composition of cosmic rays by disentangling the electromagnetic
and muonic components of extensive air showers. The highlight feature of AugerPrime is a 4 m2 Scintillator
Surface Detector, currently being deployed atop the existing water-Cherenkov detectors. Its relatively higher
sensitivity to the electrons of the electromagnetic shower component will allow for the deconvolution of the
muonic and electromagnetic contributions to detector signals. This disentanglement will improve access to
the magnitudes of the different shower components and hadronic interactions on an event-by-event basis."
