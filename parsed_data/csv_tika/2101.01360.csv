Abstract The Galactic halo is supposed to form from merging with nearby dwarf galaxies.
"In order to probe different components of the Galactic halo, we have applied the Gaussian"
Mixture Models method to a selected sample of metal poor stars with [Fe/H] < −0.7 dex in
"the APOGEE DR16 catalogue based on four-parameters, metallicity, [Mg/Fe] ratio and spa-"
"tial velocity (VR, Vφ). Nine groups are identified with four from the halo (group 1, 3, 4 and"
"5), one from the thick disk (group 6), one from the thin disk (group 8) and one from dwarf"
"galaxies (group 7) by analyzing their distributions in the ([M/H], [Mg/Fe]), (VR, Vφ), (Zmax,"
"eccentricity), (Energy, Lz) and ([Mg/Mn], [Al/Fe]) coordinates. The rest two groups are re-"
spectively caused by observational effect (group 9) and the cross section component (group
2) between the thin disk and the thick disk. It is found that in the extremely outer accreted
"halo (group 1), stars born in the Milky Way can not be distinguished from those accreted from"
other galaxies either chemically or kinematically. In the intermediate metallicity of −1.6 <
"[Fe/H] < −0.7 dex, the accreted halo mainly composed of the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage sub-"
"structure (group 5), which can be easily distinguished from group 4 (the in-situ halo group) in"
both chemical and kinematic space. Some stars of group 4 may come from the disk and some
disk stars can be scattered to high orbits by resonant effects as shown in the Zmax versus
Energy coordinate. We also displayed the spatial distribution of main components of the halo
and the ratio of accreted components do not show clear relation to Galactic radius.

1 INTRODUCTION
"According to the Λ cold dark matter scenario, the halos of large galaxies like the Milky Way grow in"
"size by merging with small dwarf galaxies, leaving behind debris in the form of different groups of stars"
(Fraley & White 2012; Helmi 2020). With Gaia second data release (Gaia Collaboration 2018) and large

spectroscopic surveys (LAMOST (Cui et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2012); RAVE (Kunder et al. 2017); APOGEE
"(Majewski et al. 2017); GALAH (Buder et al. 2018) and so on), the Galactic halo has been analysed both"
kinematically and chemically. A number of studies have drawn a consistent picture that a large fraction of
stellar halo was accreted. One recently found velocity structure has been named Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage
(Belokurov 2018; Deason et al 2018; Haywood et al 2018; Helmi et al 2018; Koppelman et al 2018;
"Myeong et al 2018c,d; Fattahi 2019), which is speculated to be debris from a massive dwarf galaxy (Gaia"
"Enceladus) with initial stellar mass about 5 × 108 − 5 × 109M⊙ (Belokurov 2018; Helmi et al 2018;
Mackereth et al 2019; Vincenzo et al 2019) and it was supposed to be accreted about 10 Gyr ago (Helmi et"
"al 2018; Di Matteo et al 2018; Gallart et al 2019). Besides Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage, Myeong et al (2018c)"
"identified another velocity structure consisting of retrograde, high-energy stars in the halo with metallicity"
"between −1.9 and −1.3, which is related to ω Centauri by Myeong et al (2018b,c) and is supposed to"
be accreted 5 − 8 Gyr ago (Koppelman et al 2019). According to Bekki & Freeman (2003); Majewski
"et al (2012), dwarf galaxy ω Centauri is known to be a major source of retrograde halo stars in the inner"
Galaxy. Massari et al (2019) argues that Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage is also likely associated with ω Centauri.
"A new high-energy, retrograde velocity structure named as term Sequoia is found by Myeong et al (2019)."
"It is connected with a large globular cluster with very retrograde halo-like motion, FSR-1758 (Barba et al"
"2019). Based on chemical abundances, Matsuno et al (2019) suggested that this retrograde component is"
"dominated by an accreted dwarf galaxy, which has a longer star formation timescale and is less massive"
"than Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage. In summary, Koppelman et al (2019) suggested that the retrograde halo"
"contains a mixture of debris from objects like Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage, Sequoia, Thamnos and even the"
"chemically defined thick disc. Based on chemical abundances, Nissen et al (2010) divided the halo into"
high α population and low α population and they proposed that the low α population is accreted from
"nearby galaxies. Based on SDSS data, Carollo et al. (2007); Carollo et al (2010) classified the halo into the"
inner halo with metal rich stars on mildly eccentric orbits and the outer accreted halo with metal poor stars
"on more eccentric orbits. From APOGEE DR12, Hayes et al (2018) found that the low [Mg/Fe] population"
has a large velocity dispersion with very little or no net rotation. Haywood et al (2018) suggested that
the high α stars thought to belong to an in situ formed halo population may in fact be the low rotational
velocity tail of the old Galactic disk heated by the last significant merger of a dwarf galaxy. Di Matteo et
al (2019) also claimed that about half of the kinematically defined halo within a few kilo parsec from the
"Sun is composed of thick disc stars, since the accretion process could lead to the last significant heating"
"of the thick disk stars into the halo. With [M/H], [Mg/Fe] and distances from APOGEE data release 14,"
"Chen et al (2019) indicates a three section halo, the inner in situ halo with |Z| less than about 8 − 10"
"kpc, the intermediately outer dual-mode halo at |Z| between about 10 kpc and 30 kpc, and the extremely"
outer accreted halo with |Z| larger than 30 kpc. Carollo & Chiba (2020) found the inner stellar halo is also
"comprised of many different components. In a word, the Galactic halo has a complicate history and further"
works are desired to unravel its assembling processes.
This paper aims to partition the Galactic halo by identifying different components in the chemical and
"kinematic space. As shown in Nissen et al (2010) and Haywood et al (2018), in the intermediate metallicity"
"range of −1.6 < [Fe/H] < −0.7 dex, the accreted halo can be separated from the in-situ halo in the [M/H]"
Halo groups 3
versus [Mg/Fe] coordinate because there is a clear gap between low [Mg/Fe] and high [Mg/Fe] stars. Those
"two populations also have distinguished kinematic properties in the Toomre diagram (Nissen et al 2010),"
the VR-Vφ diagram (Haywood et al 2018) and eccentricity distributions (Mackereth et al 2019). Note
"that, the separation between the accreted halo and the in-situ halo is not found in the chemical space of"
[M/H] versus [Mg/Fe] in the low metallicity range of −2.6 < [Fe/H] < −1.6 dex in the APOGEE data. It
would be of interest to investigate whether the kinematic imprints of the accreted halo can be picked out
for this low metallicity range by using a grouping method that simultaneously takes into account chemical
"and kinematic properties. Finally, after groups are selected, studying similarities and differences among"
different groups by various combinations of orbital and energy parameters provide new insights on the
complicate assembling history of the Galaxy.
2 DATA AND THE PARTITION METHOD
The sample stars are selected from the APOGEE DR16 dataset (Abolfathi et al. 2018) with parallaxes
and proper motions taken from Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration 2018). We have removed stars with
"ASCAPFLAG or STARFLAG warnings and stars with −9999 values of log g, Teff, [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe]."
"We chose to use the Bailer-Jones distance GAIA R EST (Bailer-Jones et al. 2018) and removed stars with
(GAIA R HI−GAIA R LO)"
"2
/GAIA R EST > 0.2. After these cuts, there are 165 332 stars left. Then, we"
calculated three dimensional velocity components in galactocentric cylindrical coordinate with radial veloc-
ities from APOGEE DR16. Python package astropy has been used to transform observed quantities in ICRS
"coordinate into galactocentric cylindrical coordinate. The Sun is placed at height z = 0.014 kpc, galactic"
radius R = 8.2 kpc with circular speed Vc = 233.1 km s−1 (McMillan 2011). The peculiar velocity of
"the Sun relative to the local standard of rest is taken as (U⊙, V⊙,W⊙) = (11.1, 12.24, 7.25) km s−1 from
Schönrich (2010). Since we want to analyse main components of the halo in the field, we removed those"
"stars with PROGRAMNAMEs in the APOGEE DR16 catalogue associated with globular clusters, bulge,"
"young stellar object, RR Lyrae stars, exoplanets, the Magellanic cloud or open clusters. Moreover, stars with"
PROGRAMNAME related to stellar streams and apparently clumped as a small group in the velocity coor-
"dinate have been removed. After those observationally clumped stars removed, there are 77 549 stars left."
Stars with [Fe/H] > −0.7 dex mainly belong to disk (Haywood 2013; Bensby et al. 2014; Recio-Blanco et
"al. 2014; Hawkins et al. 2015), and we think it is not suitable for our method to decompose halo from those"
"stars. There are still some stars with [Fe/H] < −0.7 dex belong to the disk, but it is acceptable and we will"
"keep in mind in later analysis. Finally, with metallicity cut, there are 3067 stars left in our sample. GalPot"
"(McMillan 2017) has been used to calculate orbital parameters such as energy E, angular momentum L,"
"maximum height Z of orbit Zmax, guiding radius RG and eccentricity ecc. Eccentricities are computed as"
"ecc =
Rapo−Rper
Rapo+Rper"
in whichRapo andRper are respectively the orbital apocenter and pericenter. The Galaxy
potential chosen to calculate these values is the default potential called ”PJM17 best.Tpot” supplied by
GalPot.
R package Mclust (Scrucca et al. 2016) from RR Core Team (2020) has been used for the model-based
"clustering, which allows modelling of data as a Gaussian finite mixture with different covariance structures"
as well as different numbers of mixture components. Each component of a finite mixture density is asso-

ciated with a group or cluster. The Gaussian mixture model assumes a multivariate distribution for each
component and these components are assumed to have ellipsoidal distributions in parameter coordinates
(McLachlan and Peel 2000; Frühwirth-Schnatter 2019). The number of mixing components and the co-
variance parameterization are usually selected using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) (Schwartz
"1978; Fraley 1998), which puts its first priority on approximating the density rather than the number of"
"groups. To solve this problem, Biernacki et al (2000) put forward the integrated complete-data likelihood"
"(ICL) criterion, which penalises the BIC through an entropy term by measuring overlapping area to obtain"
good performance in selecting the number of clusters. When we apply the Gaussian mixture model method
"to our sample, both BIC criterion and ICL criterion suggest nine mixing components (groups). Figure 1"
"shows BIC and ICL values distribute with numbers of components. The BIC criterion suggests nine groups,"
"while it represents a local maximum for ICL criterion. The real maximum of ICL criterion is at four, and"
"the four components are the canonical thin disk, the thick disc, the in-situ born halo and the accreted halo."
We choose nine groups because we attempt to study components of the galactic halo rather than main
components of the galaxy.
Parameters of Gaussian mixture models are obtained via the EM algorithm (Dempster et al. 1977;
McLachlan and Peel 2004). The EM algorithm is a widely used algorithm which has reliable global con-
"vergence under fairly general conditions. However, the likelihood surface in mixture models tends to have"
"multiple modes, and thus initialisation of EM is necessary to produce sensible results when started from"
"reasonable starting values (Wu 1983). In the R-Mclust package, the EM algorithm is initialised using the"
partitions obtained from model-based hierarchical agglomerative clustering (MBHAC). It obtains hierarchi-
cal clusters by recursively merging the two clusters with smallest decrease in the classification likelihood
for Gaussian mixture model (Banfield and Raftery 1993; Fraley & Raftery 1998). The underlying prob-
abilistic model used by MBHAC is shared by both the initialisation step and the model fitting step. When

"applied to coarse data as ours, the MBHAC approach has a problem that the final EM solution depends"
on the ordering of the variables. This problem has been solved by using the method presented by Scrucca
"and Raftery (2015). Before applying the MBHAC at the initialisation step, the data is projected through"
"a suitable transformation, which enhances separation among groups or clusters. Once a reasonable hierar-"
"chical partition is obtained, the EM algorithm is run using the data on the original scale. Via this approach,"
different orders of variables won’t affect fitted model any more and the result becomes stable.
3 RESULTS
"We applied the Gaussian mixture models to our data sample in a joint space of [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], VR and"
Vφ and got nine groups. Table 1 lists mean values of nine gaussian models fitted by the R-Mclust package.
The first column is the number of groups given by R-Mclust package(Keribin 2000; McLachlan 1987;
"McLachlan and Rathnayake 2014), while the sixth column lists star counts in each group. Table A.1 in the"
Appendix lists covariance matrixes of fitted gaussian distribution of each group with variables ordered as
"([Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], VR, Vφ). The rest columns of table 1 list mean values of some kinematical and dynamical"
"parameters after groups were obtained. With more parameters, there would be more smaller substructures"
with fewer stars in each group. Since we focus on the main components of the halo rather than small
"substructures, we chose to use these four parameters that can best describe the main components in our"
sample.
Figure 2 shows nine groups in the [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] coordinate fitted by Gaussian mixture model.
"The top left panel shows overall distributions of nine groups, while other three panels show relative posi-"
tions of adjacent groups more clearly. Although Gaussian distribution is not a good model to describe the
"chemical plane, because stars counts of groups monotonously increase with the increase of metallicity in"
"our sample, it is enough to pick out main components in the sample. Group 3, group 4 and group 6 have sim-"
ilar mean magnesium abundance values around 0.31 and they form the horizontal high-[Mg/Fe] sequence.
"Group 5, group 8 and group 9 in the lower panel have relatively lower mean magnesium abundance, and"
Group 7 has even lower [Mg/Fe] ratios. Group 5 takes up the position of canonical accreted halo in the
[Mg/Fe] versus [M/H] coordinate (Hawkins et al. 2015) and Group 9 may be part of the Helmi stream (see

subplots show relatively positions of adjacent groups more clearly.
"Sect. 3.1). Group 8 lies at the metal rich end of group 5 and the metal poor end of the thin disk, while group"
6 lies at the metal poor end of the thick disk. Group 1 has an increasing [Mg/Fe] with decreasing metallicity
and thus we classify it as the extension of the low-[Mg/Fe] sequence.
3.1 Group 9
"Figure 3 shows distributions of group 9 (green plus) in the (x, z) and (Lz, E) coordinates and background"
grey dots represent the total sample. Grey dots in the upper panel of figure 3 shows distributions of our total
"sample in the x-z positional space. As shown in the upper panel, group 9 has a almost continuous linear"
distribution in the x-z plane and it is the last group ordered by statistical significance. Its position in the
"E versus Lz coordinate is very close to Helmi streams (Helmi et al 1999; Koppelman et al 2018, 2019;"
Naidu et al. 2020; Helmi 2020) and we conjecture their observations are related to the Helmi streams.
"The detection of the Helmi stream is interesting, which may indicate that this method is powerful enough"
to pick out even small groups with related chemical and kinematic properties. Though we have tried to
exclude stars from obvious moving groups which apparently clumped in velocity coordinate when selected
"the sample, there are still some left in our sample. In a word, we think group 9 is caused by observational"
effect and do not discuss about it later.
"3.2 Group 3, group 4 and group 6"
"The high-[Mg/Fe] sequence is separated into threes groups (3,4,6) in our sample by the Gaussian mixture"
"model. In the top left panel of figure 4, group 6 shows thick-disk like kinematics with few retrograding"

stars. Group 4 and group 3 have very similar distribution ranges and similar scatters in the Vφ versus VR
"coordinate, which means kinematically they can not distinguish from each other. The top right panel of"
"figure 4 shows Zmax versus eccentricity distribution of group 3, group 4 and group 6. Group 3 can reach"
higher region than group 4 and group 6. Most stars of group 6 have roundish orbits and can not run out
of disk region. Thus group 6 represents the thick disk while group 3 represents the intermediately outer

"dual-mode halo or the canonical halo (Hawkins et al. 2015). In the bottom left subplot, group 4 have almost"
"similar distribution range as group 3, except its energy is slightly smaller than that of group 3 on the whole."
"To cleanly distinguish halo component and disk component, the last panel shows those three groups in the"
[Mg/Mn] versus [Al/Fe] coordinate (Hawkins et al. 2015). In the last panel group 4 and group 6 both mainly
"clumps in the disk region and can not distinguish from each other, While distribution of group 3 reaches to"
the disk region. Group 4 is tightly related to the disk region that it seems like smoothly extend out of the
disk region in all parameter spaces. Since group 4 represents the inner in-situ halo in kinematics but has
"strong connection to the thick disk in chemistry, we suggest that part of it comes from disk heating (Quinn"
et al. 1993; Di Matteo et al 2019; Grand et al. 2020; Yu et al. 2020).
3.3 Group 5 and group 8
"In figure 5, group 8 locates at the metal rich end of group 5 and the metal poor end of the thin disk. However,"
their distributions in kinematical and dynamical coordinates clearly separate from each other. With high Vφ
"speed, low eccentricity and small Zmax, group 8 represents the thin disk component in our sample. Group 5"
represents the canonical accreted halo component (Hawkins et al. 2015) according to its position in figure 2.
"Group 5 is mainly composed of Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage, but includes more than just it. Since our sample"
"stars are within z ≈10 kpc, we conformed that Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage is the dominant component of"
the halo (Naidu et al. 2020) in this spatial range. There is a megascopic group of stars clumped in the top
"left region of group 5 in the Vφ versus VR coordinate. As is shown in figure 3, They have a continuous"
distribution in the x-z plane like group 9 ? and it may be caused by observational effect too. Chemical
Halo groups 9
"Fig. 5: Group 5 and group 8 in (VR, Vφ), (ecc, Zmax), (Lz, E) and ([Al/Fe], [Mg/Mn]) coordinates and"

abundances of these stars is very close to group 9 (the Helmi stream) too. But they have different VR
coordinates and larger eccentricity distributions than stars in group 9. We think they may be related to the
Helmi stream and it is normal that some stars from the Helmi stream or other streams are classified into the
accreted halo (group 5). Group 5 not only cleanly separates from the thin disk in kinematical and dynamical
"coordinates, but also has different distribution from the thin disk in the [Mg/Mn] versus [Al/Fe] coordinate."
"Unlike group 3 in figure 4, chemical distribution of group 5 is apparently separated from the disk region with"
only few stars scattering in the disk region. Comparing our bottom left panel with selection criteria in Naidu
"et al. (2020), there are many dynamical substructures in the accreted halo such as Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage,"
"Wukong, Helmi streams and Aleph."
3.4 Group 1 and group 7
Figure 6 shows group 1 and group 7 in kinematic and dynamical coordinates. Group 1 represents the metal
poorest part of the halo while group 7 is composed of stars with poorest magnesium abundances in our
sample. They both have large ranges of velocity distributions and spatial distributions. In the E versus Lz
"coordinate, group 1 overlaps with parts of some dynamical substructures such as Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage,"
"Wukong, Arjuna, Sequoia, I’itoi, Thamnos and Aleph (Naidu et al. 2020). Group 1 has large scatters for"
"both kinematics and chemical abundances distributions. And in all those subplots of figure 6, group 1 shows"
"smooth distributions. Within group 1, stars born in the Milky Way can not be distinguished from those"
accreted from other galaxies either chemically or kinematically. The bottom right panel of figure 6 shows
[Mg/Mn] versus [Al/Fe] distributions of group 1 and group 7 and those background grey dots represent our

"Fig. 6: Group 1 and group 7 in (VR, Vφ), (ecc, Zmax), (Lz, E) and ([Al/Fe], [Mg/Mn]) coordinates and"
background grey dots represent our total sample.
total sample. Main parts of these two groups clearly distribute away from the disk region and group 7 seems
distribute slightly father away from the disk than group 1. Group 7 has even poorer metallicity and lower
"Magnesium abundance than group 5, the accreted halo. Based on these properties, we suggest that group 1"
"represents the extremely outer accreted halo, while group 7 might be related to dwarf galaxies due to lower"
"[Mg/Fe] than the accreted halo, typical for dwarf galaxies."
3.5 Group 2
"In figure 2, group 2 distributes over both high-[Mg/Fe] branch and low-[Mg/Fe] branch and it connects the"
"thin disk, the thick disk, the in-situ halo and the accreted halo. The kinematic and dynamical distributions"
of group 2 in figure 7 behave like a disk component. Most stars of group 2 have not very large eccentricity
and highest distances away from the Galactic middle plane and thus they are mainly born in the disk region.
"In the last panel, [Mg/Mn] versus [Al/Fe] distribution of group 2 mainly locates at disk region with few"
"low [Al/Fe] or high [Mg/Mn] stars permeating into halo region. As compared with group 8, group 2 has the"
main component of the thick disk with higher [Al/Fe] or high [Mg/Mn] ratios but it has a tail extending to
"lower values, overlapping with the thin-disk region. Thus, group 2 represents the cross section of thin disk"
and the thick disk and may contains some stars from accreted halo. Usually the cross section is not very
"obvious, but most stars of group 2 distribute close to the Sun in spatial coordinates. The observational effect"
may have played a role in making it an detectable component in our sample.

3.6 Discussion
Figure 8 shows those eight groups in Zmax versus E coordinates. The top left subplot shows the distribution
"of our total sample, and it apparently distributes into three blocks. Two black dotted curves are subjectively"
drawn to show boundaries between those three blocks caused by transitions from one orbital family to
another (Moreno et al. 2015; Haywood et al 2018; Amarante et al. 2020). The locations of these gaps
marked by black dotted curves are determined by the adopted potential and cannot be used to learn about the
"physical origins of the stars (Moreno et al. 2015; Amarante et al. 2020). Nonetheless, it is still interesting to"
see some disk stars being scattered to high orbits by resonant effects. The bottom subplot of figure 8 shows
"stars orbital distribution of each group in high, middle and low orbital families. We notice that the accreted"
"halo groups, group 1 and group 5 has similar distributions with comparable fraction between the high and"
middle sections and little contribution from the low section. Group 2 and group 6 have main contribution
"from the low section but significant fraction from the middle section, which is consistent with the thick"
"disk population. Group 4 shows a larger fraction of the middle section than the low section, similar as the"
"in-situ halo of group 3, and thus indicates an evidence for disk heating. The star number in group 7 is too"
small to draw conclusion. Group 8 has main distribution in the low section in consistent with the thin disk
population.
"Figure 9 shows spatial distributions of our nine groups in (R, z) coordinates. While bottom two stacked"
bar charts show distributions of percentages each group take up in small bins taken along R and z direction
with size equal to 0.5 kpc. Group 1 and group 5 have the largest spatial distributions while group 6 and
"group 8 have the smallest spatial distributions, which is consistent with their origins deduced by chemical"

and kinematical parameters. The spatial distribution of our sample is restricted by observational effect that
most stars distribute around the sun as shown in top four panels. But percentage distributions reveal some
"tendencies. In the bottom left panel, the large R end is mainly composed of group 8 (the thin disk), group 7"
"(accreted stars), group 5 (accreted halo), group 1 (extremely outer accreted halo) and group 2 (cross section"
"of disks). For group 8, only the bin at 8 kpc contains more than 10 stars, but it still needs explanation why"
group 8 takes up about twenty percent of our total sample at large R region. As is shown in the bottom left
"panel, group 4 (inner in-situ halo) take up very small percentages in bins around the large R end relative to"
"other regions, while group 2 and group 8 take up relatively larger percentages at this region. As is known,"
"there is radial abundance gradients of the disk (Shaver et al. 1983; Liang et al. 2019) and at large radius,"
the flare and warp of the disk make it more easily been observed. Considering our sample is selected by
"metallicity cut, it is reasonable the thin disk component takes up more percentage at large R region. It is"
also possible there are several thick disk stars or accreted stars or accreted halo stars mixed in group 8.
"For radius larger than the Galactic center regions (around 3 kpc), group 1 takes up similar percentages"
at different Galactic radius and so does group 5. Group 7 takes up larger percentages at larger Galactic
Halo groups 13
Fig. 9: Spatial distributions of each group. Bins of 0.5 kpc have been taken alongR and z direction to obtain
star counts in the bottom two panels.
"radius and we think group 8 might contain several stars from dwarf galaxies too. In the last panel, group 6"
(the thick disk component) dominates the Galactic mid-plane region while group 1 and group 5 dominate
regions far away from the Galactic mid-plane. Group 4 distributes around the Galactic mid-plane while
group 3 (canonical halo) does not show clear preference for z distribution. The inner in-situ halo (group 4)
"takes up similar spatial range in z direction as disk components (group 6, group 2 and group 8)."

4 CONCLUSION
"A sample of stars with reliable stellar parameters in the ranges of [Fe/H]< −0.7 dex,−0.5< [Mg/Fe]< 0.6"
"dex, Zmax < 90 kpc, E < 0 km2 s−2 and | Lz |< 5000 kpc km s−1 is selected from the APOGEE DR16"
catalogue. Gaussian mixture model has been applied to this sample by using both chemical abundances
"parameters of [Mg/Fe] and [M/H] and two velocity components of VR, Vφ. Nine groups are detected, in"
which group 9 is part of the Helmi stream caused by observational effect. We analysed distributions of
"each group on the [M/H] versus [Mg/Fe], VR versus Vφ, the Zmax versus eccentricity, Energy versus Lz"
and [Mg/Mn] versus [Al/Fe] diagrams in order to trace their origins. Group 1 represent the extremely outer
"accreted halo, while group 7 comes from dwarf galaxies. Comparing the position of group 1 in the Lz versus"
E diagram with the streams of Koppelman et al (2019) indicate that group 1 includes many accreted stars
"from Sequoia, Thamno 1 and Thamno 2 substructures as well as many local born halo stars. Group 5 is"
"the accreted halo dominated by the well known Gaia Enceladus/Sausage, which is clearly separated from"
the in-situ halo of group 3 in both chemical ([Mg/Fe] and [Al/Fe]) and kinematic spaces (VR versus Vφ
"and the Lz versus E diagrams). We may see a signature of disk heating in group 4, part of which has a"
halo-kinematics in the VR versus Vφ diagram but disk-chemistry in the [Mg/Mn] versus [Al/Fe] diagram.
"Group 6 and group 8 show typical properties for the classical thick disk and the thin disk respectively,"
while group 2 may consists mainly thick disk stars with a small fraction of thin disk stars. In the E versus
"Zmax diagram, three sections are found and the relative fractions provide further support on the similar"
"origin of group 1 and group 5 from the accreted halo, of group 2 and group 6 from the thick disk, as well"
as the signature of disk heating for group 4 (as compared with the in-situ halo of group 3). These results
indicate that the Galactic halo has complicated assembly history and it not only interacts but also strongly
"mixed with other components of the Galaxy and satellite dwarf galaxies. In addition, dynamical evolution"
"and chemical evolution of the Galaxy are entangled, and these factors should be considered together in the"
simulation works in the future.

Appendix A: GAUSSIAN FINITE MIXTURE MODEL
"Let x = (x1, x2, ..., xi, ..., xn) be a sample of n independent identically distributed observations from a"
"probability density function through a finite mixture model of g Gaussian components, which takes the"
following form
"f(xi,Ψ) ="
"g∑
i=1"
"πiφ(xi;µi,Σi)"
"Where Ψ = (π1, ..., πg − 1, ξT )T are parameters of the mixture model. ξ contains the elements of"
"the component mean µi and covariance matrices Σi, while πi is the mixing weight or probability of each"
"component. For our case, each observation is composed of four variables ordered as ([Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], VR,"
"Vφ). Mean values of nine multivariate Gaussian distributions have been listed in table 1, while table A.1"
lists covariance matrixes of these nine components.
