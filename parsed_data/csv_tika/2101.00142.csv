"Abstract. Traditional dark matter (DM) models, eg. WIMPs, assume dark matter is weakly
coupled to the standard model so that elastic scattering between DM and baryons can be
described perturbatively by Born approximation. Most direct detection experiments are an-
alyzed according to that assumption. We show that when the interaction is attractive and
strong, DM-nucleus scattering exhibits rich resonant behavior with a highly non-trivial depen-
dence on atomic mass. The scattering is non-perturbative in much of the natural parameter
range, and a full numerical calculation is needed. We also show that the extended rather
than point-like nature of nuclei significantly impacts the cross sections and must therefore be
properly taken into account. These effects are particularly important for dark matter with
GeV-scale masses, near the boundary of exclusion regions from existing direct detection limits.
They also affect the interpretation of CMB constraints, as we show. We report the corrected
limits, which are in some respects weaker and in other respects stronger than previous bounds
in the literature, which were based on perturbation theory and point-like sources and hence
are now superceded. Sexaquark (uuddss) DM with mass . 2 GeV, which exchanges QCD
mesons with baryons, remains unconstrained for most of the parameter space of interest."

1 Introduction
"A possible non-gravitational interaction between dark matter and standard model particles
is important both theoretically and experimentally. Such an interaction, if it exists, will have
direct consequences for cosmology, astrophysics and direct detection experiments."
"In general, the elastic scattering of DM by baryons with a massive mediator can be
described by a Yukawa potential in the non relativistic limit"
"V (r) = −
α"
"r
e−mφr, (1.1)"
"in which the minus sign is for convenience so that α > 0 corresponds to an attractive force
and α < 0 to repulsive. In this paper we will focus on the attractive case because of its rich
phenomenology."
"Among many dark matter models, the recently proposed model of stable sexaquark [1, 2]
is worth consideration. In this model, the dark matter is a stable scalar particle consisting
of six standard model quarks (uuddss), with a mass mX ∼ 2mp. The interaction between
sexaquark and baryon is mediated by a flavor singlet combination of ω − φ mesons. Thus
the mediator mass mφ is around the GeV or QCD scale for the sexaquark model, while for
hidden sector DM model mφ could be quite different."
"The coupling strength α is naturally taken to be of order one, typical for a strong
interaction process, although it could be much smaller depending on how φ couples to the
DM. We will focus on the spin-independent (SI) cross section for simplicity; for scalar DM
including sexaquark DM, this is the only case."
"Exact analytic solutions for the Yukawa potential scattering problem do not exist, and
Born approximation does not apply for the parameter space we are interested in. Moreover
the extended nature of the nucleon or nucleus sourcing the Yukawa potential means that the
overall potential seen by the DM is not a Yukawa, even for a proton target. Therefore a
full numerical solution is necessary. As we will see below, the typical cross section for the
sexaquark model is around mb or 10−27 cm2, if the DM and mediator masses are around a
GeV and α ∼ O(1). Such a large cross section can be constrained by cosmological limits [4, 6–
8] and surface detectors [3, 9, 10], while deep underground detectors are mostly insensitive
due to a thick overburden shading the DM flux [11]."
"Figure 1 shows the main current limits on the cross section, all derived assuming Born
approximation. However this parameter region is actually largely in the non-perturbative
regime, which has several consequences. The cross section does not depend monotonically
on any of the parameters (mX ,mA,mφ, α), where mA is the target nucleus mass and A is
the atomic mass number, so a complete, ab initio exclusion analysis on the parameter space
is needed. In addition, the cross section and atomic mass A do not have the simple Born
approximation scaling relationship commonly used in the literature [12], so it is non-trivial
to translate from the actual experiment measuring the interaction between DM and detector
target (e.g., A=28 for Si in XQC) to the DM-nucleon cross section (A=1)."
"Although motivated by the sexaquark, our result is more general and applicable to any in-
teraction described by an attractive Yukawa potential in the non-relativistic, non-perturbative
quantum regime. The experimental constraints obtained here can be directly applied to any
DM model with mediator mass above a few hundred MeV and will be qualitatively applicable
down to mφ ≈ 100 MeV; for lower mediator mass the methodology is applicable but the
numerical experimental limits need to be recalculated."

constrained by XQC. For XQC and CRESST we display the limit corresponding to a thermalization
efficiency of 0.01; simple estimates suggest a higher efficiency is implausible [2, 3]; a measurement is
critically needed."
"This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we show some general results on non-
perturbative effects and their application to experimental results. In section 3 we present
how to reinterpret the result of direct detection experiments and other constraints in this
non-perturbative regime. We give the combined constraints on parameter space in section 4
and conclude in section 5. Our numerical methods for calculating the DM-baryon scattering
cross sections are described in the Appendix."
2 Yukawa Interaction with Extended Source
2.1 Source Model
"In a more realistic model than the simple Yukawa of eq. (1.1), for the nucleus as a source
for the potential scattering of the DM particle, the source has a specified matter distribution
rather than being a singular point. The Yukawa charge is then smeared out with some charge
density and the potential becomes"
V (~r) =
"∫
−
αρ(~r′)"
"|~r − ~r′|
e−mφ|~r−"
"~r′|d3r′ , (2.1)"
"where ρ(~r′) is the normalized Yukawa-charge distribution of the source with normalization∫
ρ(~r′)d3r′ = 1 . (2.2)"
"For example a point source has ρ(~r′) = δ(~r′). The finite size of the source regulates the
Yukawa potential at the origin and thus influences the cross section."
"We adopt in this paper a simple model for the nuclear density distribution as being a
uniform ball with radius r0, which we identify as the radius of the nucleus:"
ρ(~r′) =
"4πr30
(r′ < r0)"
"0 (r′ ≥ r0)
. (2.3)"
"The corresponding rms radius is 0.77 r0, so given that the proton charge radius is 0.8 fm, we
take r0 = 1 fm for the proton and r0 = R0A"
"1
3 fm for nucleus of mass number A. This is a"
"common description of the nucleus and was adopted previously for the binding of sexaquark
with nuclei [13]. It suffices for displaying the features of the extended distribution, which
is our aim in this paper. The detailed position of resonance and anti-resonance features are
sensitive to R0 and the profile of the density distribution, and would vary somewhat if a
smoother nuclear wave function were adopted."
"Integrating eq. (2.1) to get the potential, we find"
"V (r) = −
3α"
"m2φr

"
1− (1 +mφr0)e"

(r < r0)
"[mφr0 cosh (mφr0)− sinh (mφr0)] e

"mφr
(r ≥ r0) ,"
"where a new length scale r0 is introduced in addition to the Yukawa screening length λ =
1/mφ. In the limit r0 � λ we recover the point Yukawa potential (1.1). When r0 � λ, inside
the ball, the potential is essentially constant:"
"V (r)
r0�λ−−−→ −"
"m2φr

(r < r0) . (2.5)
"So the potential is a square well with radius r0, with a soft transition region at the boundary
whose width is λ. The range of the potential is now primarily determined by r0 instead of λ,
when r0 � λ, as is the case for λ−1 ≈ GeV of interest for flavor singlet hadronic interactions."
2.2 General Results in the Non-perturbative Regime
"As discussed in the Appendix, it is useful to write everything in dimensionless language. For
the simple Yukawa of eq. (1.1) and in the non-relativistic limit, two parameters suffice [14]:"
"2α
, b ≡"
"mφ
, (2.6)"
"with µ the reduced mass and v the relative velocity. To describe the extended nucleus we
introduce a third dimensionless parameter c, with"
"b
≡

"= mφr0 , (2.7)"
"Figure 2. 2D plot of σm2φ as a function of (a, b) for a point source, with σm

"cut-off in the upper right corner is where ab ≥ 10, which is the classical regime."

"We then use the methods described in the Appendix to solve for the cross section.
Figure 2 and 3 show σm2φ as a function of the dimensionless parameters (a, b) for the"
"point source potential. It is obvious that the cross section is not a smooth function of the
underlying parameters. For the extended potential the behaviors are similar, with shifted
locations of the resonances and anti-resonances."
"Distinct Regimes:
Classical Regime (ab � 1): The upper right corner in fig. 2 (which is the lower left corner
in fig. 3) has a cut-off at ab = µv/mφ ≥ 10. In this regime the De Broglie wavelength of
the particle is much smaller than the typical scale of the potential and classical mechanics is
sufficient to describe the scattering. In this regime there are already some non-perturbative
effects relevant in plasma physics where a screened Coulomb potential is used [15]. Ref. [16]
considered this regime in trying to solve astrophysical problems with self-interacting dark
matter (SIDM) models. Outside this region, when ab . 1, classical treatment fails and
quantum effects need to be included.
Born Regime (b � 1): The blue region with relatively small cross section and b � 1 is the
Born regime where perturbative calculation is reliable.
Quantum Resonant Regime (ab . 1 and b & 1): The region between the classical and Born
regime is the quantum resonant regime where the scattering problem is entirely quantum
mechanical and non-perturbative. The resonant behavior of the cross section is clear in fig.
2 and fig. 3. We are mostly interested in this regime where analytic description is absent
and numerical calculation is a must. One model which falls in this regime is sexaquark dark
matter, which has mX ∼ 2GeV and a mediator mφ ∼ 1GeV with coupling possibly as large"
"Figure 3. 3D plot of σm2φ as a function of (a, b) for a point source, with σm

"""crenellated"" appearance is merely a sampling artifact due to the resolution of the figure."
"as α ∼ 1 to nucleon. For a sexaquark colliding with silicon (mA ≈ 28mp ≈ 26.3GeV) at
v = 300 km/s, the corresponding parameters are a = 0.0005, b = 3.71 and ab = 0.0019."
"For the extended potential (2.4), we can almost draw the same conclusions, except that
when c� b, the range of the potential is determined by r0 rather than 1/mφ, and the quantum
resonant regime is determined by ac � 1. Taking the same sexaquark-silicon collision as an
example and using rA ∼ A"
"1
3 fm to approximate the silicon nucleus radius, we find c/b ∼ 15"
"and ac ∼ 0.03, which falls well in the quantum resonant regime."
"Resonance and Anti-Resonance: The strong enhancement or diminution of cross section
in the resonant regime can be understood from the phase shift. From eq. (A.11), at low energy
when s-wave scattering (l = 0) is dominant (which is usually true for us as we will see later),
the cross section is"
"σs-wave =
4π"
"a2b2m2φ
sin2(δ0) , (2.9)"
"where δ0 depends on a, b, c; it must be calculated numerically in the resonant regime. At
low-energy and in the parameter regime that Born approximation is valid, (2.9) becomes:"
"σBorn =
4πb2"
"m2φ(1 + 4a
2b2)"
. (2.10)
"When δ0 → π2 the cross section is on resonance and reaches its maximum value, resulting
in the peaks in fig. 2 and fig. 3. The position of the peaks is in one-to-one correspondence
with the zero energy bound states of the Yukawa potential. In the pointlike-source problem
(c = 0), the potential is e−"
"x
b , with b setting its range. When b� 1 the potential is too narrow"
"and weak to accommodate any bound states. As b increases, the potential becomes wider
and stronger up to the point where a bound state with E0 → 0− emerges, in which case the
scattering cross section reaches its maximum. As b continues to increase, the ground state
binding energy gets more and more negative, up to some point where another bound state"
"with E1 → 0− emerges and the scattering cross section hits another peak. The position of
these zero energy bound states are easily calculated to be at b = 1.68, 6.45, 14.34 etc., which
are exactly the locations of the peaks in fig. 2 and fig. 3. On the other hand when δ0 → nπ
the cross section σs-wave → 0, which is an anti-resonance and corresponds to the valleys in
fig. 2 and fig. 3. These reduced cross sections at anti-resonances in the parameter space are
responsible for evading some experimental limits on the DM-baryon scattering cross section.
The anti-resonances are not associated with any bound state. For an extended potential we
have similar resonances and anti-resonances, they just appear at different b values. In general,
the location b of the (anti-)resonance is a function of c/b."
"S-wave Dominance: It is usually the case that at low energy, s-wave scattering is domi-
nant. In terms of (a, b) this means small a. Figure 4 shows lmax, such that the contribution
to the total cross section of partial waves from l = 0 to l = lmax is more than 99%. We
see for ab � 1 the scattering is always s-wave dominated and quantum mechanical. For an
extended potential, we need also to have ac� 1 to ensure s-wave dominance. This also being
the condition for quantum resonant scattering, the cross section in the resonant regime is
isotropic in the center of mass frame. This simplifies the expressions for the event rate of DM
direct detection experiments."
"Born Approximation Validity: Born approximation applies when b � 1. To quantify
this, fig. 5 shows the ratio of cross sections calculated by Born approximation and by numerical
solution. Born approximation is within ±10% of the exact result for b . 0.1. This is also
generally true for the extended potential."
"Velocity Dependence: Another feature in the quantum resonant regime is that the cross
section may have non-trivial velocity dependence. Figure 6 shows σmφ(v) for different b. At
small velocity we have several different behaviors. For b = 1.68 (resonance), σ ∼ v−2, i.e.,
greatly enhanced at small v. For b = 4.52 (anti-resonance), σ, while significantly reduced, is
roughly independent of velocity. And for other intermediate b values σ ∼ v0 (independent
of velocity) up to v & 1000 km/s. At large velocities σ ∼ v−4 for all b and the scattering
is Coulomb-like. The results of Born approximation generally have no velocity dependence
at small velocity. In our analysis, the velocity dependence is ignored for simplicity since the
parameters need to be very close to the resonance to exhibit significant velocity dependence
and the parameter space occupied by the resonance is quite narrow."

the differential cross section and one is interested in"

experiment with v = O(10−3) and nuclear size. few fm, qmaxr0 � 1, so if Born approximation
is valid F (0) = 1 means that the cross section for the extended nucleus is the same as for a
point-like nucleus. (If q is larger and higher partial waves beyond s-wave need to be taken
into account, and the q dependence of the form factor can be calculated for any given model
of the radial wave function of the nucleus, e.g., the Helm form factor [17] is a popular choice.)"
"The condition F (0) = 1 is however not general and can only be demonstrated in Born
approximation. Figure 7 compares the Helm [17] form factor (green) to the ratio of the

Finally, while we are most interested for the present work in the small q limit where"

encountered for massive DM and massive target nuclei, the angular dependence of the scat-
tering cross section embodied in the Helm form factor will be different from the true behavior
determined by numerical calculation.

"When eq. (2.13) is valid, as is the case for WIMP experiments [18], the final result of an
experiment can be reported as a limit for σp. It is for this reason that different experiments
or observations can put universal limits on σp and compare with each other despite the fact
that they are using different target nuclei. However the scaling relationship (2.13) between
σBornA and σp doesn’t work in the resonant regime, as is shown in fig. 8. In fact, the ratio
σA/σp becomes highly parameter dependent. As a consequence, there is no universal rule to
convert an experimental limit on σA to a single parameter σp, and it is non-trivial to compare
the results of different experiments. An additional complication is that experiments involving
multiple materials with different A require an even more subtle analysis."
"3. Connection to σp: In the absence of the scaling relationship embodied in eq. (2.13), the
only way to relate σA to σp is to solve for both, under a given assumption for (α, mX , mφ).
Neither σA nor σp are in general calculable perturbatively, and even for point-like proton,
σp is not given by the simple Born approximation expression for σp. In fig. 9 we compare
both point-like and extended solutions of the Schrödinger equation to Born approximation
for DM-proton scattering. Our extended model of the proton takes it to be a sphere of radius
1 fm (rms charge radius 0.77 fm) sourcing the Yukawa potential."
"We have shown in Figs. 7-9 that Born approximation fails badly in the quantum resonant
regime, in all three respects, so we must change the way the experiments are interpreted. We
discard the form factor in our analysis and model the finite size of the nucleus with full
numerical calculation for the extended Yukawa potential. We have already shown that in
the quantum resonant regime we are considering, the scattering is s-wave dominated and
isotropic."

3 Reinterpreting Direct Detection Experiments and Other Constraints
3.1 The XQC Experiment
"The X-ray Quantum Calorimeter (XQC) [19] was an experiment intended to measure the
diffuse x-ray background using microcalorimeters on board a rocket sent to about 100 km
altitude in the atmosphere. The results can also be used to put limits on the DM-nucleon
cross section and extensive studies have been performed [3, 9, 10, 20, 21]. However these
analyses uniformly used the non-valid Born approximation to extract limits on σp, so in this
section we re-interpret the latest analyses of XQC limits [3, 10] as required to obtain reliable
limits in the quantum resonant regime. The procedure is:"
"• Rescale the limits reported for σp, back to the limits on the actual cross section that
XQC is constraining – σ28 – undoing the assumed Born approximation scaling of (2.13).
The XQC detector is actually made of silicon and a thin HgTe film, but the latter makes
an insignificant contribution and we ignore it for simplicity. For DM mass ∼ few GeV
of special interest in connection with sexaquarks, the maximum momentum transfer
is very small and the form factor F (q) applied in [3, 10] is essentially 1. The curve
XQC(DM-Si) in fig. 1 shows the resultant limits on σ28."
"• Using the exact solution to the Yukawa potential model for point and extended nuclei
(the latter of which is more realistic), we calculate σ28 everywhere in the parameter space
(α,mX ,mφ). Comparing to the observational limit on σ28, we then obtain the excluded
region. Due to the resonant behavior, the excluded/allowed regions of the parameter
space has islands and holes. For the extended nucleus, we adopt RA = R0A"
"1
3 , and"
"calculate for R0 = 1.0 and 1.2 fm to assess the sensitivity to the exact size of the
nucleus."
"Figure 10 shows the excluded region in the (α,mX) plane for the XQC experiment, comparing
the results for pointlike nucleus and extended nucleus with R0 = 1.0 fm. We takemφ = 1GeV
as a benchmark and assume v = 300 km/s. Due to the resonant behavior of the cross
section with respect to the underlying parameters, the allowed and excluded regions show up"

"alternatively as islands and bands. Near resonance the cross section is enhanced and the region
is excluded, while near the anti-resonance the cross section is small so the experimental limits
are evaded. This effect is more obvious in the point nucleus model and considerably regulated
in the extended nucleus model. The narrow allowed regions remaining in the extended nucleus
case move around when R0 = 1.2 fm is adopted, but the general picture is the same. The
figure underlines the importance of treating the nuclear wave function realistically. Nuclear
wavefunctions are not perfectly well-determined, however fortunately, by complementing XQC
with experiments using different targets as done below, we can largely eliminate the sensitivity
to details of the nuclear wavefunction and mediator mass, as long as mφ & 100 MeV."
3.2 The CRESST Surface Run Experiment
"The CRESST 2017 surface run took data using a cryogenic detector operated by the CRESST
collaboration [5, 22, 23] near ground level. The detector is made of Al2O3 and observed a
total of 511 events of nuclear recoil. It is shielded by ∼ 30 cm of concrete in addition to the
atmosphere of Earth. As a result, DM with large cross section in the overburden will loose
too much energy to register in the detector. Roughly speaking, this places a maximum value
on the cross section σp which can be probed in the CRESST surface run. Since the detector,
the concrete and the atmosphere contain nuclei with different A, we modified the analysis
done in [3], calculating each of the cross sections required in the analysis for any given set
of parameters (α,mφ,mX). We thereby obtain the limits on the (α,mX) parameter space
shown in fig. 11. The non-trivial character of the new exclusion limits is already evident in the
excluded band at large α – from about α ≈ 1 at mX ≈ 3GeV to α ≈ 0.2 at mX = 100GeV
– even before translating to (σp,mX) space. This excluded band arises because even though
the fundamental coupling is large, in this parameter regime the relevant nuclear scattering"
– 12 –
"cross-sections are small due to the existence of an anti-resonance. In this region, DM can
reach the CRESST detector with sufficient energy to be detected, while for larger and smaller
parameter values it loses too much energy in the overburden."
3.3 Constraint from CMB and Lyman-α forest
"DM interacting with baryons in the early universe leaves an imprint on CMB and Lyman-α
observations, allowing limits on the cross section to be obtained [4, 6, 7]. We investigate the
most recent results from [4] (fig. 1) where both DM-Hydrogen and DM-Helium scattering are
included. However [4] uses Born approximation and assumes that only the proton interacts
with DM in the initial calculation. It is clear now that any probes of the interaction of
DM and baryons, with A > 1 in the non-perturbative regime, suffer from the problem of
breaking down of the Born scaling (2.13). So a reinterpretation as done above for the XQC
and CRESST experiments is necessary. In the early universe both DM-H (A = 1) and DM-
He (A = 4) are significant. What governs the limits on the cross section is the momentum
transfer rate between DM and baryon fluids. Following the notation of [4] this is:"

"where a and c0 are constants not relevant for us, the sum on i is the sum over all baryon
species (H and He here), mi is the nuclear mass, ρi is the nuclear mass density, and vi and σi
are, respectively, the average relative velocity and the scattering cross section between DM
and baryon i; YHe = 0.26 is the Helium mass fraction used by [4]. Defining σ0 as the
conservative limit on σH when σHe = 0, ref [4] reports σ0 as a function of mX . To include

"Figure 11. Exclusion region in the (α,mX) plane for mφ = 1GeV. For each experiment or
observation, the corresponding dashed lines indicate the parameter values such that the dimensionless
parameter b = 1, for A = 4 relevant for He in CMB, A = 16 for O in CRESST, and A = 28 (XQC).
Below the dashed lines, b ≤ 1 and Born approximation is reliable for the pointlike Yukawa model, but
the extent of the nucleus still matters."
"then check whether the inequality eq. (3.3) is violated. Since the proton has rms charge ra-
dius ≈ 0.8 fm , we model it as a solid sphere of radius 1 fm. Figure 11 shows the resultant
exclusion region in (α,mφ,mX) for mφ = 1 GeV. We see that the CMB limit has gaps for
relatively large α when mX & 10 − 15GeV due to anti-resonance regions in (α,mφ,mX), as
encountered in the XQC and CRESST analyses."
4 Combined Limits on the Dark Matter-Nucleon Interaction
"Combining the results from the previous section, fig. 11 shows the allowed/excluded regions of
(α,mX), for mφ = 1GeV, and R0 = 1 fm using constraints from XQC, CRESST, and CMB.
The dashed lines indicate where b = 1, above which the interaction is strong enough that the
Born approximation breaks down. Evidently, in much of the parameter space of interest we
cannot trust Born approximation, and in particular we cannot use the Born scaling (2.13)
to draw our exclusion region, especially in the large coupling region probed by XQC and the
CMB. The CRESST limit is almost always in the b . 1 region so we expect less deviation
from Born approximation and no resonances, except for the narrow anti-resonance region in
which CRESST has sensitivity for α & 0.1."
"We also see that there can be gaps in the exclusion from a single experiment due to
anti-resonant behavior of the cross section, such as for the CMB in fig. 11. Such gaps may
be better overcome by considering multiple experiments with different target mass number
A, rather than trying to improve the sensitivity for the same experiment. Due to the non-
trivial A-scaling in the resonant regime, different targets in general leave different gaps in"
– 14 –
"the parameter space, and the allowed region for one may be excluded for another. Here, we
see that XQC with A = 28 closes the gap in the CMB limit. It should also be noted that
the exact positions shifts of gaps and boundaries move as the nuclear radius R0 and edge-
softening (governed in the spherical-ball approximation by mφ) are changed, so the positions
of perimeters should be considered blurry."
"Based on the allowed parameters (α,mX), we can calculate the allowed σp for DM-
nucleon scattering for each mX , and thereby find the excluded range for σp. We model the
proton as a sphere of radius 1 fm sourcing the mediator. (This distinction from a point-like
nucleon is relevant for larger α and brings the prediction a bit closer to Born approximation,
as shown in fig. 9.) The complete set of allowed/excluded domains of σp are shown in fig. 13,
for mφ= 1 GeV and R0 = 1 fm. The detailed limits are sensitive to uncertainties in the
treatment of the nuclear wave function and mφ, so the boundaries of excluded regions should
be considered a bit blurry."
"We can see significant differences between the excluded σp in our treatment and in the
previous state-of-the-art limits from XQC [3, 10], CRESST [3] and the CMB [4]. There is a
rather non-trivial structure in the topology of the excluded regions for individual experiments.
We illustrate how this comes about using XQC as an example. In [3, 10] it was assessed
based on Born approximation that XQC had sensitivity to proton cross sections & 1 mb for
mX ≤ 3GeV, via multiple scattering of a single DM particle in the detector allowing sufficient
total energy deposit to meet the threshold condition. (The relevance of multiple scattering
for low masses was first pointed out in [9].) However this apparent sensitivity disappears in
our more accurate treatment. To understand how that comes about, fig. 12 shows the exact
and Born predictions for σ28 and σp as a function of α, for mX = 2.5 and 10 GeV. The salient
points are that:"
"1. The upper limit on σ28 becomes weaker and weaker for lighter DM, because a larger
and larger number of multiple scatterings in the detector are needed to produce a total
energy deposit above threshold."
"2. For light DM requiring multiple scattering, e.g., mX = 2.5 GeV shown in the left panel
of fig. 12, σBorn28 > σ"
"Exact
28 for α > 0.2. Therefore, in this regime Born approximation"
"exaggerates the ability to exclude. In the narrow region around α ≈ 0.1, the opposite
is true, resulting in an actually-excluded ""peninsula"" around σp ≈ 10−28 cm2, which is
not evident from the Born approximation."
"3. At higher mass, e.g., mX = 10 GeV shown in the right panel of Fig. 12, the more
stringent limit on σ28 requires α so small as to be barely out of the Born regime. Thus
the treatment of [3, 10] is fairly accurate, yet since the exact σ28 is larger than the Born
value for α in this regime, the limit is strengthened when the exact treatment is used."
"In [3, 10] it was assessed that XQC had sensitivity to proton cross sections & 1 mb for
mX ≤ 3GeV, via multiple scattering of a single DM particle in the detector allowing sufficient
total energy deposit to meet the threshold condition. This apparent sensitivity disappears in
our more accurate treatment, because in this parameter regime DM-Si scattering is near anti-
resonance and multiple scattering does not occur. (Note that b shifts with DM mass through
its µ dependence.) We do find a small increase in sensitivity at the edge of the excluded
region notably when σp ≈ 10−28 cm2 and mX ≈ 2 GeV. The detailed limits at the boundary
region are, however, sensitive to uncertainties in the nuclear wave function modeling and mφ,
so the boundary should be considered blurry."
– 15 –
"Figure 12. Cross sections σp and σ28 versus α, for mX = 2.5 GeV (left) and 10 GeV (right), from
the exact treatment (solid) and Born approximation (dashed). This shows how an XQC upper limit
on σ28 maps into excluded regions of σp, and illustrates how there can be ""islands"" of allowed and
excluded parameters unlike in Born approximation."
"Returning to the summary plot, fig. 13, we see that for CRESST, the true sensitivity
region is generally reduced compared to what the perturbative analysis indicated, except for a
sliver at higher cross section. The loss in CRESST’s sensitivity to cross-sections ∼ 10−29 cm2
falls in the XQC-excluded region, except for 2GeV < mX < 3GeV. Finally, the sensitivity
of the CMB is generally extended by our analysis, except that a large gap in the CMB
limits appears for mX ≥ 10GeV. Fortunately, the large gap in the CMB limit is closed by
XQC. Overall, our exact results are mostly somewhat stronger than in the literature, most
significantly for the CMB which provides the strongest constraint on DM-baryon interaction
for DM mass below 3 GeV."
"As noted, the exact positions of resonance and anti-resonances depends on the shape of
the nuclear wave function and on mφ. Thus the exact position of particular features such
as the ""peninsula"" of XQC sensitivity at low mass, and the island of CRESST sensitivity at
∼ mb cross section, are not well-localized. However the combined limits largely allow these
uncertain regions to be fully covered by other constraints, reducing the sensitivity to these
uncertainties."
"We adopted mφ = 1GeV for our analysis, because in the case of sexaquark DM the
dominant interaction with nucleons is through exchange of the flavor-singlet combination of
ω−φ vector mesons, whose mass is in this range. However constraints based on scattering on
heavier nuclei are relatively insensitive to mφ, because the range of the potential is predom-
inantly governed by the size of the nucleus. In the large-A regime, sensitivity to the exact
nuclear wave function would be the dominant uncertainty unless mφ is small. For a mediator
with mass . 100 MeV, the analysis could change considerably and would need to be redone.
We leave discussion of this regime for a future report."
5 Conclusions
"We have shown that the pioneering and state-of-the-art analyses of direct detection and CMB
constraints are not generally valid in the regime of relatively large coupling and DM mass less"

as appropriate for isoscalar DM."
"than ≈ 10 GeV. We can now see that these works inappropriately used Born approximation
to relate the cross sections for nuclei of different A to that of protons, and furthermore they
did not properly take into account the finite size of nuclei."
"DM-baryon elastic scattering via a massive mediator in general exhibits resonance be-
havior which must be analysed by exact numerical solution of the Schroedinger equation.
For example, GeV-range dark matter with an attractive Yukawa interaction lies in the non-
perturbative resonant regime for the XQC experiment with A = 28, even for Yukawa coupling
strength as low as α = 0.02. In the resonant regime, it is non-trivial to interpret results of
direct detection experiments and other constraints from observations, when A > 1 nuclei are
used as targets. Universal limits on the DM-nucleon cross section cannot be directly obtained
as long as it is the DM-A cross section that is actually experimentally constrained, since there
is a non-trivial, model-dependent relationship between σp and σA. For example, XQC using
a silicon detector leaves a large part of (σp,mX) parameter space for mX . 3GeV allowed,
rather than being excluded as concluded previously based on naive use of Born approximation."
"Analyses of CMB constraints also need modification, due to the non-trivial relation
of DM-He scattering to DM-p scattering. When this is taken into account, we find there
is a gap in the CMB exclusion region for relatively large coupling, due to anti-resonance
behavior which sharply reduces the DM-He cross-section for DM mass above 10-15 GeV. At
the same time, we strengthen the CMB limits for lower masses and smaller σp, due to the"
– 17 –
"non-perturbative enhancement of σHe in this parameter regime.
In our analysis we therefore combine the cosmological CMB constraints with direct"
"detection limits for multiple atomic mass targets, to produce the most complete and reliable
exclusion limits for GeV mass-scale DM. Our summary results are shown in fig. 13. The
interesting parameter space for sexaquark DM (mX . 2 GeV) remains largely unconstrained,
requiring only σp . 10−27 cm2 and Yukawa coupling parameter α . 0.3. The constraints
are stronger for heavier DM, where the energy deposit per collision is larger and the direct
detection experiments XQC and CRESST are more sensitive. As discussed in [2, 3], it is
crucial to measure the thermalization efficiency of semiconductors to small nuclear recoils
before experiments like XQC and CRESST can be interpreted for lower DM masses."
"Recently, in ref. [24] the authors performed experiments with 27 different atomic nuclei
and reported limits on σDM−A for each of them, extending the limits of ref. [25] derived by
consideration of the atmosphere of DM particles surrounding the Earth and its impact on the
evaporation of cryogens and drag on the Hubble Space Telescope. Due to its complexity, we
postpone our analysis of [24, 25] for future work. However the combination of the lower mass
reach and large coverage in A of the constraints of [24, 25], offers promise that these will be
a valuable addition to the constraints on DM interactions with hadrons, for DM in the GeV
mass range."
"The recent limits from [8] using the Milky Way satellite population are not directly
applicable here because non-gravitational DM-baryon interactions modify the structure of
cores of dwarf galaxies, potentially modifying the mapping from as-observed dwarfs to linear-
regime structure used in [8]. The limits from gas cloud cooling [26] are in general weaker than
the CMB constraint for this regime, so we did not include them here."

"The Yukawa potential (1.1) describes a point source nucleus scattering with a point-like DM.
Although this is not so realistic since the nucleus has some finite size which can be comparable
to the range of the potential 1/mφ, it reveals some general features which can also be found
in the result of the extended nucleus model discussed later in this section. To obtain the
total elastic scattering cross section for DM-baryon scattering in the non-relativistic regime,
we need to solve the Schrödinger equation exactly and perform a partial wave analysis."

"Eq. (A.7) is a second order differential equation together with the initial condition ul(0) =
1, u′l(0) = 0 (for regularity of the wave function at x = 0). It needs to be solved for ul(x)
with x ∈ [0,∞), and δl is obtained from ul(∞) as in (A.9). However, numerically the best
we can do is to solve ul(x) for x ∈ [xi, xm] with sufficiently small(large) but finite xi(xm),
and match δl at ul(xm) to achieve appropriate accuracy. The detailed numerical method is
described below.
(1) Since we are changing the initial point from zero to xi > 0, a different initial condition
should be used. When xi is sufficiently small, such that the Yukawa and a2 terms in eq. (A.7)
are sub-dominant compared to the angular momentum term, the solution is approximately
ul(x) ∝ xl+1. Ignoring the overall normalization of u(x) since it is irrelevant for determining
δl, we impose the initial condition:"

"where xit is the smallest classical turning point. (Notice that for l = 0 the angular momentum
term disappears and a different condition must be used.) This is our initial guess for a small
enough xi.
(2) We solve eq. (A.7) with the initial condition (A.14) for x ∈ [xi, xm]. The end point xm is
determined so that the Yukawa term is negligible compared to the a2 term and the angular
term. For any potential which is exactly zero for x ≥ xm, matching the solution at xm will
give the exact δl. The condition for xm is"

"where xmt is the largest classical turning point. The condition involving xmt is critical since in
practice we find the phase shift only starts to converge to its asymptotic value after xmt, where
the wave function starts to oscillate like a sine function. The 5b is chosen from experience,
justified by the fact that b is the only relevant scale introduced by the Yukawa term. This
will be our initial guess for a large enough xm.
(3) At xm we match ul(x) to a new asymptotic form, different from eq. (A.9):"
"lim
x→∞"
ul(x) ∝ xeiδl (cos δljl(ax)− sin δlnl(ax)) (A.17)
"following [27], where jl (nl) is the spherical Bessel (Neumann) function. The corresponding
dimensional condition for the original wave function is"
"lim
r→∞"
Rl(r) ∝ cos δljl(kr)− sin δlnl(kr). (A.18)

(A.19)
"(4) Based on the initial guess of (xi,xm), we calculate δl according to (A.19). To check
convergence, in other words to test if xi(xm) is sufficiently small(large), we first fix xi and
increase xm in units of b (by the assumption that b is the relevant scale for convergence)
until δl converges at 1%, to obtain a (xi,δl) pair. Practically, we find δl will converge within
xm + 20b. Then we decrease xi by half each time until δl converges at 1% with respect to xi.
Our experience shows convergence will be achieved within 2−20xi. Finally we obtain δl for
each (a,b,l).
(5) We calculate σ by summing over l in eq. (A.11). The truncation of the series, lmax, is
determined by the requirement that lmax contributes to σ less than 1% of the sum of all
smaller l, and δlmax <0.01. And we check this condition for 10 successive lmax to make sure
we arrived at sufficiently large l so that higher l makes ignorable contribution."
A.2 Phase Function Method
"An alternative way to calculate the phase shift δl instead of solving the Schrödinger equation,
is the phase function method or variable phase method. See the book by Calogero [28] for"

"details. In our dimensionless parametrization, we define the differential equation obeyed by
the ’phase function’ δl(x):"
"δ′l(x) = axe

b [cos δl(x)jl(ax)− sin δl(x)nl(ax)]"

"(2l + 2)[(2l + 1)!!]2

"lim
x→∞"
"δl(x)→ δl
. (A.21)"
"It is clear that the phase function got it is name since its asymptotic value gives the phase
shift: δl(∞) = δl. The advantage of the phase function method is that the phase equation is
1st order instead of the 2nd order Schrödinger equation. The trade-off is that the equation
is now non-linear. In the form described by equation (A.20), the angular momentum term
is eliminated, so we need to integrate to a larger cut-off point xm to achieve appropriate
convergence for δl. Overall, the phase function method turns out to be more efficient and has
the ability to resolve a much smaller phase shift than the Schrödinger equation method, in
certain regions of the parameter space. In obtaining our results for this paper, both methods
have been used depending on the parameter regime. Our program is written in Mathematica."
