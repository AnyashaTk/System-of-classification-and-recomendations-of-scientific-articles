ABSTRACT
Analyzing the dynamical state of nearby young massive star clusters is essential understanding star
cluster formation and evolution during their earliest stages. In this work we analyze the stellar and gas
kinematics of the young massive star cluster Westerlund 2 (Wd2) using data from the integral field unit
MUSE and complement them with proper motions from the Gaia DR2. The mean gas radial velocity
of 15.9 km s−1 agrees with the assumption that Wd2 is the result of a cloud-cloud collision. The gas
"motions show the expansion of the H II region, driven by the radiation from the many OB stars in the"
cluster center. The velocity profile of the cluster member stars reveal an increasing velocity dispersion
with decreasing stellar mass and that the low-mass stars show five distinct velocity groups. Based on
"their spatial correlation with the cluster’s two clumps, we concluded that this is the imprint of the"
"initial cloud collapse that formed Wd2. A thorough analysis of the dynamical state of Wd2, which"
"determines a dynamical mass range of Mdyn,Wd2 = (7.5±1.9) ·104−(4.4±1.1) ·105 M� and exceeds the
photometric mass by at least a factor of two leads to the conclusion that Wd2 is not massive enough"
to remain gravitationally bound. Additionally we also identify 22 runaway candidates with peculiar
velocities between 30 and 546 km s−1.

1. INTRODUCTION
The detailed study of young star cluster (YSC) kine-
matics is vital to understand their long-term evolution
and survivability. Only if star clusters are massive
enough they may overcome the so-called “infant mortal-
ity” (Lada & Lada 2003) surviving internal and external
"processes that disturb the gravitational potential, such"
"as supernova explosions, which lead to abrupt, violent"

the Galactic disk or a change in the Galactic tidal field

"The detailed kinematic analysis of such young, and still"
embedded clusters and their gaseous and stellar content
down to the hydrogen burning limit (or even below) is
challenging and has only become feasible in recent years

"matic components with distinct age differences, while"
Jerabkova et al. (2019) suggest the detection of multi-
ple populations in its young stellar population. McLeod
et al. (2015) studied the detailed kinematics of the “Pil-
lars of Creation” in the Eagle Nebula finding radial ve-
"locity (RV) differences of ∼ 2 km/s between the different
pillars. Their analysis also revealed a possible protostel-"
lar outflow and let them identify both lobes as a blue
and a red shifted counterpart. Time domain studies
"(e.g., Sabbi et al. 2020) have the capability of detect-"
"ing protoplanetary disks, stellar variability, and the bi-"
"nary fraction, which is important to the evolution of the"
whole cluster system (we refer to Portegies Zwart et al.
(2010) and Krumholz & McKee (2020) for a detailed
overview).
The measurement of the internal kinematics of YSCs
has been observationally very expensive. Especially for
"the determination of RVs, high resolution stellar spectra"
"had to be obtained. For many fiber or slit spectrographs,"
only a handful of stars can be observed simultaneously.
"With the development of efficient, large field of view"
(FOV) integral field units (IFUs) over the past decade
and the increasing computational capacities it has be-
come possible to study the RV of entire stellar popula-
tions in resolved star clusters. The optical IFU with the
largest FOV to date (1 arcmin2) is the Multi Unit Spec-
"troscopic Explorer (MUSE, Bacon et al. 2010) mounted"
"at UT4 of the Very Large Telescope (VLT), which al-"
lows us to survey larger regions similar to photometric
studies. MUSE has been proven to be an excellent in-
strument to spectroscopically map nearby star-forming
regions to study the kinematics of their stars and the gas
"simultaneously (e.g., McLeod et al. 2015, 2020; Zeidler"
"et al. 2018, 2019, for the latter two, hereafter Paper 1"
and Paper 2). In Paper 1 we showed that it is indeed
possible to measure stellar RVs in YSCs to an accuracy
"of ∼ 2 km s−1 using MUSEpack, despite the lack of
pre-main sequence (PMS) stellar spectral libraries and"
the variable and high local background. For a detailed
description of the code and the assessment of the uncer-
tainties we refer to Paper 2.
This work is the third paper in a series (Paper 1; Pa-
per 2) spectroscopically studying the Galactic young
"massive star cluster Westerlund 2 (Wd2, Westerlund"
1961) using MUSE data. Wd2 is the central ionizing star
cluster of the H II region RCW49 (Rodgers et al. 1960)
located in the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm at a dis-
"tance of ∼ 4.16 kpc (Zeidler et al. 2015; Vargas Álvarez
et al. 2013) at an age of 1–2 Myr (Zeidler et al. 2015)."
"With a total photometric stellar mass of 3.7 · 104 M�,
Wd2 is the second most massive young star cluster in"
"the Milky Way (MW, Zeidler et al. 2017), after Wester-"
"lund 1 (∼ 5 · 104 M�, e.g., Clark et al. 2005; Andersen
et al. 2017). This cluster is built from two coeval clumps,"
the MC and NC (Hur et al. 2014; Zeidler et al. 2015)
and is highly mass segregated (Zeidler et al. 2017). The
"close proximity, its numerous OB stars in the cluster cen-"
"ter (e.g., Rauw et al. 2004, 2011; Bonanos et al. 2004;"
"Vargas Álvarez et al. 2013), and its young age (so far"
no supernova explosion has been detected) make Wd2
a prime target to study the internal processes of star
cluster formation and pre-supernovae evolution.
In this work we present a detailed analysis of the dy-
namical state of Wd2 to determine whether it has a
"chance to overcome infant mortality, and to better un-"
derstand its formation process. This paper is structured
the following. In Sect. 2 we give a brief introduction to
the used data. In Sect. 3 we reanalyze the spatial struc-
ture of Wd2 to obtain missing key parameters. In Sect. 4
we present a detailed analysis of the gas and stellar RVs
including the dynamical state of Wd2. Sect. 5 intro-
duces the data obtained from the Gaia mission and in
Sect. 6 we analyze high-velocity stellar runaway candi-
dates. In Sect. 7 we provide a in-depth discussion about
the results obtained in the previous sections and put
"them into a greater context, while in Sect. 8 we summa-"
rize the analysis and our findings.
2. THE DATA AND DATA REDUCTION
"We will only provide a brief overview of the dataset,"
"data reduction, and RV measurements. A detailed de-"
scription was presented in Paper 1 and Paper 2. The
"data and their derived products used in this work, such"
"as stellar RVs, are identical to those of Paper 2."
We surveyed Wd2 using 21.5 h of VLT/MUSE time
"(Program ID: 097.C-0044(A), 099.C-0248(A), PI: P. Zei-"
dler). We combined 11 short (220 s) and 5 long (3600 s)
"exposures to simultaneously cover the gas, the high-"
"mass, luminous OB stars, and the fainter PMS stars"
"down to ∼ 1 M�. MUSE was operated in the ex-
tended mode covering a wavelength range of 4600–"
9350 Å. The short exposures were executed in the
wide-field mode without the adaptive optics (AO) sys-
tem (WFM NOAO) while four of the five long expo-
sures were executed in the wide-field mode with AO
"(WFM AO), which results in a spatial resolution im-"
provement by a factor of two. Because in AO mode the
notch filter of the Na-lasers blocks the coverage in the
"5780–5990 Å range, we chose the WFM NOAO mode for"
the short exposures as to cover the He Iλ5876 line.

The complex internal dynamics of Wd2 3"
The data was reduced with the musereduce module
of the python package MUSEpack1 (Zeidler 2019) to-
gether with the standard MUSE data reduction pipeline
"(Weilbacher et al. 2012, 2015). In total we extracted"
1726 stellar spectra with a mean signal-to-noise ratio2
"(S/N) ≥ 5 using the software package PampelMuse (Ka-
mann et al. 2013, 2016) in combination with our deep,"
"high-resolution, multi-band photometric star catalog ex-"
tracted from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observa-
"tions (ID: 13038, PI: A. Nota, Zeidler et al. 2015) to"
detect and de-blend the stellar spectra. The world coor-
dinate system (WCS) of all data were corrected to match
"the Gaia data release 2 (DR2, Gaia Collaboration et al."
2016; Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018).
3. THE STELLAR SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION
Zeidler et al. (2015) confirmed the finding of Hur et al.
"(2014) that Wd2 is built from two subclumps, the main"
cluster (MC) and the northern clump (NC) with a pro-
"jected separation of ∼ 1 pc at the distance of Wd2. We
reanalyze the spatial structure using both the stellar sur-"
face density and the stellar mass density obtained from
our photometric HST catalog down to the 50% com-
pleteness limit of all cluster member stars (Zeidler et al.
2017). We use a maximum likelihood approach to fit
two peaks to the density distributions including a com-
mon offset to account for a halo of lower-mass stars and
test two different distributions: 1) two 2D Gaussian pro-
files and 2) the Elson-Fall-Freeman (EFF) profile (Elson
et al. 1987). The latter is an empirical surface density
profile as a function of r that was found to well describe
the surface density of massive YSCs in the MW. It has
the form:
Σ(r) = Σ0
")−γ/2
, (1)"
with Σ0 being the peak surface density and a being a
"scale parameter. The core radius, rc, used by the King"
(1966) profile (to fit Globular Cluster profiles) is:
"rc = a
("
"2
2/γ − 1"
")1/2
, (2)"
where γ and a are the EFF profile parameters (for a
detailed summary see also Portegies Zwart et al. 2010).
After running extensive Markov-Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) fitting of the two density distributions to
"the data, the Akaike information criterion (AIC,"
"1 MUSEpack is made available for download on Github https://
github.com/pzeidler89/MUSEpack.git"
"2 Whenever we refer to the S/N of spectra we always provide a
S/N per spectral bin."
"Akaike 1974), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC,"
"Schwarz 1978), and the Watanabe – Akaike information"
"criterion (WAIC, Watanabe 2010; Gelman et al. 2013)"
clearly favors the EFF model over a Gaussian distribu-
tion. The best-fit parameters for the mass and number
density distributions are shown in Tab. 1 and Fig. 1.
The dynamical evolution of a star cluster is highly
"driven by its mass distribution and, therefore, we will"
use the mass density as reference distribution. We
define the coordinates of the Wd2 cluster (R.A. =
"10h24m02s.128, Dec. = −57◦45m04s.30) as the geo-
metric mean of the centers of the two clumps, simi-"
lar to the definition in Zeidler et al. (2015). Integrat-
ing over the mass density distribution leads to a total
clump mass above the 50% completeness limit of m50MC =
"(0.55±0.01) ·104 M� and m50NC = (0.05±0.01) ·10
4 M�,"
which agrees with the masses estimated using the stellar
mass function (Zeidler et al. 2017).
The half-mass radius for the EFF profile is defined as:
"rhm = a
("
"2−γ − 1
)1/2"
"and yields rhm = (0.23 ± 0.01) pc and rhm = (0.31 ±
0.01) pc for the MC and NC, respectively3. The expo-"
nential decline of the stellar distribution is with γMC =
"7.61±0.01 and γNC = 7.63±0.02 steeper than observed
in other YSCs (typical values are γ = 2–3, e.g., Elson"
"et al. 1987; Portegies Zwart et al. 2010), which may be"
"explained by the composite nature of Wd2, the high de-"
"gree of mass-segregation, and that the distribution is"
"only fit to the stars above the 50% completeness limit,"
which increases core densities.
For any further analysis of the cluster stellar popula-
"tion we define the size of Wd2 as the combined, encir-"
"cled area of 1.5 times the radius (around each clump)4,"
at which the stellar mass density drops to the halo
(background) density of Σbck = 70.82 M� (black lines
in Fig. 1).
4. THE RADIAL VELOCITY PROFILE
To measure RVs5 we used our new method that al-
lows us to measure stellar RVs without the need of a
"spectral template library, which was implemented in"
the RV spectrum module of MUSEpack. RV spectrum
uses strong stellar absorption lines in combination with
a Monte Carlo approach to measure stellar RVs to
"3 For the detailed error propagation see eq. A3 to A5
4 The factor of 1.5 is chosen such that the irregularly, elongated"
"shape of the stellar distribution (see top, left frames of Fig. 1) is
taken into account."
"5 Throughout the paper we may use the term “velocity” inter-
changeable for “radial velocity” if it is clear from context."

mon for PMS stars and is the result of accretion
processes.
2. The regions around each of the chosen absorption
"lines are fitted, using a user-provided spectral line"
"library, together with a low-order polynomial to"
match the local continuum. A spectral template
is created using the line parameters of the best-
fitting solution and the rest-frame wavelengths.
3. These templates are cross-correlated with the stel-
"lar spectra using the core of each line, which pro-"
vides a RV measurement per absorption line. This
"cross-correlation is typically repeated 10,000 times"
and for each iteration the uncertainties of the spec-
trum are randomly reordered. A sigma clipping is
applied that ensures that lines with “odd” profiles
are removed from the final RV fit.
"4. The remaining, trustworthy, lines are now cross-"
correlated together with a typical repetition of
"20,000 times. The resulting Gaussian distribution"
gives the RV of the star (mean) and the uncer-
tainty (1σ).
Extensive tests of this method are described in Pa-
per 2 to ensure its reliability and to show its limitations
and possible sources for errors. In Appendix B we show
the extracted and fitted spectra of four different Wd2
"member stars (see Fig. 9, 10, and 11.)"
4.2. The gas velocities
To obtain the gas velocity profile we use a similar ap-
proach as McLeod et al. (2015) by stacking the spectra
of individual gas emission lines to a single spectral line
per spatial pixel (spaxel). This stacking results in a well-
"sampled line, which is fit by a Gaussian profile to mea-
sure the RVs on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis. This method"
is computationally more efficient than measuring RVs
with MUSEpack but it is only applicable if there
"are a significant number of strong, non-blended spec-"
tral lines available that have a reasonably flat contin-
uum. We used the PYTHON packages pyspeckit (Gins-
burg & Mirocha 2011) and spectral cube6 to com-
"bine the Hα, the N IIλλ6549.85, 6585.28 Å, and the"
"S IIλλ6718.29, 6732.67 Å emission lines. The continuum"
was extracted in the spectral range of 6620–6660 Å. We
"avoid using the [O I]λλ6300, 6363Å emission lines due to"
"the applied “modified sky subtraction” (Paper 2), which"
properly recovers these lines but it may slightly change
their centroids due to Telluric residuals. To obtain the
6 https://spectral-cube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
mean gas velocity of the H II region small differences in
the velocities of the individual gas components can be
"neglected (e.g., McLeod et al. 2016, Paper 1). Addition-"
"ally, we masked the stars and extrapolated the gas ve-"
locities at each stellar position to get a clean gas velocity
"map (see left frame of Fig. 2). The median RV of the gas,"
"determined from all MUSE pixels, is 15.9 km s−1, which"
we will use henceforth as the systemic RV of Wd2 rel-
ative to the Sun. This systemic velocity is subtracted
from all further RV measurements in this study unless
stated otherwise.
The gas velocity profile (left frame of Fig. 2) clearly
shows that the central part of the cloud is receding while
the outer ridges move toward us. When comparing the
gas RV map with the extinction map (see right frame
"of Fig. 2 and Zeidler et al. 2015), we see a correlation"
"between the magnitude of the E(B−V ) color excess and
the gas motion. By comparing the average gas velocity"
"with the average E(B − V ) color excess (left frame of
Fig. 3) we indeed see significantly higher E(B− V ) val-
ues at negative RVs. Locations with a lower line-of-sight"
extinction allow us to look deeper into the gas cloud7.
We conclude that we actually see the expansion of the
H II region driven by the stellar winds and the far ul-
traviolet (FUV) radiation of the numerous OB stars of
"Wd2 (e.g., Rauw et al. 2004, 2005, 2007; Bonanos et al."
"2004; Vargas Álvarez et al. 2013; Drew et al. 2014, Pa-"
per 1). To better visualize the expansion we show a
black-white version of the gas RV map (right frame of
Fig. 2) in which we marked the bottom (blue) and the
"top (red) 10% of the RV distribution, as well as, the gas"
"with vsys ± 1 km s−1. This suggests a differential RV of
the H II region of ∼ 15 km s−1."
4.3. The stellar radial velocities
To measure stellar RVs we used the following spec-
"tral absorption lines, depending on the stellar type:"
"He Iλλ 4922, 5876, 6678, 7065 Å, He IIλλ 4685, 5412 Å,"
"Mg Iλλ 5367, 5172, 5183 Å, Na Iλλ 5889, 5895 Å, and"
"Ca IIλλ 8498, 8542, 8662 Å. We intentionally avoided"
"other strong absorption lines, such as Balmer lines since"
these may be unreliable for RV measurements due to the
"young stellar age, the possible ongoing accretion pro-"
"cesses, and nebular contamination. An overview of the"
"7 We note here that the Zeidler et al. (2015) color-excess map does
not distinguish between the extinction caused by the H II region
and the foreground extinction. Given the relatively small FOV
(∼ 5′ × 5′) of the survey area, we do not expect any significant
variations of the foreground extinction. The regions with low ex-
tinction in the Zeidler et al. (2015) color-excess map are in agree-
ment with the foreground color-excess, E(B − V )fg = 1.05 mag,
estimated by Hur et al. (2014)."

applied method is given in Sect. 4.1 and an in-depth
"analysis of the underlying assumptions, the selection"
"criteria, as well as the limitations and uncertainties is"
presented in Paper 2.
In total we extract reliable RVs from 388 stars. Based
"on the F814W −F160W vs. F814W and the F555W −
F814W vs. F555W color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs)"
created with our HST photometric catalog (Zeidler et al.
"2015), 117 source are located in the Wd2 cluster and"
271 are foreground field stars. The high extinction
(AV = 6.12 mag) toward Wd2 allows for a clean sep-
aration between cluster members and field stars. The
"typical (mean) RV uncertainties are σclmtyp = 1.96 km s
−1"
"and σfieldtyp = 1.87 km s
−1 for the cluster members and"
"MW field stars, respectively. In Fig. 4 we show the stel-"
lar RV distribution of the cluster members (top panel)
and field stars (bottom panel). The field stars span over
a wider RV range than the cluster members but gener-
ally their RV spaces overlap. This is expected due to the
location of Wd2 close to the tangent point of the Carina-
Sagittarius spiral arm. To create the RV histograms we
use a running mean with a step size of 0.1 km s−1 and
a bin width of the typical uncertainty. This method
reduces a possible bias caused by binning the data.
4.4. The Wd2 velocity profile
From the isochrone fitting to CMDs (Zeidler et al.
2015; Sabbi et al. 2020) we know that the PMS turn-
"on is at ∼ 3 − 5 M�, which means that most O and
B stars are already in their main-sequence (MS) phase."
"Therefore, we divide the stars into three groups:"
1. O-stars: showing He I and He II absorption fea-
"tures (16 stars),"
2. B-stars: showing He I but no He II absorption
"features (26 stars), and"
"3. later type stars: showing metal features, such as"
Mg I-Triplet or Ca II-Triplet (75 stars).
These groups divide the stars into different evolution-
ary stages and certain mass ranges. As the next step
we create RV histograms of the three groups (see Fig. 5)
with the same method as Fig. 4.
The histograms immediately reveal a significant differ-
ence in the velocity distribution of the stellar types. The
"more massive the stars, the smaller their velocity disper-"
sion. To quantify this initial analysis we fit a combina-
tion of Gaussians to the RV histograms using MCMC.
This allows us to properly account for the individual RV
uncertainties. The three distributions are best described
"by a single Gaussian for the O-stars, a combination of"
"two Gaussians for the B-stars, and five Gaussians for"
the PMS stars. Using the AIC and BIC as well as the
convergence of the MCMC fit we ensure that five ve-
locity groups are the best fitting number of components

tion of the individual stellar RV uncertainty measure-

To investigate the origin of the individual stellar ve-
locity groups we analyze the spatial location of the stars
within one standard deviation of the mean of each veloc-
"ity group (error bars in Fig. 5). Additionally, the stars"
also need to be located within the Wd2 cluster as de-
fined in Sect. 3. These two limitations ensure that we
only analyze stars that can be uniquely identified with
one velocity group and whose locus coincides with the
"immediate cluster, which leaves us with 5 to 14 stars for"
each group (see Tab. 2). We use a 2D kernel density
estimator (KDE) with a Gaussian kernel to better visu-
alize the number density of the (relatively low number
of) stars in each velocity group (see Fig. 6).
4.4.1. The O and B stars
The O and B stars are mostly concentrated toward
the center of Wd2 with the majority co-located with
the MC. This is in complete agreement with a highly
mass-segregated cluster. There is no apparent correla-
tion between the spatial location of the stars and the two
velocity groups of the B stars. Possible undetected bi-
naries can be excluded as a source for the two peaks
of the B-star distribution. The dispersion of MUSE
"is 2.4 Å, which means that a minimum relative veloc-"
"ity of ∼ 80–160 km s−1 is necessary to detect line split-
ting caused by the binary components (compared to the"
"(9.08 ± 0.43) km s−1 between B1 and B2, see Tab. 2).
The visual inspection of all used spectra does not hint"
for any such line splitting.
4.4.2. The late-type PMS stars
To avoid confusion due to five groups and the larger
"number of stars, we divide the PMS stars into three"
different plots (bottom frames of Fig. 6). The stars
"with an RV of (−16.75 ± 5.18) km s−1 (PMS1, yellow)
appear to be distributed throughout the cluster region"
The complex internal dynamics of Wd2 9
with the highest concentration of stars aligned with
the the center of Wd2 along the MC–NC axis. The
"stars with RVs of (−8.40± 1.85) km s−1 (PMS2, green))
and (3.10 ± 2.46) km s−1 (PMS4, brown) tend to be lo-
cated North of the cluster center. The remaining two"
"RV groups with (−3.57± 2.00) km s−1 (PMS3, red) and
(−9.41 ± 1.82) km s−1 (PMS5, black) are more concen-
trated toward the MC. Interestingly, the difference of"
the mean velocities of groups PMS2-PMS4 and PMS3-
"PMS5 is very similar with (11.50 ± 0.41) km s−1 and
(12.90± 0.24) km s−1, respectively."
4.4.3. The spatial location of the velocity groups
The number of stars per velocity group is fairly low
and to quantify the spatial correlation we use a 2D
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test (Hodges 1958; Peacock
1983; Fasano & Franceschini 1987). The null-hypothesis
(H0) we use is: two individual velocity groups follow the
same spatial distribution. This means that if H0 is true
the p-value is larger than the significance level α. We
test H0 against α = 5% (confidence level: 95%). In
addition we also test their spatial locations against all
Wd2 members of the HST photometric star catalog and
the onse detected with MUSE. The resulting p-values
are presented in Tab 3. We also apply the 1D KS test
we transform the two-dimensional location of the stars
into one dimensional distribution by creating a cumu-
lative distribution of the stars’ distances to a reference
point. The results of the 1D KS test highly vary with
the choice of the reference point so we decided that the
1D KS test is not suited for our purposes. The KS-test
results can be summarized the following:
"• HST vs. MUSE catalog: A p-value of 0.274 shows
that their underlying spatial distribution is the"
"same. This minimizes the chance of introducing
correlations based on detection effects, such as"
completeness.
"• Groups O1, B1, and B2: The 2D KS test con-
firms that these groups are spatially correlated to"
"each other and to the full Wd2 MUSE catalog,"
in agreement with a mass segregated star cluster.
We must note here that the p-value between the
velocity groups B1 and B2 is only marginally sig-
nificant.
"• PMS2 – PMS4: With p = 0.045 the correlation
is only marginally significant. Yet, given the in-"
spection of the KDE plot and that it is by far
the highest p-value with respect to the other PMS
groups let us conclude that these two groups are
spatially correlated.
"• PMS3 – PMS5: The p-values suggest that these
groups are correlated to each other but also to the"
"O1, B1, B2, and PMS1 groups. Given their much"
different RV profile suggest that this is only the
case because they are centered around the MC.
The 2D KS tests confirm our initial analysis about the
spatial correlation of the PMS3 and PMS5 groups with
the MC and the PMS2 and PMS4 groups with the NC.
The PMS1 group is consistent with a group that follows
the spatial distribution of the Wd2 cluster.
"4.4.4. Are the velocity groups a result of small number
statistics?"
Even though our sample consist of 117 cluster member
"stars, dividing them into 8 individual velocity groups"
"leaves only a handful of stars per group (see Tab. 2),"
which raises the question whether the individual groups
are a result of small number statistics. In the following
we estimate the likelihood that the five PMS RV groups
are the result of a random occurrence by simulating 300
realizations of the PMS stellar RV distribution using
Bayesian sampling. We test two different scenarios:
1. The true RV distribution only has one broad peak;
2. The true RV distribution is similar to the distri-
bution of the B-stars including a blue shifted com-
ponent (representing the PMS1 peak).
"For the first scenario, we sample the 300 different re-"
alizations using a likelihood distribution of one broad
"Gaussian with a mean velocity of −2.12 km s−1 and
a velocity dispersion of 11.09 km s−1, estimated from"
the cluster member RV distribution (see Fig. 4). For
the second scenario we use a combination of three
"Gaussians, representing the PMS1, B1, and B2 groups"
(see Tab. 2). For both scenarios the RV uncertainties
are sampled from a likelihood distribution of the form
"p(σ) ∝ σ · e − σ/a, which is a good (empirical) fit to the
observed uncertainties (see Fig. 14)."
We then try to recover the true RV distribution of
"each scenario, as well as five RV groups. We use the"
same priors and technique as we used for the real data.
To analyze the results we compare the number of MCMC
runs that reach convergence8. For the first scenario in
only 16.0% (48 out of 300 realizations) we find five peaks
while in 80.3% (241 out of 300 realizations) the underly-
ing true distribution can be recovered. For scenario two
"8 We consider only those that converged to one value for each pa-
rameter and each parameter stays well within set boundaries.
The latter ensures physically meaningful results (e.g., no nega-
tive amplitudes)."
10 Zeidler et al.
"Figure 6. The spatial distribution of the individual RV groups for the O and B stars (top frames) and the later-type PMS
stars (bottom three frames). The colors scheme is identical to Fig. 5 for the velocity groups. We divided the later-type PMS
stars into three individual plots to avoid confusion. The contours represent the spatial stellar density of each stellar velocity
group determined via a KDE. The white dashed circles mark the scale radii a and the dash-dotted lines are the Wd2 cluster
are (see Sect. 3)."
in 26.0% (75 out of 300 realizations) we find five peaks
while in 75.0% (225 out of 300 realizations) the under-
"lying distribution can be recovered. These results, in"
combination with the correlation of the spatial location
"of the stars and their membership to certain RV groups,"
suggest that it is unlikely that small number statistics
are the reason for the five groups. Although the five
"RV peaks are the most probable result, a second, inde-"
pendent dataset like higher resolution spectroscopy or
high-precision astrometry (see Sect. 5) may provide an
independent confirmation.
4.5. The dynamical state
To determine whether this cluster has the chance of
overcoming the “infant mortality” we will make an as-
sessment of its dynamical state by estimating its dy-
"namical mass Mdyn, the viral radius rvir, and the dy-"
namical time tdyn or crossing time (detailed derivations
and discussions of these parameters can be found in
Spitzer 1987; Fleck et al. 2006; Portegies Zwart et al.
"2010; Krumholz & McKee 2020; Adamo et al. 2020, and"
references therein).
The dynamical mass is defined as follows:
Mdyn = η
"(
σ2rhm
G"
")
, (4)"
"where σ is the 1D velocity dispersion, G the gravi-"
"tational constant, rhm the half-mass radius, and η is a"
dimensionless parameter to link observational accessible
parameters with theory and is typically η = 9.75 for
clusters with γ > 4 (see Tab. 1 for Wd2 parameters).
"For this value, the virial radius is rvir = 1.625 · rhm.
The typical assumption is that massive star clusters"
"are spherically symmetric, which is not the case for Wd2."
"Therefore, we decided to analyze the following cases:"
1) the MC and NC are separate clusters; 2) the MC
and NC are located at the same position in space with
"rhm,Wd2 = (rhm,MC + rhm,NC)/2; 3) the half mass ra-"
"dius of Wd2 incorporates both the MC and the NC,"
"hence rhm,Wd2 = rhm,NC + rhm,MC + d(MC,NC); and 4)"
a thought experiment on which is the minimal necessary
half-mass radius for a bound spherical cluster with the
photometric mass of Wd2. The results are:

2. The assumed half-mass radius of Wd2 is
"rhm,Wd2 = (0.13 ± 0.04) pc. The velocity dis-
persion, σWd2 = (11.09 ± 1.36) km s−1, is esti-
mated from the cluster member velocity distribu-"
tion (see Fig. 4). This yields a dynamical mass of
"Mdyn,Wd2 = (7.5± 1.9) · 104 M�."
3. The assumed half-mass radius of Wd2 incorporat-
"ing the MC and NC is rhm,Wd2 = (1.57± 0.01) pc,
which leads to a dynamical mass of Mdyn,Wd2 ="
(4.4± 1.1) · 105 M� (with σWd2 as in 2.).
"4. We assume Mdyn = Mphot = (3.7 ± 0.8) · 104 M�
(Zeidler et al. 2017). With σWd2 as in 2., the half"
mass radius is rhm = (0.13± 0.04) pc.
"The dynamical time, or crossing time, is the time that"
a star needs to cross the cluster system. It indicates how
long a system needs to establish or re-establish dynam-
ical equilibrium. It is defined as:
tdyn =
"√
r3vir"
"GMphot
. (5)"
For the results of the four cases the dynamical time
"yields: 1.) tdyn,MC = 0.3 Myr and tdyn,NC = 1.6 Myr;"
"2.) tdyn,Wd2 = 0.034 Myr, 3.) tdyn,Wd2 = 4.64 Myr, and"
"4.) tdyn,Wd2 = 0.11 Myr."
It becomes clear that the dynamical mass and time
highly depend on the structure of the underlying system
and the assumptions made to determine these parame-
"ters, which we will discuss in detail in Sect. 7."
5. THE Gaia DR2
The Wd2 cluster and its parental H II region RCW49
is being observed by the Gaia satellite and the al-
"ready collected data is part of the data release 2 (DR2,"
Prusti et al. 2016; Brown et al. 2018). Its location
in the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm and the extinction
and crowding impose limitations to the DR2 accuracy.
"Hence, many cluster member parameters, such as stellar"
"velocities, and parallaxes are still poorly constrained9."
"Nevertheless, we analyze the existing Gaia stellar"
proper motions (pms) using priors based on the knowl-
edge we gained from the HST and MUSE data. We
cross-correlate the HST and the Gaia catalogs. Of the
"20,482 point sources in the HST catalog, 1239 are in-
cluded in the Gaia DR2, of which 471 are cluster mem-"
ber stars based on the HST CMD selection (Zeidler et al.
2015; Sabbi et al. 2020). To select stars with a clean as-
trometric solution we use the following magnitude based
limits as suggested by Lindegren et al. (2018):
"u < 1.2 ·max (1, exp (−0.2 · (G− 19.5))), (6)"
"where G is the Gaia G-band magnitude and u =(
χ2/ν"
")1/2
. χ is the astrometric goodness-of-fit in the"
“along-scan” direction and ν is the adjoined number of
good observations. This leaves us with 282 cluster mem-
"bers, of which 85 also have MUSE RVs. We use the"
"9 For example, only three stars of the HST photometric catalog
have Gaia RVs (Paper 1)"
12 Zeidler et al.
282 cluster members to calculate the systemic pms in
"R.A. and Dec. µα∗,sys = −5.17 mas yr−110 and µδ,sys =
3.00 mas yr−1, which is µα∗,sys = −101.9 km s−1 and
µδ,sys = 59.1 km s"
−1 at the distance of Wd2 (4.16 kpc).
As for the cluster RVs (Sect. 4) we subtract the systemic
velocities from the cluster members throughout the rest
of this work unless stated otherwise.
To analyze the pm distributions we only use the 85
stars that have MUSE RVs. This allows us to dif-
"ferentiate between O-stars, B-stars, and PMS stars."
For the pm distributions we use the same method
as for the RVs (Sect. 4.3). The typical uncertainties
"are σµα∗ = 0.332 mas yr
−1 (6.55 km s−1) and σµδ ="
"0.329 mas yr−1 (6.49 km s−1) for cluster members, and"
"σµα∗ = 0.524 mas yr
−1 and σµδ = 0.542 mas yr"
−1 for
field stars. We show the field star distributions in the
bottom panel of Fig. 7 (R.A. in black and Dec. in green).
The arrows indicate the respective cluster member sys-
temic pms. Similar to the RVs (see Fig. 4) the velocity
space of the field stars and the cluster members overlap.
This means that also pms are not suitable to improve
the cluster member selection.
"The pm profiles of the O-stars, B-stars, and PMS"
stars (top panels of Fig. 7) indicate a similar distribu-
tion as the RV profile. The O-stars and B-stars are
centered around the 0 km s−1 with the B-stars show-
ing a slightly broader velocity profile. The distribu-
tion of the PMS is much broader covering more than
20 km s−1. While they are also centered around the sys-
temic pm in declination they appear to be slightly offset
in R.A.. In both pm directions the PMS stars show
"two peaks at σµα∗ ≈ 0 km s−1 and σµα∗ ≈ 12 km s−1
and σµδ ≈ −5 km s−1 and σµδ ≈ 8 km s−1. The fairly
high pm uncertainties (in comparison to the RVs) do"
not allow to resolve the five individual velocity groups
"detected with the RVs, assuming they have a similar"
separation and dispersion in pm direction. Addition-
"ally, the Gaia DR2 data is less deep than the MUSE"
"dataset, which may lead to a similar effect we saw in"
Paper 1 for the shallower MUSE sample. Here also only
"two RV peaks where detected (∼ 17 km s−1 apart). In
the right top panels of Fig. 7 we show the pm distri-"
bution of the five PMS RV groups. Their distributions
"indicate marginal relative shifts, yet the relatively large"
uncertainties and the low numbers (not all RV stars
have pms) do not allow for a confirmation of the ve-
locity groups. Future Gaia data releases will provide
the necessary precision.

of the five RV groups (see Fig. 5). The bottom panel shows
the pm distributions of the foreground field stars (R.A. in

6. HIGH VELOCITY RUNAWAY CANDIDATES
High stellar densities in YSCs (either naturally formed
"or through rapid mass-segregation), binaries, and"
higher-order systems increase the probability for close
"encounters within the cluster (e.g., Portegies Zwart"
"et al. 2010, and reference therein). These dynamical in-"
teractions and supernova explosions (if one binary com-
ponent explodes) can give a star a “kick” making it a
runaway star. Runaway events are believed to be the
main source of populating the field with these massive
objects (Blaauw 1961; Portegies Zwart et al. 2010). In
"the MW, sources with a velocity > 30 km s−1 relative to"
the local standard of rest are considered as runaway stars
(Hoogerwerf et al. 2001). Recent studies found that a
significant number of massive O and B-stars may have
"been ejected from YSCs including Wd2, NGC3603, and"
R136 Roman-Lopes et al. (2011); Lennon et al. (2018);
"Drew et al. (2018, 2019)."
The complex internal dynamics of Wd2 13
"In both, the MUSE RV distribution and the Gaia DR2"
pm distributions (see Fig. 5 and 7) we see bona-fide clus-
"ter member stars with velocities exceeding ±30 km s−1.
To analyze these runaway candidates we calculate their"
peculiar velocities based on the three velocity compo-
"nents (RV, µα∗, µδ). We only consider those sources,"
whose total pm uncertainty do not exceed 50% prior
"to the systemic velocity subtraction, which ensures that"
a proper direction of the stars’ motion can be deter-
mined. The pm uncertainty ellipse is determined fol-
lowing eq. (9) in Lindegren et al. (2016) and eq. (B.2) in
Lindegren et al. (2018). Since we are only interested in
"the the relative motion of the stars, we do not consider"
any systematic offsets in the DR2 pms and parallaxes
as they are described in Lindegren et al. (2018). In
"total we find 22 stars that fulfill the above criteria, of"
which one is an O9.5V star11 (ID: 10198) and one is a B-
type star (ID: 10048). The parameters of all 22 sources
are listed in Tab. 4. In Fig. 8 we show the location
of the runaway candidates. The green arrows point in
"the direction of the stars movement in pm space, while"
the length of the vector represents the velocity. The el-
lipse at each vector’s tip represents the pm error ellipse.
The size of each point represents the magnitude of the
RV (blue/red points indicate a relative RV toward/away
from the Sun).
The majority of runaway candidates show peculiar ve-
locities in the range of 30–100 km s−1. Only three stars
"exceed this range: ID-1358712 with 123.2 ± 4.2 km s−1,
ID-1630613 with 245.8±2.3 km s−1, and ID-1454214 with
546.1± 5.3 km s−1."

In the following we will discuss the results presented
in this work on the internal dynamics of Wd2.

"CO sub-millimeter observations, that cloud-cloud colli-"
sion of two CO clouds at 4 km s−1 and 16 km s−1 may
have triggered the formation of Wd2. Our RV analysis of
the H II region RCW49 surrounding Wd2 shows that its
mean RV of 15.9 km s−1 is in agreement with their con-
"clusion. Furthermore, is the cavity, created by the ioniz-"

see Fig. 3). Hence, the ∼ 15 km s−1 should be consid-
ered as a lower limit. Nevertheless, the expansion rate of"
"∼ 7−10 km s−1 is comparable with studies of other H II
regions, such as N44 (∼ 6−11 km s−1, Nazé et al. 2002;
McLeod et al. 2019), N11 and N180 (∼ 10 km s−1 and
10−20 km s−1, respectively, Nazé et al. 2001), and other
Magellanic Clouds, Milky Way, and extra galactic H II"
"regions (e.g., Murray & Rahman 2010; Mesa-Delgado &"
"Esteban 2010; McLeod et al. 2020). These numbers are
also supported by a variety of numerical models and sim-"
ulations (Osterbrock & Michael Shull 1989; Bertoldi &
McKee 1990; Fujii & Zwart 2016; Haid et al. 2018). The
stellar and gas velocities are uncorrelated. We conclude
"that the H II region is dominated by feedback processes,"
"such as stellar winds and radiation pressure (see e.g.,"
Dale 2015) and has lost the imprint of the original cloud
collapse.
In Paper 1 we demonstrated that cluster member stars
show two distinct RV groups. The use of the short ex-
posures only led to a smaller sample of stars with a
"cutoff at higher masses, which led to a bias toward more"
massive stars. Combining the short and long exposures
and using the full capacity of MUSEpack allows us to
conduct a more sophisticated study of the stellar RV dis-
tribution. The three main results of this analysis are: 1)
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3433996
"
14 Zeidler et al."
stars of different masses show different RV distributions
"2) the lower the stellar mass, the higher the velocity dis-"
"persion, and 3) the low-mass PMS stars show five dis-"
"tinct, spatially correlated RV groups. The distributions"
"of the O and B stars (one and two peaks, see Fig. 5)"
are in agreement with the two RV peaks detected in Pa-
per 1. The overall smaller RV dispersion of the OB-stars
is in good agreement with a highly mass-segregated star
cluster. Two-body relaxation drives star clusters toward
"energy equipartition (miv
2
i = const., e.g., Spitzer 1969;"
"Parker et al. 2016), which impacts high-mass stars faster"
"and stronger. We also must note that, given the young"
age and the EFF profile being the best-fitted mass dis-
tribution it is almost impossible that Wd2 has reached
energy equipartition. The low-mass PMS stars do not
"only show an overall higher velocity dispersion, they also"
belong to five distinct velocity groups (see Fig. 5). While
PMS groups 2 – 5 have very similar velocity dispersions
"(∼ 2 km s−1, see Tab. 2), the velocity dispersion of PMS
group 1 is with 5.18 km s−1 much higher. The analy-"
sis of the spatial location of the stars in each velocity
"reveals a correlation. Always two groups (PMS3,PMS5"
"and PMS2,PMS4) coincide with the MC and NC. The"
stars of PMS group 1 are distributed throughout the
cluster region in a halo-like structure with a higher con-
centration toward the center of Wd2. Observations and
theoretical studies show that star and star cluster for-
mation is a hierarchical process and that YSCs form
"through merging of smaller sub cluster (e.g., McMillan"
et al. 2007; Sabbi et al. 2007; Fujii et al. 2012; Baner-
jee & Kroupa 2015; Fujii & Zwart 2016). Given the
age of Wd2 (1–2 Myr) we conclude that the individual
velocity groups are a remnant of the formation process
of the MC and NC. While the feedback from the OB
stars has destroyed this imprint in the H II region the
stars are much less affected by feedback processes. The
fact that always two groups are co-located with each
clump may either suggest that these clumps have been
more sub structured or it is a residual from the possi-
ble cloud-cloud collision that initiated the formation of
Wd2. The latter is supported by the fact the mean ve-
"locity differences of PMS2,PMS4 and PMS3,PMS5 are"
"(11.50± 0.41) km s−1 and (12.90± 0.24) km s−1, respec-
tively, which is in agreement with the velocity difference"
"of the two CO clouds (4 km s−1 and 16 km s−1, Furukawa"
et al. 2009). Although the two clumps of Wd2 are coeval
"(Zeidler et al. 2015), its structure has similarities with"
the observations of a highly sub-structured ONC with
several kinematically different stellar groups at different
ages (Zari et al. 2019).
Star cluster populations throughout the Universe
show a drop in number for YSCs (typically around
< 10 Myr) compared to the older cluster population
(> 100 Myr). This is often referred to as “infant mor-
"tality” (e.g., Lada & Lada 2003; Goodwin & Bastian"
2006; Portegies Zwart et al. 2010) and means that there
"is a process that destroys the majority of YSCs (∼ 90%)
within the first few 10 Myr of their life. This typically"
happens because these YSCs are not massive enough
"to overcome internal (e.g., supernova explosions, rapid"
"gas expulsion) and external (e.g., collisions and close"
"encounters with GMC in the Galactic disk, changes"
in the external tidal field) evolution effects. In this
work we solely focus on the internal processes and a
detailed discussion on external factors can be found in
"e.g., Krumholz et al. (2019). The absolute minimal mass"
necessary to keep a self-gravitating system bound is:
Mdyn = Mphot. The non-spherical substructured na-
ture of Wd2 makes this comparison challenging and we
introduced four different cases. In case 1. we consider
the two clumps as individual clusters and the result-
"ing dynamical masses, Mdyn,MC = (1.9 ± 0.5) · 103 M�
and Mdyn,NC = (3.3 ± 1.4) · 103 M� are smaller than
the individual photometric masses (Mphot,MC = (2.8 ±
0.6) · 104 M� and Mphot,NC = (4.2 ± 1.3) · 103 M�, Zei-
dler et al. 2017). This is an unrealistic scenario and the"
close proximity of the two clumps suggests that they will
merge in the near future supporting hierarchical forma-
"tion of YSCs (e.g., Fujii et al. 2012). Therefore, we must"
analyze the cluster system as a whole. In case 2. we
assume the MC and NC are located at the same posi-
"tion with rhm,Wd2 = (rhm,MC + rhm,NC)/2 and in case 3."
the half mass radius incorporates both the MC and the
"NC (rhm,Wd2 = rhm,MC + rhm,NC + d(MC,NC)). Both"
"cases lead to a dynamical mass (Mdyn,Wd2 = (7.5±1.9) ·
104 M� and Mdyn,Wd2 = (4.4±1.1)·105 M�) that highly
exceeds the Wd2 photometric mass. Even without any"
external perturbations this suggests that Wd2 will dis-
perse in the future. This is supported by an unreason-
"ably small half-mass radius (rhm = (0.13 ± 0.04) pc, in
comparison the mass surface density, see Fig. 1) that is"
"necessary for case 4, Mdyn = Mphot."
Next we discuss the dynamical time scale. The ratio of
the cluster’s age with its dynamical time (Π = age/tdyn)
"should be large if a system is bound, while for unbound"
systems it is expected to be small. A cut can be defined
"at Π ∼ 1–3 but has to be used with caution when the
ratio is close to this, somewhat arbitrary cut (Pfalzner"
2009; Adamo et al. 2020). For an age range of 1–2 Myr
"for Wd2 (e.g., Zeidler et al. 2015; Sabbi et al. 2020) this"
"ratio is Π = 29–58, Π = 0.22–0.43, and Π = 9–18 for"
"cases 2., 3., and 4., respectively. Π = 9–18 (case 4.)"
agrees with the value of Π = 8.48 shown in Tab. 2 of
"Portegies Zwart et al. (2010), yet this value is based"
The complex internal dynamics of Wd2 15
on a distance of 2.8 kpc for Wd2 (Pfalzner 2009). The
somewhat high variation of this ratio does not allow a
"conclusive determination of whether Wd2 is bound. Yet,"
the analyses of the dynamical mass and its location in
the Galactic disk lead to the conclusion that Wd2 will
eventually dissolve. In addition to external perturba-
"tions, the many OB-stars in the cluster center will go"
"supernovae, ejecting the remaining gas within the clus-"
ter. This will shock the cluster’s gravitational potential
"leading to an almost instantaneous expansion (see e.g.,"
"Goodwin & Bastian 2006), which will accelerate this"
dispersion.
"While not all (massive) stars from in clusters (e.g.,"
"De Wit et al. 2005; Ward & Kruijssen 2018), high-"
velocity runaway stars are the main source for massive
"O and B field stars (e.g., Blaauw 1961; Portegies Zwart"
et al. 2010; Fujii & Zwart 2011; Oh & Kroupa 2016).
"In the larger vicinity (1.5×1.5 deg2) around Wd2, Drew
et al. (2018) detected 8–11 early O and Wolf-Rayet stars"
that are Wd2 runaway candidates. In this work the
combination of Gaia DR2 proper motions and the high
accuracy of the MUSE RVs allowed us to detect high-
velocity runaway stars inside the cluster region. The
majority of runaway candidates show peculiar velocities
in the range of 30–100 km s−1 but three stars exceed this
"range: ID-13587 with 123.2± 4.2 km s−1, ID-16306 with
245.8±2.3 km s−1, and ID-14542 with 546.1±5.3 km s−1.
We do not detect any preferred ejection direction (see"
"Fig. 8), which is in agreement that these high stellar ve-"
locities are obtained through two-body interactions in
the dense cluster center. Although the favored scenario
for these “kicks” are supernovae explosions of the binary
"component (e.g., Hoogerwerf et al. 2001), we concur with"
Drew et al. (2018) that this scenario is very unlikely be-
cause Wd2 is too young. Especially the massive run-
away stars are important to understand the initial mass
"function (IMF). While studies show that some YSCs,"
"including Wd2 (Zeidler et al. 2017), show a top-heavy"
"present day MF, YSCs that show a canonical IMF may"
have had a top-heavy IMF before the early ejections of
some of their most massive members.
8. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
"The young age, the close proximity, and its spatial"
sub-structure make Wd2 an interesting target to study
how YSCs form and evolve during their first few mil-
"lion years. In this third paper of this series, we used"
"the unique capabilities of HST photometry, Gaia pms,"
and VLT/MUSE RVs to analyze the internal kinematic
structure of Wd2 with the following results:
"• The current, already super-virial state of Wd2, the
fact that the first supernovae are yet to happen,"
"and its location in the MW disk, which make Wd2"
"prone to interact or even collide with other GMCs,"
led to the conclusion that the cluster is not massive
enough to remain gravitationally bound.
"• The cluster velocity dispersion increases with de-
creasing stellar mass, as expected from a highly"
mass-segregated cluster.
"• The low-mass PMS stars have five distinct and
statistically significant velocity groups."
"• Always two velocity groups are part of each of the
two clumps (MC and NC), while the fifth group"
"is a halo-like structure, in agreement with the for-"
mation of star clusters through mergers.
"• We detected 22 runaway candidates that may be
kicked out of the cluster due to two-body inter-"
actions caused by the high stellar density in the
cluster center.
"• The H II region that surrounds Wd2 is expanding,
driven by the radiation pressure and FUV flux of"
the many cluster center OB stars. Any imprint of
the original cloud collapse has been destroyed.
Although this analyses already provides a multi-
"dimensional picture, future data releases of the Gaia"
mission and multi epoch HST observations to accurately
measure stellar proper motions will allow truly 3D kine-
matic studies.
