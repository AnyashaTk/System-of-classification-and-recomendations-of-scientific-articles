"ABSTRACT
The bright emission from high-redshift quasars completely conceals their host galaxies in the rest-frame ultraviolet/optical, with
detection of the hosts in these wavelengths eluding even the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) using detailed point spread function
(PSF) modelling techniques. In this study we produce mock images of a sample of ùëß = 7 quasars extracted from the BlueTides
simulation, and apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based PSF modelling to determine the detectability of their host galaxies with
the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). While no statistically significant detections are made with HST, we predict that at the
same wavelengths and exposure times JWST NIRCam imaging will detect ‚àº 50% of quasar host galaxies. We investigate various
observational strategies, and find that NIRCam wide-band imaging in the long-wavelength filters results in the highest fraction
of successful quasar host detections, detecting & 80% of the hosts of bright quasars in exposure times of 5 ks. Exposure times of
& 5 ks are required to detect the majority of host galaxies in the NIRCam wide-band filters, however even 10 ks exposures with
MIRI result in . 30% successful host detections. We find no significant trends between galaxy properties and their detectability.
The PSF modelling can accurately recover the host magnitudes, radii, and spatial distribution of the larger-scale emission, when
accounting for the central core being contaminated by residual quasar flux. Care should be made when interpreting the host
properties measured using PSF modelling."

1 INTRODUCTION
"In the local Universe, there exist tight correlations between the mass
of a supermassive black hole and the properties of its host galaxy,
such as its bulge mass, luminosity, total stellar mass, and stellar
velocity dispersion (e.g. Magorrian et al. 1998; Ferrarese & Merritt
2000; Gebhardt et al. 2000;Merritt & Ferrarese 2001; Tremaine et al.
2002; Marconi & Hunt 2003; H√§ring & Rix 2004; Bentz et al. 2009;
Kormendy & Ho 2013; Reines & Volonteri 2015; see the review by
Heckman & Best 2014). These relations may be caused by the black
hole interacting with the host galaxy, with feedback from the active
galactic nucleus (AGN) heating the surrounding gas, regulating star
formation and also the future growth of the black hole (e.g. Silk &
Rees 1998; Di Matteo et al. 2005b; Bower et al. 2006; Ciotti et al.
2010). They may be also a result of the efficiency at which the galaxy
can fuel the black hole with gas (e.g. Hopkins & Quataert 2010;
Cen 2015; Angl√©s-Alc√°zar et al. 2017). This relation may instead
be coincidental, with both black hole and galaxy growth triggered
by the same processes, such as galaxy mergers (e.g. Haehnelt &"
‚òÖ E-mail: Madeline.Marshall@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca
"Kauffmann 2000; Croton 2006; Gaskell 2011). Alternatively, some
studies suggest that the black hole and galaxy growth is uncorrelated,
with the relations a result of a central-limit-like theory caused by
galaxy mergers across cosmic history (e.g. Peng 2007; Jahnke &
Macci√≤ 2011)."
"To determine why these black hole‚Äìhost relations exist, a key strat-
egy is to study how they evolve throughout cosmic time (e.g. Peng
et al. 2006; Croton 2006; Willott et al. 2017). However, measuring
these relations at high redshift is significantly challenging observa-
tionally. Black holemassmeasurements become less certain at higher
redshifts (see e.g. Shen 2013; Peterson 2013). In addition only black
holes that are highly accreting, shining as luminous quasars, are de-
tectable, whereas local studies generally measure these relations for
inactive galaxies (see e.g. Kormendy & Ho 2013)."
"The main difficulty, however, lies in measuring the properties of
the host galaxies of these high-redshift (ùëß & 6) quasars. There are two
main wavelength regimes used for detecting these galaxies. The most
successful method is to use sub-mm instruments such as the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to study the rest-
frame far-infrared (FIR) emission from the host galaxies, produced
by gas and dust (e.g. Bertoldi et al. 2003; Walter et al. 2003, 2004;"
¬© 2019 The Authors
2 M. A. Marshall et al.
"Riechers et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2010, 2011; Venemans et al. 2019).
The emission from the quasar is minimal at these wavelengths, and
so this provides an unobstructed view of the host galaxy itself. These
observations can measure detailed properties of the distributions
of gas and dust within these galaxies on even sub-kpc scales (e.g.
Venemans et al. 2019). However, the local black hole‚Äìhost scaling
relations are generally linked to the stellar properties of the galaxy
(e.g. Magorrian et al. 1998; Merritt & Ferrarese 2001), and so these
observations are not ideal for examining how these relations evolve
with redshift. Regardless, these observations can make estimates for
the mass of the galaxy, for example, using the measured dynamical,
dust and gas masses (see e.g. Wang et al. 2013; Valiante et al. 2014).
This provides the best measurements of the high-redshift black hole‚Äì
hostmass relation possiblewith current instruments (e.g.Willott et al.
2017; Pensabene et al. 2020).
The second regime for observing quasar host galaxies is to study"
"the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) emission (e.g. Bahcall et al. 1994;
Disney et al. 1995; Kukula et al. 2001; Hutchings 2003), which is
emitted by the host‚Äôs stellar population. At ùëß & 6, this emission is
redshifted into the near-infrared. Unfortunately, however, quasars are
extremely bright at these wavelengths, generally outshining their host
galaxies (e.g., Schmidt 1963; McLeod & Rieke 1994; Dunlop et al.
2003; Hutchings 2003; Floyd et al. 2013). In addition, galaxies are
smaller at larger redshifts, with galaxy size ùëÖùëí ‚àù (1 + ùëß)‚àíùëö where
ùëö ‚àº 1‚Äì1.5 (e.gOesch et al. 2010;Ono et al. 2013; Shibuya et al. 2015;
Kawamata et al. 2018) decreasing more rapidly with redshift than the
increase in apparent diameters at ùëß & 2 due to the cosmic angular
size‚Äìdistance relation. Large (1 + ùëß)4 surface brightness dimming
makes the host galaxies more difficult to detect at high redshift. Thus
at high redshift, the host galaxies become difficult to resolve with
current telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and
so the light from the quasar completely obscures any underlying host
galaxy emission (e.g. Mechtley et al. 2012).
A promising technique for observing the host emission in the"
"rest-frame UV is to perform point-source modelling on photometric
images. This involves carefully modelling the quasar emission using
the point spread function (PSF) of the telescope, to detect the un-
derlying host emission from the residual flux. One particular method
for this is psfMC (Mechtley 2014; Mechtley et al. 2016), a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based software which has been used to
successfully detect the host emission from quasars at ùëß ' 2 (Mecht-
ley et al. 2016; Marian et al. 2019). When applied to HST images of
higher redshift quasars, this method can provide useful upper limits
on the underlying host galaxy flux and stellar mass (Mechtley et al.
2012; Marshall et al. 2020b), however, it has not been able to de-
tect the host galaxies of ùëß & 6 quasars. This method is limited by the
spatial resolution of HST, which barely resolves galaxies at these red-
shifts. In addition, with the thermal instability of HST as it orbits the
Earth, the PSF is difficult to characterise even with the most careful
of studies, and thus the subtraction is difficult to perform (Mechtley
et al. 2012; Mechtley 2014). These issues will both be significantly
reduced with the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST;
Gardner et al. 2006), with the NIRCam pixel resolution four times
smaller than HST WFC3 in the near-infrared, as well as being more
thermally stable at the Sun‚ÄìEarth second Lagrange point.
JWST will also provide the opportunity to observe these systems"
"at longer wavelengths than possible with HST, observing in the in-
frared from 0.6 to 28 `m, covering the rest-frame UV and optical
emission of these objects. These longer wavelengths will help to
increase the detectability of dusty quasar host galaxies, which have
their flux significantly attenuated in the rest-frame UV (e.g. Marshall
et al. 2020a,b). JWST will also allow for the detection of common"
"galaxy and AGN emission lines in the rest-frame optical, such asHùõº,
HùõΩ, [OII]_3272, [OIII]__4960,5008, [NII]_6585 and [SII]__6717,6731,
which after careful modelling of the quasar contribution could be
used for accurate characterisation of the properties of the galaxy
(e.g. Greene & Ho 2006; Harris et al. 2012). Overall, JWST will
lead to significant advancements in the detectability, and thus our
understanding, of quasar host galaxies in the early Universe.
In this paper, we make detailed predictions for JWST photometric"
"observations of high-redshift quasar host galaxies. We use the Blue-
Tides simulation (Feng et al. 2015), a cosmological hydrodynamical
simulation with significant resolution and volume to contain the rare
high-redshift quasars seen in observations. We make mock images
of these BlueTides quasars in both HST and JWST, and apply the
psfMC modelling technique in an attempt to detect the underlying
host emission. We describe the simulation and these methods in Sec-
tion 2. In Section 3, we investigate the detectability of host galaxies
using this technique, showing the improvements of JWST over HST
in Section 3.1 and then comparing various JWST observing strate-
gies in Section 3.2. In Section 4, we investigate the properties of
quasars and host galaxies that are most likely to result in successful
detections. We then consider the biases in recovering the properties
of the host galaxies using this technique in Section 5. A discussion
is presented in Section 6, and we conclude in Section 7.
The cosmological parameters used throughout are from the nine-"
"year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP; Hinshaw
et al. 2013):Œ©ùëÄ = 0.2814,Œ©Œõ = 0.7186,Œ©ùëè = 0.0464,ùúé8 = 0.820,
[ùë† = 0.971 and ‚Ñé = 0.697."
2 METHODS
2.1 The BlueTides simulation
"BlueTides1 (Feng et al. 2015) is a large-volume cosmological hy-
drodynamical simulation, which used the smoothed particle hydro-
dynamics (SPH) code MP-Gadget to model the evolution of dark
matter and baryons from ùëß = 99 to ùëß = 7. In a box with vol-
ume of (400/‚Ñé cMpc)3, BlueTides contains 2 √ó 70403 particles,
with a mass resolution of 1.2 √ó 107/‚Ñé ùëÄÔøΩ for dark matter particles,
2.4 √ó 106/‚Ñé ùëÄÔøΩ for gas particles, and 6 √ó 105/‚Ñé ùëÄÔøΩ for star par-
ticles. The effective spatial resolution is the gravitational softening
length of ùúñgrav = 1.5/‚Ñé ckpc, corresponding to 0.269 pkpc or 0.05
arcsec at ùëß = 7 in this cosmology. The resolution of BlueTides is
well-matched to JWST, which has a resolution of 0.07 arcsec at 2`m.
BlueTides implements a variety of sub-gridmodels for the physics"
"governing galaxy and black hole formation and their feedback pro-
cesses. A basic overview is provided below, with the reader referred
to the original paper (Feng et al. 2015) for full details.
In BlueTides, gas cools on to galaxies via primordial radiative"
"cooling (Katz et al. 1999) and metal line cooling, with the gas and
stellar metallicities traced following Vogelsberger et al. (2014). This
gas can then form stars, based on the multi-phase star formation
model originally from Springel & Hernquist (2003) with modifica-
tions following Vogelsberger et al. (2013), and accounting for the
effects of molecular hydrogen (Krumholz & Gnedin 2011). These
stars can produce supernova feedback, via a type-II supernova wind
feedback model (Okamoto et al. 2010).

limit. The black holes are assumed to radiate with bolometric lumi-
nosity ùêøAGN = [ ¬§ùëÄBHùëê2, with a radiative efficiency [ of 0.1. The
model for black hole growth and feedback is the same as in theMas-
siveBlack I & II simulations, originally developed in Springel et al.
(2005) and Di Matteo et al. (2005a), with modifications consistent
with Illustris; see DeGraf et al. (2012) and DeGraf et al. (2015) for
full details.
Throughout this work, we consider the ùëß = 7.0 snapshot, the"
"lowest published redshift of the simulation to date (Ni et al.
2020; Marshall et al. 2020a). From this snapshot we consider the
108,000 most massive halos, with masses ùëÄvir > 1010.8ùëÄÔøΩ , which
contain galaxies with ùëÄ‚àó = 105.9‚Äì1011.2ùëÄÔøΩ and black holes with
ùëÄBH = 105.8‚Äì108.9ùëÄÔøΩ ."
"The spectral energy distribution (SED) of each galaxy from Blue-
Tides is calculated by assigning a simple stellar population (SSP)
to each of its star particles, based on their mass, age and metallic-
ity, using the Binary Population and Spectral Population Synthesis
model (BPASS, version 2.2.1; Stanway & Eldridge 2018), assuming
a modified Salpeter initial mass function with a high-mass cut-off of

is the sum of the SEDs of each of its star particles.

galaxies, we take the line-of-sight along the ùëß-direction, whereas for
each quasar, where the variation in dust attenuation between different
sight-lines is significant, we take the direction of minimum dust-
attenuation, which is typically the face-on direction, as an optimistic
assumption. See Ni et al. (2020) and Marshall et al. (2020a) for full
details."
2.2 Quasar sample
"We follow the Marshall et al. (2020a) method for characterising
quasars in the BlueTides simulation, by making the simple assump-
tion that ‚Äòquasars‚Äô are AGN which outshine their host galaxy in the
UV-band, i.e. ùëÄUV,AGN < ùëÄUV,Host. Here ùëÄUV,AGN and ùëÄUV,Host
are the observed (dust-attenuated) UV absolute magnitudes for the
AGN and host galaxy, respectively.
The pioneering sample of high-redshift quasars was discovered"
"using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (e.g. Fan et al. 2000, 2001, 2003,
2004). These are bright quasars, with the faintest SDSS quasar SDSS
J0129‚Äì0035 having ùëö1450 = 22.8 mag, or ùëÄ1450 = ‚àí23.89 mag at
ùëß = 5.78 (Wang et al. 2013; Ba√±ados et al. 2016). More recent studies
have discovered fainter quasars, with the faintest known high-redshift
quasar to date discovered in the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-
Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) project (Matsuoka et al. 2018),
HSC J1423‚Äì0018 with ùëö1450 = 24.85mag, or ùëÄ1450 = ‚àí21.93mag
at ùëß = 6.13.
Using the limiting magnitudes from SDSS and SHELLQs, we"
define two quasar samples as:
"‚Ä¢ Bright quasars: ùëÄUV,AGN < ùëÄUV,Host and ùëöUV,AGN < 22.8
mag"
"‚Ä¢ Faint quasars: ùëÄUV,AGN < ùëÄUV,Host and 22.8 < ùëöUV,AGN <
24.85 mag"
"This selection method can be visualised in Figure 1, which shows
the ùëöUV,AGN‚ÄìùëöUV,Host distribution for all BlueTides galaxies and
quasars. The ‚Äòbright‚Äô and ‚Äòfaint‚Äô quasar samples are equivalent to
the Marshall et al. (2020a) ‚ÄòSDSS‚Äô and ‚Äòcurrently observable‚Äô quasar
samples, respectively.
The BlueTides simulation contains 22 bright quasars and 175"
"faint quasars, with the brightest quasar in the simulation having
ùëöUV,AGN = 20.7 mag. Their stellar and black hole masses are
shown in Figure 1. The bright quasars have black hole masses of
log(ùëÄBH) = 8.3+0.2‚àí0.3ùëÄÔøΩ"
"2, and are hosted by galaxies with stel-
lar masses of log(ùëÄ‚àó) = 10.7+0.2‚àí0.3ùëÄÔøΩ . The faint quasars have
lower median black hole mass and stellar mass than the bright
quasars, with a larger range of values, log(ùëÄBH) = 7.9+1.0‚àí0.9ùëÄÔøΩ and
log(ùëÄ‚àó) = 10.4+0.6‚àí0.7ùëÄÔøΩ . The reader is referred to Marshall et al.
(2020a) for a detailed analysis of the simulated properties of these
quasars and their host galaxies.
Throughout this work we consider the bright quasars, correspond-"
"ing to the highly-studied SDSS quasar sample. However, when study-
ing the effect of quasar luminosity on whether a host galaxy is ob-
servable, we also consider the faint quasar sample in order to increase
the range of luminosities studied (see Section 4)."
2.3 The psfMC quasar modelling technique
"psfMC (Mechtley 2014; Mechtley et al. 2016) is an MCMC-based
software which performs 2D surface brightness modelling on astro-
nomical images. It was designed specifically to model the emission
from bright quasars and their underlying host galaxies (Mechtley
2014), and has been used on HST images of quasars at ùëß ' 2 (Mecht-
ley et al. 2016; Marian et al. 2019) and ùëß ' 6 (Mechtley et al. 2012;
Marshall et al. 2020b)."

"This softwaremodels the input image using a combination of spec-
ified source profiles, in this work a point source for the quasar and
a S√©rsic profile for its host galaxy. The user specifies prior proba-
bility distributions of the properties of these profiles: point source
magnitude and position, and S√©rsic magnitude, position, S√©rsic in-
dex ùëõ, effective radius of the major axis ùëÖùëí, ratio between the major
and minor axes ùëè/ùëé, and position angle. psfMC then explores this
range of model parameters, convolving each model with an input
PSF, which is then compared to the input image to determine the
posterior probability of the model parameters given the input data.
To do this, psfMC requires an input science image and corre-"
"sponding variance map of the object to be modelled. In addition, the"
"software requires an image and variance map describing the PSF of
the telescope. In the section below we describe our method for mak-
ing mock images to be supplied to psfMC, to simulate this process
for the BlueTides galaxies."
2.4 Mock images
2.4.1 Science images
"We make mock images of each of the quasars using the SynthObs3
software, which produces synthetic observations from SPH simula-
tions.
SynthObs uses the positions and SEDs of each particle in the"
"galaxy to produce these observations. We assume that the galaxy is
viewed from the face-on direction.We also assume that the AGN flux
is emitted from a single ‚Äòparticle‚Äô at the location of the black hole,
and so appears as a point source convolved with the PSF in the mock
images. SynthObs uses these star- and AGN-particle positions and
spectra to determine the total flux in a specified photometric filter
in each pixel, which is then convolved with a model instrument
PSF. For HST we use PSFs from the Tiny Tim model (Krist et al.
2011), and for JWST we use PSFs from the WebbPSF model (Perrin
et al. 2015). Examples of observed 2-orbit HST WFC3 PSFs are
given inWindhorst et al. (2011). SynthObs then applies appropriate
smoothing to produce a mock image with the pixel scale of the
instrument.
We make mock images for both HST and JWST, to compare the"
"results from the two telescopes. These mock images include shot
noise, and a random noise background. The noise ùúé for the mock
JWST images is estimated from the predicted 10ùúé sensitivity of
JWST, using a circular photometric aperture 2.5 pixels in radius
(STSci 2017a,b). For JWST we consider a range of exposure times
in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.1, but otherwise assume an exposure time of
10 ks. The noise in the mock HST images is equivalent to that in the
Marshall et al. (2020b) images, taken over 2 orbits or an exposure
time of 4.8 ks.
Pixel sub-sampling or ‚Äòdithering‚Äô is commonly used inHSTWFC3"
"observations, as the the camera pixels under-sample the PSF of the
instrument (see e.g. Koekemoer et al. 2002). From Nyquist signal
theory, to fully recover the PSF the data must be sampled such that
there are at least 2 pixels per full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of
the PSF, which is ' 0.2516 _(`m)/ùê∑ (m) arcsec where ùê∑ is the
diameter of the telescope. In the F160W filter HST WFC3 has a
FWHM of ' 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤168 and a native pixel scale of ' 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤13, resulting in
under-sampling. This will also be true for JWST NIRCam, with the
short-wavelength F115W filter having a FWHM of ' 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤044 and a
native pixel scale of ' 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤031, and the long-wavelength F277W filter
having a FWHM of ' 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤106 and a native pixel scale of ' 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤062,
for example. JWST MIRI will better sample the PSF, with a FWHM
of ' 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤214 and a native pixel scale of ' 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤11 in the F560W filter,
for example. Our WFC3, NIRCam and MIRI mock images assume a
sub-sampling in each spatial dimension of a factor of 2, equivalent to
a 4-point sub-pixel dither pattern. This corresponds to a sampling of
‚àº 2.6 pixels/FWHM in HST F160W, ‚àº 2.84‚Äì4.9 pixels/FWHM in
theNIRCam short-wavelength filters,‚àº 3.4‚Äì5.4 pixels/FWHM in the
NIRCam long-wavelength filters, and ‚àº 3.9 and 5.4 pixels/FWHM
in the MIRI F560W and F770W filters respectively. This ensures our
mock observations adequately sample the PSF, so the PSF errors will
not be dominated by sampling errors."

2.4.2 Inverse variance maps
"Alongside the science exposures, we also construct mock inverse
variance maps for psfMC. The inverse variance maps are used to
calculate the probability of the posterior distribution for a given set
of parameters in the MCMC process.
For the variance maps, we include a flat background, correspond-"
"ing to ùúé2 from the sky noise. We also include a 2D Gaussian located
at the centre of the quasar to represent the additional uncertainty in
the inner region, with the peak 5000 times smaller than the peak
quasar flux, and width ùúé = 2. These properties were determined
empirically from the Marshall et al. (2020b) HST images and in-
verse variance maps, which are calculated using AstroDrizzle on the
output telescope ERR arrays. This simple approximation produces
semi-realistic variance maps, and the resulting success of psfMC is
not particularly sensitive to these Gaussian parameters. Thus, this
simple empirical determination of the map is adequate for the pur-
poses of this study.
We then invert the variance matrix to produce an inverse variance"
"map, which is saved as a FITS file."
2.4.3 PSF images
"As well as the quasar image, psfMC requires an image of the PSF
of the telescope in order to perform the modelling. This PSF image
can be from a model such as Tiny Tim, as in Mechtley et al. (2012).
However, with the level of PSF variation experienced by HST (di
Nino et al. 2008), Mechtley et al. (2012) found more accurate results
by taking an image of a nearby star with similar properties to the
quasar, to accurately measure the PSF. In this work we model both
scenarios.
We consider a point source with a flux of 6 √ó 105 nJy in each"
"filter, corresponding to 17 mag in the F200W filter. This is of similar
brightness to the PSF stars observed in Marshall et al. (2020b). Note
that we tested the modelling using various PSF brightnesses and
obtained similar results, unless the PSF brightness was of order the
quasar brightness, which resulted in a poorer subtraction.
We first take the PSF of such an object directly from the Tiny-"
"Tim (for HST) or WebbPSF (for JWST) model: the ‚Äòsmooth PSF‚Äô.
Additionally, we model a star observation, by adding shot noise and
background noise (at the same level as the quasar image) to the out-
put image: the ‚Äòstar PSF‚Äô. We use the same inverse variance map
for both, for simplicity, calculated as for the science image using the
mock star observation. We create a PSF image and variance map for
each instrument, filter and exposure time combination considered in
this work."
2.5 Performing and testing the quasar modelling
"We run psfMC using thesemock quasar and PSF images and variance
maps. For this study, we assume uniform priors on all properties, over
awide range of parameter space to ensurewe obtain themost accurate
solution. We also fix the quasar position to its known location in the
centre of the image to reduce computational expense.
In order to test the quasar modelling technique, we create mock"
"images of each of the bright quasars with no underlying host galaxy,
and run psfMC on these images. We show the mock host-free quasar
image and the residual image after quasar subtraction for one bright"

for both HST and JWST mock images. We are therefore confident
that this method is working successfully.
We first perform the quasar modelling using both PSF"
"techniques‚Äîthe smooth PSF and star PSF‚Äîin the NIRCam F200W
filter. We find that both PSF models perform equivalently well for all
bright quasars, with an example showing the two fits relative to the
true host mock image for one quasar given in Figure 3. As in prac-
tice, a star image obtained from the telescope may be more likely to
match the observed quasar PSF than the model, for the remainder of
this work we use the mock star image in all subtractions. We note,
however, that using a model PSF will produce similar results if the
PSF model is sufficiently accurate relative to the true telescope PSF."
3 DETECTABILITY OF QUASAR HOSTS
"In this section we explore the success of this method in detecting the
host galaxies of the ùëß = 7 BlueTides bright quasar sample."
3.1 Comparison of HST and JWST
"We first compare the success of this method on mock images from
HST and JWST. We consider an exposure time of 4800s, equiva-
lent to 2 orbits of HST, as used in the observational study of Mar-
shall et al. (2020b). We consider the HST WFC3 F160W filter, the
longest-wavelengthWFC3wide-band filter, as used inMarshall et al.
(2020b). For comparison, we choose the JWST NIRCam F150W fil-
ter, covering similar wavelengths.
We create mock images for each of the bright quasars with these"
"two setups, and process them with psfMC. For two quasars we show
the original quasar and host image, the residual image after PSF
subtraction, the best S√©rsic model from psfMC, the full residual
image after subtraction of the best quasar and host models, and a
true mock image of the host galaxy in Figure 4. Also shown is the
difference between the PSF-subtracted image and the true host image,
which illustrates the success of the fit.

compare models with and without the host galaxy. The criterion is
given by"
"BIC = ùëò ln(ùëõ) ‚àí 2 ln( ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ), (3)"
"where ùëò is the number of model parameters, ùëõ is the number of data
points and ÔøΩÃÇÔøΩ is the maximum value of the likelihood function. Using
the psfMC output, we calculate the BIC for the model with both a
point source quasar and a S√©rsic host galaxy, BIChost, which has 8
model parameters, and for the model with only a point source quasar,
BICno host, which has only 1 parameter, the magnitude of the quasar.
To compare models, we then calculate ŒîBIC = BICno host ‚àíBIChost.
If ŒîBIC > 10, there is very strong evidence that the host model is
preferred, and thus we claim a detection. Otherwise, if ŒîBIC < 10,
there is no significant detection of the host galaxy.
From the mock HST images, there is no significant detection of"
"the host galaxy for any of the 22 bright quasars in the simulation.
This is in agreement with current observational studies, which have
not been able to detect the hosts in real HST WFC3 images using
this technique (Mechtley et al. 2012; Marshall et al. 2020b). At the
same wavelengths and exposure times, the mock JWST images show
successful host detections in 10 of the 22 bright quasars. This success
rate is shown in Figure 5. Thus, while observing the host galaxies
in HST is very challenging, the increased resolution of JWST will
lead to significant improvements for the detectability of high-redshift
quasar host galaxies."
3.2 Comparison of JWST observational strategies
"We now consider the success rates of various observational strategies
with JWST, by exploring the effect of exposure time and wavelength."
3.2.1 Exposure time
"To study the effect of exposure times, we run psfMC on mock NIR-
Cam F200W images with an exposure time of 1 ks, 2.5 ks, 5 ks, and
10 ks, for each of the bright quasars. Example residual images for
one quasar are shown in Figure 6. We choose the F200W filter as an
example, as it has the highest sensitivity of the wide-band filters for
a given exposure time.
We find that with an exposure time of 1 ks, only 1 of the 22"
"quasar hosts is successfully detected in the F200W filter. For 2.5, 5,
and 10 ks exposures, 9, 15, and 19 of the 22 hosts are successfully
detected, respectively. These success rates are shown in Figure 5.
Thus, exposures of at least 5 ks are recommended for detecting a
large fraction of quasar host galaxies.
For the remainder of this work, we consider exposure times of"
"10 ks unless otherwise specified. The residual images and true host
mock images of each of the 22 bright quasar host galaxies, in the
F200W filter with exposure times of 10 ks, are shown in Appendix
A."

wide-band filters red-ward of the ùëß = 7 Lyman-break: F115W,

bright quasar hosts, respectively, in 10 ks exposures. These success
rates are shown in Figure 5. Longer-wavelength filters have larger
success rates for detecting the quasar host galaxies, with the F115W
filter performing the worst.
In Figure 5 we also show the median ratio of AGN to host lumi-"
"nosity for the bright quasars, in each filter. This ratio is largest in the
F115W filter, due to the large Lyman-alpha emission from the AGN
falling in this wavelength range. This may explain the low success
rate for F115W images, as the hosts are more significantly outshined
by the AGN and thus harder to detect. The AGN‚Äìhost luminosity ra-
tio increases from F150W to F277W, reflecting the increasing AGN
luminosity with wavelength and roughly constant galaxy luminosity.
This ratio then drops in the F356W filter, due to the Balmer-break
causing a significant increase in the galaxy flux in this filter, before
again rising at larger wavelengths due to the AGN and host contin-
nuum slopes. The AGN‚Äìhost luminosity ratio is low for the F356W
and F444W filters, which have the highest success rates, however
similar ratios are seen for the F150W and F200W filters which have
lower success rates, suggesting that this ratio does not entirely deter-
mine the success of the method.

"MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì19 (2019)"
Observing high-redshift quasar hosts with JWST 9
"that as for the F200W filter, while 10 ks exposures result in more
successful detections, 5 ks exposures are reasonable and result in
success rates of > 60% for all filters excluding F115W (see Figure
5).
For comparison, we also consider 10 ks exposures in the two"
"shortest wavelength MIRI imaging filters, F560W, centred at 5.6
`m, and F770W, centred at 7.7 `m. We find that in the F560W
filter, only 6 of the 22 bright quasar host galaxies are successfully
detected. The F770W filter results in only 1 successful detection.
Longer wavelength MIRI filters have lower sensitivity, and so are
likely to perform worse than these two filters. Thus, MIRI imaging
will result in significantly fewer detections of quasar hosts using
this method, with NIRCam imaging likely to provide the best
opportunity for detecting the hosts. The low success rates for host
detections with MIRI are likely due to the lower resolution of these
images, alongside the reduced sensitivity at these wavelengths due to
a significantly brighter thermal JWST foreground at _ > 4‚Äì4.5`m.
Combined with the expected relatively flat rest-frame host galaxy
spectra and the enormous (1 + ùëß)4 surface brightness dimming, this
will reduce the detected host contrast compared to the quasar point
source at _ > 4.5`m. Exceptions may be for very dusty, red quasars
and their hosts, with significantly attenuated UV flux resulting in the
quasar/host contrast being more favourable for detection with MIRI."
"In summary, we predict that longer exposure times will result in
more successful host detections, with & 5 ks exposures required to
detect the majority of hosts with NIRCam wide-band filters. The
long-wavelength NIRCam wide-band filters show higher expected
success rates than the short-wavelength filters. The F115W filter
shows the worst performance, likely due to the large AGN luminos-
ity in that wavelength range. Finally, MIRI imaging is predicted to
result in significantly lower fractions of successful detections than
NIRCam, due to its lower resolution and sensitivity."
3.3 Residual Quasar Flux
"The majority of the PSF-subtracted images contain some remnant
flux from the quasar, concentrated in the central core of the PSF (see
e.g. Figures 3 and 6, and Appendix A). For the bright quasars across
all NIRCam filters, the ratio of the extracted psfMC luminosity to
the input AGN luminosity ùêøAGN, psfMC/ùêøAGN, Input is 99.15+0.76‚àí1.78%,
where values quoted are the median and the differences to the 5%
and 95% percentiles. All of the 132 runs either underestimated or
matched the input luminosity, with ùêøAGN, psfMC ‚â§ ùêøAGN, Input.
Across the three short-wavelength filters, the poorest extracted flux"
"is 95.9% of the input flux, while the long-wavelength filters show an
improved performance with the worst underestimation 97.7%. As
seen in Figure 7, for example, the long-wavelength residual images
show smoother features than the short-wavelength images, due to the
decreased resolution in these filters. This smoothness may result in
the AGN being easier to extract.
These psfMC fits thus predominantly underestimate the quasar lu-"
"minosity, however not by a significant fraction. This may be caused
by a mismatch in the PSF shapes due to the shot noise, as seen in
the HST images of Marshall et al. (2020b). A more substantial un-
derestimation would result in residual flux in the PSF wings, which
is not seen. This AGN underestimation may, however, significantly
affect the measured flux of the host galaxy. Figure 4 shows the PSF-
subtracted model, alongside the full model-subtracted residual im-
age, for two bright quasars. This shows that for the JWST images the
central core of this flux is not being attributed to the host galaxy in the
S√©rsic fit. This suggests that this residual flux will not significantly"
"contaminate the measured S√©rsic magnitudes. However, we do see
that some of this flux, particularly in the outer core, may be being
falsely attributed to the host galaxies. This will likely result in the
host brightnesses being overestimated. We investigate this in detail
in Section 5.1.
We note that this imperfect subtraction is not a result of under-"
"sampling of the PSF, with an increased sub-sampling in each spatial
dimension of a factor of 3, equivalent to a 9-point sub-pixel dither
pattern, producing the same results.
We cannot at this stage fully anticipate the exact thermal behaviour"
"of JWST in L2, and its subtle sun-angle and pointing-direction depen-
dent thermal effects on the actual JWST PSF. Determining the PSF
for JWST will be a challenging task, particularly in the first cycles
of observations. From our experience with HST with highly reliable
PSFs, the psfMC code can leave PSF subtraction errors of order‚àº1%
amplitude in the central ùëü = 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤2 circular region of the image where
the quasar is centered (see Figure 4 and Marshall et al. 2020b). With
the improved resolution of JWST, this corruption should be limited to
a smaller region in the centre, if the PSF can be accurately calibrated.
Hence, it will always be safest to have a circular central exclusion
area within which one will not, or cannot, determine the host galaxy
flux. The host flux in this region may simply have to be interpolated
from the host galaxy surface brightness distribution outside this cor-
rupted area (see Figure 4). The true level of contamination will need
to be considered in detail when analysing the real JWST data.
For now, it therefore seems most realistic to approximate this pro-"
"cess by simply measuring the total fluxes outside this inner corrupted
area, and interpolate the missing flux into this central area from the
actual surface-brightness distribution outside this corrupted region.
This is in essence what we do in Section 5.1."
4 QUASAR AND HOST PROPERTIES
"We now investigate the kinds of quasars and host galaxies that are
most likely to result in successful detections using this technique.
First we investigate the bright quasars. We consider a host which is"
"successfully detected in at least 5 of the 6 NIRCam wide-band filters
in 10 ks exposures as ‚Äòdetectable‚Äô, while those that are successfully
detected in 4 or fewer of the 6 filters are ‚Äòundetectable‚Äô. This results in
a sample of 15 ‚Äòdetectable‚Äô hosts, and 7 ‚Äòundetectable‚Äô host galaxies,
from the 22 total bright quasars. The residual images and true host
mock images of these host galaxies in the F200W filter, showing
which are ‚Äòdetectable,‚Äô are presented in Appendix A.
We compare the physical properties of these host galaxies in Figure"
"8, which shows their star formation rates, bulge-to-total mass ratios

are detectable, or the ‚Äòsuccess rate‚Äô, in bins of each property. We see
that galaxies with the largest stellar masses, ùëÄ‚àó & 1010.7ùëÄÔøΩ , have
a success rate of 1, whereas lower mass galaxies have much lower
success rates. A similar trend is seen for star formation rates, which
are correlated with the stellar mass of the galaxy. Galaxies with the
largest star formation rates, SFR & 500ùëÄÔøΩyr‚àí1, have a high success
rate, with detectability worse for galaxies with lower star formation
rates. Galaxies with bulge-to-total mass ratiosùëÄbulge/ùëÄ‚àó . 0.9 have
success rates of 1, with ùëÄbulge/ùëÄ‚àó & 0.9 galaxies showing lower
success rates. However, given the low number of quasars studied,
these trends are not statistically significant.

half-mass radius or S√©rsic radius, although smaller galaxies seem
to show mildly lower success rates. When examining the host mock
images (Appendix A), we do see that the undetectable hosts are
those that appear the most compact. Thus, there may be a correlation
between detectability and the compactness of the host emission.

find no significant trends between host detectability and these black

We also consider the impact of luminosity of the bright quasars and"
"their host galaxies on their detectability. In Figure 10we show theUV
absolute magnitudes of the quasar and the host galaxy, both intrinsic
and including dust attenuation. We find that brighter host galaxies,
ùëÄUV,Host < ‚àí21.5 mag, have a success rate of 1, with fainter host
galaxies harder to detect. This is also seen, to a lesser extent, in the
intrinsic galaxy magnitudes. However, again we note that due to the
low number of quasars, these trends are not statistically significant.
We also show the difference between the UV absolute magnitudes
of the quasars and their host galaxies in Figure 10. We see lower
success rates when the AGN outshines the galaxy by the largest
fraction (ùëÄUV,Host ‚àí ùëÄUV,AGN > 4), however again these trends are
not statistically significant. We also see no significant dependence of
the detectability on the AGN magnitude.
We have focused purely on the bright quasar sample throughout"
"this work. However, given the limited magnitude range covered by
the bright quasars and the small sample size, we also consider the
faint quasar sample to study the detectability of quasar hosts. Here
we consider only whether the hosts are successfully detected in 10 ks
F200W exposures, to reduce the computational expense of analysing
the large number of faint quasars in all filters. With this technique,
19/22 of the bright quasars and 167/175 of the faint quasars are
successfully detected in the 10 ks F200W exposures, resulting in an
overall success rate for the faint quasars 9% higher than that for the
bright quasars.
In Figure 11 we show the UV dust-attenuated absolute magni-"
"tudes for the quasars and their host galaxies from both samples.
For both bright and faint quasars, there is no significant trend
between detectability in the F200W filter and the quasar or host

ity and any other galaxy or black hole property for these faint quasars."

psfMC.
We obtain the input magnitude of the host galaxies using Syn-"
"thObs, by calculating the flux within the given filter of each star
particle from the SSP model, and converting to a magnitude. We
then compare these input magnitudes against the S√©rsic magnitudes
extracted by psfMC, for quasars with ‚Äòsuccessful‚Äô host detections, as
shown in the top panel of Figure 12.
From Figure 12 we see that the long-wavelength filters F277W,"

that there could be a difference in the observationally determined
magnitudes and theoretically input ones, due to surface brightness
effects and image extents, for example. Thus this difference may not
be due to the PSF-subtraction method producing poor results.

ages and the mock images of the host galaxies with no quasar emis-
sion (‚Äòtrue host images‚Äô).We assume a circular aperturewith diameter
equal to the total image width, and do not perform background sub-
traction as this is already completed within psfMC. We then compare
the photometric magnitudes measured from the true host images to
the S√©rsic magnitudes extracted by psfMC for quasars with ‚Äòsuccess-
ful‚Äô host detections, shown in the second panel of Figure 12. The

Overall, the S√©rsic magnitudes are in better agreement with the"
"true host photometric magnitudes than the input magnitudes. This
suggests that indeed the input magnitudes do not reflect the observed
true host magnitudes due to observational effects. Thus, the S√©rsic
magnitudes extracted from psfMC can be used to reasonably estimate
the magnitude of the host that would be measured if no quasar con-
tamination were present. However, there is large scatter between the
S√©rsic and true host photometric magnitudes, with an overall median
ùëöSersic ‚àí ùëötrue of 0.016 mag and a standard deviation of 0.279 mag
across all filters. This suggests that the S√©rsic magnitude may not be
an ideal estimator of the host magnitude, potentially indicating that
high-redshift galaxies are not ideally described by a S√©rsic profile.

a standard deviation of 0.186 mag across all filters, there is a tighter
correlation between ùëöphot and ùëötrue than with the S√©rsic magnitude
ùëöSersic, suggesting that this may be a more precise indicator of the
true host photometric magnitude. However, the photometric mag-
nitudes ùëöphot are generally offset to lower magnitudes than ùëötrue,
and thus performing photometry on the PSF-subtracted images will
overestimate the brightness of the host galaxies. This is likely due to
residual flux from the quasar itself, with some central flux remain-
ing after the psfMC fit, as discussed in Section 3.3. We note that
the S√©rsic magnitudes do not systematically overestimate the host
brightness, as the central core of this remnant flux is not necessarily
attributed to the host galaxy in the S√©rsic fit (see Section 3.3).
To account for this residual flux, wemask the central contaminated"
"region of the images before performing the photometry. Based on the
PSF-subtracted images (see e.g. Figures 3 and 6, and Appendix A),
we choose to mask the central circle with a radius of 5 pixels, which
encompasses the core of the contamination, setting their original flux
values to NaNs. For a lower limit on the host brightness, we simply
assume that the flux for each pixel within this region is equal to the
minimum flux in a ring of one pixel in radius around this central
region. For our best estimate of the host brightness, we replace the
NaNs by interpolating from the neighbouring data points outside the
masked region with a 2D Gaussian kernel with standard deviation
equal to the FWHM, using theAstroPy (Astropy Collaboration et al.
2013) convolution and filtering functions. For both of these masking
choices, we perform aperture photometry in an identical procedure
to the unmasked images. We assume that the upper limit on the
brightness is the original photometric magnitude ùëöphot.
We show these masked photometric magnitudes in the bottom"
"panel of Figure 12. We find that for the best estimate magnitudes us-

"MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì19 (2019)"
Observing high-redshift quasar hosts with JWST 13
"makes clear improvements for the short-wavelength filters, although
it provides more limited benefits for the magnitudes measured in the
long-wavelength filters, which are less affected by residual flux from
the quasar.
In summary, we find that the host S√©rsicmagnitudes extracted from"
"psfMC are not representative of the ‚Äòinput‚Äô theoretical magnitudes
from BlueTides, however this is likely due to observational effects
such as surface brightnesses and not a failure of the psfMC method.
To determine the success of the psfMC technique we compare the
extracted S√©rsicmagnitudes to the photometricmagnitudesmeasured
from the true host images. While overall these are similar, with an
overall medianùëöSersic‚àíùëötrue of 0.016mag, there is a large scatter of
0.279 mag, which suggests that S√©rsic profiles do not ideally model
the host profiles. Photometric host magnitudes calculated from the
PSF-subtracted images generally overestimate the host brightness
due to the quasar contamination, with an overall medianùëöphot‚àíùëötrue
of ‚àí0.128 mag and a standard deviation of 0.186 mag across all
filters. Masking the inner contaminated region prior to performing
the photometry and smoothing with a Gaussian kernel results in the
most accurate and precise estimates of the true host magnitude, with
median ùëömasked ‚àí ùëötrue of 0.001 mag and a standard deviation of
0.178 mag across all filters. Significant care thus needs to be made
when extracting the magnitudes of the host galaxies."
5.2 Physical Properties
"We now investigate the extent to which psfMC can recover the phys-
ical properties of quasar host galaxies."
5.2.1 Radius
"In Figure 13 we show the S√©rsic radius found from psfMC fits to 10
ks images in each NIRCam filter, compared with the half-mass radius
determined from the true particle distribution from BlueTides. We
see no clear correlation between the half-mass radius and fit S√©rsic
radius for the majority of the filters, with no statistically significant
Spearman rank-order correlations found. Thus, the S√©rsic radius pro-
vides no prediction for the intrinsic half-mass radius of the galaxy,
as measured by BlueTides. It is important to note, however, that the
BlueTides half-mass radius is calculated from the stellar particle dis-
tribution, and does not consider the dust distribution. In addition, the
mass-to-light ratio may not be constant. Thus, the half-mass radius is
unlikely to trace the dust-attenuated half-light radius. Hence, while
the S√©rsic fit cannot provide an estimate for the simulated half-mass
radius, this may not represent a failure of this technique specifically,
but a difference in observational and theoretical derivations of galaxy
properties.
To evaluate the success of the psfMC technique in recovering"
"galaxy sizes, we also consider the non-parametric effective radius, as
measured from the true and PSF-subtracted images. We first define
the effective area of each galaxy as the minimum area encompassing
50% of the total light of galaxy, even if the contributing pixels are
non-contiguous. Then, we calculate the effective radius as the radius
of a circle which contains this total area. This is a more robust way
to measure the light distributions of clumpy, high-redshift galaxies
(e.g. Ma et al. 2018).
In Figure 13 we first compare the S√©rsic radii from the psfMC"
"fits to the effective radii measured from the true host images. We
find that for the long-wavelength NIRCam filters, these show rea-
sonable agreement albeit with large scatter, with ùëüSersic ‚àí ùëütrue =

filters cluster around a radius of 10 pixels. This is a result of the prior
distributions specified for the S√©rsic radii in psfMC‚Äîthese radii are
constrained to be less than 10.5 pixels. This was required for the
psfMC method to converge on a reasonable solution; we found that
by allowing larger radii the model would not converge on a feasi-
ble solution, with significant PSF under-subtraction resulting in no
statistically-significant host detections. Thus, S√©rsic radii measured
in these short-wavelength filters are not an accurate representation
of the true host extent.

from the true effective radii, showing radii that are lower by ‚àº0.7
kpc. Thus 50% of the flux in the PSF-subtracted images are con-
tained in fewer pixels than in the true host images. This is expected
due to the remnant quasar flux in the core of the images, which
impacts the short-wavelength images more significantly. Thus, as
for the magnitude comparison, we also calculate the effective ra-
dius on the PSF-subtracted images with the inner circle of radius 5
pixels masked using a 2D Gaussian kernel. These radii are shown
in the final panel of Figure 13. We find that ùëüeff,mask ‚àí ùëütrue =

short-wavelength filters, however the effective radii for the long-
wavelength filters are now overestimated.
Thus, the psfMC technique is able to recover the effective radii"
"of the host galaxies well; in the long-wavelength filters from the raw
images, while the short-wavelength filters first require masking of
the central quasar-contaminated regions."
5.2.2 Morphology
"Finally, we consider the morphologies of the host galaxies.
We consider the S√©rsic index ùëõ, which can be used to estimate the"
"morphology of the galaxy as it is generally correlated with the mea-
sured bulge-to-total ratio (e.g. Vika et al. 2014; Kennedy et al. 2016).
In Figure 14 we show the S√©rsic index compared to the bulge-to-total
mass ratio calculated from the BlueTides simulation. The psfMC
method finds large uncertainties on the extracted S√©rsic indices. The
S√©rsic index shows no significant correlationwith bulge-to-totalmass
ratio, with no statistically significant Spearman rank-order correla-
tions found.
Observations measure the galaxy light profiles to estimate the"
"bulge-to-total mass ratio, performing bulge‚Äìdisc decomposition (e.g.

"particle following Scannapieco et al. (2009). This is based on the
intrinsic stellar properties, and does not consider the observational
effects of stellar ages, dust attenuation or inclination, for example
(see e.g. Scannapieco et al. 2009), which alter the observed light
distributions. The presence of bars and pseudo-bulges further com-
plicate the observational measurements. Thus, it is unlikely that the
BlueTides bulge-to-total measurements would reflect observation-
ally measured ratios. In addition, there is significant scatter in the
relations between measured bulge-to-total ratio and S√©rsic index ùëõ.
Thus, it is reasonable that we see a lack of correlation between ùëõ
and the BlueTides bulge-to-total ratio, and this is not necessarily an
indicator that the psfMC technique is producing poor measurements
of the galaxy.
To understand the success of psfMC in recovering the observed"
"galaxy structure, we visually compare how each PSF-subtracted host
image compares to the true host image (see e.g. Appendix A1 for the
F200W images).
We see that the PSF-subtracted images contain a bright core, from"
"the residual quasar flux as discussed in Section 3.3. The flux in this
region fluctuates significantly between pixels, so the cores are both
bright and clumpy. This central flux is therefore likely to negatively
influence any measurements taken of the galaxy light concentration
or clumpiness, and so must be carefully considered when exploring
such properties. In some true host images, the centre of the galaxy
often contains less flux than the outer regions; this is due to the
large amount of dust present in the cores of these galaxies, which
significantly attenuates the flux in these rest-frame UV wavelengths
(see e.g. Marshall et al. 2020a). The contaminated core makes these
features undetectable.
In the short wavelength filters, many host galaxies have extended"
"emission beyond the contaminated core, which is often quite asym-
metric and clumpy. The psfMC method is able to recover these
features well, working best for the brighter features that are furthest
from the quasar location. psfMC performs poorly for the more com-
pact galaxies with minimal flux outside the contaminated core, with
the recovered outer host flux more clumpy than the true emission,
and the central flux contaminated by the inner quasar core. In the
long-wavelength filters, the true host images show much smoother"
"host distributions, likely due to the reduced resolution of these im-
ages, but also the reduced dust attenuation in the central cores of
these galaxies resulting in smoother galaxy profiles. These images
show fewer faint extended features. The method recovers these hosts
well, excluding the inner core.
Thus we urge caution when interpreting the spatial distribution of"
"the emission of these galaxies, with more extended emission likely
to be real host features, while the cores of the hosts are significantly
contaminated.
One would like to apply quantitative morphological codes to de-"
"scribe the surface-brightness distribution outside this central con-
taminated area. For this, model-independent measures such as the
concentration, asymmetry and clumpiness indices (CAS; e.g. Con-
selice 2003), the Gini coefficient (e.g. Gini 1912; Abraham et al.
2003) and the M20 parameter (e.g Lotz et al. 2004) could be used.
These approaches have been shown to work well on high signal-
to-noise images of galaxies that are not too asymmetric, at low to
intermediate redshifts (z'0‚Äì2, e.g. Taylor-Mager et al. 2007; Mager
et al. 2018). The issues with applying these methods to our PSF-
subtracted host galaxy images are that: 1) these host galaxies can be
extremely asymmetric (see e.g. Appendix A); 2) they have very low
signal-to-noise ratios, rendering the traditional quantitative morpho-
logical classification algorithms less reliable (see e.g. Taylor-Mager
et al. 2007; Mager et al. 2018); and 3) the imperfections in the PSF-
subtraction process (see above) may not allow certain morphological
parameters to be determined reliably or at all, such as the compact-
ness parameter, because it is heavily weighted towards the central
galaxy flux which may be corrupted by PSF imperfections. There-
fore, for true JWST data, one may need to modify these morphology
codes such that the central circular area is excluded. We presented a
simplified version of this process to determine the total magnitudes
in Section 5.1. However, because the high-redshift quasar host galaxy
signal-to-noise ratio will always be low, the CAS and Gini/M20 mea-
sures may have to be determined as averages over cones centered on
the quasar."
6 DISCUSSION
6.1 S√©rsic Profiles
"In this work, we have modelled the galaxies in psfMC as following a
S√©rsic profile. A different profile, or combination of S√©rsic profiles,
could be used in psfMC, however a single S√©rsic profile is chosen
for simplicity.
It is important to note that high-redshift galaxies are unlikely"
"to be well-described by a S√©rsic profile. As seen in the true host
images (e.g. Figure A1), the host galaxies are often asymmetric and
clumpy, and appear not to follow a smooth S√©rsic-like distribution.
Indeed, as seen in Figure 4 which shows both the S√©rsic model
and the true host profile for two quasars, the S√©rsic model does not
perfectly describe the host emission. The suitability of the S√©rsic
model for describing the magnitudes and radii of the host galaxies
was discussed in Sections 5.1 and 5.2.1.
The use of the S√©rsic model may result in some host galaxy de-"
"tections being classified as statistically insignificant, when by eye
the PSF-subtracted images appear to show emission from the host
galaxy. For example, the PSF-subtracted HST images in Figure 4
show some host galaxy flux that is consistent with the true host mock
image, although these are not classified as statistically significant
detections. This suggests that the assumed S√©rsic profile may be a
poor model for the true emission of these hosts. However, this neg-
ative classification is consistent with the large positive and negative"
"MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì19 (2019)"
16 M. A. Marshall et al.
"residuals seen in the difference between the PSF-subtracted and true
host images, which are independent of the host model (Figure 4)."
6.2 The Bayesian Information Criterion
"The Bayesian Information Criterion provides a statistical way to
compare the quasar model to a model with both the quasar and S√©rsic
host galaxy. This accounts for the extra parameters involved with the
more complex host model, ensuring that the additional component
is not over-fitting the data. This criterion can be used to determine
whether a statistically significant detection of the host galaxy has
been made. However, we note that this criterion does not consider
the pixel smoothing that results in the host galaxies appearing clearer
in the mock images. The majority of the mock images shown here
have been smoothed with a ùúé = 1 pixel Gaussian kernel, which
makes the noisy host image clearer, and results in more extended
features being easier to distinguish against the background noise (see
Appendix B). For visualization, in Figure B1 we show Figure 4 with
no smoothing applied.
Image smoothing has a consequence on human classification,"
"based on observing extended structures of positive flux (yellow re-
gions) beyond the central contaminated core (red region). In 10 ks
images with the F200W filter, in non-smoothed images 19/22 of the
bright quasar hosts are visually classified as successfully detected.
For the smoothed images this increases to 21/22, with marginal
flux observed from two additional very compact host galaxies. The
Bayesian Information Criterion results in 19/22 successful detec-
tions, the same fraction as with human classification using only the
raw (non-smoothed) images. However, note that the detected galaxies
are not the all the same, with two BIC-detected galaxies not detected
visually and vice versa; this occurs for very compact marginally-
detected hosts. As this smoothing has an effect on human classifica-
tion, using a different or modified statistical method which includes
smoothing could result in a larger number of successful detections.
When using psfMC to analyse quasar observations, it is a reason-"
"able assumption to model the galaxies as S√©rsic profiles and then use
the Bayesian Information Criterion to support the hypothesis that the
host detection is true and not likely to be noise or residual quasar flux
from the PSF-subtraction. However, alternative statistical measures
or galaxy profiles may result in a larger number of detections, and
may be more accurate at measuring the true galaxy properties."
6.3 Recommendations for JWST Images
"The methods used here are guided by the large number of simulated
images, and our overall aims of understanding the successes and
failures of psfMC for detecting the hosts of quasars with JWST‚Äîwe
create a generic, standard pipeline for this analysis. Initially there will
be very few images of high-z quasars taken with JWST, which will all
have significant science outcomes that warrant detailed investigation.
Hence for the best outcomes with real JWST images we suggest a
similar but more bespoke method to the one performed here.
We recommend using psfMCmodelling with a host S√©rsic profile"
"for the quasar subtraction, using the BIC for basic statistical detection
classification. A detailed analysis should then be performed on each
PSF-subtracted image to understand the host galaxies. This includes
masking any regions contaminated by the quasar flux on a specific
pixel-by-pixel basis in each image, as opposed to masking a general
region as performed here. We have shown that the magnitudes and
radii extracted from the hosts in this way are reliable estimates of
the true host properties, if sufficient care is shown. Thus, applying"
"this method to images in various filters would allow for a compre-
hensive understanding of the rest-frame UV and optical properties
of these host galaxies. For additional complexity, the fits from each
filter could be processed simultaneously, as in GalfitM which fits
the galaxy while imposing a smooth variation of S√©rsic parameters
with wavelength (Vika et al. 2013). This could lead to more secure
measurements of the host galaxy properties."
7 CONCLUSIONS
"High-redshift quasars completely outshine and conceal their host
galaxies in rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. The detection
of these hosts has eluded the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) even
with advanced modelling of the telescope‚Äôs point spread function
(PSF) to account for the quasar emission (e.g. Mechtley et al. 2012;
Marshall et al. 2020b). In this work we use mock images of ùëß = 7
quasars from the BlueTides simulation (Feng et al. 2015) to study
the detectability of quasar host galaxies with the upcoming James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST; Gardner et al. 2006). We apply the
psfMCMarkov Chain Monte Carlo-based PSF modelling technique
(Mechtley 2014) to these mock images, using the Bayesian Infor-
mation Criterion to determine whether a host galaxy is successfully
detected. We primarily consider the 22 ‚Äòbright‚Äô quasars in the simu-
lation with ùëÄUV,AGN < ùëÄUV,Host and ùëöUV,AGN < 22.8 mag.
We compare the performance of HST and JWST at the same wave-"
"lengths (‚àº 1.6`m) and exposure time (4.8 ks), and find that while
HST makes no statistically significant detections, JWST can detect
10 of the 22 bright BlueTides quasars. The improved resolution of
JWST is therefore expected to result in the first successful detec-
tions of the rest-frame UV emission from high-redshift quasar host
galaxies.
We investigate various observational strategies with JWST, study-"
"ing the effect of instrument, photometric filter and exposure time.We
find that in the NIRCam F200Wfilter with exposure times of 1, 2.5, 5
and 10 ks, < 5%, 41%, 68% and 86% of the 22 hosts are successfully
detected, respectively. Thus we predict that exposures of at least 5 ks
will be required to detect a large fraction of quasar host galaxies. We
find that NIRCam imaging in the long-wavelength wide-band filters
will result in the highest fraction of successful host detections, with
10 ks exposures with the F277W, F356W and F444W filters detect-
ing 86%, 100% and 100% of the hosts of bright quasars respectively.
The short wavelength wide-band filters are predicted to obtain fewer
successful detections, with the F115W, F150W, and F200W filters
detecting 55%, 77% and 86% of hosts respectively in 10 ks expo-
sures. We find that MIRI will obtain fewer successful detections than
NIRCam, with only 27% of the hosts of bright quasars successfully
detected in the F560W filter in 10 ks exposures, and < 5% success-
ful detections in the F770W filter, with the lower-sensitivity longer
wavelength filters expected to perform worse.
We find no significant trends between the quasar or galaxy prop-"
"erties and the detectability of the host. However the host galaxies of
bright quasars may be more likely to be successfully detected in at
least 5 of the 6 NIRCam filters if they are massive, ùëÄ‚àó & 1010.7ùëÄÔøΩ ,

extended emission, and have ùëÄUV,Host ‚àí ùëÄUV,AGN < 4. We also
consider the 175 faint quasars with 22.8 < ùëöUV,AGN < 24.85 mag,
which have an overall rate of successful host detection in the F200W
filter 9% higher than that of the bright quasars. Considering both
bright and faint quasars, there is no significant trend between de-
tectability and host or quasar properties."
"MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì19 (2019)"
Observing high-redshift quasar hosts with JWST 17
"We investigate the accuracy of this method for recovering the true
host galaxy magnitudes. We find that the host S√©rsic magnitudes ex-
tracted from psfMC are not representative of the input theoretical
magnitudes from BlueTides, however this is likely due to obser-
vational effects such as surface brightnesses and not a failure of
the psfMC method. We compare the S√©rsic magnitudes to photo-
metric magnitudes measured from the true host images, finding fair
agreement but with large scatter, suggesting that S√©rsic profiles are
reasonable but do not ideally model the host distributions. Photo-
metric host magnitudes measured from the PSF-subtracted images
generally overestimate the host brightness due to the residual quasar
flux in the central regions. Masking this contaminated region prior
to performing the photometry results in the most accurate and pre-
cise estimates of the true host magnitudes. Careful masking of these
central regions will therefore be required to accurately measure the
host magnitudes.
We also study how well the PSF-subtraction can recover the phys-"
"ical properties of the galaxy. We find that the S√©rsic radius provides
no prediction for the intrinsic half-mass radius of the galaxy from
BlueTides, although this reflects a difference in observational and
theoretical derivations of galaxy properties and does not indicate
that the fits perform poorly. We compare the S√©rsic radii from the
psfMC fits to the effective radii as measured from the true host im-
ages, and find that while these show reasonable agreement in the
long-wavelength NIRCam filters, the S√©rsic radii are not an accurate
representation of the true host extent in the short-wavelength filters.
Measuring the effective radii from the PSF-subtracted images, we
find that the psfMC technique is able to recover the effective radii
of the host galaxies well in the long-wavelength filters, and in the
short-wavelength filters only after masking of the central quasar-
contaminated regions. Finally, we consider the morphologies of the
host galaxies. We find no correlation between S√©rsic index ùëõ and
the BlueTides bulge-to-total mass ratio. The PSF-subtraction ac-
curately recovers the distribution of more extended host emission,
while the cores of the hosts are contaminated. Significant care is
needed when interpreting the magnitudes and physical properties of
PSF-subtracted quasar host galaxies.
In this work we predict that JWST will be able to detect the rest-"
"frame UV/optical emission from high-redshift quasar host galaxies
for the first time. This ground-breaking instrument will lead to huge
advancements in our understanding of the growth of the first super-
massive black holes in the Universe, and the interplay between black
holes and their host galaxies."

APPENDIX A: HOST MOCK IMAGES
"We plot the PSF-subtracted images of each of the BlueTides bright
quasars in the JWST NIRCam F200W filter, with an exposure time
of 10 ks, in Figure A1. For comparison, we also show true host mock
images, produced by assuming no quasar emission. We find that 19
of the 22 hosts are successfully detected in 10 ks F200W exposures
using the psfMC PSF modelling technique."
APPENDIX B: NON-SMOOTHED MOCK IMAGES
"The majority of the mock images throughout this work have been
smoothed with a ùúé = 1 pixel Gaussian kernel. This smooths the
galaxy emission, making more extended features easier to see com-
pared to the background noise and any residual host flux. However,
the statistical criterion used to determine whether a host galaxy is
significantly detected does not consider this smoothed data, but the
raw images. We therefore show the non-smoothed mock images for
two quasars in Figure B1, which is identical to Figure 4 except the
mock images have no smoothing applied."

i.e. of both the quasar PSF and host S√©rsic profiles. The fifth panels show the true mock image of the host galaxy, simulated by assuming no quasar emission.
The right-most panels show the difference between the PSF-subtracted image (second panel) and the true host image (fifth panel), with green circles depicting
the PSF FWHM. Green ticks show the statistically significant detections, while red crosses show the fits which are not significant detections. We assume a
sub-sampling of the native pixel scale of a factor of 2 in each spatial dimension, corresponding to a pixel scale of 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤065√ó 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤065 for HST and 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤0155√ó 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤0155
for JWST. The colour scale is chosen to best display the host galaxy, and so the inner quasar PSF core appears saturated. Images are not smoothed."
