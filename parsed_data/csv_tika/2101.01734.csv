"ABSTRACT
We analyse the gas content evolution of infalling haloes in cluster environments from The
Three Hundred project, a collection of 324 numerically modelled galaxy clusters. The haloes
in our sample were selected within 5𝑅200 of the main cluster halo at 𝑧 = 0 and have total halo
mass 𝑀200 ≥ 1011ℎ−1M�. We track their main progenitors and study their gas evolution since
their crossing into the infall region, which we define as 1 − 4𝑅200. Studying the radial trends
of our populations using both the full phase space information and a line-of-sight projection,
we confirm the Arthur et al. (2019) result and identify a characteristic radius around 1.7𝑅200
in 3D and at 𝑅200 in projection at which infalling haloes lose nearly all of the gas prior their
infall. Splitting the trends by subhalo status we show that subhaloes residing in group-mass
and low-mass host haloes in the infall region follow similar radial gas-loss trends as their hosts,
whereas subhaloes of cluster-mass host haloes are stripped of their gas much further out. Our
results show that infalling objects suffer significant gaseous disruption that correlates with
time-since-infall, cluster-centric distance and host mass, and that the gaseous disruption they
experience is a combination of subhalo pre-processing and object gas depletion at a radius
which behaves like an accretion shock.

1 INTRODUCTION
"Our current understanding of structure formation, the ΛCDM
paradigm, describes the growth of structures via continuous merg-
ing of lower mass systems into more massive, denser haloes (White
& Rees 1978). As galaxies fall into these objects, they are affected
by several mechanisms due to their local environment (e.g. Boselli
& Gavazzi 2006, and references therein). Studies have shown that
correlations between galaxy properties and environment become"

"stronger in more extreme environments, such as within the virial ra-
dius of galaxy clusters. For instance, compared to the field, in high
density environments early-type morphologies are more abundant
(Dressler 1980), galaxies are redder (Baldry et al. 2006), and star
formation is suppressed (Gómez et al. 2003)."
"Determining the extent of galaxy disruption in “sub-dominant”
environments, such as filaments and group-sized haloes, before an
in-falling galaxy passes beyond the virial radius of a galaxy cluster,
also known as pre-processing (Fujita 2004), is likewise important.
Pre-processing has been suggested as a possible cause for recent
observational results that find suppressed star formation (Lu et al."

"2012; Cybulski et al. 2014; Haines et al. 2015), lower disc fractions
(Roberts & Parker 2017) and higher red fractions (Just et al. 2019)
in infalling galaxies at high cluster-centric radii compared with the
field. More specifically, observations have shown that subhaloes,
containing satellite galaxies, show signs of pre-processing (Hou
et al. 2014) at high cluster-centric radii. In fact, it has been suggested
that the quenching of satellite star formation is responsible for the
majority of all quiescent (red-sequence) galaxies at𝑀star < 1010M�
by 𝑧 = 0 and pre-processing by groups dominates this quenching
(Wetzel et al. 2013)."
"Using SDSS data, Wetzel et al. (2012) andWetzel et al. (2013)
showed that on first infall into a host, satellites are unaffected by
the host environment and are able to actively form stars for 2 − 4
Gyr after their infall. Results from Wetzel et al. (2013) also imply
that the satellite quenching time does not depend on the mass of
the host, but rather the mass of the satellite. In contrast, Roberts
& Parker (2017) showed that the largest degree of pre-processing
was found in the smallest satellite galaxies and the largest hosts.
Theoretical work by Bahé & McCarthy (2015) agrees with Wetzel
et al. (2013) in that there is a delay in quenching satellites, once
accreted onto a host. However, they also go on to corroborate the
results of Roberts & Parker (2017), by showing that quenching
timescales do depend on host mass. Further theoretical studies have
also tried to assess how prevalent pre-processing is. Using semi-
analytic models, McGee et al. (2009) and De Lucia et al. (2012)
found that up to ∼ 40 per cent of galaxies residing in clusters at z
= 0 had previously spent a significant time in group environments.
However, using a similar technique, Berrier et al. (2009) found
that pre-processing was a secondary process in galaxy evolution.
Using a semi-analytic model, Cora et al. (2019) found quenching
times consistent with the ones presented in Wetzel et al. (2013),
and a star formation quenching of low-mass satellites (i.e. 𝑀star
∼ 1010 M�) that supports the Wetzel et al. (2013) ‘delay-then-
rapid’ scenario. However, they showed that this scenario does not
accurately describe the quenching experienced by the 𝑧 = 0 passive
satellites with higher stellar mass, as the duration of both phases is
of the same order of magnitude. Thus, they suggest a ‘delay-then-
fade’ quenching scenario that accounts for quenching processes in
which both phases have comparable time-scales."
"The missing ingredient from these studies is an extensive ex-
amination of the gas in pre-processed objects. Bahé et al. (2013)
made some attempt to quantify the gas stripping beyond the cluster
virial radius by using the instantaneous gas fractions of infalling
objects around clusters. Their main finding showed that radial gas
fractions decrease with decreasing cluster-centric distance, and con-
tamination from backsplash and pre-processed galaxies (which will
also increase with decreasing cluster-centric distance) brings the
distribution down. This is in disagreement with Lotz et al. (2019)
and Arthur et al. (2019), who find that the instantaneous gas frac-
tion does decline radially, but the gas in (sub)haloes is lost on first
passage, rather than contamination being the cause for the radial
decline. In fact, in Arthur et al. (2019) it was postulated that the
majority of gas in infalling objects is stripped by some sort of ac-
cretion shock at 1.5− 2𝑅200, where 𝑅200 is the radius of the halo at
200 times the critical density of the universe at that redshift. How-
ever, whilst galaxy star formation quenching has been well studied,
a full examination of the gas in infalling objects is needed in order
to possibly alleviate tension in the literature and learn more about
pre-processing."
"In this work we use the The Three Hundred dataset 1, a
sample of over 300 galaxy clusters simulated with full-physics hy-
drodynamics out to > 5𝑅200 of each galaxy cluster (Cui et al. 2018),
to assess the level of gaseous disruption of haloes and subhaloes be-
yond 𝑅200. We extend the 𝑧 = 0 analysis done in Arthur et al.
(2019) by using the orbital histories of > 105 infalling (sub)haloes
in a range of environments to quantify gas-loss since infall, which
we arbitrarily define as 4𝑅200. Using these tools we address what
cluster-centric distance objects lose their gas, how long it takes
since crossing 4𝑅200 for objects to lose their gas, how host mass is
linked to subhalo pre-processing, and whether some hosts are more
efficient at stripping subhaloes."
"This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 contains the nu-
merical methodology used in this chapter. In Section 2.1 we give
brief reminder of the The Three Hundred dataset and how it was
created. Section 2.2 describes how the objects in our sample and
their orbital histories were selected. In Section 2.3 we present the
definitons and methodologies used in the analysis. Our results and
discussion is presented in Section 3. Lastly, in Section 4we conclude
with a summary of our main findings."
2 NUMERICAL METHODS
2.1 ‘The Three Hundred’ Dataset
"The Simulations The Three Hundred dataset consists of simu-
lated clusters created by extracting 324 spherical regions of 15ℎ−1
Mpc radius centred on each of the most massive clusters identified
at 𝑧 = 0 from the dark-matter-only MDPL2, MultiDark simulation
(Klypin et al. 2016)2. MDPL2 was simulated with a Planck 2015
cosmology (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016), with ΩM = 0.307,
Ωb = 0.048, ΩΛ = 0.693, ℎ = 0.678, 𝜎8 = 0.823, and 𝑛𝑠 = 0.96;
and it contains 38403 darkmatter particles each ofmass 1.5×109ℎ−1
M� residing within a box of 1ℎ−1 Gpc side-length. To model the
relevant baryonic physics, the 15ℎ−1Mpc regions extracted from
the MDPL2 simulation were traced back to their initial conditions
and populated with gas particles according to the Planck 15 cos-
mological baryonic fraction Ωb/ΩM ∼ 0.16. Consequently, the
resulting particles in the spherical region have a dark matter and
gas particle mass resolution of 𝑚DM = 1.27 × 109ℎ−1M� and
𝑚gas = 2.36 × 108ℎ−1M� , respectively. Outside the re-simulated
region, to reduce the computational cost of the original MDPL2
simulation, dark matter particles are degraded with lower mass
resolution particles to maintain the same large scale tidal field.
The new initial conditions were simulated forward in time from
𝑧 = 16.98 to 𝑧 = 0 (in 129 saved snapshots) using GADGET-X (Beck
et al. 2016), using a Plummer equivalent softening of 6.5ℎ−1kpc
for both the dark matter and baryonic component. GADGET-X is a
modified version of GADGET3 (an updated version of GADGET2 by
Springel 2005), with a modern Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics
(SPH) scheme which improves the treatment of gas particles in the
presence of dynamical instabilities and mixing processes, alleviates
clumpiness instabilities, and reduces the viscosity away from shock
regions (Beck et al. 2016; Sembolini et al. 2016b). Results of simu-
lations of galaxy clusters based on GADGET-X have been presented
in several previous papers (e.g. Rasia et al. 2015; Planelles et al."

The gas disruption of infalling objects 3"
"2017) and in the nIFTy cluster comparison project (Sembolini et al.
2016a; Elahi et al. 2016; Cui et al. 2016; Arthur et al. 2017)."
"The Halo Finding The halo analysis was done using the AHF3
halo finder (Gill et al. 2004a; Knollmann & Knebe 2009). AHF lo-
cates local overdensities in an adaptively smoothed density field
as potential halo centres. Thus, it automatically creates a hierar-
chical structure between haloes and substructure, i.e. subhaloes,
subsubhaloes, etc. The radius of a halo 𝑅200 (and its corresponding
enclosed mass 𝑀200) are calculated as the radius 𝑅 at which the
density 𝜌(𝑅) = 𝑀 (< 𝑅)/(4𝜋𝑅3/3) drops below 200𝜌crit, where
𝜌crit is the critical density of the Universe at a given redshift 𝑧."
"We maintain the definitions used in Arthur et al. (2019). We
use the term halo to refer to an object comprised of a collection of
dark matter and baryonic particles, as classified by AHF, which does
not reside within 𝑅200 of another halo. Conversely, subhalo refers
to an object that does reside within 𝑅200 of another object, be it
another subhalo or halo. In each of the 324 cluster regions available
in the dataset we identify a main galaxy cluster halo, defined here
as the most massive object at 𝑧 = 0."
"The Merger Trees The progenitors of haloes and subhaloes are fol-
lowed across the snapshots with MergerTree. Objects identified at
redshift 𝑧 = 0 are tracked backwards in time and assigned main pro-
genitors at some previous redshift. A main progenitors is defined as
the object that maximises the merit functionM = 𝑁2"
"𝐴∩𝐵/(𝑁𝐴𝑁𝐵),
where 𝑁𝐴 and 𝑁𝐵 are the number of particles in haloes𝐻𝐴 and𝐻𝐵 ,
respectively, and 𝑁𝐴∩𝐵 is the number of particles that are in both
𝐻𝐴 and 𝐻𝐵 . The merger trees used in the analysis allow snapshot
skipping, i.e. progenitors of (sub)haloes that are not found in the
previous snapshot are still searched for in earlier snapshots, recov-
ering an otherwise truncated branch of the merger tree (see Wang
et al. 2016)."
2.2 Sample selection
"To build the sample, from each of the cluster regions we selected
at 𝑧 = 0 all objects within 5𝑅200 from their respective main galaxy
cluster halo, and with total halo mass 𝑀200 ≥ 1011ℎ−1M� . This
corresponds to a median of ∼ 160 dark matter particles."
"In this work we extend upon the analysis presented in Arthur
et al. (2019) by using the orbital histories of the 𝑧 = 0 sample up to
𝑧 = 1, which corresponds to a look-back time of ∼ 8 Gyr. For this
analysis, we only make use of the main progenitor branch of each
object in our sample. Any past objects that have merged into our
sample of objects as a progenitor, and not a main progenitor, will
be discarded."
"As previously mentioned, each cluster region contains a main
cluster halo located in the centre of the region, and like the rest
of objects in the sample, a main cluster halo is tracked back by
following its main progenitor branch. If an object in the sample is
beyond the radial cut or falls below the mass threshold at a certain
time in its orbital history, that part of its history is ignored in the
analysis. For objects that do pass these criteria, at each snapshot
we describe their positions and velocities relative to the position
and velocity of the main progenitor of the main cluster halo of the
region at that time. Major mergers during the formation of cluster
haloes pose a challenge to this (Behroozi et al. 2015), therefore,
following the discussion in Haggar et al. (2020), we identified and"
3 http://popia.ft.uam.es/AHF
"removed cluster haloes whose main progenitor’s position changes
by more than half their radius 𝑅200 (𝑧) between two consecutive
snapshots [𝑧, 𝑧 + Δ𝑧]. As our analysis extends up to 𝑧 = 1, this re-
duces the number of resimulated regions considered in the analysis
from 324 to 253. We obtain 132 427 haloes and subhaloes, with
mean total mass 𝑀200 = 1.2 × 1012ℎ−1M� and mean gas mass
𝑀gas = 8.4 × 1010ℎ−1M� , satisfying these constraints and con-
stituting our analysis sample. Note that, as our analysis primarily
concerns the infall region of each main galaxy cluster, defined here
as their 1− 4𝑅200 region, not every object can be assigned an infall
redshift, i.e. the time at which an object crossed 4𝑅200. For analysis
where properties at infall are required, we instead use 85 497 haloes
and subhaloes with a designated infall redshift."
2.3 Phase space analysis
"We follow the same definitions of phase space coordinates as in
Arthur et al. (2019), which in turn follows the definitions presented
in Oman et al. (2013). Here we briefly describe the procedure, we
refer to Arthur et al. (2019) for further details."
"For every object in our sample we construct their phase-space
coordinates in 3D and in projection along line-of-sight (PROJ),
where the latter is designed to mimic observational studies4. Across
our analysis, we normalise relative distances by the 𝑅200 radius of
the main progenitor of the main cluster halo at the corresponding
redshift value 𝑧snap, i.e. 𝑅200 (𝑧 = 𝑧snap); and relative velocities
by the cluster velocity dispersion, 𝜎, at the corresponding redshift
value."
"The 3D coordinates are defined by using all phase-space di-
mensions, i.e. their 3D position r and velocity v, of the object (𝑥h,
𝑦h, 𝑧h, 𝑣x,h, 𝑣y,h, 𝑣z,h) with respect to the same dimensions of the
cluster halo (𝑥c, 𝑦c, 𝑧c, 𝑣x,c, 𝑣y,c, 𝑣z,c). In particular, we define the
3D velocity of an object, 𝑣3D, as"
"𝑣3D = sgn (r · v) |v| , (1)"
"where r and v are the (relative) position and velocity vectors between
the cluster and the object, respectively. Note that the sign of 𝑣3D
allows us to disentangle which objects are infalling into or outgoing
from the cluster. Finally, to estimate the corresponding 3D velocity
dispersion 𝜎3D of an object, we take the root mean square of the
𝑣3D distribution of subhaloes of the main cluster halo, i.e. objects
within 𝑅200 of the main cluster halo, defined by the halo finder5."
"The projected coordinates are defined by arbitrarily projecting
down one axis of the simulation box, in our case along the third (z-)
axis of the simulation box. We note that our results are not sensitive
to the choice of the projected axis. We use the two remaining spatial
coordinates, i.e (𝑥, 𝑦), to calculate the distance from the cluster,"
𝑅PROJ =
"√︃
(𝑥h − 𝑥c)2 + (𝑦h − 𝑦c)2 , (2)"
"A more in-depth study of the projected phase space of the sample
(at 𝑧 = 0) is presented in Arthur et al. (2019)."
"4 Although we use the same definitions as the ones presented in Arthur
et al. (2019), for clarity we changed the naming convention. Our 3D and
line-of-sight projection (PROJ) phase-space coordinates correspond to the
‘6D’ and ‘LOS’ coordinates in Arthur et al. (2019), respectively.
5 We use the velocity dispersion of subhaloes in the main cluster halo as
it is closer to what is measured in observations. The deviation between this
estimator and the velocity dispersion of the main cluster halo is less than 10
per cent (e.g Gill et al. 2004b; Munari et al. 2013)."

3 RESULTS
"The analysis is split into several parts. In the first section we exam-
ine cluster build up in and beyond 𝑅200. We then stack the orbital
histories from our sample in order to construct gas-loss relations
with respect to cluster-centric distance and time-since-infall. Lastly,
we examine how subhalo gas disruption is linked to their host en-
vironment. Note that, to determine the gas evolution of our sample,
we simply use the mass of all the gas particles within 𝑅200 of an
object."
3.1 Cluster and infall region build up
"In Fig. 1 we show the halo and subhalo spatial distribution and
phase-space information at three different snapshots in time around
the same cluster. The top, middle and bottom panels depict the
cluster at 𝑧 = 1.0, 𝑧 = 0.5 and 𝑧 = 0, respectively. In each panel
in the left column we represent the projected distribution of haloes
with blue circles and subhaloes (be it the main galaxy cluster halo
or any other halo) with red circles. The size of the circles represents
the relative mass of the objects and the black circle shows the 𝑅200
radius of the cluster halo. In the right column we present the phase-
space information at each redshift coloured by their mass 𝑀200 and
their gas fraction 𝑓g, defined as the mass of all the gas particles
within 𝑅200 of an object over its total mass. The vertical dotted
line separates the objects inside the cluster halo (‘in’) from the ones
outside it (‘out’), and the horizontal dotted line differentiates the
backsplash population (‘bsplsh’) from the infalling one (‘inf’)."
"From the snapshots it is apparent that the cluster accretes more
objects as time progresses. At 𝑧 = 1.0, the infall region is sparsely
populated and the cluster halo itself does not containmuch substruc-
ture.However, by 𝑧 = 0.5, the infall region has accreted considerably
more substructure, with some objects apparently coalesced into fil-
amentary structures. Alongside this, the infall region contains more
host environments at 𝑧 = 0.5 than at 𝑧 = 1.0, potentially leading
to more pre-processing at this epoch. At 𝑧 = 0, the cluster halo
still contains a considerable amount of substructure, but the infall
region looks comparatively different to previous epochs. Overall,
we observe that there are many more haloes and subhaloes more
isotropically distributed around 𝑅200."
"By examining the phase-space planes in the right-hand pan-
els at each epoch, we can extract more information about how the
infalling objects are accreting onto the cluster. At 𝑧 = 1.0, the in-
falling population has a substantial amount of scatter in velocity.
This might be due to the lack of virialisation of the cluster, or due
to the influence of the host environment at ∼ 2𝑅200. By 𝑧 = 0.5,
the phase-space plane shows that the infall region contains a tight
infalling branch, with little scatter in velocity. We identify a few
objects that are scattered off the main branch, probably dynamic
subhaloes falling into host environments. These objects are particu-
larly good candidates to look for signs of pre-processing, especially
considering they are also gas-poor. As previously seen from the gas
fractions in Arthur et al. (2019), infalling objects are substantially
more gas-poor at < 1.5𝑅200. At 𝑧 = 0.5 the cluster contains many
more subhaloes than at the earlier epoch; some of these objects are
on their first infall, whilst others have already passed their pericentre
passage, but have not travelled beyond 𝑅200 to form the backsplash
population. However, by 𝑧 = 0 there is a distinct backsplash pop-
ulation that extends out to ∼ 2.5𝑅200. Interestingly, in this cluster
one can see a clear group of objects that are on their second infall,
located between ∼ 1 − 2.5𝑅200. The extent of the backsplash and"

up, the left-hand column contains the projected orbital histories of
the infalling objects coloured by their time since accretion onto
4𝑅200, i.e. since their crossing of 4𝑅200. On the other hand, to find
how the gas in each infalling object behaves as they infall, we colour
the halo orbital histories by the gas fraction they have in that posi-
tion. We have also coloured the orbital histories in the right-hand
column by their subhalo status at the corresponding point in time,
i.e. if the object resides within another halo or not at the given time."

left-hand column colours thewhole orbital history by the time since an object
crossed 4𝑅200. The middle and right-hand columns contain orbital histories
that have coloured sections based on the gas fraction and their subhalo
status at that position, respectively. Infalling objects at 𝑧 = 0 are marked
with circle markers, backsplash objects with triangle markers. For clarity,
only a subsample of 150 infalling objects are shown in each resimulation."
"Additionally, we mark infalling objects at 𝑧 = 0 with circle markers
and backsplash ones with triangle markers. Cross-correlating this
information allows us to examine in detail how our example clusters
are built, and how the gaseous properties of our infalling objects are
affected by their local environment or subhalo status."
"In all four example cluster regions, we identify a population
of objects that have accreted early that either become part of the
backsplash or virialised populations at 𝑧 = 0. As our sample only
contains objects that survive to 𝑧 = 0, no mergers can be seen in
the orbital histories. These early accreting objects are nearly always
gas-poor as soon as they enter the cluster halo, and we can see how
the backsplash objects can contaminate infall region observations
designed for identifying pre-processing. However, as stated in De
Lucia et al. (2012), as these objects have accreted early, they are
older and therefore might had more time to be quenched by secular
processes. From these left-hand panels, we can see the build up of
each cluster is fairly diverse. The top-middle cluster presents a more
in-situ build up, where many of the early accreting objects have not
come in from a large distance or as part of a merger. Contrary to
this, the top cluster appears to have been more built up by many"
"objects that have traversed the whole infall region. However, we do
note that our analysis is limited between 𝑧 = 0 and 𝑧 = 1. Some
of these clusters may have undergone drastic transitions very early,
which we have no knowledge about in this analysis. Nevertheless, a
lookback time of ∼ 8 Gyr should be satisfactory to build up a good
picture of each cluster’s accretion history."
"The infall region is also structured differently in each resimu-
lation. The bottom-middle cluster appears to be funnelling in mate-
rial through what appears to be filamentary structures in projection,
whilst most of the material in the bottom row is being brought in as
part of a large object on the top left-hand side of the panels. Despite
the diversity observed in these regions, they all display signs of
filamentary structure."
"Whereas the objects that have travelled into the cluster halo are
nearly always gas-poor, the objects in the infalling regions are not,
although there are some caveats and these exceptions are possible
pre-processing candidates. For instance, there are objects in the top
three rows that become gas-poor in the infall region, before they
entered the main cluster halo, and this gas disruption corresponds
well with them being a subhalo of some other infalling object.
Therefore, it is quite possible that these objects are being stripped
as they fall into host environments at large cluster-centric radii.
However, there are some haloes which become gas-poor in the
infall region, which may be because of some local filamentary gas
environment or some secular process. The bottom cluster shows the
most obvious case of pre-processing. Many gas-poor objects on the
left-hand side of the panels are clearly orbiting some large host halo,
which is stripping their gas before reaching the main cluster halo."
"It’s clear from Fig. 2 that the accretion histories of galaxy clus-
ters are extremely diverse, and difficult to generalise and describe
by only one or two metrics. It is also evident that within our res-
imulations, there is some evidence for object gas disruption within
both the cluster halo and the infall region. Whereas Fig. 2 contains
a substantial amount of detail about this, we next go on to stack all
object orbital histories from each resimulation, in order to extract
robust general trends and to learn more about the extent of gaseous
disruption since objects crossed 4𝑅200."
3.2 How gas-loss since infall relates to cluster-centric distance
"In this section we stack orbital histories to assess whether, on av-
erage, there is a characteristic radius at which infalling haloes and
subhaloes lose their gas since infall. This section directly follows up
on the work done in Arthur et al. (2019), where it was found that the
instantaneous gas fractions of infalling objects dropped to approxi-
mately zero at∼ 1.5𝑅200 and 𝑅200 in the 3D and PROJ perspectives,
respectively. In this case, the temporal study actually allows us to
answer whether the gas is lost at these points in space. In Fig. 3 we
present these radial relations, where the left-hand panel contains the
median fractional gas-loss as a function of cluster-centric distance
in both 3D and PROJ. For every object, their gas mass is recorded at
infall (𝑅inf = 4𝑅200), and this is then used to calculate the fractional
gas-loss at each snapshot for every orbital history. As remarked in
Section 2.2, to determine properties at infall we only use haloes
and subhaloes with an assigned infall time. The radial trends are
found by stacking in radial bins and then extracting median gas-loss
fractions in each bin with corresponding 40 and 60 percentiles."
"From the 3D distribution in the left-hand panel, infalling ob-
jects start to lose their gas gradually, beginning at ∼ 3𝑅200 until
∼ 2𝑅200, where objects have lost ∼ 30 per cent of their gas on
average. At this point, there is a dramatic upturn in object gas-loss,
and between ∼ 2𝑅200 and ∼ 1.7𝑅200, infalling (sub)haloes appear"

"to lose all of their gas. Our results here corroborate and further the
results presented in Arthur et al. (2019), as it is now clear infalling
objects start losing the majority of their gas close to ∼ 2𝑅200.
Previous studies (e.g. Behroozi et al. 2014; Niemiec et al. 2019)
found that infalling dark matter haloes start losing their dark matter
around similar cluster-centric distances, i.e. ∼ 1.5 − 1.8𝑅200. This
characteristic radius seems to be present also for less massive haloes
(Buck et al. 2019). As suggested in Behroozi et al. (2014), galaxy
quenching might correlate with such mass-loss processes. In the
PROJ projection, the gradual loss of gas starts at ∼ 2𝑅200, and 100
per cent gas-loss is recorded at 𝑅200. In fact, our PROJ perspec-
tive trend agrees well with Wetzel et al. (2013), who showed that
haloes containing central galaxies, are not quenched by either local
environments or the cluster, until they reach ∼ 2𝑅200."
"Like our trends, Bahé et al. (2013) also found that their in-
stantaneous radial gas fraction trends decreased with decreasing
cluster-centric distance. However, they postulated that the main rea-
son for this decline was due to contamination from backsplash
objects, which as seen in Fig. 3, are definitively gas-poor. We in-
vestigate this further in the right-hand panel of Fig. 3, which shows
the radial 3D fractional gas-loss trend from the left panel, but here
we have split this trend by outgoing and infalling objects. This split
corresponds to a cut at v3D/𝜎3D = 0, where anything above and
below this cut are outgoing and infalling objects, respectively. The
fractional gas-loss of outgoing objects is nearly always 100 per cent,
except at ∼ 4𝑅200 , which consists of extremely dynamic, gas-rich
subhaloes falling into host environments. The contamination of our
trends by outgoing objects is calculated by taking the negative ab-
solute difference between the combined and infalling trends."
"Most of the difference between these trends is seen at ∼
1.5𝑅200, where infalling objects appear to lose their gas ∼ 0.3𝑅200
closer to the cluster. However, infalling objects still lose all of their
gas by the characteristic ∼ 1.5𝑅200 radius. Note that using this ve-
locity cut does not account for second, or even third, infalling objects
that have already traversed the cluster halo and been stripped. The
only way to disentangle previous backsplash and ≥ 2nd infalling
objects from the first infalling population is to tag each orbital his-
tory as it passes within the cluster halo. Using a similar sample,
Haggar et al. (2020) showed that, depending on the dynamical state"

"of the galaxy cluster, the median fraction of backsplash objects is
∼ 40 per cent at 2𝑅200 for relaxed galaxy clusters, and ∼ 1 per cent
for unrelaxed galaxy clusters. By 2.5𝑅200, backsplash objects are
only found around relaxed galaxy clusters. Our results show that, at
similar radii, half of the gas of the infalling objects is already gone.
As we do not make a distinction between relaxed and unrelaxed
galaxy clusters, we expect that the contamination by these popula-
tions does not alter our trends by a substantial amount and therefore
we conclude that most fractional gas-loss from infalling objects is
lost on first infall (see Lotz et al. 2019) at a characteristic radius."
"In Fig. 4 we split the fractional gas-loss radial trends, seen
in the left-hand panel in Fig. 3, by the subhalo status of the ob-
jects at that radius. From the 3D projection (left-hand panel), we
see that subhaloes lose their gas much quicker than haloes since
crossing 4𝑅200. The halo trend still follows the combined trend
in Fig. 3 very well, as the majority of the objects in the infall
region will be haloes, which also explains why there is more scat-
ter in the subhalo-only trend. However, even with the percentiles
taken into account, subhaloes have already lost 60 per cent of their
gas by ∼ 3𝑅200, on average, whereas haloes reach the same frac-
tional gas-loss at ∼ 1.7𝑅200. While this is compelling evidence for
pre-processing of subhaloes by host environments, we further sep-
arate the subhaloes in the sample by their host halo mass. We note
that the radial cut used to determine the sample region at 𝑧 = 0,
i.e. 5𝑅200 from the most massive object, contains a diverse range
of haloes and subhaloes masses, including objects with total mass
𝑀200 > 1014ℎ−1M� . In order to differentiate galaxy disruption due
to sub-dominant environments (i.e. pre-processing) from disruption
exerted by cluster-mass hosts infalling onto the main galaxy cluster
(i.e. cluster quenching), we remove from the subhalo sample the
subhaloes residing in cluster-mass host haloes. The fractional gas-
loss of the subhaloes in group-mass and low-mass hosts is shown as
a dashed violet line.We can clearly see that the fractional gas-loss of
these subhaloes follows essentially the same radial disruption trend
observed in the halo population in 3D. For the PROJ projection,
haloes, and subhaloes in group-mass and low-mass hosts follow a
similar trend up to 𝑅200, from which the subhaloes have ∼ 20 per
cent less gas than haloes, albeit with more scatter. From these re-
lations we conclude that subhaloes that reside within cluster-mass
host haloes during their infall onto the main cluster halo, i.e. sub-
haloes of cluster-mass host haloes found in the infall region of the
main cluster halo, are quickly depleted of their gas and dominate"

The gas disruption of infalling objects 7
"the radial gas-loss trend if we consider all subhaloes regardless of
the mass of their host haloes."
"Some recent studies (van den Bosch & Ogiya 2018; van den
Bosch et al. 2018) have found that subhaloes in hydrodynamic sim-
ulations are prone to enhanced artificial tidal stripping due to inad-
equate mass or spatial resolution, even at a nominal ‘resolved’ mass
cut (e.g. 1011ℎ−1M� , which is used in this analysis). For example,
if the intrahalo medium is not well resolved gas particles become
easily unbound. As a consequence, the gas-loss (or gain) trend found
for infalling objects simply translates the motion towards higher or
lower density regions. In light of these issues, we consider the char-
acteristic radius 1.7𝑅200 (1.5𝑅200 when removing contamination
from outgoing objects) below which infalling objects lose their gas
as an upper-bound of the accretion shock radius. Nevertheless, it is
most probable that the fractional gas-loss trends are a combination
of environmental stripping by host environments, secular processes,
and enhanced numerical stripping. The interesting question here is
how dominant the environmental effect is, and will be an area of
future work."
"We note here that our trends line up well with those seen in
Wetzel et al. (2013), but this time we have identified that the halo
population, which contain central galaxies, seem to be affected by
the cluster at ∼ 2𝑅200. This is especially true in the PROJ per-
spective, whereas in the 3D perspective, haloes seem to be affected
somewhat further out. We note that any differences in gas-loss as
a function of cluster-centric distance between the halo and subhalo
populations are somewhat washed out by projection effects intrinsic
to the PROJ perspective."
3.3 How gas-loss relates to time-since-infall
"In this section we use the orbital histories of our sample to investi-
gate how gas-loss since crossing 4𝑅200 relates to time since crossing
that radius. Bahé & McCarthy (2015) first used the GIMIC simula-
tions to characterise how satellites were quenched as a function of
time since passing 𝑅200. We extend their analysis by examining, on
average, how the infall region builds up as a function of time-since-
infall and how an object’s gaseous properties are also affected. In
order to acquire a clear picture of how The Three Hundred clus-
ters generally build up, we repeat the analysis done in Oman et al.
(2013), which is presented in Fig. 5. In the top-left panel we show
the stacked 3D phase-space plane from all the objects in our sample
at 𝑧 = 0, which extend the analysis done in Arthur et al. (2019).
We use the orbital histories to split the objects in this plane by their
time-since-infall into the following eight panels. In each panel we
show the number of objects in each bin."
"The top-left panel contains a distinct infalling branch, a back-
splash population and a virialised population. Unsurprisingly, the
objects that have recently undergone infall (i.e. < 2 Gyr) are mostly
located on the infalling branch at high cluster-centric radii. There
are a small number of objects that already reside within the cluster
in these panels, which are suspected to be spurious effects resulting
from MergerTreemislabelling the cluster main progenitor branch.
In the next three panels, that show objects that underwent infall 2-5
Gyr ago, we see that the infalling branch is well established. By 2-3
Gyr, objects are starting to accrete onto 𝑅200 of the cluster and by
4-5 Gyr, the backsplash population is well defined. In the final three
panels, the infalling branch starts to diminish at high cluster-centric
radii. By 6-7 Gyr, it seems as though nearly all objects have made
their first passage, and any objects infalling at this stage are on their
second, or above, re-entry. The virialised parts of these planes are
well established. For the most part, our results are consistent with"
"those in Oman et al. (2013). However, we do note that the infalling
branch around the clusters in the sample takes longer to disappear;
the branch in Oman et al. (2013) is gone by 4-5 Gyr, but for our
objects it becomes indistinct at 6-7 Gyr. Alongside this, we see
backsplash objects reach much higher cluster-centric distances than
those in Oman et al. (2013) (a detailed analysis of the backsplash
population of a similar sample to the one used here can be found
in Haggar et al. 2020). We note that the host masses in Oman et al.
(2013) have a mass > 1014ℎ−1M� , which are comparable to our
sample. However, the analysis done in Oman et al. (2013) uses a
different definition of halo radius, namely 𝑅360𝑏 , the radius at which
the density drops below 360𝜌bg, where 𝜌bg = ΩM𝜌crit is the back-
ground matter density of the Universe at a given redshift 𝑧, and ΩM
the matter density parameter. This difference in the volume defini-
tion (i.e. 𝑅200c ∼ 0.8𝑅360b) might explain the difference between
the lifetime of the infalling branch of our sample compared to the
one found in Oman et al. (2013)."
"To study how an object’s gas-loss since infall is related to the
time-since-infall, we present in Fig. 6 the same distribution as in
Fig. 5, but now coloured by the median fractional gas-loss in each
bin. Fig. 6 shows that objects, on average, lose nearly all of their gas
at ∼ 1.5𝑅200 (marked with a vertical pink dash-dotted line), which
agrees with the instantaneous gas fractions presented in Arthur et al.
(2019). In this case though, as we now have the orbital histories of
each object at our disposal, we can confirm that nearly all infalling
objects, by the time they reach ∼ 1.5 since they entered the infall
region, lose all their gas."
"In the top-middle and top-right panels, recent infalling objects
have lost little gas at high cluster-centric radii, with the exception
of the very dynamic pre-processing candidates. In the following
three panels though, where the infalling and backsplash branches
are more distinct, objects seem to have lost more of their gas. As
soon as 2−4Gyr since infall, objects have reached the characteristic
radius where the majority of gas-loss is encountered: ∼ 1.5−2𝑅200.
In these panels the backsplash population starts to become more
distinct, but one can see that the objects forming this region have
lost all of their gas. In the final three panels, which shows the objects
with the latest infall, nearly all objects have lost all of their gas, with
the exception of a small sample of objects that are still on their first
infall. We also identify a correlation between the velocity of the
objects and their gas-loss fraction: as best seen in the phase-space
distribution of the objects with a time-since-infall within 3 Gyrs
(top-middle, top-right, and middle-left panels), the faster they infall
towards the main cluster halo, the higher their gas-loss fraction,
likely due to the higher ram-pressure these objects experience as
their infall velocity increases."
"From Fig. 6 we find that objects within the ∼ 1.5𝑅200 region
have always lost ∼ 100 per cent of their gas, on average, regard-
less of their time-since-infall. This suggests that gaseous disruption
in this region is mostly environmental and not driven by secular
processes. Moreover, we also find that an object’s gas-loss in the
infall region is driven by its time-since-infall; the longer an object
spends in the infall region, the more fractional gas-loss it will un-
dergo. One plausible explanation for this is that more intermediary
environments, such as groups and filaments, need longer to strip an
object’s gas and therefore a trend with time is more easily seen in the
infall region. However, a higher time-since-infall will presumably
correspond to an older object, which is more likely to be affected
by secular processes in that region."
"To examine how haloes and subhaloes lose their gas differently
since crossing 4𝑅200, we use the fractional gas-loss information for
the population of objects at 𝑧 = 0 to construct separate probability"

"become even starker. Haloes that have spent 0−1Gyr within the in-
fall region are generally gas-rich and have retainedmost of their gas;
many have lost less than ∼ 20 per cent of their initial gas at infall. In
contrast, the subhalo distributions are much more gas-depleted in
this panel, even when considering subhaloes in sub-dominant envi-
ronments. From Fig. 7 and Fig. 4, if we consider all the subhaloes in
the sample, they lose their gas faster and further out from the cluster
than haloes. Otherwise, they follow similar radial gas-loss trends.
Interestingly, in the following panels, which show the objects with
earlier infall times (i.e. that spent more time in the infall region),
subhaloes lose their gas as a function of time-since-infall, but they
are not fully depleted until 6 − 7 Gyr, which is almost as long as
the halo population. In fact, by 7 − 8 Gyr, nearly all haloes and the
whole subhalo population have lost all of their gas."
"3.4 How subhalo gas-loss relates to both cluster-centric
distance and time spent in the host environment"
"Subhaloes generally lose more gas further from the cluster and
sooner than haloes would. As seen in Fig. 4, their radial trend is
dominated by subhaloes in cluster-mass host haloes. Once separated
from the full population, subhaloes in sub-dominant environments
(e.g. group-mass haloes or filaments) follow similar radial gas-loss
relations as haloes. Barring any artificial effects, this suggests that
subhaloes are being stripped off their gas before they reach 𝑅200. In
this section we examine this closely by investigating how subhalo
fractional baryonic mass is lost as a function of time spent in differ-
ent host haloes. By analysing the orbital histories of our objects and
only considering the times atwhich they became subhaloes of haloes
in the infall region, we can classify those parts of their histories by
the mass of their host haloes, their cluster-centric radius at the time,"
"and the time they spent in the host environment7. This is first pre-
sented in Fig. 8, which shows how subhalo gas-loss correlates with
the aforementioned properties. In order to construct these trends, we
use the orbital histories of the objects in the sample to record when
an object accretes onto another object in the infall region to become
a subhalo, and its initial gas mass at that time. The evolution of the
subhalo gas content is tracked from that point onwards to construct
temporal trends. Due to the fact that host haloes will accumulate
mass over time, we use the mean host halo mass during the tracking
time window. Likewise, this is done for cluster-centric distance8.
In order to control for subhalo mass, subhaloes are only tracked in
host halo environments if they have an initial mass at the time they
became subhaloes that is 1011ℎ−1M� ≤ 𝑀200 ≤ 1012ℎ−1M� . The
shaded regions show the 1𝜎 errors on the median in each time bin,
calculated by boostrap re-sampling."
"Analysing each radial bin, we find that subhaloes lose their gas
more quickly within higher mass host haloes. In the highest cluster-
centric distance bin (bottom-right), subhaloes in group-mass host
haloes (green) essentially lose all of their gas by ∼ 1 Gyr, but for
subhaloes residing in the lowest host mass bin (blue) it takes ∼ 4
Gyr to lose half their initial gas. Although we only examine the
gas here, this is consistent with work done in Wetzel et al. (2012);
Bahé & McCarthy (2015); Roberts & Parker (2017) and Cora et al."
"7 Note that the time spent in a host halo environment differs from the time-
since-infall of an object, which exclusively refers to the crossing of the 4𝑅200
radius of the main cluster halo.
8 It is worth mentioning that using averaged quantities might introduce a
bias in the analysis. For instance, subhaloes assigned to a radial bin might
spend half of their time within their host environment in one radial bin, and
half in the neighbouring one. We analysed this potential issue and found
that the vast majority of subhaloes remain within their assigned radial bins
for each point of the trends, with a dispersion from the mean normalised
cluster-centric distance of ∼ 0.2 − 0.3."

lower mass haloes, both prior and after their first infall, due to the
combined effect of the milder environmental disruption exerted by
low-mass host haloes, and the reduced secular quenching in low-
mass subhaloes that naturally accrete onto low-mass host haloes.
However, in contrast, when we consider where subhaloes lose 50
per cent of their gas in the first radial bin, the trends only differ
by less than a Gyr. This latter point is more consistent with Wetzel
et al. (2013), who suggest that host mass does not influence the
quenching time-scales of satellite galaxies, although their analysis
was constrained to the virial radius of the clusters. Both Wetzel
et al. (2013) and Cora et al. (2019) observed a delay in satellite
quenching after accretion onto a host, and it is possible that this
delay is consistent with our subhaloes in lower mass hosts retaining
some cold interstellar medium component of their gas. As for trends
with host mass, looking at the lowest mass hosts (blue) of Fig. 8 we
see a clear radial trend. Subhaloes lose their gas quicker in these
hosts the closer they are to the main cluster halo. Subhaloes in these
hosts in the furthest bin lose 40 per cent of their gas by ∼ 4 Gyr,
but in the closest bin they lose all of their gas by ∼ 1.5 Gyr. These
radial differences are mainly seen in the last 80 per cent of gas, as
across all bins subhaloes in the lowest mass hosts reach ∼ 20 per
cent gas-loss by ∼ 1 Gyr. These results suggest that whilst the low
mass hosts are efficient in stripping the first ∼ 20 per cent of gas,
being in closer proximity of the main cluster halo is enough for the
main cluster environment to take over and strip the remaining ∼ 80
per cent. Interestingly, no radial trends are found for group-mass or
cluster-mass hosts; they are just as efficient at removing all gas from
subhaloes at any cluster-centric radii. This is good evidence for gas
disruption of subhaloes by group environments (green-line) at high
cluster-centric distances."

"Figure 9. As in Fig. 8, but shows the fractional stellar loss of subhaloes as
a function of time spent in a host environment."
"By only examining the fractional gas-loss of subhaloes, it is
difficult to disentangle whether any lost gas is being stripped (exter-
nal processes), ejected (internal processes), or whether it is being
turned into stars over time. In light of this we next present Fig. 9,
which depicts the same information as in Fig. 8, but instead shows
the fractional stellar loss of subhaloes as they fall into hosts haloes."
"Firstly, we identify a radial trend in the stellar mass loss of
subhaloes within low-mass hosts (blue): the stellar mass loss in-
creases as we move closer to the main cluster halo. For the other
two subhalo populations, i.e. subhaloes of group-mass (green) and
of cluster-mass (red) hosts, the stellar mass loss radial trends are
fairly similar, with the exception of the innermost radial bin (top-
left panel), in which all three subhalo populations show a light
correlation between their stellar mass loss and the time spent in
their respective host environments, regardless of the mass of their
host halo. On the other hand, subhaloes residing in low-mass and
group-mass hosts display a gain of stellar mass outside the inner-
most radial bin. In the highest radial bin (bottom-right panel), there
is a ∼ 10 per cent difference in the stellar mass change between
the subhalo population of the lowest and highest host masses after
4 Gyrs inside the host environment. Nevertheless, for high-mass
hosts (red), the trends in each radial bin show no increase in stel-
lar material, and in the stacked data it seems as though the stellar
material only decreases as a function of time spent in the host envi-
ronment. These results are in partial disagreement withWetzel et al.
(2012) and Wetzel et al. (2013), who suggest that satellites are still
allowed to form stars and grow in mass before a delayed, but rapid
quenching. In our results we do not find star formation for subhaloes
residing in cluster-mass hosts. For massive galaxies, however, Cora
et al. (2019) showed that the duration of the phase following the
delay might, in fact, be of the same order of magnitude as the delay
phase."
"It is possible that the star-loss found in such subhaloes, as
opposed to the stellar gain observed in the other populations, is not
solely a consequence of a lack of star formation. Such subhaloes
might indeed form stars but stripping or ejection of stellar material
from environmental or secular processes might outweigh the star"

"formation taking place in the subhaloes, resulting in a net loss of both
gas and stellar material.We concede that the number of star particles
is less than statistically significant for some subhaloes in the sample.
As a first approximation, taking into account the cosmic baryon
fraction of our simulations, a population of subhaloes with mass
1011ℎ−1M� ≤ 𝑀200 ≤ 1012ℎ−1M� will contain between∼ 70 to∼
700 star particles. For subhaloeswith only few star particles, one star
particle being stripped from a subhalo could equate to asmuch as a∼
10 fractional star-loss, but this is presumably smoothed out by using
the stacked median in temporal bins. However, even considering
this, we do find that, on average, the stellar mass of subhaloes in
massive hosts is not increasing as a function of time spent in the
host. Therefore, we may statistically infer that subhalo gas is really
being lost by either stripping or ejection in such subhaloes, while for
subhaloes residing in group and low-mass hosts, gas-loss is boosted
by the star mass gain identified in Fig. 9. In order to differentiate
between these processes and estimate their relative importance, a
thorough tracking analysis is needed that examines the history of
each and every gas and star particle situated in infalling subhaloes."
"While we suggest that it is compelling that gas disruption
by host environments, either by sub-dominant environments or by
cluster-mass hosts, is the main cause for enhanced subhalo gas-loss
during their infall onto the main galaxy cluster, it is most likely a
mixture of actual gas disruption, secular processes and enhanced
numerical stripping of subhaloes due to inadequate resolution (van
den Bosch & Ogiya 2018; van den Bosch et al. 2018). To conclude
our analysis, we finish by investigating how subhalo gas-loss is
related to number of particles in our subhaloes. In Fig. 10 we present
the fractional gas-loss of subhaloes, as in Fig. 8, but here the trends
are split by the initial mass each subhalo has when it accretes onto
the host."
"We note that for this part of the analysis we do not make the
same initial subhalo mass cuts that we used in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9.
What is striking on first glance is that we find that group and low-
mass subhaloes retain their gas for longer in all radial bins, with
the exception of the first radial bin (top-left) in which there is no"
"apparent difference between the populations. Analysing the host
mass of these subhalo populations we confirm that larger mass
subhaloes reside in larger mass host haloes, which as seen from
Fig. 8, are more efficient environments for subhaloes to lose their
gas in. For the innermost radial bin, similar to what we found Fig. 8,
they all lose their gas at similar times. In light of this result, we
now are able to better understand the radial correlation seen in the
stellar mass change in subhaloes of group and low-mass hosts and
their cluster-centric distance in Fig. 9. One possible scenario is that,
as subhaloes within more massive hosts would accrete with larger
velocities in the high density environment of their host, the ram
pressure theywould experiencewould be greater than in comparable
subhaloes in lower mass hosts. As discussed in Cora et al. (2019),
secular processes (e.g. feedback from active galactic nuclei) play a
major role in the decline of the star formation for high-mass galaxies
both before and after their infall time, which they defined as the time
at which a galaxy becomes a satellite for the first time. As subhaloes
in group and low-mass hosts tend to be on the lower end of the
subhalo mass distribution, they are able to form stars even after 4
Gyrs since they entered their host halo environment."
"These trends lend support for these subhaloes losing gas by
physical processes, rather than any artificially enhanced stripping
due to the number of particles used to describe such subhaloes, as
otherwise one would expect these artificial effects to lead to en-
hanced stripping in the lower mass subhaloes (as we discussed in
Section 3.2). Presumably the host environment dominates this nu-
merical effect, thus more massive subhaloes lose their gas quicker,
and lower mass subhaloes retain their gas for longer, despite hav-
ing less dark matter particles. Although these trends diminish the
numerically enhanced stripping argument, they do not allow us to
differentiate on whether subhaloes are losing their gas via stripping
or secular processes, as in larger mass subhaloes one would ex-
pect more extreme feedback schemes to be implemented in order to
control stellar production."
4 CONCLUSIONS
"We used haloes from The Three Hundred project, a suite of 324
zoomed galaxy cluster simulations that extend > 5𝑅200 of the main
cluster halo, to investigate the level of gaseous disruption of infalling
objects and examine the extent of pre-processing in our simulations.
In particular, we use the orbital histories of 132 427 (sub)haloes to
identify where, when and how these objects lose their gas since
crossing into the infall region, which we define as 1 − 4𝑅200. Our
main conclusions are as follows:"
"• On average, infalling objects lose nearly all of their gas around
1.7𝑅200 in the 3D perspective and ∼ 𝑅200 in the PROJ perspective.
By constructing stacked fractional gas-loss trends as a function of
cluster-centric distance, we show that in a 3D perspective objects
lose ∼ 30 per cent of their gas at ∼ 2𝑅200 , where there is then
a dramatic increase in gas-loss until ∼ 1.7𝑅200. In the PROJ per-
spective, these trends are translated ∼ 0.7𝑅200 closer to the cluster.
Our results agree with and extend the work done in Arthur et al.
(2019), by showing that, on average, objects actually lose their gas
at a characteristic radius in the infall region. The increase of frac-
tional gas-loss with decreasing cluster-centric distance is not due to
contamination from outgoing objects, which agrees with Lotz et al.
(2019)."
"• By splitting the radial trends by subhalo status, we show that
subhaloes lose their gas much further out than haloes. ∼ 60 per
cent of gas is depleted from subhaloes by ∼ 3𝑅200 , whereas haloes"
"MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2019)"
12 Mostoghiu et. al
"only reach this level of disruption by∼ 1.7𝑅200. However, removing
subhaloes residing in cluster-mass hosts in the infall region from the
radial trends, we find that subhaloes in group-mass and low-mass
hosts follow essentially the same radial gas-loss trends as haloes,
suggesting that cluster-mass hosts environments are responsible for
removingmost of the gas observed for the whole subhalo sample. At
present, the relative importance of gas disruption (either by to sub-
dominant or cluster-mass hosts environments), secular processes
or numerically enhanced stripping of subhaloes on these results is
unclear."
"• The phase-space analysis of the objects in the sample shows
that the infalling branch is established within ∼ 1 − 3 Gyr since
the objects entered the infall region. After this time, a character-
istic gas-loss cluster-centric radius can be identified at ∼ 1.5𝑅200.
Around 4−5Gyr, the backsplash population branch becomes appar-
ent. Independent of their time since they entered the infall region,
any object within ∼ 1.5𝑅200 has lost nearly all of its gas. On the
other hand, for objects that remain outside this region, their gas-loss
fraction is dependent on the time they spent in the infall region."
"• Subhaloes lose their gas much quicker than haloes after en-
tering the infall region of the main cluster halo. Within 1 Gyr, the
subhalo population shows significant depletion of its gas. Generally
haloes retain their gas for much longer, but there is a population of
these objects that lose their gas within the first few Gyrs after infall
as well. These are either backsplash haloes or haloes that have en-
tered the characteristic radius at∼ 1.5𝑅200, but are not yet classified
as a subhalo of the cluster."
"• Subhaloes lose their gas more quickly within higher mass host
halo environments. In group-mass host haloes, the gas of subhaloes
is typically depleted by ∼ 1.5 Gyr since they became subhaloes,
whilst in Milky Way like hosts, it is typically depleted by ∼ 4 Gyr.
Our results agree with those found in Bahé & McCarthy (2015);
Roberts & Parker (2017), and Cora et al. (2019) who suggest that
higher mass hosts quench satellites quicker than low mass hosts.
However, when one only considers the first ∼ 20 per cent of subhalo
gas-loss, all host environments are nearly equally as efficient."
"• Subhaloes in group and low-mass host haloes appear to gain
stellar mass at high cluster-centric radii even after spending 4 Gyrs
within host halo environments. On the other hand, on average, sub-
haloes of cluster-mass haloes do not form stars. In fact, we find that
their stellar material slightly declines as a function of time spent
within the host. We note that this decline might not be solely the re-
sult of a lack of stellar production: it is possible that these objects are
indeed using their gas to form stars, but due to stripping or ejection
processes, stellar material can be lost in subhaloes, outweighing star
formation. This would result in a net stellar loss, despite the sub-
haloes actually forming stars. Disentangling the relative relevance
of these processes would be a primary aim for future analysis. On
the other hand, as the stellar component is significantly more bound
than the gas in a halo, we find this scenario unlikely. Our results are
in partial disagreement with Wetzel et al. (2013), who found that
there is a delay in satellite quenching once they accrete onto their
host, whereby all satellites are still allowed to form stars, and not
only the ones in group and low-mass hosts. This mass-dependent
stellar-loss trend, however, is compatible with the analysis presented
in Cora et al. (2019), who pointed that secular processes play a ma-
jor role on the decline of the star formation of high-mass galaxies,
potentially allowing galaxies with lower mass to keep forming stars."
"• Lower mass subhaloes retain their gas for longer once they
have accreted onto a host than higher mass subhaloes. This is easily
explained by the fact that massive subhaloes are in more massive
hosts, which as seen, deplete subhalo gas more efficiently, e.g. sub-"
"haloes in more massive hosts would accrete with larger velocities in
the high density environment of their host, which increases the ram
pressure they experience. These results suggest that gas depletion
in our subhalo population is driven predominately by host mass
rather than artificially enhanced numerical stripping found in recent
studies (van den Bosch & Ogiya 2018; van den Bosch et al. 2018)."
"In summary, we conclude that in the infall region, infalling
objects suffer significant gaseous disruption that correlates with
their time-since-infall and cluster-centric distance. Subhaloes suffer
more disruption further out from the main cluster halo and quicker
than the halo population, and we find that the gas-loss radial trend
is dominated by subhaloes residing in cluster-mass hosts in the
infall region. Considering only the subhaloes in group-mass and
low-mass host halo environments, we find a similar radial trend to
the halo population. We have shown that this is not solely driven
by artificially enhanced stripping due to particle number resolution.
However, as the spatial resolution of the simulation might induce an
enhanced stripping of gas particles on our objects if their intrahalo
medium is not fully resolved, we understand the characteristic radius
found in our radial gas-loss trends as an upper bound of the accretion
shock radius, rather than its actual value."
"Our results suggest that gaseous disruption in the infall region
is a combination of pre-processing and cluster quenching (for sub-
haloes within cluster-mass host haloes), and object gas depletion at
a characteristic radius that behaves as an accretion shock. However,
some questions remain and could be the subject of a future study.
For instance, a prime concern would be to investigate how environ-
mental effects alone contribute to the gas-loss of infalling objects,
by examining how (particle and mass) resolution and different sub-
grid physics affect our trends. Fortunately, The Three Hundred
has been run with multiple codes, each containing different subgrid
physics with different calibrations. Alongside this, there are 2 − 5
clusters within the sample that have been re-run with eight times
better mass resolution. By using this data, a follow-up study could
relatively easily target the question of how dominant environment
is. In addition to this, by disentangling the gaseous components
in subhaloes into the cold inter stellar medium and the hot halo,
a future study could pin down what kind of host environments are
necessary in order to exclusively strip the hot component, essentially
starving the satellite within the subhalo, and which environments
are necessary in order to disturb the cold inter stellar medium."
