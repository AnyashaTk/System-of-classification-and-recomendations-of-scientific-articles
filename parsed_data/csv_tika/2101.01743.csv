"ABSTRACT
Blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that have a relativistic jet with a small
viewing angle towards the observer. Recent results based on hadronic scenarios havemotivated
an ongoing discussion of how a blazar can produce high energy neutrinos during a flaring state
and which scenario can successfully describe the observed gamma-ray behaviour. Markarian
421 is one of the closest and brightest objects in the extragalactic gamma-ray sky and showed
flaring activity over a 14-day period in March 2010. In this work, we describe the performed
analysis of Fermi-LAT data from the source focused on the MeV range (100 MeV - 1 GeV),
and study the possibility of a contribution coming from the 𝑝𝛾 interactions between protons
and MeV SSC target photons to fit the very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission. The fit
results were compared with two leptonic models (one-zone and two-zone) using the Akaike
Information Criteria (AIC) test, which evaluates goodness-of-fit alongside the simplicity of
the model. In all cases the photohadronic model was favoured as a better fit description in
comparison to the one-zone leptonic model, and with respect to the two-zone model in the
majority of cases. Our results show the potential of a photohadronic contribution to a lepto-
hadronic origin of gamma-ray flux of blazars. Future gamma-ray observations above tens of
TeV and below 100 MeV in energy will be crucial to test and discriminate between models."

1 INTRODUCTION
"Blazars are a sub-class of radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
with a relativistic jet pointing close to our line of sight. These
objects have a highly variable spectrum and flaring states, periods
of enhanced activity on time scales that can go fromhours tomonths.
This variability makes it extremely difficult to model the broad-band
spectral energy distribution (SED) of these sources."
"Leptonic models have been used for many years to fit the SEDs
from blazars (see, for example, Bloom & Marscher (1996); Tavec-
chio et al. (1998); Sahayanathan & Godambe (2012); Aleksić et al.
(2015b)). These models consider a population of relativistic elec-
trons to be responsible for the characteristic two peaked SED of a
blazar. In this approach, the first peak (covering radio to X-rays)
can be explained by synchrotron emission; meanwhile, the second
peak (X-rays and gamma rays) may be composed of different con-
tributions coming from inverse Compton interactions between the
electrons and a photon field. One option is synchrotron-self Comp-
ton contributions (SSC) coming from the emission region inside the
jet (Maraschi et al. 1992; Dermer & Schlickeiser 1993; Sikora et al.
1994; Bloom &Marscher 1996; Tavecchio et al. 1998); another op-
tion is to consider external Compton-scattering contributions with"

"the target photons coming from the broad-line region (BLR), the
accretion disk, the dusty torus or any other external radiation field
(Böttcher et al. 2013; Finke 2018)."
"The different versions of the leptonic scenarios mentioned
above have been applied to the spectra of several objects, but the
challenging observations raise the question of whether a hadronic
component is necessary to explain the full spectrum. This idea has
once again caught the interest of the scientific community after
a possible correlation between the blazar TXS 0506+056 and a
neutrino alert (IC-170922A). On September 22nd 2017, an exten-
sive multi-wavelength campaign was triggered by the high energy
neutrino-induced muon track event. The blazar TXS 0506+056 was
reported to be 0.1◦ from the best-fitting neutrino direction by the
Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) Collaboration (Tanaka
et al. 2017). This source was in a flaring state at the time and
had a considerably brightened in the GeV band since April 2017.
After the follow-up observations, models associating neutrino and
gamma-ray production during the flaring state of the source found
the gamma-ray emission was correlated with the neutrino alert at a
statistical significance of 3𝜎 (IceCube Collaboration et al. 2018b).
In addition, the IceCube Collaboration performed an independent
analysis using prior data. The result was an excess of high energy
neutrino events coming from the direction of the source, with re-
spect to atmospheric backgrounds, at a significance level of ∼ 3.5𝜎"

"between September 2014 and March 2015 (IceCube Collaboration
et al. 2018a). These findings motivated an ongoing discussion of
how a blazar can reproduce the experimental data and which model
(or models) can successfully describe the observed behaviour (e.g.
Righi et al. (2019); Murase et al. (2018); Palladino et al. (2019);
Padovani et al. (2019); Rodrigues et al. (2019); Cerruti et al. (2019);
Petropoulou et al. (2020); Winter & Gao (2019); Liu et al. (2019);
Halzen et al. (2019))."
"The possible neutrino/gamma-ray connection exhibited be-
tween the IC-170922A alert and TXS0506+056 is onemotivation to
explore hadronic contributions, but there are other hints and plausi-
ble evidence for this scenario. The blazar 3HSP J095507.9+355101
was recently reported to be in a flaring state and 0.62◦ away from
the best-fit position of the alert IceCube200107A, a muon track
event (Giommi et al. 2020). There is also PKS B1424-418, a Flat
Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) which was in temporal and po-
sitional coincidence with a high-energy starting event (HESE) on
December 2012, a cascade-like event with a reconstructed energy
of 2 PeV but a median positional uncertainty of ∼ 16◦ that gives an
estimated ∼ 5% chance of coincidence (Kadler et al. 2016). In addi-
tion, there are several studies searching for gamma-ray counterparts
and predicting consistent limits within the IC neutrino flux so far
(Krauß et al. 2014; Krauß et al. 2015; Brown et al. 2015; Padovani
et al. 2016; Glüsenkamp 2016); the successful SED modelling of
blazars during flaring episodes using hadronic models (Mücke &
Protheroe 2001; Diltz et al. 2015; Diltz & Böttcher 2016; Sahu
et al. 2017, 2018a,b); and hadronic emission has been proposed as
an explanation for the spectral hardening in TeV energy gamma-ray
spectra, behaviour which has been observed in some blazars (e.g.
W Comae, 3C 66A (Böttcher et al. 2013), 1ES 0229+200 (Tavec-
chio et al. 2009), 1ES 1101-232 and H 2356-309 (Aharonian et al.
2006))."
"Hadronic scenarios propose that protons are accelerated to
relativistic energies in blazar jets. A group of models invoke pho-
tohadronic (𝑝𝛾) interactions, which involve collisions between the
high energy protons and a target photon field. Another option is
hadronuclear interactions (𝑝𝑝), where a matter target such as a
gas cloud is required. Both scenarios lead to photo-meson produc-
tion, from which gamma rays and neutrinos are generated in the
decay process. The decay products will also emit radiation, includ-
ing proton-synchrotron emission, photo-pion production, electron-
positron synchrotron triggered pair cascades, or even synchrotron
from the charged decay products (muons and pions). Depending
on the hadronic model, the physical conditions and chosen param-
eters, there might be a dominant component, for instance proton-
synchrotron radiation (Mücke et al. 2003; Dimitrakoudis et al. 2012)
or photo-pion production (Mannheim&Biermann 1992;Mannheim
1993)."
"In the hadronuclear models, 𝑝𝑝 interactions can occur, if the
high energy protons accelerated along the jet reach a matter target,
for example the gas clouds in the broad line region (BLR) around
the AGN (Dar & Laor 1997; Araudo et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2019).
This process has a lower interaction cross section compared to the
prominent Δ−resonance of the photohadronic process, so a high
density target is required to improve the efficiency of the hadronic
interactions."
"If a model considers mixed contributions from hadronic and
leptonic origin, then it can also be referred as lepto-hadronic (includ-
ing some of the previously given examples: Araudo et al. (2010);
Diltz & Böttcher (2016); Rodrigues et al. (2019); Cerruti et al.
(2019); Petropoulou et al. (2020); Liu et al. (2019); among others)."
"In this work, we test the potential of a dominant photohadronic"
"contribution within a lepto-hadronic scenario to fit the very high
energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations (E > 100 GeV) during a
flaring blazar state. We account for the 𝑝𝛾 interactions through the
Δ−resonance approximation; the subsequent decay products include
gamma rays and neutrinos in the following way:"
"𝑝 + 𝛾 → Δ+ →
{"
"𝑝𝜋0, 𝜋0 → 𝛾𝛾
𝑛𝜋+, 𝜋+ → `+a` , `+ → 𝑒+ + a𝑒 + ā` ."
"The Δ+ particle decays into (𝑝 + 𝜋0) in 2/3 of all cases while
goes to (𝑛+𝜋+) in 1/3 of all cases (Hümmer et al. 2010). The model
considered is described in Section 5 and a broader discussion of
the Δ−resonance can be found in Mücke et al. (1999); Gaisser et al.
(1995)."
"The blazar Markarian 421 (Mrk 421; RA=66.114◦,
Dec=38.209◦, z=0.031) is one of the closest and brightest objects in
the extragalactic VHE sky. It was the first extragalactic source de-
tected using Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs)
(Punch et al. 1992) and has been regularly monitored since then.
Mrk 421 has been measured during flaring states on several occa-
sions (e.g. Błażejowski et al. (2005); Abdo et al. (2011); Aleksić
et al. (2015a,b)), and the recorded multi-wavelength (MWL) data
from radio to high energy gamma rays makes it an ideal candidate
to test different production mechanisms and their evolution during a
flare. The 2010 flaring activity fromMrk 421 (Aleksić et al. 2015b)
provides a rich dataset. We performed an analysis in the MeV en-
ergy range (100 MeV-1 GeV) with the updated instrument response
functions (IRFs) from the Fermi-LAT to obtain an input seed pho-
ton spectrum to a photohadronic model that could provide a good
fit to the VHE gamma-ray data."
"This paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we review
the 2010 flare, in Section 3 we describe the Fermi-LAT analysis
undertaken, and in Section 4 we describe the results of that analysis.
Section 5 describes the photohadronic model and the method used
to fit this to the data, and Section 6 describes the results of this
fit. Finally, we discuss our results in Section 7 and conclude in
Section 8."
2 FLARING ACTIVITY IN 2010
"Mrk 421 exhibited flaring activity over a 14-day period in 2010
from March 10 to March 22 (MJD 55264-55277). At the time,
a multi-instrument campaign was performed which included the
gamma-ray space telescope Fermi-LAT and three IACTs: the Major
Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope
system, the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array Sys-
tem (VERITAS) and the Whipple gamma-ray telescope."
"MAGIC took 11 observations in stereoscopic mode with ex-
posure times ranging from 10 to 80 min each, which led to 4.7 h of
good-quality data with a zenith angle range of 5◦ − 30◦. The data
collected were taken in dark conditions and were not affected by
moonlight, but the data recorded on MJD 55272 and 55275 suf-
fered from bad weather and were therefore removed from the MWL
observations (Aleksić et al. 2015b). For more details on theMAGIC
telescope system see Aleksić et al. (2012)."
"VERITAS monitored the source on MJD 55260, 55265, and
55267-55274 with a 10 min run per day. The observations were
performed at zenith angles 18◦ − 23◦ to benefit from the lowest
possible energy threshold. Further information about the VERITAS
instrument can be found in Perkins et al. (2009)."
TheWhipple telescope performed 10 observations in ON/OFF
"MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2020)"
Photohadronic modelling of Mrk 421 3
"and TRK (tracking) modes (Pichel 2009), lasting from one to six
hours each on MJD 55267-55271 and MJD 55273-55277. The
dataset collected for this flaring period amounts to 36 h. More
information and details about the Whipple telescope can be found
in Kildea et al. (2007)."
"TheVHEgamma-ray data from ground based IACTs published
in Aleksić et al. (2015b) were used to test a possible dominant con-
tribution from photohadronic interactions. In this paper, we focus on
the modelling of the VHE gamma-ray observations. In this case, the
Fermi analysis and the IACT datawere the two key elements needed,
and data from other wavelengths were not critical for our calcula-
tions (see Aleksić et al. (2015b) for a full description of the MWL
observations). The light curves fromMAGIC, VERITAS andWhip-
ple above 200GeV are shown in Figure 1. In terms of simultaneity of
the data, the shorter observation times of the IACTs are embedded
in the 2-day bins period defined for the Fermi analysis, noting that
there is a 7-h time difference between the VERITAS/Whipple and
MAGIC observations due to their different longitudes. The variabil-
ity reported in the gamma-ray data corresponds to daily changes in
the VHE emission; no intra-night variability was reported on the
days studied."
"The photohadronic model does not aim to describe the whole
SED with purely hadronic components. This approach relies on a
standard leptonic scenario to explain the low energy peak of the
SED and provide seed photons for the 𝑝𝛾 interactions. To describe
the blob from which the gamma-ray photons are produced, we have
adopted the values of the physical parameters in the one-zone model
of Aleksić et al. (2015b) relating to magnetic field, Doppler factor
and the radius of the emission region. These parameters are fixed
during the flaring events, and the evolution of the spectral parameters
provides snapshots on the different days considered for modelling."
"Mrk 421 was highly active during other months in 2010, and
theVERITASCollaboration reported another flare in February 2010
(MJD 55234-55240), the brightest ever observed from this object in
VHE gamma rays (Abeysekara et al. 2020). They concluded that the
time variability of the source is difficult to explain using a single-
zone SSC model. This result provides another motivation to try to
extend the current models and look for hadronic contributions."
3 FERMI ANALYSIS
"Launched in June 2008, the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board
the Fermi satellite is a pair conversion telescope covering the energy
range from 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV. The LAT’s combination
of a wide field of view (FoV ' 2.4 sr) and large effective area allows
it to scan the entire gamma-ray sky approximately every 3 hours (At-
wood et al. 2009). The data analysis described here was performed
with the Pass8v6 version of the IRF and the v11r5p3 Science Tools
software with Fermipy (Wood et al. 2017). This IRF provides a full
reprocessing of the entire mission dataset, including improved event
reconstruction, a wider energy range, better energy measurements,
and significantly increased effective area in comparison to previous
versions. As a result, we were able to extend our analysis into a
lower energy range than previously possible, resulting in a more
comprehensive spectrum of the source during the flaring period."
"The Fermipy package provides a set of tools and an interface
(GTAnalysis) to perform the data preparation, modelling, statistics
and analysis tasks. The 4FGL-DR2 catalog (Abdollahi et al. 2020),
containing the positions and spectral information of the known
gamma-ray sources, was used during the analysis."
"Our data reduction steps considered all ‘SOURCE’1 class
events photons in an energy range of 100 MeV to 1 GeV between
2010 March 9th to 22nd (MJD 55264-55277). The flaring period
studiedwas divided into shorter 2-day intervals; this time periodwas
the minimum to obtain enough photon events to calculate the SED
points and upper limits. The Fermi-LAT data are publicly-available
and were downloaded from the LAT data server system2."
"The analysis was performed inside a 15◦ region of interest
(RoI) around Mrk 421’s coordinates, a 90◦ zenith cut angle was
applied to avoid gamma rays coming from Earth’s atmosphere. The
gamma-ray data were then binned using 5 bins per decade in en-
ergy and 0.1◦ spatial bin size. To remove sub-optimal data, only
the events within good time intervals (GTI) were analysed, these
were selected by the ‘gtmktime’ tool filters ‘(DATA_QUAL>0) &&
(LAT_CONFIG==1)’ and a cut above 52◦ in rocking angle."
"A model consisting of gamma-ray point sources and a back-
ground with a Galactic diffuse and an extragalactic component was
employed. All the sources listed in the 4FGL catalog inside a 20◦
neighbourhood from the centre of the ROI were included; this was
to account for the possible contributions of sources near the edge of
our ROI. The spatial model, position and spectral parameters of the
sources were adopted from the 4FGL catalog. The Galactic diffuse
emission component used in the model was ‘gll_iem_v06.fits’3.
The extragalactic gamma-ray contribution coming from unresolved
extragalactic sources, and residual (misclassified) cosmic-ray emis-
sionwas also included as an isotropic spectral template parametrised
in the file ‘iso_P8R2_SOURCE_V6_v06.txt’3. In the 4FGL cata-
log, Mrk 421 (4FGL J1104.4+3812) is listed as a source with a
log-parabola (LP) spectrum type. However, over the short time in-
tervals which we are considering, there were not sufficient photon
statistics to allow a log-parabola model to be distinguished from
a power-law (PL) model, so the latter was adopted. The spectral
models should not differ significantly in the range of interest for our
analysis and the SED extrapolation below 100 MeV."
"A maximum likelihood method4 was used for fitting the ROI;
the spectral shape parameters of the sources were left free to vary
within a 5◦ radius around the ROI’s centre. The two background
components were also left free to vary during the maximum like-
lihood fitting. The sources in the model that were considered in-
significant (TS < 1) were discarded. A second optimisation and fit
steps were applied to the ROI using the new model with the same
free components and criteria used before."
"To check for any point sources inside the ROI which are not
listed in the 4FGL catalog, the ‘find_sources’ routine built within
Fermipy was implemented. No significant extra source candidates
(TS>16) were found during the analysis."
"The SED points for each 2-day bin were calculated using the
‘sed()’ tool included in Fermipy, which performs an independent
maximum likelihood fit per energy bin for the flux normalisation.
In our analysis, the energy range studied (100 MeV to 1 GeV) was
split into 5 evenly spaced log-energy bins. The same analysis steps
described above were applied to each 2-day interval in the flaring"

4 FERMI RESULTS
"The Fermi analysis was done with the purpose of characterising the
seed photon spectrum of the source using an extrapolation below the
100MeVenergy range. In the assumed scenario, the seed photons for
the 𝑝𝛾 interactions are expected to be between 2 and 168 MeV (see
Section 5.1). For the Fermi analysis, we selected a photon energy
range from 100 MeV (the recommended starting energy) and up
to 1 GeV, then extrapolate to the lower energy range of interest.
Using the updated version of the IRFs, the shortest time bins which
allowed the spectrum to be obtained were 2-days in length."
"As discussed in the previous section, the spectrum in the MeV
range was characterised using a PL model:"
"dN
d𝜖𝛾"
"= 𝑁PL𝜖
−^
𝛾 , (2)"
"where the normalisation constant 𝑁PL and the spectral index ^ act
as free parameters that were optimised to get the best-fit values. The
PL description was then used to extend the spectrum below 100
MeV. The spectra of the source alongside the PL extrapolation are
shown in Figure 2 for the selected bins."
"The spectral parameters of the days on which the source was
detected significantly (TS>25) are shown in Table 1 and the cor-"
"responding light curves from our Fermi analysis and in the VHE
energy range are shown in Figure 1. This analysis extends the pre-
vious results by Aleksić et al. (2015b), which started at 300 MeV
rather than 100 MeV. There are no significant flux changes in the
VHE band in the combined 2-day bins which we used for the Fermi
analysis and subsequent modelling. The remaining days presented
low photon statistics andwere not considered for further VHEfitting
with the photohadronic model. In order to get our final result, the
gamma-ray spectrum of the source was studied in the MeV energy
range, with the fitted spectrum serving as an input for the photo-
hadronicmodelling. The time bins in our analysis and that ofAleksić
et al. (2015b) coincide; however, the extended spectrum analysed
with the updated IRF allowed us to calculate a PL extrapolation in
our range of interest."
"Once the MeV region is characterised, the input seed photon
spectrum for the photohadronic model can be expressed as"
"Φinput = 𝜖
2
𝛾"
"dN
d𝜖𝛾"
"= 𝑁PL𝜖
−^+2
𝛾 . (3)"
"The uncertainty of the seed photon spectrum will impact on the
optimisation process of the other free parameters within the model
(𝛼 and 𝐴𝛾 , see section 5.1) and therefore the final fitting result."
"Alongside the spectral parameters, the light curve of Mrk 421
during the flaring period (MJD 55264-55277) was calculated using
the photons in the MeV energy range (100 MeV to 1 GeV), also
using 2-day temporal bins (see top of Figure 1). The data reduction
steps described in the previous section were followed to prepare,
optimise and fit the ROI."
"The light curve was generated using the ‘gta.lightcurve’
method within Fermipy, which performs a likelihood fit for each
time bin. An optimised region of 15 degrees was considered in the
energy range of 100MeV to 1 GeVwith 5 bins per decade in energy.
The average photon flux for Mrk 421 was 1.67 ± 0.28 × 10−7 ph
cm−2 s−1. For each significant bin (TS>25), the gamma-ray flux is
reported in the third column of Table 1, in bins where the TS value
was below 25 we present upper limits."
"5 PHOTOHADRONIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE
FLARES"
"In the lepto-hadronic scenario we consider, a one-zone leptonic
model is assumed to contribute to the SED via electron synchrotron
and SSC radiation; this is a standard leptonic interpretation. The
low-energy peak from the SED comes from the synchrotron com-
ponent of leptonic origin, while the SSC component is assumed to
provide the target photon field in the MeV range. For the photo-
hadronic contribution to arise, it is hypothesised that protons are
accelerated into the single spherical emission region of radius 𝑅′f
(flaring blob), with a tangled magnetic field 𝐵, propagating along
the jet with a velocity 𝛽Γ𝑐 and an associated bulk Lorentz factor Γ.
The jet forms a small angle \ with respect to the line of sight, which
results in a Doppler boosting characterised by the Doppler factor
D. It is proposed that during the flaring episode, the blazar pos-
sesses a dense, compact inner jet structure (Ghisellini et al. 2005;
Marscher et al. 2008, 2010; MacDonald et al. 2015; Homan et al.
2015; Walker et al. 2016). Geometrically this represents a double
conical shape, with a compact and smaller region enclosed by the
jet along its axis (for a schematic view see Figure 1 in Sahu et al.
(2016)). The inner compact region has a photon density 𝑛′"
"𝛾,f , which
is much higher than the outer region 𝑛′𝛾 , this helps to increase the
efficiency of the photohadronic interactions. The prime notation is"

range will serve as targets for the interaction to get a TeV energy

sive review of the photohadronic flaring model can be found in Sahu
et al. (2012, 2013)."

for interaction and corresponds to the production of the particle at
rest. Above this energy threshold, the cross-section of the process is
enhanced and this decay channel becomes dominant over other com-
ponents. At its peak, the cross-section of the Δ−resonance reaches
a value of 𝜎peak ∼ 500 `barn, which is ∼ 5 × 10−28cm2, being

simplicity, it is assumed that the internal jet region and the external

5.2 Contribution to Mrk 421’s Flare
"During the 2010 flaring period of Mrk 421, the VHE data recorded
by the IACTs lies in an energy range of 80 GeV to 5 TeV (Aleksić
et al. 2015b). The energy relation from the Equation 8 indicates
that the seed photon energy in the 𝑝𝛾 interaction is between 2 and
168 MeV (in the observer’s reference frame). The reduction in the
source flux combined with the low sensitivity of the LAT below
100 MeV are an impediment to obtaining precise measurements at
these energies, and therefore we use the results obtained in Section
4 to estimate the flux coming from the seed photons (Φinput (𝜖𝛾)).
The PL input is shown on Figure 2."
"The energy range of the seed photons and the threshold con-
dition for the Δ−resonance can be used to estimate proton energy.
From Equation 7, we have that 𝐸p ∼ 10𝐸𝛾 in the observer’s ref-
erence frame; if measured from Earth, these high energy protons,
boosted by the blazar’s jet, will be detected in an energy range of
∼ 800 GeV to 50 TeV, which corresponds in the emission region ref-
erence frame to ∼ 40 GeV < 𝐸 ′p < 2.45 TeV. This is the energy range
of the protons to reach the threshold condition for the Δ−resonance."
"The emission region has some physical parameters (magnetic
field,Doppler factor, radius of the spherical blob)which are the same
as those used in the calculation of the photohadronic component.
These are fixed parameters taken from the one-zone emission region
leptonic model of Aleksić et al. (2015b) and are: magnetic field of
𝐵 = 38 mG, a Doppler factor D = 21 and a radius of the emission
region log10 (𝑅′f [cm]) = 16.72. The variability reported in Aleksić
et al. (2015b) corresponds to daily changes in the VHE emission, a
time scale which in principle is related to the proton injection. The"

6 MODEL FIT RESULTS
"The best-fit value parameters for the photohadronic fit (𝐴𝛾 , 𝛼)
are given in Table 2. The photohadronic component (𝑝𝛾 model)
for the best-fit values is shown as a magenta continuous curve in
Figure 3; the one-zone leptonic model from Aleksić et al. (2015b)
(SSC model) is shown as a dash-dot black line, and the two-zone
model (two-zone SSC) used in the same paper is represented by a
dashed red line. The two-zone SSC model assumes one quiescent
blob producing the steady emission, and a smaller independent blob
responsible for the temporal evolution of the SED (flaring blob).
The VHE energy points in Figure 3 are a combination from the
IACT observations during the flare (MAGIC and VERITAS, see
section 2)."
"To compare quantitatively thesemodels, we perform anAkaike
Information Criterion (AIC) test (Akaike 1974), which can be used
to determine if a model fit is significantly better than another (Harris
et al. 2014; Bozdogan 1987; Forster 2000). The AIC takes into
account both the goodness of the fit, and the simplicity of the model.
This is done by assessing the likelihood and the number of free
parameters adopted, AIC is defined as:"
"AICs = −2𝑙𝑛(𝐿s) + 2𝑘fs , (15)"
"where 𝐿s is the likelihood of the model used and 𝑘fs is the number
of free parameters in the model. In our optimisation process, the
𝜒2 statistic was used to obtain our best-fit results and is adopted as
our likelihood function. Most of the parameters used in the photo-
hadronic model are fixed. There are 4 free parameters considered
within the model, which vary to fit the daily VHE observations: 2
from the PL input of the seed photons and 2 from the calculation of
the gamma-ray flux 𝐹𝛾 from the photohadronic component."
"According toAleksić et al. (2015b), 11 parameterswere used in
the one-zone leptonic model, 9 of which come from a broken power-
law function (with two breaks) in the electron energy distribution
required to satisfactorily describe the SED during the flaring period.
From these, 5 parameters were left free to vary during the flaring
days and the rest were fixed. For the two-zone leptonic model,
20 parameters were used to describe the SED. After fixing the
parameters of the quiescent blob, only 4 parameters were left free
to vary in the flaring blob. We use the number of free parameters in
each model to calculate the corresponding AIC value."
"The AIC is based on a theoretical framework within informa-
tion theory and provides a way to evaluate both the simplicity and
accuracy of the model fits. The difference between the AIC of two
models p,q is expressed as:"
"ΔAICp,q = AICp − AICq . (16)"
"The AIC difference enables the models considered to be com-
pared and ranked. The model with the lowest AIC represents the
best description of the empirical data available. Any model compar-
ison with aΔAICp,q > 2 above theminimal AIC value is considered
significantly worse (Burnham&Anderson 2001; Lewis et al. 2011)."
"A direct comparison through the AIC difference test between
the 𝑝𝛾 model and the two leptonic models considered is shown on
Table 2. Among the IACTs observations from the 2010 flaring pe-
riod from which we were able to fit a spectrum (Figure 3), we found
that the photohadronic fit was the preferred model in 3 out of 5 cases
according to the AIC comparison test. On one day (MJD 55266), the
two-zone SSC model has the minimum AIC by a large difference
with respect to the other models. Meanwhile on MJD 55274, the
AIC test was inconclusive, as no difference larger than 2 was found
between the 𝑝𝛾 and the two-zone SSC model."
"In all cases, the comparison of the 𝑝𝛾 model with the one SSC
model results in a ΔAICSSC,p𝛾 > 2, which means the 𝑝𝛾 model is
favoured over the one-zone SSCmodel and represents a significantly
better fit (Table 2). Nevertheless, this does not necessarily means
that the 𝑝𝛾 model fits all the datasets well."
"During the first days of the observations (MJD 55264-67) the
source was in its maximum emission state. The gamma-ray flux
detected, as shown in Table 1 for the seed photon spectrum reaches
a peak on this day, and the spectral index associated is also the
highest at ^ ∼ 2.2. This behaviour also relates to the optimised
free parameters (𝛼 and 𝐴𝛾) which presents their maximum values
during these couple of days."
"The fitting for MJD 55266 presents a large difference between
the calculated AIC values, the two-zone SSC resulting in the lowest
AIC and therefore favoured as the best fit for data from this day.
The SSC model over-predicts the VHE flux just above 100 GeV,
whereas the 𝑝𝛾 model over-predicts the flux above the TeV energy
limit and is flatter below that point, thus underestimating the flux
peak. Neither of these two models represent a good fit to the data,
which is reflected in the AIC difference between them and the two-
zone SSC model."
"On the following day (MJD 55267), using the corresponding
PL input to calculate the photohadronic contribution, the overall
behaviour of the VERITAS observations can be fitted with the 𝑝𝛾
model, but the PL behaviour from the input takes over if extended
below 100 GeV and predicts an increase in flux; this is a non-
physical effect that is outside our validity range and represents a"
"MNRAS 000, 1–11 (2020)"
8 A. Rosales de León et al.
"caveat of the model. Nonetheless, the 𝑝𝛾 model scored the lowest
AIC value among the 3 models and the difference in this day is
enough to consider it the best fit."
"For the final days of the flaring period (MJD 55274 to 55277)
three days of VHE data were available, there being no VHE ob-
servations on MJD 55275. The PL spectral parameters used as an
input for the 𝑝𝛾 model are very similar for these 3 days. The spectral
index during this period is ^ ∼ 1.1 and the power index of the proton
spectrum is around 𝛼 ∼ 2.2 − 2.3."
"During this later part of the flaring period, the lowest AIC
values found were from the 𝑝𝛾 model, indicating these are the best
fits to the datasets and ranking the model as the preferred option on
MJD 55276 and 55277."
"On MJD 55274 the three models predict a similar flux in the
100 GeV to 1 TeV range, but the photohadronic contribution differs
at higher energies where it is expected a larger contribution. This
is the only day on which the models were tested with data from
both MAGIC and VERITAS, although the 𝑝𝛾 model reached the
lowest value from the three, the AIC difference with the two-zone
SSC model was not significant enough (ΔAICSSC,p𝛾 > 2) for the
𝑝𝛾 model to be selected as the preferred model, therefore this day
is listed as inconclusive in Table 2."
"On MJD 55276, the photohadronic model is able to reproduce
accurately the VHE gamma-ray data and has the lowest AIC in
the period studied. In contrast, the SSC model over-predicts the
MAGIC observations, and although the two-zone SSC is a better
approximation to the data, the AIC difference in favour of the 𝑝𝛾
model is enough to select it as the preferred model."
"On the final day studied (MJD 55277) both leptonic models
are a good approximation to the data; nevertheless, the 𝑝𝛾 model
results in a much lower AIC value due to the accuracy of the fit
and its simplicity (in terms of free parameters), remaining as the
preferred model. The behaviour of the 𝑝𝛾 model and the influence
of the PL input approximation will be discussed in the next section."
7 DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
"The fits obtained using the 𝑝𝛾 model over the flaring period are a
significantly better description of the VHE data than a purely one-
zone leptonic model, due to a combination of the fit quality obtained
and the simplicity of the model in terms of the approximations used
and the number of free parameters adopted. The two-zone SSC
model is more competitive, being selected as the preferred model
on MJD 55266 and scoring a similar AIC value to 𝑝𝛾 model on
MJD 55274. It is worth noting that for the AIC calculation we are
using an optimistic estimation of the number of free parameters in
the leptonic models, following Aleksić et al. (2015b) in which only
4 (5) from a total of 20 (11) parameters are considered as free for
the two-zone (one-zone) SSC leptonic model during the flaring."
"An interesting feature is that the best fits for a photohadronic
contribution are obtained in the last 4 days of the flare. In a more
complex hadronic scenario, besides the photo-pion production,
there is gamma-ray radiation emitted by proton-synchrotron cooling
and the synchrotron radiation of the secondary charged particles.
These hadronically induced gamma rays are usually in competi-
tion with synchrotron and inverse Compton photons radiated by
primary electrons considered in the usual leptonic model (Rachen
& Mészáros 1998). On some days the hadronic component could
be dominant at VHE and then followed by a dominant SSC lep-
tonic component. If the proton injection occurs randomly, there is
no preferred time for this to happened during the flare. The in-"
"terplay between these mechanisms could lead to a time-dependent
model with a dominant component at VHE (Diltz & Böttcher 2016;
Dimitrakoudis et al. 2012). The current stage of the model relies
on the leptonic contributions to provide the target photon field at
MeV energies (presumably the SSC component) and ignores other
hadronic components based on the dominant process of photo-pion
production through the Δ−resonance. This work aims to be a first
step into a more comprehensive lepto-hadronic modelling of flaring
blazars."
"A common problem with hadronic modelling is the high pro-
ton energy required to produce the observed gamma-ray emission.
However, in this case the high frequency of the seed photos con-
sidered in the 𝑝𝛾 interactions lowers the energy threshold for the
accelerated protons to 40 GeV < 𝐸 ′p < 2.45 TeV in the comoving
frame (the emission region), which is below the extreme energies
considered in other hadronic models (Mannheim&Biermann 1992;
Mücke et al. 2003). This feature from the 𝑝𝛾 model can be consid-
ered an advantage that would facilitate the conditions for objects like
blazars to produce VHE gamma rays and neutrinos from hadronic
interactions. Using the Hillas criterion (Hillas 1984; Ptitsyna &
Troitsky 2010; Meli et al. 2008) with the considered parameters of
the emission region (𝐵, D, 𝑅′f), a proton could be accelerated up
to 𝐸 ′p,max ∼ 650 TeV at the source, more than sufficient for the 𝑝𝛾
model to produce the VHE gamma-ray emission."
"An interesting feature of the 𝑝𝛾model (Figure 3) is the increase
of the energy flux above TeV energies. This is where the one-zone
SSC model and the 𝑝𝛾 model differ and needs to be tested in future
observations. The forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA)
(CTA Consortium et al. 2019) will be critical to differentiating
between these scenarios. The expected sensitivity and capabilities of
the CTA observatories will enable detection of the gamma-ray flux
from Mrk 421 and other near blazars with unprecedented accuracy
and instantaneous sensitivity above tens of TeV in energy."
"CTA will also take part in the Neutrino Target of Opportunity
(NToO) program to look for gamma-ray counterparts to neutrino
alerts in follow-up observations. The large field-of-view (FoV) and
the rapidly re-position capabilities of CTA’s telescopes working
alongside the real time alert program from IceCube (Blaufuss et al.
2019) look very promising for the upcoming years. A more detailed
discussion of the current work and development of the NToO for
CTA can be found in Satalecka et al. (2020)."

spectrum using the effective areas 𝐴eff (𝐸a) of the 59-strings con-
figuration (IC-59) operating in 2010 (Aartsen et al. 2013; Halzen
& Hooper 2005), we can set an upper limit of 𝑁events < 0.14 for
the expected number neutrino events that would have been detected
during the Mrk 421 flaring event. While in this paper, we are focus-
ing on the explanation of the VHE gamma-ray emission rather than
neutrino production, the possible detection of neutrino events from
flaring blazars is an interesting topic that will be investigated in a
future work on the photohadronic contributions."
"On MJD 55267, 55274 and 55277, the photohadronic model
would behave like a PL that increases, if we extend the fit below
105 MeV. This is related to the type of seed photon input that we
are using (a PL approximation) and does not represent a realistic
physical description of the SED. This is a caveat of the current
model which is focused on the contribution of the photohadronic
component at VHE and it is not designed to extend continuously
to lower energies. A more complex input model would improve
the overall final fit but at the expense of a larger number of free
parameters. For the PL description of the seed photon spectrum,
2 free parameters were optimised over bins lasting a couple of
days due to the lack of photon statistics; this was the shortest time
period over which it was possible to obtain Fermi spectra in the
> 100 MeV energy range. The parameters 𝛼 and 𝐴𝛾 coming from
the photohadronic contribution at VHE were calculated on daily
intervals: this discrepancy between the time bins was dictated by
the differences in instantaneous sensitivity between the space and
ground-based telescopes and might affect the accuracy of the final
fit."
"The uncertainty of the seed photon spectrum impacts the opti-
misation process for the free model parameters 𝛼 and 𝐴𝛾 which are
chosen to get the best-fit values to the VHE data and therefore the
minimum AIC value for the model. Better data in the MeV energy
range (1 MeV to 100 MeV) would enable a better description of
the input seed photons and hence an improvement in the photo-
hadronic fit and more reliable predictions. On this regard, the All-
sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory (AMEGO) mission
(McEnery et al. 2019), which is planned to operate from 200 keV
to >10 GeV with ∼ 5× better angular resolution than Fermi-LAT,
would be very helpful. The combination of MeV gamma-ray photon
data with precise measurements from gamma rays in the 10s of TeV
regime would be ideal to further test hadronic emission models."
8 CONCLUSIONS
"The hadronic modelling of flaring episodes from blazars is a com-
plex challenge that has gained relevance in recent years. In this
work, the scenario of a dominant hadronic contribution in the VHE
region of the SED coming from 𝑝𝛾 interactions during the flaring
period of Mrk 421 in 2010 was studied. A photohadronic model
with 4 free parameters was used and the gamma-ray flux calcu-
lated using the Δ−resonance approximation. For the target photon
spectrum, we used a PL description estimated from an analysis per-
formed of Fermi-LAT data. The injected proton spectrum assumed
for the model was also characterised by a PL. We were able to fit
the VHE gamma-ray data with the 𝑝𝛾 model on the days with suffi-
cient photon statistics and according to the AIC test, in all cases the
𝑝𝛾 model was favoured as a better fit description than a one-zone
leptonic model, and in comparison with the two-zone SSC model,
the 𝑝𝛾 was favoured by the AIC test on 3 out of the 5 days fit-"
"ted (MJD 55267, 55276, 55277). The AIC test was inconclusive on
MJD 55274 because the difference between the 𝑝𝛾 and the two-zone
model was not meaningful. OnMJD 55266 the two-zone model was
favoured as a better description of the observations."
"Our results therefore show that a dominant contribution from
the photohadronic component can be used to successfully fit the
observations of a blazar flaring episode, which shows the potential
of including 𝑝𝛾 interactions in blazar modelling. However, other
contributions coming from leptonic processes, synchrotron emis-
sion from the charged particles in the hadronic decay chain and
cascading effects can also play an important role at VHE. These
will be investigated in future works in the search to complement our
model towards a lepto-hadronic description."
"To explore the neutrino/gamma-ray connection in the upcom-
ing years, the next generation of gamma-ray and neutrino obser-
vatories, such as CTA, AMEGO and IceCube-Gen2, will play a
crucial role; the improvements in observations at VHE and follow-
up programs will make possible to test hadronic components and
discriminate between pure leptonic and hadronic scenarios."
