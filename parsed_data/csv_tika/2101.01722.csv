"Abstract. Telescope Array (TA) experiment has recorded [1, 2] several short time"
bursts of air shower like events. These bursts are very distinct from conventional single
"showers, and are found to be strongly correlated with lightnings. In our previous"
work [3] we proposed that these bursts represent the direct manifestation of the dark
matter annihilation events within the so-called axion quark nugget (AQN) model.
In the present work we suggest to test this proposal to search for the radio signals
"in frequency band ν ∈ (0.5 − 200) MHz which must be synchronized with the TA
bursts. We argued that the conventional lightning-induced radio emission can be easily"
discriminated from the AQN-induced radio pulses discussed in this work.

1. Introduction
This work is tightly linked to our recent proposal [3] interpreting the mysterious bursts
"observed by Telescope Array (TA) experiment [1, 2] in terms of the AQN annihilation"
events under the thunderstorm. These events are very unusual and cannot be interpreted
in terms of conventional single showers as reviewed below. In the present work we
shall argue that the proposed mechanism [3] in terms of the AQN annihilation events
inevitably predict the radio wave pulses which must be synchronized with TA bursts.
Based on this prediction we suggest to test our proposal by searching for the radio
"signals in frequency band ν ∈ (0.5 − 200) MHz which must be synchronized with the
TA bursts."
Such test would unambiguously support or refute the proposal because the
main arguments of the present work based on synchronization which represents pure
geometrical property of the system. This is because the radio pulse and the TA burst are
"originated from the same location, emitted at the same instant, and propagate with the"
speed of light. This feature of synchronization is not sensitive to many assumptions and
uncertainties which were inevitably present in estimates [3] interpreting the TA bursts
"as the AQN annihilation events. Furthermore, we also argue that the conventional"
lightning-induced radio emission is qualitatively different from the AQN -induced radio
"pulses discussed in this work. Therefore, these two different radio signals can be easily"
distinguished from each other.
"Finally, before we proceed one should emphasize from the start that AQN events"
"are generically random events as they are related to dark matter particles. However, as"
mentioned in [3] the AQN hitting the thunderstorm area may serve as a trigger which
"sparks the lightning. In other words, the AQNs play the same role of the CRs which are"
normally assumed to initiate the lightning processes. This represents a key element why
mysterious bursts which are associated with lightning events can be indeed originated
from the AQNs which happen to appear in the area under the thunderclouds. The event
rate estimated in [3] is based on this assumption.
Our presentation is organized as follows. In next section 2 we overview the TA
"bursts observations [1, 2] and the basic ideas of the proposal [3] with the resolution of"
these puzzling bursts in terms of the AQN annihilation events. In sections 3 and 4 we
argue that the emission of the radio pulse is inevitable consequence of the proposed
"mechanism, and we estimate its numerical characteristics. In sections 5 and 6 we"
estimate the radio pulse due to the Earth’s magnetic field. In section 7 we explain how
the conventional radio signals induced by the lightnings could be easily discriminated
"from the AQN-induced radio pulses. Finally, section 8 is our conclusion where we suggest"
to search for a synchronized radio pulse with TA burst.

2. TA bursts as the AQN annihilation events under thunderclouds
The main goal of this section is to overview the basic idea of the proposal [3]. We
"organize this section as follows: first, in subsection 2.1 we overview the TA bursts"
"observations [1,2] emphasizing on the very distinct features of the events. In subsection"
2.3 we explain the resolution of these puzzling bursts in terms of the AQN annihilation
events. In subsection 2.2 we highlight the very few key elements of the AQN construction
relevant for this work by referring to original paper [3] for all less important elements
"of the proposal. In other words, in the subsection 2.2 we shall only mention the"
"crucial ingredients related to the physics of emission of the radio pulses, which represent"
the topic of the present work. Such organization of this work helps us to avoid an
unavoidable repetition of the background material which can be found in [3].
"2.1. Mysterious bursts observed by [1, 2]"
"The unusual features of the bursts recorded by [1,2] can be briefly formulated as follows:"
1. All reconstructed air shower fronts for the burst events are much more curved
than usual cosmic ray (CR) air showers. This feature is expressed in terms of the time-
spreading versus spatial-spreading of the particles in the bursts. The corresponding
“curvature” is much more pronounced for the bursts in comparison with conventional
"CR air showers, see see figure 3 and figure 4 in [1]. Furthermore, the bursts events do"
not have sharp edges in waveforms in comparison with conventional CR events;
"2. The events are temporally clustered within 1 ms, which would be a highly"
unlikely occurrence for three consecutive conventional CR hits in the same area within
a radius of approximately 1 km. The total 10 burst events have been observed during
5 years of observations. The authors of ref. [1] estimate the expectation of chance
coincidence is less than 10−4 for five years of observations. If one tries to fit the
"observed bursts with conventional code, the energy for CR events should be in 1013"
"eV energy range, while the observed bursts correspond to (1018− 1019) eV energy range
as estimated by signal amplitude and distribution. Therefore, the estimated energy"
from individual events within the bursts is five to six orders of magnitude higher than
the energy estimated by event rate.
3. Most of the observed bursts are “synchronized” (difference between burst and
lightning is less than 1 ms) or “related” (difference between burst and lightning is less
than 200 ms) with the lightning events. Some of them bursts are not related to any
"lightnings. However, all 10 recorded bursts occur under thunderstorm."
It is very hard to understand all these features in terms of conventional CR physics
as the bursts cannot be reconciled with conventional CR physics. At the same time
"all unusual features (including the energetics, the flux estimates, the time and spatial"
spreading of each events within the bursts) as listed in items 1-3 above can be
naturally explained within the AQN framework. Before we proceed with corresponding
explanation we have to briefly overview the basic features of the AQN model to explain
the nature and the source of the TA bursts. This is the topic of the next subsection 2.2.
"Telescope Array Bursts, Radio Pulses and Axion Quark Nuggets 4"
2.2. The AQNs under the thunderclouds
The axion quark nugget (AQN) dark matter model [4] was invented long ago with a single
motivation to naturally explain the observed similarity between the dark matter and
"the visible densities in the Universe, i.e. ΩDM ∼ Ωvisible without any fitting parameters,
see recent brief review [5] on this model. The AQN construction in many respects is"
"similar to the Witten’s quark nuggets, see [6–8], and review [9]. This type of DM is"
"“cosmologically dark” not because of the weakness of the AQN interactions, but due to"
"their small cross-section-to-mass ratio, which scales down many observable consequences"
of an otherwise strongly-interacting DM candidate.
There are two additional elements in the AQN model compared to the original
models [6–9]. First new element is the presence of the axion domain walls which are
copiously produced during the QCD transition1. This domain wall plays a dual role:
"first it serves as an additional stabilization factor for the nuggets, which helps to alleviate"
"a number of problems with the original nugget construction [6–9]. Secondly, the same"
"axion field θ(x) generates the strong and coherent CP violation in the entire visible
Universe."
Another feature of the AQN model which plays absolutely crucial role for the present
work is that nuggets can be made of matter as well as antimatter during the QCD
"transition. Precisely the coherence of the CP violating field on large scale mentioned
above provides a preferential production of one species of nuggets made of antimatter"
over another species made of matter. The preference is determined by the initial sign of
the θ field when the formation of the AQN nuggets starts. The direct consequence of this
"feature along with coherent CP violation in entire Universe is that the DM density, ΩDM,
and the visible density, Ωvisible, will automatically assume the same order of magnitude"
"densities ΩDM ∼ Ωvisible without any fine tuning. We refer to the original papers [26–29]
devoted to the specific questions related to the nugget’s formation, generation of the"
"baryon asymmetry, and survival pattern of the nuggets during the evolution in early"
"Universe with its unfriendly environment, see also independent analysis [30] confirming"
these basic results.
Precisely the AQNs made of antimatter are capable to release a significant amount
of energy when they enter the Earth’s atmosphere and annihilation processes start to
occur between antimatter hidden in form of the AQNs and the atmospheric material.
The emission of positrons from the nuggets made of antimatter during the thunderstorms
plays the crucial role in the proposal [3]. This is because the thunderclouds are
"characterized by large preexisting electric field E which serves as a trigger and accelerator
of the liberated positrons."
"We refer to review papers [31, 32] devoted to study of the lightning where pre-"
"1 The axion field had been introduced into the theory to resolve the so-called the strong CP problem
which is related to the fundamental initial parameter θ0 6= 0. This source of CP violation is no longer
available at the present time as a result of the axion’s dynamics in early Universe. One should mention"
"that the axion remains the most compelling resolution of the strong CP problem, see original papers
on the axion [10–16], and recent reviews [17–25]."
"Telescope Array Bursts, Radio Pulses and Axion Quark Nuggets 5"
"existing electric field E plays a crucial role in dynamics of the lightning processes. While
there is a consensus on typical parameters of the electric field which are important for"
"the lightning dynamics, the physics of the of the initial moment of lightning remains a"
"matter of debate, and refs [31, 32] represent different views on this matter, see also"
references [33–35] where some specific elements of existing disagreement have been
explicitly formulated and debated.
"For our purposes, however, the disputable elements do not play any role in our"
"studies. Important elements for the present work, which are not controversial, are"
"the temporal and spatial characteristics of the electric field E and their values under
thunderclouds. These parameters are well established and are not part of the debates,"
"and we quote these parameters below. The electric field E in the thunderclouds is
characterized by the following parameters [31,32]"
"E '
kV"
"cm
, la ' 100 m, τE '"
"la
c
' 0.3µs (1)"
where la is the so-called avalanche length.
"If the AQN enters the electric field (1) along its path, it may liberate the positrons"
from AQNs as the additional energy ∆E assumes the same order of magnitude as the
"binding energy Ebound ∼ keV of the positrons, i.e."
∆E ' [eE ·Rcap] ∼ 2 keV & Ebound. (2)
In this formula Rcap is a typical distance (from the nugget’s core) where positrons
reside. These excited positrons localized sufficiently far away from the nugget’s core
due to the large rate of elastic collisions with air molecules which kick them off from
the unperturbed ground state positions. The Rcap which enters (2) can be estimated in
"terms of the ionization charge Q and internal temperature of the nuggets T ' 10 keV,"
"Rcap '
αQ"
"T
∼ 2 cm, (3)"
see [3] with proper estimates. This additional energy (2) of order of several keV could
liberate the weakly coupled positrons from the nuggets. These liberated positrons find
themselves in the background of strong electric field characterized by typical length
"scale la ' 100 m according to (1). This pre-existing field will accelerate them to MeV
energies on length scale (1). Indeed,"
Eexit ' [eE · la] ∼ 10 MeV (4)
after the positrons exit the region of strongly fluctuating electric field which is known
to be present under thunderclouds.
"2.3. “Mysterious bursts” proposal [3] confronts the observations [1, 2]"
The goal of this subsection is to explain the puzzling bursts within AQN framework as
proposed in [3]. It will be briefly explained how the unusual features 1-3 listed above
in subsection 2.1 can be naturally understood within the AQN framework.
"Telescope Array Bursts, Radio Pulses and Axion Quark Nuggets 6"
2.3.1. “curvature” puzzle. We start our discussions with item 1 from the list. In
the AQN framework this “curved” feature can be easily understood by noticing that
essential parameter in this proposal is the initial spread of the particles determined by
"angle ∆α ' (v⊥/c) ∈ (0 − 0.1). As a result of this spread the typical time scale is
determined by ∆α and it could naturally assume relatively large values up to (7− 8)µs
as estimated in (6) and consistent with observations, see figure 3 and figure 4 in [1]."
"Indeed, all released positrons will obviously move in the same direction which is"
"entirely determined by the direction of the electric field E at the moment of exit. Small
angle ∆α ' (v⊥/c) ∈ (0−0.1) in the velocity distribution at the exit point is determined
by initial energy (2) which itself is determined by transverse component perpendicular"
"to electric field, v⊥ '
√"
"2∆E/m ' 0.1c.
Therefore, after travelling the distance r the spatially spread range ∆s is estimated"
"∆s ' r
("
"( r
10 km"
")(∆α

")
, (5)"
see figure 1 for precise definitions of the parameters.
∆r + r
Figure 1. The positrons move along the cone with angle ∆α and inclination angle
"α with respect to the vertical direction. The angular spread ∆α � α is assumed to
be small. The spatial spread on the surface is determined by ∆s, while the additional"
"travelling path is determined by ∆r, see estimates in the text. The altitude is assumed"
"to be within conventional range h ' (4− 12) km. Instant direction of the electric field
E at the moment of exit of the positrons is also shown."
"At the same time, the parameter ∆t can be estimated as follows:"
"∆t '
∆r"
"c
' 3µs · (tanα) ·"
"( r

")(∆α

"where ∆r ' r tanα∆α see figure 1. One can infer from (6) that time spread (2∆t)
indeed could be relatively large, up to (7− 8)µs, in contrast with conventional CR air
shower when this timing spread is always below 2µs, see figure 5 in [1]. We use (2∆t)"
in our estimates with extra factor 2 as the angle ∆α = (v⊥/c) determining the particle
"distribution, could assume the positive or negative value, depending on sign of v⊥ with"
"respect to instant direction of the electric field E as shown on figure 1.
Another distinct characteristic of the the AQN framework is much stronger"
"localization of the particles around the axis when it is typically below 2 km, see figure"
"Telescope Array Bursts, Radio Pulses and Axion Quark Nuggets 7"
"3 and figure 4 in [1], in contrast with conventional CR air shower when it normally"
"assumes much greater values around 3.5 km, figure 5 in [1]. This feature also finds its"
"natural explanation within AQN framework. Indeed, the spread of the particles on the"
"plane determined by ∆s, while the timing is characterized by ∆t ' ∆r/c estimated
above (6). These parameters are linearly proportional to each other and assume proper"
"values consistent with observations. Indeed,"
"∆r ' ∆s sinα, ∆α '
(v⊥
c"
")
∈ (0− 0.1) (7)"
"such that 2∆t may vary between (0.5 − 8)µs when 2∆s changes between (0.5 − 2)
km with approximately linear slope determined by electric field direction sinα. This"
behaviour2 is consistent with observed events presented on figure 3 and figure 4 in [1].
This behaviour in terms of the timing and spatial spreads for the bursts should be
contrasted with conventional CR distribution when the timing spread is much shorter
"and always below 2µs while the spatial spread is much longer, up to 3.5 km, see figure"
5 in [1]. This difference between the distributions in bursts and conventional CR air
"showers was coined as the “curvature” puzzle. As we mentioned above, this puzzle is"
naturally resolved within the AQN framework.
Similar arguments also explain why the observed events do not have sharp edges in
waveforms (see figure 6 in [1]). The point is that conventional CR air showers typically
have a single ultra-relativistic particle which generates a very sharp edge in waveforms.
It should be contrasted with large number of positrons which produce the non-sharp
edges in waveforms in the AQN-based proposal.
What is important here is that these features are not sensitive to many uncertainties
which inevitably present in estimates of [3]. This is because the “curvature” feature
discussed above has pure kinematical (geometrical) nature. It is not related to any
"complicated problems such as a large Mach number, turbulence, the AQN internal"
"structure, the dynamics of the electric field under the thunderstorm, etc. One can"
say that the “curvature” property observed in bursts is an almost model-independent
"consequence of the AQN framework, not sensitive to many uncertainties of the absolute"
normalization factors in the estimates presented in [3]. The same comment also applies
to the property of the non-sharp edges in waveforms as this feature is also very generic
"consequence of the AQN framework, not related to any uncertainties in the estimates [3]."
2.3.2. “clustering” puzzle. The item 2 shows a dramatic inconsistency (when
interpreted in terms of the CR air showers) for the bursts events when the event rate
"suggests that the energy should be in 1013 eV range, while the intensity of the events"
suggests (1018− 1019) eV range. In the AQN framework the burst represents the cluster
2 One should comment here that the actual trajectories of the positrons are not the straight lines due
"to the Earth’s magnetic field B ∼ 0.5 Gauss as we discuss in section 5. However, the main point here
is that the emitted positrons are characterized by the same velocity and localization at the instant of"
"exit. Therefore the presence of the magnetic field B does not spoil our estimates for the temporal and
spatial spreads given by (7) which must hold irrespective of the presence of B."
"Telescope Array Bursts, Radio Pulses and Axion Quark Nuggets 8"
"of events related to one and the same AQN which traverses the distance Lburst ' 0.25
km during ∆t = 1 ms. In different words, the burst is not a collection of independent"
"events. Conventional Poisson distribution does not apply here. Instead, the bursts"
represent the clustering events when the intensities are determined by the numbers of
liberated positrons when the AQNs enter strong electric field under the thunderstorm.
"Furthermore, the spatial spread for each individual event within the same cluster also"
"lies within the same range ∼ 1 km according to (5). On the one hand, the observations
are extremely hard to explain in terms of conventional CR air showers. On the other"
"hand, the same observations are perfectly consistent with the AQN based estimates."
2.3.3. “synchronization” puzzle. According to item 3 most of the observed bursts are
"“synchronized” or “related” to the lightning events. However, some of the bursts are not"
"related to any lightnings. However, all 10 recorded bursts occur under thunderstorm."
This is very puzzling property of the bursts if interpreted in terms of the conventional CR
air showers because it is very hard to understand how the thunderstorms may produce
the observed features of TA events.
At the same time the “synchronization” puzzle is perfectly consistent with AQN
based proposal [3] because the thunderstorm with its pre-existing electric field (1) plays a
crucial role in the mechanism as the electric field instantaneously liberates the positrons
and also accelerates them up to 10 MeV energies. The mean free path of such energetic
positrons is sufficiently long such that these positrons can easily reach the Telescope
Array Surface Detectors (TASD) and can produce the signals consistent with the bursts.
"In addition, an AQN can serve as a trigger of runaway breakdown avalanche as"
discussed in [3] 3. This explains the strong correlation between bursts and lightning
events within AQN interpretation. The AQN-induced burst may or may not initiate
lightnings depending on presence of other required ingredients for runaway breakdown
avalanche to start. It explains the synchronization puzzle as well as it answers the
question of why most but not all bursts are correlated with lightnings.
To summarize this section: the mysterious bursts (with highly unusual features
"as listed by items 1-3 in Section 2.1) of shower-like events observed by TASD [1, 2]"
are naturally interpreted as the cluster events generated by the AQNs propagating in
thunderstorm environment. Some of the features of these events (such as intensity
and the basic normalization factors) suffer inevitable uncertainties due to very complex
dynamical properties of the system (the AQN propagation under thunderstorm with
"large Mach number). However, there are some features of the system such as given by"
"(5), (6), (7) which are not sensitive to these uncertainties and represent almost model-"
independent consequences of the proposal [3].
3 It is known that the presence of a strong electric field (1) is required to initiate a runaway breakdown
avalanche. Another element which remains to be a matter of debates [31–37] is the nature of the seeded
particles which play the role of a trigger to an avalanche. The proposal [3] suggests that AQNs may
"also play the role of a trigger along with conventional sources such as the CR [31,36]."
"Telescope Array Bursts, Radio Pulses and Axion Quark Nuggets 9"
3. Radio pulse and TA burst as synchronized events
This section is devoted to studies of the radio signals which always accompany TA bursts
when interpreted in terms of the AQN annihilation events under the thunderstorm as
presented in previous section 2. We shall argue below that the emission of the radio
"pulse is inevitable consequence of the proposed mechanism. Furthermore, the radio"
pulse must be synchronized with TA burst irrespective of whether the bursts are related
or unrelated to the lightning events. This synchronization must be within 10µs from
every TA event as the positrons and radio waves originated from the same location at
the same instant and both propagate with the speed of light. As the typical time and
"spatial spreads of the TA events do not exceed 10µs, the synchronization must be within"
the same temporal and spatial range.
This section is organized as follows. In next subsection 3.1 we study the trajectory
of the liberated positrons in a typical electric field characterized by parameters (1).
We analyze the total intensity and the angular distribution of the radio emission in
"subsection 3.2, while the spectral properties of the pulse are studied in subsection 3.3."
"Finally, in subsection 3.4 we study the properties of the electric field’s pulse which can"
be detected at the surface detector area.
3.1. Positron’s acceleration in electric field under thunderstorm
Our goal here is to describe the dynamics of the liberated positrons which are emitted
with initial energies in keV range according to (2). To simplify things we assume that
"the electric field E directed along z-axis is uniform and characterized by parameters (1).
In this case the solution is well known [38] and can be described as follows. At the"
"very initial moment of acceleration at t � t0 the particle moves with non-relativistic
velocities according to conventional formulae:"
"z(t) '
p0z

"where p0z ∼ p0⊥ is the initial positron’s momentum at the moment of liberation from
AQN. Numerically, this non-relativistic portion of the positron’s journey is very short"
"as t0 ∼ 10−8s. It will be ignored in all our discussions which follow.
The portion of the positron’s journey which plays the key role in our discussions"
"is the motion with constant acceleration eE/m and the velocity close to c. The
corresponding motion is determined by the formulae:"
"z(t) =
c"

"|e|E
(9)"
"where E0 ' (mc2 + ∆E) is the total initial energy of positrons at the moment of
liberation."
"Telescope Array Bursts, Radio Pulses and Axion Quark Nuggets 10"
The most important observation here is that the positrons move with ultra-
"relativistic velocities for most of the time, and the displacement in transverse direction"
(with respect to the orientation of the electric field) is very modest such that the majority
of the particles remain in the system and continue their acceleration for the entire time
"interval τE ∼ 0.3µs determined by parameter la according to (1). At this point most of
the particles assume very high energy close to 10 MeV according to (4) while transverse"
"momentum distribution is characterized by (v⊥/c) . 0.1. The elastic scattering of the
positrons off the atmospheric molecules during this short journey plays very minor role"
as the kinetic energy of positrons being in keV range at the initial instant assumes
MeV energies very quickly such that the corresponding cross section never becomes
sufficiently large to modify the positron’s dynamics as computed above in vacuum.
3.2. Intensity and the angular distribution
Our next task is to present conventional formulae for the intensity and the angular
distribution of the radio emission due to the relativistic positrons (9) accelerating in
"electric field E with parameters (1). As we discussed above the velocity v of the positrons
is mostly oriented along the electric field while v⊥ is small. Therefore, we assume that"
"E ‖ v to simplify our formulae which follow. In this simplified geometry the angular
distribution for the intensity assumes the following form, see e.g. [38, 39]:"
"dΩ
'
N2e2a2(t)"
"4πc3
sin2 θ"
"(1− v
c"
"cos θ)5
, a ≡"
"eE
mγ3"
", (10)"
"where N is the number of coherent positrons participating in the radio wave emission,"
to be estimated below. The angle θ in this expression is defined as usual as the angle
between the velocity v of the charged particle at the moment of emission and the
"direction n of the observer, i.e. v · n = v cos θ. Formula (10) explicitly shows that the
emission mostly occurs along E direction as E ‖ v. This is precisely the same direction
where burst events are recorded as shown on figure 1."
Integration over all angles leads to well known expression for the total intensity:
"I(t) '
2N2e2"
"3c3
[
a2(t)γ6"
"]
, γ ≡"
"1√
(1− v2/c2)"
Formula (11) represents the well known feature of the emission that the intensity is
"strongly enhanced for ultra-relativistic particles, which is obviously the case for positrons"
accelerated up to 10 MeV energies according to (4). This implies that the relativistic
"enhancement factor entering (11) is enormous: (Eexit/m)
6 ∼ 108."
3.3. Spectral characteristics of the radio emission
The main goal of this subsection is to understand the spectral characteristics of the
radio emission. It will also allow to estimate the coherence factor N entering (10) and
(11) as this factor obviously depends on the frequency of radiation and corresponding
wave length.

The same expression can be derived from (20) by integrating over the angles dΩ.
This spectral density holds as long as ω is sufficiently small. To be more precise:
"ω . γ2τ−1E , (24)"
which represents the dominant contribution to the integral (19) for small ω. The
emission with higher frequencies will be power-suppressed as ω−2.
Few comments are in order. The spectral density (23) integrated over all angles dΩ
approximately constant and does not depend on ω as long as condition (24) is satisfied.
This is of course a well-known feature of the constant acceleration (21) which we used as
"a simplified model for the electric field. In reality, the electric field under thunderstorm"
obviously fluctuates in time and space. This will obviously modify the spectral features
"(23). However, we expect that a typical frequency of the emission as given by (24) will"
hold because it is basically determined by the typical time scale of the problem τE and
expected relativistic factor γ which is not very sensitive to the details of the fluctuating
"electric field E .
The crucial observation here is that the typical frequency of emission is not simply"
given by the scale τ−1E as one could naively expect based on dimensional arguments.
"Rather, the emission extends to much broader region due to the large relativistic factor"
γ2 as (24) states.
We postpone for the detail numerical estimates to section 4. Now we want to
make few simple numerical estimates supporting the main claim of this work that the
"frequency of emission is in the radio band ν ∈ (0.5 − 200) MHz. Furthermore, the"
"Telescope Array Bursts, Radio Pulses and Axion Quark Nuggets 13"
emission is mostly oriented along the same direction where TA bursts are recorded.
"Therefore, one should anticipate a strong synchronization between the TA bursts and"
"the radio pulses as both emission occurs at the same location at the same instant, and"
propagate to the corresponding detectors with the same speed of light. These features
"are not very sensitive to details of the dynamics of the AQNs, nor specific features of"
"electric field under thunderstorm. Rather, all these features are inevitable consequences"
of the basic AQN framework along with pure geometrical properties of these observables.
With these comments in mind we can represent the typical band as follows
"ν .
γ2"
"2πτE
≈ 200 MHz, ν ≡"
"2π
, γ ≈ 20, (25)"
which we expect to hold irrespective of specific features of the AQN model as it is
entirely determined by well established typical time scales of the electric field under the
thunderstorm (1). One could naively think that the typical frequency of emission could
be extrapolated to very low ν as the spectral density (23) apparently does not depend
on frequency. This is not quite correct conclusion though as we shall discuss in next
section 4.
3.4. Radio pulse of the electric field
The goal of this section is to estimate the intensity of the electric field (12) at very
large distances R where it can be potentially detected. The orientation of E field
is determined by cross product (12) where one can assume (for the simplicity of the
"numerical estimates) that v ‖ a, similar to our previous estimates for the spectral
intensity of the emission (19). The absolute value for |E| at large distances can be
estimated as follows"

"where R is the distance from the emission site to the area where the electric field |E|
could be recorded. It should not be confused with parameter r which enters all formulae"
from section 2.3 and describes the distance from the emission site to the SD site where
"the energetic positrons could be detected. Numerically these parameters are similar, of"
"course. However, the radio signal can be observed in a different location from the local"
area where the positrons hit the TASD.
This formula explicitly shows that the time duration of the radio pulse and its
"properties are unambiguously determined by the features of the electric field E under
thunderstorm. For simple model (21) this implies that the radio pulse lasts τE while the"
absolute value of the pulse is estimated as
"|E(θ, t)| ≈
Neθ"
1 + γ2θ2
")3(
eE(t)

")
, t ∈ (0, τE). (27)"
It is important to emphasize that the duration of the pulse τE is not very sensitive to
the details of the AQN model as it is entirely determined by well established typical
time scales of the electric field under the thunderstorm (1). This feature is very similar
"Telescope Array Bursts, Radio Pulses and Axion Quark Nuggets 14"
to our previous arguments regarding a typical frequency of the radio emission (25). At
the same time the intensity of the pulse is highly sensitive to the details of the AQN
model as it depends on the number of positrons N participating in the emission. In
this respect this feature of insensitivity to any specific details of the AQN model for the
pulse duration τE and the frequency ν as given by (25) is similar to our studies of the TA
"burst events when such features as the “curvature”, the timing and the spatial spread of"
"the bursts are not sensitive to the details of the AQN model, but entire determined by"
the geometry as reviewed in section 2.3. This should be contrasted with estimations [3]
of the intensity of the TA bursts which are highly sensitive to specific features of the
"model, which are hard to carry out in a quantitative manner."
4. Numerical Estimates
Our goal here is to present some numerical results using parameters which had been
used in our previous estimations [3] related to puzzling TASD bursts as reviewed in
section 2.3. One should emphasize from the very beginning that the corresponding
"estimates suffer from huge uncertainties, and should be considered as the order of"
"magnitude estimates, at the very best. Our main arguments of the present work are"
"not based on these highly model dependent estimates. Rather, our main arguments are"
based on essentially model-independent features of the radio emission such as typical
frequency band (25) and strong synchronization between TASD burst events and the
"radio emission. Nevertheless, we think that an order of magnitude estimates for the"
amplitude of the electric field as presented below could be useful as they demonstrate
the consistency of the proposal. The same estimates also demonstrate the principle
feasibility to detect such radio signals.
We start with numerical estimation of the strength of the electric field of the pulse

"where factor N is the number of the coherent positrons participating in the emission,"
to be estimated below. The orientation of the electric field is determined by the cross
"product as given by (12), and it is approximately (up to small angle θ) points along a"
which represents the direction of the electric field under thundercloud at the instant of
"emission. The temporal shape of the pulse (bipolar, unimodal or even more complicated"
"form) is also determined by the same fluctuating electric field E at the moment of
emission. The intensity of the field is strongly peaks along n with typical angle θγ . 1,
see figure 2 for a precise angular distribution of |E(θ)|."
Our next task is the estimation of parameter N entering (28). Our estimates will
"be entirely based on the observations, rather than on theoretical computations which"
"inevitably suffer from huge uncertainties as reviewed in section 2.3. Therefore, the logic"

Figure 2. Strength of electric field (28) induced under thunderstorm versus
"observation angle θ. The parameters are chosen to be N = 109, γ = 20, E = 1 kV/cm."
of our estimation of parameter N is as follows. Let us assume that the TASD bursts
which have been recorded are indeed due to the positrons emitted by AQNs as proposed
in [3]. In this case the number of detected particles must be proportional to the density
of particle detectors. This number is known for presently operating 507 SD detectors
with area 3m2 each. These detectors are covering 680 km2 total area. The number of
"detected particles must be also proportional to the area ∼ π(r∆α)2 where particles had
been recorded by TASD during a single event within the burst. Therefore, the number"
of positrons N at the emission site can be estimated from the following relation:
"Ndetectedpositrons[∆s] ≈ N
["
507 · 3 m2
680 km2
"] [
〈exp"
")
〉
] [
π(r∆α)2"
"]
(29)"
In our estimate (29) the number of detected particles being recorded over the surface
"area π(∆s)2 [left hand side of (29)] varies for different events within a single burst,"
"and it normally varies in the range (2 − 6) · 102. In our estimate (29) we inserted the
suppression factor 〈exp(−r/λ)〉 ∼ 0.1 introduced in [3] to account for some attenuation
of the positrons travelling a distance r ∼ 10 km or so when the mean free path λ
for positrons with few MeV energy is order of kilometre at the sea level and several"
kilometres at higher altitudes. One should also note that π(r∆α)2 on the right hand
"side of (29) is not identically the surface area ∼ π(∆s)2 where particles are being
recorded. These areas are directly related to each other through angle α according to"
"(5), see figure 1 for notations."
"The relation (29) suggests that number N entering (28) for (r∆α) ∼ 1 km (which
corresponds to a typically observed spatial spread for the burst events) can be estimated"
N ≈ (0.3− 1) · 109 for (r∆α) ∼ 1 km. (30)
"Telescope Array Bursts, Radio Pulses and Axion Quark Nuggets 16"
This estimate for N corresponds to the amplitude of the electric field (28) on the level
"20(mV/m) measured at distance R ' 10 km from the source of the emission within the
angle range (θγ) . 1 where the most of the radio emission occurs."
Our last task in this section is establishing the lower frequency bound for the radio
"emission. The spectral density (23) which is approximately a constant, naively suggests"
"that the spectrum extends to arbitrary low frequencies. In fact, it is a premature"
"conclusion as formula (23) was derived assuming a constant acceleration. In reality,"
a typical acceleration time is determined by (1) such that one should expect that
"ν & (2πτE)
−1 ≈ 0.5 MHz. Therefore, the AQN-induced ∼ 0.3µs pulse represents a radio"
"emission in the bandwidth ν ∈ (0.5−200) MHz with the amplitude of the corresponding
electric field of the order |E(θ, t)| ∼ 20(mV/m) at distance R ∼ 10 km as estimated
above. Important feature of this spectrum is that it is very broad. Indeed, the intensity"
of the radiation changes by factor two or so when the frequency varies by two orders
of magnitude. Another comment which follows from figure 3 is that the portion of the
positron’s energy being converted into the radio waves is very tiny as initial positrons
energy can be estimated as 10N MeV when N is estimated in (30). This implies that
the initial energy is many orders of magnitude greater than the radio wave energy shown
on figure 3.

"Figure 3. Spectrum of (19) in terms of frequency ν, thunderstorm radiation. The"
"parameters are chosen to be N = 109, γ = 20, E = 1 kV/cm."
The crucial point of our analysis can be formulated as follows. This radio pulse must
be synchronized with an event within TA burst within 10µs because the TA burst and
the radio emission are originated from the same location emitted at the same instant and
both signals propagate with the speed of light along the same direction to be detected
"within ∼ km2 area.
It is important to emphasize that such strong synchronization must hold even if"
the TA bursts are not related to any lightning events and can be easily discriminated
"Telescope Array Bursts, Radio Pulses and Axion Quark Nuggets 17"
"from much stronger radio emission which always accompany lightnings. Therefore,"
"such synchronization between the radio pulses and the TA bursts, if observed, can be"
easily distinguished from any other possible correlation between radio emission and
"conventional lightning events, see section 7 for the details."
5. Geosynchrotron radiation
Another significant radio emission is the geosynchrotron radiation which is due to
"presence of the Earth’s magnetic field B ∼ 0.5 gauss. This effect becomes important
near the end of radio emission under thunderstorm. At this instant all the positrons are"
"ultrarelativistic (γ ∼ 20) but they are no longer accelerating as they already left the
region of the external electric field E . Trajectory of positrons are helical in presence of
the magnetic field of Earth B ∼ 0.5 gauss. The acceleration in this case is perpendicular
to the direction of velocity v ⊥ aB, so it is convenient to set up the following coordinate
with respect to the direction of observer n:"
"v̂ · n = cos θ , âB · n = sin θ cosφ (31)"

The estimation of electric field strength holds as long as the positron current remains
coherent. The coherent length lcoh can be estimated in what follows. The dispersion in

"While numerical values of the frequency bandwidth ν ∼ (0.1 − 102) MHz and the
maximal strength of electric field of the radio wave [|E| ∼ (20− 50) mV/m] are similar
in both cases of radio pulses (which we term as E-type and B-type correspondingly)
there is an important distinct feature, which is manifested in dramatically different"
"time durations in these two cases. To be more precise, a B-type pulse induced
by geosynchrotron radiation (τB ∼ 0.14 ns) is much shorter than E-type pulse with
(τE ∼ 0.3µs)."
This distinct feature is in fact an absolutely crucial element for possible potential
observations of the emission. This difference between τB and τE is the main reason for
"dramatically different energy injection which is measured in units MeV ·MHz−1 in case
of E-type emission to be contrasted with much lower keV ·MHz−1 scale in case of B-type
emission, see Figs. 3 and 5 correspondingly."
"Therefore, the total energy of the radio emission integrated over the pulse"
"time is much greater for the E-type radiation in comparison with B-type radiation.
Furthermore, the required resolution to detect the very short B-type pulse with τB ∼ ns
requires much more demanding instruments than recording of the conventional E-type
pulses with duration time of order τE ∼ µs. These arguments strongly suggest that
E-type radiation plays the dominant role in emission processes. Therefore, any future"
"Telescope Array Bursts, Radio Pulses and Axion Quark Nuggets 20"
"studies (including possible observations) should be focused on E-type radiation analyzed
in Section 4."
7. Can conventional physics be responsible for proposed effects?
The question we address in this section can be formulated as follows. It has been known
for quite sometime that the thunderstorm lightnings are always accompanied by the
"radio emissions, see e.g. reviews [31, 32]. Can these lightning-induced radio pulses be"
responsible for the effects studied in this work? Before we answer this question we first
"recall [3] the basic features of the TA bursts interpreted as the AQN events, see item"
"1. Then, in item 2 we overview the main features of the radio emission which always"
accompanies the thunderstorm lightning events. After that in item 3 we explain the
dramatic qualitative differences between the radio pulses associated with thunderstorm
lightnings and the radio pulses studied in this work.
"1. As we previously mentioned, lightnings are correlated with AQN events when"
an AQN hits the region of the thunderclouds and potentially may initiate lightnings
serving as a trigger [3]. The mechanism is similar to the role of conventional CRs
"that are considered to be one of the dominant triggers of lightnings, see footnote 3"
with related comments and references. This is the basic reason why the bursts being
interpreted as random AQN events are nevertheless associated with the lightnings.
"Further to this point, it is important to emphasize that in the AQN framework the"
"direction of the electric field E characterized by (1) (also shown on Figure 1) and the
direction of the lightning current are not correlated. This is because the AQN event"
may serve as a trigger for the lightning strike. The trigger should not be confused with
the initial stepped lightning leader which determines the direction of the current of the
"lightning being developed. In different words, the direction of the observed current of"
"a lightning does not determine the sign of the fluctuating electric field E which itself
defines the direction of the positrons to be recorded as TASD unusual events."
"To rephrase it, an AQN plays the dual role when it propagates in the thunderclouds:"
"it emits the very energetic positrons, and it also triggers the lightning, similar to"
"conventional CR, see footnote 3 with relevant references. The former phenomenon"
"is recorded as a TASD burst, while the latter one explains the observed correlation"
between the bursts and lightnings.
"As a next remark: as we mentioned, all mysterious bursts occur at the very initial"
moment of the lightning flashes or even earlier than lightning. Some bursts are not
related to the lightning flashes at all (but occur under the thunderclouds). In original
interpretation [1] this feature is explained in terms of the initial stepped lightning leaders
propagating to the ground on a time scale of ten or tens of milliseconds. In the AQN
framework this feature is also automatically satisfied as the AQNs can serve as the
"triggers of lightning flashes, which may or may not initiate the lightnings. The particles"
"which are recorded as TASD events are produced directly by AQN itself at this moment,"
not at the initial stage of the strike determined by the lightning leader.
"Telescope Array Bursts, Radio Pulses and Axion Quark Nuggets 21"
2. Having discussed the basic features of the TASD events within AQN framework
we now turn to our next item on radio emission features as a result of lightnings.
The correlation between lightning and radio emission during thunderstorms is well
"known and well documented generic feature of the the lightning discharges, see [41]"
"with large number of references on observations. In particular, the lightning discharges"
are characterized by a very large number of radio pulses which last in total for about 1
"second. Each pulse is characterized by full width (0.2−0.3)µs with electric field strength
which could be as large as |E| ∼ 103 mV/m. Most of the pulses, though, show the
strength of the electric field in the |E| ∼ (100− 200) mV/m range. Another important
feature of the radio emission: the gaps between pulses are in the range (10 − 102)µs.
Therefore, total number of pulses could be very large & 103 during a single lightning
event. Finally, the typical frequency of the radiation is strongly peaked in few MHz"
"bands, while it completely diminishes for ν & 10 MHz.
3. These features must be contrasted with the AQN-induced radio pulses studied"
in this work. While a typical duration of an individual pulse τE and the strength of the
"corresponding electric field |E| assume similar orders of magnitude in both cases, some
other key characteristics are dramatically different. It allows an easy discrimination"
between these two cases.
"Indeed, the number of clustered radio pulses associated with the mysterious bursts"
must be very few (it ought to be 3+ corresponding to the number of clustered events
"in a single burst). It should be contrasted with ∼ 103 in case of the lightning-induced
radio pulses. The total durations of the radio emissions are also very different for these"
two cases.
The most important distinct feature which discriminates the different sources of the
emission is that the frequency bands of the radiation are dramatically different in these
"two cases. The lightning-induced radio emission is strongly peaked in few MHz bands,"
"while AQN-induced radio pulse is characterized by the flat spectrum with ν . 200 MHz
according to (25). The basic reason for this dramatic difference is that the electric"
"current responsible for the lightning is represented by the particles with γ ∼ 1 while
for the AQN-induced case the positrons are characterized by γ ∼ 20. This difference is
translated into dramatic modification of the frequency bands according to (25) though"
"the typical time scale for an individual lightning-induced pulse ∼ (0.2− 0.3)µs assumes
the same order of magnitude as τE ∼ 0.3µs."
"Next, we want to mention that there are some dramatic differences between the"
"radio pulses induced by conventional CR showers [42, 43] and the AQN-induced radio"
pulses. These differences have been discussed in details in [44]. Here we want to mention
that these dramatic differences are related to very different structures of the showers.
In case of conventional CR the radio emission is based on the picture when a CR air
shower is characterized by the “pancake” of particles and its central axis. The density of
the particles strongly depend on the distance to the central axis such that the spectral
"density of the radio pulse is highly sensitive to the width of the “pancake”, which"
becomes much thicker further away from the axis. It is very different from the AQN-
"Telescope Array Bursts, Radio Pulses and Axion Quark Nuggets 22"
induced radio signal as the notions of the shower axis and the “pancake” do not exist
in our case such that the density of the particles is approximately the same irrespective
of the distance to the central axis.
"Additionally, conventional CRs are well studied even being heavily distorted by"
"electric field in thundercloud, and in fact it is nowadays an efficient probe to study"
the electric field in thunderstorms by analysing the radio emission [45]4. The dramatic
difference with the radio pulse studied in the present work is that the radio emission
"due to the CR is strongly correlated with the Earth’s magnetic field, in contrast with"
"dominant E-type emission studied in the present work. As a result the width of the
corresponding signal is in nanosecond range, in contrast with the AQN induced pulse"
"when the width is ∼ 0.3µs. Furthermore, the polarization pattern for the pulses related
to CRs are dramatically different from the AQN-induced emission. Therefore, there"
should be no technical difficulty to distinguish an AQN-induced radio pulse from a
conventional CR under the thunderstorm. The corresponding studies could support or
refute our proposal.
There are many other distinct features between the AQN and conventional CR air
"showers. In particular, the AQNs mostly emit photons in X ray bands, such that a"
signal cannot be observed by a fluorescence detector which is designed to detect the
visible and UV light5.
"Next, we note that gamma rays can be produced by an avalanche of relativistic"
runaway electrons during initiation of lightning [48]. Bursts of gamma rays initiated in
"the Earth’s atmosphere, commonly referred to as terrestrial gamma ray flashes, can be"
"generated in a lightning leader system [49, 50]. The terrestrial gamma ray flashes can"
trigger atmospheric photonuclear reactions that produce neutrons and positrons [51].
Evidently these gamma rays and their byproducts do not interfere with our proposed
"radio detection, as they are excessively more energetic and only appear at frequency"
band above EHz. Another important point here is that this powerful emission occurs
"in a latter stage of a lightning, while an AQN-induced event appears before or at the"
initial stage as it serves as a potential trigger of a lightning strike.
Based on these dramatic differences in frequencies and timings of the radio emissions
we conclude that the signals due to the thunderstorm lightning events and conventional
CR air showers can be easily discriminated from the AQN-induced radio pulses studied
"in this work. Therefore, we suggest to study the corresponding radio signal to support"
or refute our proposal to interpret the TA bursts as the AQN-induced events.
"Lastly, one can assume that the source of the TASD bursts is entirely due to the"
complicated and not well understood physics of the lightning strikes (which may or may
not be recorded by the system on the surface). In addition to many problems with
"explanation of the observed intensity, timing, clustering features, and geometry, there is"
4 Another way to study the electric field under the thunderstorm is to study distortion of the muon’s
"propagation in the background of electric field [46].
5 In fact, it was precisely the argument presented in [47] why the all sky camera has not observed any"
signal from a powerful meteor-like event detected by the infra-sound dedicated instrument.
"Telescope Array Bursts, Radio Pulses and Axion Quark Nuggets 23"
an additional problem of the very low observed event rate (which is 10) in comparison
"with recorded ∼ 104 number of lightnings in the same area. At the same time the
estimated event rate [3] based on assumption that the observed TASD bursts is a result"
of the AQN-induced events is consistent with observations.
To conclude: we are not aware of any studies which could explain the observed
"intensity, timing, clustering features, and geometry of the signal in form of the"
"mysterious bursts being produced during initial stage of the lightning as recorded, while"
proposal [3] naturally explains all these features within AQN framework.
8. Conclusion
"As we argued at the very end of previous Section 6 the E-type radiation plays the
dominant role in radio emission. The corresponding results have been summarized"
at the very end of Section 4 where it has been argued that the radio pulse can be
recorded if proper instruments are designed and built at the TASD site. The pulse
must be synchronized with TASD bursts. Such a signal cannot be confused with
"any other spurious and noise signals as a result of this synchronization. Therefore,"
"observing (not observing) such synchronized signals can confirm, substantiate or refute"
our proposal. We further argued in section 7 that the AQN-induced radio signals can
be easily discriminated from the pulses generated by the thunderstorm lightning events.
"One should comment here that the strength (28) of the amplitude |E| on the level
20 mV/m with the duration time of the radio pulse on the scale ∼ 0.3µs could be
recorded with existing technology as discussed in [41] in application to thunderstorm"
lightning events where wide-band radio interferometry (0.1-30 MHz) has been used to
"detect such short signals with amplitudes of electric field on the level 102 mV/m, which"
"is very close to what is required for the purposes of the present work. Therefore, the"
predicted radio signals (28) can be in principle measured if proper instruments are
designed and built at the TASD site.
"Furthermore, the short radio pulses can be, in principle, recorded by any"
(sufficiently sensitive) radio telescope outside of the TASD site as the corresponding
"radio pulses will be emitted in form of the clustering events, similar to TA-bursts. Such"
clusters of individual short radio pulses can be discriminated from any spurious signals
representing the radio noise. It can be also discriminated from radio emission occurring
as a result of the thunderstorm lightning events as argued in 7.
Our arguments are entirely based on the AQN framework. Why should we take
this model seriously? In section 2.2 we mentioned that this model was originally
formulated to resolve simultaneously two fundamental puzzles of the modern cosmology:
the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry and the observed similarity between the dark
"and visible components of the Universe, i.e. the ratio ΩDM ∼ Ωvisible holds irrespective
for any specific features of the model."
The basic logic of the construction suggests that there must be many observable
"consequences of this model. Indeed, the AQNs may offer a resolution [52, 53] to some"
"Telescope Array Bursts, Radio Pulses and Axion Quark Nuggets 24"
seemingly unrelated puzzles such as the “Solar Corona Mystery” when the so-called
“nanoflares” conjectured by Parker long ago [54] are identified with the annihilation
events in the AQN framework. The luminosity of the Extreme UV (EUV) radiation
from corona due to these annihilation events is unambiguously determined by the DM
density. It is very nontrivial consistency check that the computed luminosity from the
corona nicely matches with observed EUV radiation. The same events of annihilation
are also manifested themselves as the radio impulsive events [55] in quiet solar corona.
The computed intensity and spectral features are consistent with recently recorded radio
"events in quiet solar corona by Murchison Widefield Array Observatory [56], which also"
"represents a very nontrivial consistency check of the proposal [52, 53] on the “Solar"
Corona Mystery” resolution.
The AQNs may also offer a resolution of the “Primordial Lithium Puzzle” [57] and
the longstanding puzzle with the DAMA/LIBRA observation of the annual modulation
"at 9.5σ confidence level [58]. Furthermore, it may resolve the observed (by XMM-"
Newton at 11σ confidence level [59]) puzzling seasonal variation of the X-ray background
in the near-Earth environment in the 2-6 keV energy range as suggested in [60]. The
AQN annihilation events in the Earth’s atmosphere could produce infrasound and
seismic acoustic waves as discussed in [47] when the infrasound and seismic acoustic
waves have been recorded without any traces of accompanying meteor-like events. The
AQN framework may also offer a resolution [44] of a different mysterious CR-like event
(the so-called anomalous events with noninverted polarity observed by the Antarctic
Impulse Transient Antenna (ANITA) collaboration). This list of possible observational
"consequences of the AQN framework is already quite long, but definitely this list is far"
from being complete.
Our present proposal suggests that the TA bursts with very unusual features will be
synchronized with radio pulses. If this synchronization is observed and the interpretation
of TA bursts as the AQN annihilation events is confirmed by future studies it would
"be the first direct (non-gravitational) evidence which reveals the nature of the DM, in"
contrast with large number of indirect hints listed above.
