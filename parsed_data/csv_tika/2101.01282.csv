ABSTRACT
The cusp-core problem is one of the main challenges of the cold dark matter paradigm on small
"scales: the density of a dark matter halo is predicted to rise rapidly toward the center as ρ(r) ∝ rα
with α between -1 and -1.5, while such a cuspy profile has not been clearly observed. We have carried"
"out the spatially-resolved mapping of gas dynamics toward a nearby ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG), AGC"
242019. The derived rotation curve of dark matter is well fitted by the cuspy profile as described
"by the Navarro-Frenk-White model, while the cored profiles including both the pseudo-isothermal"
"and Burkert models are excluded. The halo has α= -(0.90±0.08) at the innermost radius of 0.67 kpc ,
Mhalo=(3.5±1.2)×1010 M� and a small concentration of 2.0±0.36. AGC 242019 challenges alternatives
of cold dark matter by constraining the particle mass of fuzzy dark matter to be < 0.11×10−22 eV or
> 3.3×10−22 eV , the cross section of self-interacting dark matter to be < 1.63 cm2/g, and the particle
mass of warm dark matter to be > 0.23 keV, all of which are in tension with other constraints. The"
modified Newtonian dynamics is also inconsistent with a shallow radial acceleration relationship of AGC
"242019. For the feedback scenario that transforms a cusp to a core, AGC 242019 disagrees with the"
"stellar-to-halo-mass-ratio dependent model, but agrees with the star-formation-threshold dependent"
"model. As a UDG, AGC 242019 is in a dwarf-size halo with weak stellar feedback, late formation time,"
a normal baryonic spin and low star formation efficiency (SFR/gas).
1. INTRODUCTION
The cosmological model of cold dark matter and dark
"energy, i.e., ΛCDM, has achieved tremendous success in"
understanding the cosmic structure across time on large
"scales, but this model is challenged by observations on"
"small scales such as the cusp-core problem, the missing"
"dwarf problem, the too-big-to-fail problem etc. (for a"
"review, see Weinberg et al. 2015)."
In cosmological simulations of cold and collisionless
"dark matter, a dark matter halo has a density profile"
that rises toward the center with a power index of -1
to -1.5 (Moore 1994; Burkert 1995; Navarro et al. 1997;
Moore et al. 1998; Ghigna et al. 2000; Jing & Suto 2002;
"Wang et al. 2020), referred as a cuspy profile. However,"
"over the past decades, much shallower or even flat core-"
"like profiles toward centers have been found in most, if"
"not all, observed data of nearby galaxies through map-"

HI interferometric data reveal shallow dark-matter cen-

tral profiles in individual galaxies (Carignan & Beaulieu
1989; Lake et al. 1990; Jobin & Carignan 1990). Stud-
ies with higher spatial resolutions for a larger sample of
dwarfs and low-surface-brightness galaxies further con-
"firm the central flatness of the rotation curve, and de-"
rived a median dark-matter density slope of about -0.2
"toward centers (de Blok et al. 2001; Oh et al. 2011,"
2015). Optical observations of ionized gas such as Hα
"can achieve higher spatial resolutions than the HI data,"
and confirmed the median density slope of about -0.2
with long-slit spectra for a large sample of dwarf galax-
ies (Spekkens et al. 2005). Although the rotation curves
from the long-slit spectroscopic data are sensitive to the
"assumed dynamical center, the position angle of the"
"kinematic major axis etc, further studies with optical"
integral field unit have suggested insignificance of the
above effects and validated dark-matter profiles with
central shallower slopes (Kuzio de Naray et al. 2008;
Adams et al. 2014).
Among few galaxies whose halos can be described by
"cuspy profiles, the one with the highest signal-to-noise-"
ratio is DDO 101 that has a central dark-matter slope
"of -1.02±0.12 (8.5-σ) (Oh et al. 2015). However, this
object can be fitted equally well with a cored profile;"

the difference in the reduced χ2 is only 0.02 for a degree
of freedom (d.o.f) of six (see Oh et al. 2015). This is
because of the limitation on the spatial resolution and
"spatial extent of the observed rotation curve, as well as"
"different models for cuspy and cored profiles (see § 3.2).
For example, the density slope of a NFW model for a"
cuspy profile varies from -1 at the center to -3 at in-
"finity, while the pseudo-isothermal (ISO) model for a"
cored profile has a slope from 0 at the center to -2 at
"infinity, so that both models may perform well on fit-"
ting the data with a limited spatial extent. In order to
"identify a definitive cuspy dark matter halo, it is thus"
required to demonstrate not only the validity of cuspy
models but also the invalidity of cored models. For DDO
"101, the large uncertainty in its distance further chal-"
lenges the reliability of its cuspy profile (Read et al.
2016b). Studies of local dwarf spheroidal galaxies also
"suggest cuspy profiles in few objects, among which the"
highest-probability one is Draco with a central density
slope of -1.0 at 5.0-σ and 6.8-σ by Jardel et al. (2013)
"and Hayashi et al. (2020), respectively. However, it has"
not been demonstrated whether a cored model can fit
"the data or not for this object, as done for DDO 101."
"And furthermore, systematic uncertainties are compli-"
cated for these studies in which the velocity dispersion
among individual stars as a function of the galactic ra-
dius are used to measure the dark matter distribution.
"The orbital anisotropy, the method to model stellar or-"
"bits, the dark-matter shape and the limited number of"
the member stars are all found to affect the conclusions
"(Evans et al. 2009). Especially, a recent study of simu-"
lated galaxies by Chang & Necib (2020) emphasized the
importance of a large amount of stars in order to unam-
biguously measure the dark matter distribution. If the
"number of stars is less than 10000, an intrinsic cored pro-"
file cannot be differentiated reliably from a cuspy profile.
"For Draco, there are only ∼468 member stars (Walker
et al. 2015). Fortunately, these systematic uncertainties"
are significantly eliminated for HI interferometric data
as seen in simulated galaxies (Kuzio de Naray et al. 2009;
Kuzio de Naray & Kaufmann 2011). This is mainly be-
cause gas is collisional and their dynamics can be rela-
tively easily described by titled-ring models (Begeman
"1989; Di Teodoro & Fraternali 2015). In summary, the"
above few claimed cuspy profiles of dark halos are not
definitive.
There are two solutions to the small scale controversies
of ΛCDM. One is to modify the nature of dark matter
"so that it is no longer cold but instead self-interacting,"
fuzzy or warm. These modifications can retain the prop-
erties of the universe on large scales as predicted by
ΛCDM but resolve its small-scale challenges. Fuzzy cold
"dark matter, also known as ultralight scalar particles,"
has a mass around 10−22 eV (e.g. Hu et al. 2000; Schive
et al. 2014). The uncertainty principle of its wave nature
"acts on kpc scales, smoothing the density fluctuations"
and preventing the growth of small halos and formation
of central cusps. The self-interacting dark matter trans-
ports “heat” (higher velocity dispersion) from the outer
region to the “cooler” inner region of a halo. It leads to
a constant density core with isothermal velocity disper-
sion (e.g. Spergel & Steinhardt 2000; Rocha et al. 2013;
"Tulin & Yu 2018). If dark matter is warm, it decou-"
"ples from the primordial plasma at relativistic velocity,"
thus free streaming out of small density peaks. As a
"result, the structure formation at small scales are sup-"
pressed (e.g. Avila-Reese et al. 2001; Lovell et al. 2014).
Warm dark matter scenario is found to have a “catch-
"22” problem, i.e., if the “cusp-core” problem is resolved,"
the requirement for the particle mass cannot form small
"galaxies at the first place, and vice versa (e.g. Macciò"
et al. 2012).
Another solution is to keep cold dark matter paradigm
but invoke efficient gravitational interaction between
dark matter and baryonic matter through stellar feed-
back (Navarro et al. 1996; Governato et al. 2010). Over-
"all, as gas falls into the inner region of the halo, star for-"
mation takes place and the subsequent feedback through
supernovae expels an appreciable amount of gas and
stars to large radii. These baryonic matter pulls dark
matter particles to migrate outward through pure gravi-
"tational interaction, lowering the central density of dark"
matter. The overall efficiency of this interaction and
its effects are still under investigations (Di Cintio et al.
2014; Read et al. 2016a; Tollet et al. 2016; Bose et al.
2019; Beńıtez-Llambay et al. 2019; Read et al. 2019). In
"addition to the stellar feedback, other mechanisms have"
"also been proposed, such as dynamical friction between"
gas clouds and dark matter particles (Nipoti & Binney
2015).
A definitive cuspy profile from observations will prove
the validity of the cold dark matter paradigm on sub-
galactic scales while challenging other types of dark mat-
"ter. As shown in Figure 1, the object AGC 242019 is"
an ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) identified by the Arecibo
Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey of Hi galaxies
(Leisman et al. 2017). This galaxy has a stellar mass
"of (1.37±0.05)×108 M� , a HI mass of (8.51±0.36)×108
M� and a star formation rate of (8.2±0.4)×10−3 M�
yr−1 as listed in Table 1. Its receding velocity is"
"2237±25 km s−1 after correcting for the Virgo, Great
Attractor and Shapley supercluster (Mould et al. 2000)."
"In the cosmological frame of h=0.73, Ω0=0.27 and"
"ΩΛ=0.73, the corresponding distance is 30.8 Mpc and"
A cuspy halo 3
"the uncertainty is estimated to be 5%, given that it is"
an isolated field galaxy (see § 4.2).

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION
2.1. Radio interferometric observation of Hi gas with
the VLA
Our L-band observations were performed with the
Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) through two
projects corresponding to the D configuration (19B-072;
PI: Y. Shi) and to the C and B configurations (20A-004;
"PI: Y. Shi). The D-configuration observations were per-
formed on 21st and 23rd Sep. 2019, each with a 1.5-hr"
"observing time and a ∼ 66 min on-source time. A to-
tal of 27 antennas were employed in both executions,"
with the first under overcast weather conditions and the
second under clear weather conditions. The projected
baselines of the D-configuration array are in the range
of 34–1050 m. The flux and bandpass calibrator was
"3C 295, and the gain calibrator was J 1419+0628. We"
configured the spectrometers with a mixed setup. The
spectral line window that covers the Hi 21-cm line has
a bandwidth of 128 MHz and a channel width of 32.3
"kHz (∼ 6.9 km s−1), while the remaining windows cover
a frequency range between 963.0 MHz and 2017.0 MHz"
to optimize the sensitivity for the radio continuum.
The C-configuration observations were performed on
"4th, 9th and 13th Feb. 2020, each with a 2-hr observing"
time and a ∼ 90 min on-source time. Two observations

C configuration are in the range of 40–3200 m. In the C-
"configuration observations, the 21-cm emission line was"
observed with a spectral line widow that has a channel
"width of 5.682 kHz (∼ 1.2 km s−1) and a bandwidth
of 32 MHz. The remaining windows cover a frequency"

was J 1419+0628.

The B-configuration observation was performed with
"five executions during July and August of 2020, each"
"with a 2-hr observing time and a ∼ 90 min on-source
time. In most executions, 27 antennas were employed"
under cloudy conditions. The projected baselines of the
B-configuration are in the range of 230–11000 m. The
hardware setup and the calibrators were the same as
those used for the C-configuration observations.
We reduced all data manually with the Common As-
tronomy Software Applications (CASA) package (Mc-
"Mullin et al. 2007), v5.6.1. Both D-configuration ob-"
servations were severely affected by radio frequency in-
terferences (RFI). Therefore we calibrated and flagged
the data manually. Approximately 20% of the data have
"to be flagged, across different frequency ranges. The"
"data obtained on 21st Sep. 2019, including the cali-"
"brators, has about three times higher noise than that"
"estimated from the VLA sensitivity estimator, due to"
"unknown reasons. However, the fluxes, line profile, and"
spatial distributions are highly consistent with the data
obtained on 23rd Sep. 2019. Whether combine it to the
final data does not change the results. All gain calibra-
"tors were checked carefully to ensure a flat bandpass, a"
point-source distribution and excellent calibration solu-
"tions. The 1.4 GHz flux densities of 3C 286, 3C 295 and"
"J 1419+0628 were 15.1±0.1 Jy, 22.3±0.1 Jy, and 6.0±0.1
Jy."
"After flagging and calibration, we weighted all dataset"
"with their noise levels using the statwt task. Then,"
"through the uvcontsub task, we fitted and subtracted"

to match with the spectral resolution of the D-array
"data, using the mstransform task. The final spectrally"
"matched line-only data from the D, C, and B configura-"
tions were combined together with the concat task.
"In the end, we inverted the visibility data to the image"
plane and cleaned the data cube with Briggs’ robust pa-
rameter of 2.0 using the tclean task. The final D+C+B
datacube has a velocity coverage of 500 km s−1 and a
"channel width of 32 kHz, corresponding to a velocity"
"resolution of ∼ 7 km s−1. The r.m.s. noise level reaches

6 Shi et al.
"HI gas mass is (8.51±0.36)×108 M� . A slightly higher
flux as seen by VLA in the red wing may be caused by a"

given a large size of the galaxy that is two arcmins in
the diameter. The radial profile of the gas mass surface
density is shown in Figure 2 (c). The channel map is
shown in Figure 3.
We also tested tilted-ring modeling with the combined
data using the B+C configurations and found essentially
"no difference, except for a higher noise level. Though the"
better velocity resolution leads to better estimates of the
"pressure support, which has a very minor contribution"
to the decomposition of the rotation curve.
2.2. Broad-band images
The co-added images at 3.6 and 4.5 µm were obtained
from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)
archive (Wright et al. 2010) with spatial resolutions of
"6.0′′ and 6.8′′, respectively. The target is well detected"
"at 3.6 µm as presented in Figure 4 (a), but shows al-"
most no detection at 4.5 µm. To derive the radial profile
of the stellar mass surface density as presented in Fig-
"ure 4 (b), a few nearby bright stars in the field were sub-"
tracted using the stellar point spread functions1. The
stellar mass based on the 3.6 µm image is estimated
"to be (1.37±0.05)×108 M� for a Kroupa stellar ini-
tial mass function and a mass-to-light ratio Υ3.6µm=0.6"
"(M�/L�,3.6µm) (see below)."
The optical g and r images were obtained from
the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Surveys (Dey et al.
2019). The far-ultraviolet image was retrieved from the
GALEX data archive. The integrated flux was converted
"to a star formation rate of (8.2±0.4)×10−3 M� yr−1 for
a Kroupa stellar initial mass function (Leroy et al. 2008)."
2.3. Integral field unit observation of Hα by ANU 2.3
Integral field unit observations of Hα were carried out
with the Wide-Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) onboard the
Australian National University 2.3 m telescope on the
"nights of 21st-22nd Mar., 26th May and 20th-22nd Jul.,"
2020. An R7000 grism (5290-7060Å) at a resolution of
7000 was adopted to cover the Hα emission line. WiFeS
"has a field of view of 25′′×38′′. As shown in Figure 4 (a),
exposures were taken at several positions to cover the"
"whole optical extent of the galaxy, with one pointing"
toward a nearby bright star for astrometric calibration.
"Each exposure was 30 mins, and the total on-source inte-"
gration time varied from 2.0 hrs to 3.5 hrs at each pixel.
1http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allsky/expsup/sec4 4c.html
"For every 1–2 hrs, an off-target blank sky and a stan-"
dard star were observed. The seeing was between 1.5′′
and 2.0′′. Each frame was first reduced following the
"standard procedure by pyWiFeS (Childress et al. 2014),"
and then was subtracted by the median value of the
sky frame at each wavelength. Individual frames were
aligned with each other to produce the final mosaic im-
"age using the positions of the Hα clumps, as the con-"
tinuum emission was too faint. The absolute astrom-
etry was obtained through alignment with the bright-
est star in the mosaic field of view. Since Hα clumps
"are not perfect point sources, we estimated the final as-"
trometric uncertainty to be about 1′′. To correct the
barycentric velocity offset and any possible intrinsic in-
"strumental shift, the wavelength solution of each night"
was further cross-calibrated based on Hα lines of the
same clumps observed during different nights. The in-
tegrated Hα flux map is presented in Figure 4 (c) with
the integrated spectrum shown in Figure 4 (d).
3. DATA ANALYSIS
3.1. The derivation of the rotation curve of dark
matter
We derived the rotation curve of the dark matter by
first obtaining the total rotation curve from the Hi and
"Hα data with a correction for the pressure support, and"
then quadratically subtracting the gas and stellar grav-
ity contributions as detailed below.
"3.1.1. The observed rotation curve from titled-ring fitting
to the Hi datacube"
We fitted the tilted-ring model to the Hi 3-D datacube
with 3DBarolo (Di Teodoro & Fraternali 2015) to ob-
tain the rotation curve as listed in Table 2. The radial
"width of each ring is set to be 9′′, which is roughly the"
beam size so that each ring is independent. We adopted
uniform weighting (WFUNC=0) and least-squared min-
imization (FTYPE=1). All other optional parameters
are set as default. The full list of the set-up is included
in Table A1.
The angular resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio
"were good enough to set the rotation velocity, the veloc-"
"ity dispersion, the position angle and the inclination an-"
gle as free parameters for each ring. Before running this
"setup, we first ran a model by also setting the dynamic"
"center and the systematic velocity as free parameters,"
and then fixed them to the mean values of all rings as
listed in Table 1.
"The scale height was fixed to 100 pc, independent of"
the radius. If the height is varied by a factor of five
"(see below), the conclusion remains unchanged. We do"
notice that 3DBarolo is not able to remove effects fully

"When running 3DBarolo, we adopted the “twostage”"
"fitting method, which allows a second fitting stage after"
regularizing the first-stage parameter sets. As shown
"in Figure 5, the radial profiles of the inclination and"
position angles from the first-stage fitting are regularized
"by fitting a Bezier function, based on which the second-"
stage fitting is performed. The errors of the derived
rotation velocity and velocity dispersion in 3DBarolo

"velocities from three runs are within 1-σ errors, while"
the velocity dispersions are also within errors except for
"the innermost radius, which is shown in Figure B1 of"
"Appendix. As shown in Figure 5, the derived rotation"
velocity and velocity dispersion vary well within the 1-σ
error bars before and after regularization.
"As shown in Figure 6, within the outer boundary of"

"nated by the observed flux noise, and the residuals of"
the velocity and velocity dispersions show small ampli-

"small, with |Vcirc−Vrot| being smaller than ∼1.0 km s−1
across the radius. In this case, only the error of Vrot
is propagated to Vcirc while ignoring the error of VA."
"The radial profile of Vcirc is referred to as the observed
rotation curve."
Note that our Hi data have a spectral resolution of
7 km s−1 which is comparable to or even lower than
the derived velocity dispersion shown in Figure 5. To
"check the effect of the limited spectral resolution, we"
also performed tilted-ring fitting on the Hi datacube
from the B and C configurations that has a spectral
resolution of 2.4 km s−1. The difference in the velocity
"dispersion between the two data is within the 1-σ error,"
and the difference in the derived rotation curve is within
the 1-σ error too.
3.1.2. The observed rotation curve from the Hα map
The Hα emission is clumpy and sporadic across the
"disk. As a result, tilted-ring modeling cannot be per-"
formed for the Hα data in the same way as for the Hi
"data. Instead, we adopted the same ring parameters"

and 5.77 mJy km s−1."
"from the Hi data, including the center position, incli-"
"nation angle, and position angle, to convert the line-"
of-sight velocities into the rotation curve. As shown
"in Figure 4 (c), we used a circular aperture with a ra-"
dius of 2′′ to extract the spectrum of the Hα region and
"measured the line-of-sight velocity, whose error was es-"
"timated through a Monte Carlo method, by randomly"
inserting a Gaussian error at each data point and iter-
ating one thousand times.
The velocity was then converted into the rotation
curve with the following steps. 1) We first correct for the
absolute wavelength of the optical IFU data by compar-
ing the Hα velocity to the Hi velocity at the same posi-
tion. 2) The line-of-sight velocity is then converted into
"the rotation velocity by Vrot=Vl.o.s/sin(i)/cos(θ), where"
i is the inclination angle and θ is the azimuthal angle
from the major axis in the plane of the un-projected
"disk. Here, the inclination angle and position angle are"
also interpolated based on the result from the Hi fitting.
3) The dynamical center from the Hi ring is adopted.

"Figure 8. The rotation velocities from the line of sight
velocities based on the Hi ’s ring parameters. These velocities
are further rebinned with a radial bin of 1.0 kpc."
4) Individual velocities are then rebinned at a width of
1.0 kpc to have enough points to obtain the mean value.
Except for the outermost bin where only one datapoint
"is available, the error of the mean is obtained through"
"the Monte Carlo method, which fits a mean value after"
it randomly inserts a Gaussian error at each data point
and iterates one thousand times. To obtain the pres-
"sure support correction for the Hα, we assumed that"
the radial shape of the Hα gas mass surface density and
velocity dispersions are similar to those of Hi (Adams
et al. 2014). The velocity dispersions of the Hα clumps
after correcting for the thermal broadening (10 km s−1)
are about the same as that of Hi at similar locations. As
"a result, we adopted the VP from the Hi data to correct"
for the Hα rotation velocity.
Since our Hα emission is sporadic and the errors of the
"rotation curve are only based on those detected regions,"
we used the Hα rotation curve as a sanity check of the
Hi curve.
"3.1.3. The contribution to the rotation curve from the
gravity of gas"
The radial profile of the gas mass surface density de-
rived from the tilted-ring modeling is shown in Fig-
ure 2 (c). We used this profile to estimate the gas ro-
tation curve using the ROTMOD task (Begeman 1989) in
the GIPSY package. The gas mass has been corrected
for helium by multiplying it by a factor of 1.36. The
vertical distribution of the gas disk is assumed to be
10 Shi et al.
“SECH-SQUARED” with a scale height of 0.1 kpc. By
"varying the gas mass surface density with its error, we"
used the Monte-Carlo method to estimate the uncer-
tainty of the rotation curve. We then varied the scale
height from 0.02 kpc to 0.5 kpc to quantify the effect of
the scale-height uncertainty on the rotation curve. The
two types of errors were summed quadratically to get
the final error.
"3.1.4. The contribution to the rotation curve from the
gravity of stars"
"To estimate the stellar mass distribution, we first de-"
rived the radial profile of the 3.6 µm surface brightness
"at a bin width of 3′′, half of the resolution FWHM."
The ellipse parameters derived by the above Hi dynam-
"ical modeling were used, for which the inclination angle"
and the position angle were interpolated. We then con-
verted this brightness into the stellar mass profile using
"Υ3.6µm=0.6 M�/L�,3.6µm with a Kroupa stellar initial"
"mass function (see below), as shown in Figure 4 (b). To"
"extend the profile to 10 kpc, an exponential disk was"
fitted to the part outside a radius of 4 kpc.
To measure the stellar contribution to the rotation
"curve, we use the ROTMOD task (Begeman 1989) in"
"GIPSY, where the vertical distribution was assumed to"
be “SECH-SQUARED” with a scale height of 0.2 kpc.
The errors of the stellar mass surface density are dom-
inated by the subtraction of the sky background and
its effects on the rotation curve are simulated with the
Monte Carlo method. We also varied the scale height
from 0.01 kpc to 0.5 kpc to obtain the uncertainty due
to the scale height. The above two errors were quadrat-
ically added to represent the final error of the stellar
rotation curve.
3.2. The models of dark matter halo
The models of cuspy dark matter halo are moti-
"vated by numerical simulations of dark matter, including"
a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) model (Navarro et al.
1997) and an Einasto model (Einasto 1965). The models
"of cored dark matter halo are observatinally motivated,"
including the pseudo-isothermal (ISO) model (Begeman
et al. 1991) and Burkert model (Burkert 1995).
1) A NFW halo model (Navarro et al. 1997) has a
density profile of
"ρNFW(R) =
ρcδchar"
"(R/RS)(1 +R/RS)2
, (4)"
"where ρc=3H
2/(8πG) is the present critical density,"
δchar is dimensionless density contrast and RS is the
scale radius. RS is related to R200 through the con-
"centration c=R200/RS , where R200 is the radius within"
which the halo average density is 200 times the present
"critical density. δchar =
200c3g"
"3
with g = 1"
ln(1+c)−c/(1+c) .
"The halo mass with R200 is M200 =
100H2R3200"
"G
. The in-"
ner density profile of the NFW model shows a cusp with
"ρ ∝ R−1. The corresponding rotation velocity of the
NFW model is"
VNFW(R) = V200
"√
ln(1 + cx)− cx/(1 + cx)
x [ln(1 + c)− c/(1 + c)]"
where V200 is the circular velocity at R200 with
"V200=R200h, and x=R/R200."
2) A pseudo-isothermal halo model (Begeman et al.
1991) is observationally motivated to describe the pres-
ence of a central core:
"ρISO(R) =
ρ0"
"1 + (R/RC)2
, (6)"
where ρ0 is the central density and RC is the core radius
of the halo. The rotation velocity is
VISO(R) =
"√
4πGρ0R"
"arctan(
R"
= Vnorm
"√
(
RC
R1"
")2
[
1−"
"arctan(
R"
"where Vnorm = R1
√"
4πGρ0 and R1=1 kpc.
3) The Burkert density profile (Burkert 1995) is de-
scribed by
"ρBk(R) =
ρ0R"
"(R+RC)(R2 +R
2
C)
, (8)"
where ρ0 and RC are the central core density and core
"radius, respectively."
The corresponding circular velocity is given by
VBk(R) = VC
"√
2 ln(1 + x) + ln(1 + x2)− 2 arctan(x)"
"x [3 ln(2)− 2 arctan(1)]
,"
where x=R/Rc and VC is the circular velocity at the
core radius.
"4) With the rotation curve of a dark matter halo, the"
density profile of the halo can be derived through (de

3.3. Priors and set-ups of the rotation curve modeling
We fitted the above three dark-matter models to the
rotation curve of dark matter through Bayesian infer-
ence with the Python code PyMC3 (Salvatier et al. 2016).
We adopted the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) with 5000
"samples, 2000 tune, 4 chains and target accept=0.99."
"As listed in Table 3, the prior of each parameter of"
a dark-matter model is described with a bounded nor-
"mal distribution, whose lower-limit bound is set to be"
zero. The mean of the distribution is set with some
"prior knowledge as detailed below, and the standard de-"
viation is set to be twice the mean.
The prior R200 of the NFW model is set to have a
"mean of 75 kpc, corresponding to a halo mass of 5×1010"

(Santos-Santos et al. 2016). At this halo mass, the halo"
concentration is about 10 in simulations (Macciò et al.
"2007), giving the mean prior RS of 7.5 kpc."
Since the core radius of a cored dark-matter halo is
"on a kpc scale (Oh et al. 2015), the mean prior RC
of the ISO model is set to be 2 kpc. The mean prior"
"Vnorm of the ISO model is thus set to be 25 km s

that the galaxy is on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation-

"(1.37±0.05)×108 M� and a HI mass of (8.51±0.36)×108
M� . Similarly, the mean prior RC of the Burkert model"
"is set to be 2 kpc, and the mean prior VC of the model"
is set to be 35 km s−1.
The fitting is convergent. By exploring the full pos-
"terior distribution, the best-fitted parameter is given as"
"the mean of the distribution, and the error is given by"
"the standard deviation, as well as the 3% and 97% High-"
est Posterior Density (HPD). The percentage of small
Pareto shape diagnostic values (k < 0.7) is also listed.
A larger diagnostic value indicates that the model is
mis-specified.

Two datasets are overall consistent with each other in
the overlap region. The rotation curve rises all the way
up to the last measurable radius.
Figure 9 (b) shows the rotation curve of dark matter
after quadratically subtracting the gas and stellar grav-
ity contributions. The sampling of the Hi curve is at
"the beam size, while the Hα curve has a radial bin of"
"1.0 kpc. As shown in the figure, the Hα curve is overall"
well consistent with the Hi curve over the spatial extent
"where both dataset cover. As mentioned before, since"
the Hα emission is sporadic and the errors of the Hα ro-
"tation curve are only based on the detected regions, its"
rotation curve is only used for the sanity check of the Hi
curve. We fitted the Hi curve with two spherical halo
"models, namely, the NFW model (Equation 5, Navarro"
"et al. 1997) and the ISO model (Equation 7, Begeman"
"et al. 1991), through the Python code PyMC3 (Salvatier"
"et al. 2016) to represent the cuspy and cored profiles, re-"
"spectively. The ISO model is too steep at the inner radii,"
whereas the NFW model matches the observed data in
"the overall fitting, which is also illustrated by the fit-"

ting residuals as shown in Figure 10. To quantitatively
"discriminate the two models, we performed a leave-one-"
out (LOO) predictive check (Vehtari et al. 2015). We
found that the estimated effective number of parame-
ters (ploo=1.6) of the NFW model is smaller than the
"real number of free parameters, i.e., two, while that of"
"the ISO model has ploo=6.3, significantly larger than"
two (see Table 4). This quantitatively indicates that
"the NFW model is valid, while the ISO model is ruled"
out. The corresponding difference in the reduced χ2 is
"1.9 for d.o.f.=5, equivalent to a Gaussian significance of"
"3.0-σ. As listed in Table 4, some Pareto diagnostic value"
"k of the ISO model is larger than 0.7, further indicating"
that the model is mis-specified. We also run the fitting
"by including the Hα , and obtained similar difference in"
"ploo values and ∆(χ
2/d.o.f.)=2.8 for d.o.f.=9 between"
"the two models, equivalent to a Gaussian significance of"
5.0-σ.
The Burkert model is another observationally-
motivated formula to describe a cored dark matter halo
"(Equation 9, Burkert 1995). Its density profile is flat"
"toward the center, which is like the ISO model, but has"
"a power law index of -3.0 toward infinity, which is like"
"the NFW model. As shown in Figure 9 (b), the Burk-"
"ert model gives a bad fitting too, with ploo=4.4, much"
larger than (1.6) that of the NFW model.
The best-fitted NFW model has a halo scale radius
"of ∼33 kpc. Such a large cusp is well spatially resolved
given that its size relative to the Hi beam is 24. This"
suggests that the presence of the cusp is not an artifact
caused by a limited spatial resolution (de Blok et al.
2001; Oh et al. 2015). The dark-matter halo has a mass
"of (3.5±1.2)×1010 M� within R200, the radius at which
the average halo density is 200 times the average cosmic"
density. Due to the fact that the rotation curve does
"not reach the flat part, the constraints on the R200 (or"
Mhalo) and RS do not reach a small error. But a small
"halo concentration of only 2.0±0.36 is conclusive. This
is much smaller than the median concentration of 15 at"
the same halo mass in the local Universe (Macciò et al.
2007). The implication of this small concentration on
"the formation of the galaxy is discussed in § 5.3.
To constrain the innermost density slope αinnermost"
"of the dark matter halo, we derived the density profile"
of dark matter from the rotation curve (de Blok et al.
2001) as shown in Figure 11. Following de Blok et al.
"(2001) and Oh et al. (2015), we measured αinnermost by"
carrying out the least-square fitting to the density pro-
14 Shi et al.
"file within the break radius, and defined the error of"
αinnermost as the difference between the result including
the first data-point outside the break radius and the re-
sult including only data-points within the break radius.
Here the break radius is the radius where the density
profile shows a maximum change in the slope. If adopt-
ing the core radius of the best-fitted ISO model as the
"break radius, αinnermost=-(0.96± 0.12). If adopting the
scale radius of the best-fitted NFW model as the radius,"
"αinnermost=-(0.90±0.08). Here the error is given by the
least square fitting since the scale radius of the NFW"
model is larger than the last ring. Two measurements
indicates a statistical significance of about 10-σ that the
dark matter halo of AGC 242019 is cuspy down to a ra-
dius of 0.67 kpc .
4.2. The systematic uncertainties of the dark-matter
rotation curve
The identification of a cuspy profile in AGC 242019
is robust against systematic uncertainties from several
aspects.
(1) Position and inclination angles: Since these
two angles have been set as free parameters during the
"fitting, their uncertainties have already been included"
"in the derived rotation curve. For comparison, we fur-"
ther estimated the photometric position and inclination
angles based on the r-band image. The galaxy in the
"r-band is somewhat asymmetric with clumpy features,"
"but outside the radius of 8′′, the position angle and incli-"
"nation angles converge to (2±2)◦ and (67±3)◦, respec-
tively. These results are consistent with the values de-"
"rived from the dynamic fitting of the Hi data, as shown"
in Figure 5 and listed in Table 2.
(2) Mass-to-light ratio in 3.6 µm: The rotation
velocity due to stellar gravity is proportional to the
square root of the stellar mass-to-light ratio. The over-
all stellar contribution to the observed rotation curve is
"small, so our result is not sensitive to the mass-to-light"
"ratio Υ3.6µm, as is detailed here. The mass-to-light ratio"
in a broad band is obtained by fitting a synthetic spec-
trum to the observed spectrum or a broad-band spec-
tral energy distribution. The uncertainties of the stellar
"population synthesis model, the star formation history,"
"the dust extinction, the metallicity and the initial mass"
function all result in the variation of the derived mass-
to-light ratio.
With the measured stellar mass and star formation
"rate of AGC 242019, we assumed a low metallicity"
with [Fe/H]=-1 and suppressed asymptotic giant branch
"(AGB) stars, as seen in some low surface brightness"
"dwarfs (Schombert et al. 2019), to derive the Υ3.6µm of"
our target to be 0.6 (Schombert et al. 2019). The pre-
ceding assumption about AGB stars causes the mass-
"to-light ratio to be ∼ 30% larger than that in normal
galaxies. Υ3.6µm is also color dependent (Bell et al. 2003;"
Zibetti et al. 2009; Jarrett et al. 2013; Meidt et al. 2014;
Shi et al. 2018; Schombert et al. 2019; Telford et al.
"2020). As the object is not detected in 4.5 µm, we used"
"the radial variation in g − r color with a median of 0.3
and standard deviation of 0.03. Converting to B − V
= 0.98*(g − r) + 0.22 (Jester et al. 2005), the variation
in Υ3.6µm is expected to have a standard radial devia-"
"tion as small as 0.02 dex (Schombert et al. 2019), and"
"thus, its effects on the rotation curve of dark matter are"
negligible.
The systematic uncertainties due to the difference in
"star formation histories, initial mass functions and stel-"
lar population models among different studies are much
larger even at a fixed color (Bell et al. 2003; Zibetti et al.
2009; Jarrett et al. 2013; Meidt et al. 2014; Schombert
"et al. 2019; Telford et al. 2020). As a result, we adopted"
0.1 dex as the 1-σ error to encompass the results in
"different studies. We then varied Υ3.6µm by ±3σ to in-
vestigate its effect on the rotation curve of dark matter."
"As listed in Table 4 and shown in Figure 12, the cusp-"
like NFW model is a more reasonable model than the
core-like ISO model for both Υ3.6µm values.
(3) Distance: The velocities due to baryonic gravity
"vary with the square root of the distance, while the ob-"
served rotation curve is independent of the distance. As
the object is an isolated galaxy with no close-by com-
panion that is brighter than mr = 17.7 (or Mr = -14.8)
within 500 kpc and 1000 km s−1 in the Sloan Digital
"Sky Survey, the error in the distance is dominated by"
the uncertainty of the Hubble constant and the peculiar
velocity. The heliocentric velocity is 2237 km s−1 af-
"ter correcting for the Virgo, Great Attractor and Shap-"
ley supercluster (Mould et al. 2000). We estimated the
"residual error to be 100 km/s, which corresponds to an"
infalling velocity toward an imaginary dark matter halo
with 1011 M� at a separation of 50 kpc. By adopting
a local Hubble constant of 73 km s−1 with 2.5% uncer-
"tainty (Riess et al. 2016), the distance thus has a 1-σ"
"uncertainty of 5%. We varied this distance by ±3σ to
investigate its effect on the dark-matter rotation curve."
"As listed in Table 4 and shown in Figure 12, the cusp-"
like NFW model is again advocated against the core-like
ISO model for both distances.
(4) The scale height of the gas disk: For a thick
"disk, emissions from adjacent rings are projected to be"
"in the same pixels, which causes a beam smearing and"
affects the measurements of the inclination and position
angles. By increasing and decreasing the scale height
"by a factor of five to 500 pc and 20 pc, respectively, the"

"(5) The noncircular motion: As shown in Figure 6,"
the median amplitude of the residual velocity obtained
"by 3DBarolo fitting is small, i.e., ∼2 km s−1. During
the fitting, the line-of-sight velocities are assumed to"
"be entirely circular motions, while noncircular motions"
cause the real circular velocity to be underestimated. To
"quantify the amplitude of noncircular motions, we car-"
ried out harmonic decomposition with the GIPSY task
RESWRI (Begeman 1989). As detailed in previous stud-
"ies (Schoenmakers et al. 1997; Trachternach et al. 2008),"
the line-of-sight velocity of each ring can be decomposed
"vlos(r) = vsys(r) + Σ
N
m=1(cm(r)cosmψ + sm(r)sinmψ),"
where r is the radial distance of each ring from the
"dynamical center, vsys(r) is the system velocity, ψ is"
the azimuthal angle in the plane of the disk. vlos(r) =
vsys(r)+c1(r)cosψ corresponds to a pure circular motion
"scenario. In this study, we expanded the velocity up to"
"m=3, as has been adopted in other studies (Schoenmak-"
ers et al. 1997; Trachternach et al. 2008).
"To run RESWRI, we used the 2-D velocity field pro-"
"duced by 3DBarolo as the input, fixed the dynami-"
cal center and system velocity to those determined by
"3DBarolo, and set the rotation velocity, inclination an-"
gle and position angle of each ring as free parameters.
"With the derived cm and sm, the amplitude of each non-"
circular harmonic component with m >1 is defined as
"Am(r) =
√
c2m(r) + s"
"2
m(r) (12)"
"and for m=1 where c1 is the circular motion,"
"A1(r) =
√
s21(r). (13)"
The total amplitude of noncircular motion is given by
"Atot(r) =
√
s21(r) + c"
"2
2(r) + s"
"2
2(r) + c"
"2
3(r) + s"
"2
3(r). (14)"
The measured harmonic component can be used to
quantify the elongation of the potential �pot at each ra-
dius as follows:
"�potsin2φ2 = (s3 − s1)
1 + 2q2 + 5q4"
"c1(1− q4)
, (15)"
where φ2 is an unknown angle between the minor axis of
the elongated ring and the observer in the plane of the
"ring and q = cos i, with i being the inclination angle of"
the disk.
Figure 13 shows the result of the harmonic decomposi-
"tion. As shown in Figure 13 (a), the radial cm fluctuates"
"around 0 km/s with amplitudes . 2 km/s. The radial
sm shows similar behaviors with amplitude . 2 km/s.
As a result, the Am of each harmonic component is in"
"general . 2 km/s. Figure 13 (d) shows that the total
amplitude Atot is only about 2 km/s. As shown in Fig-"
"ure 13 (c), all the amplitudes are small fractions of the"
circular velocities at the corresponding radii that are <
Compared to other galaxies with similar absolute
"magnitudes (Trachternach et al. 2008), AGC 242019 is"
16 Shi et al.
indeed a galaxy without stronger noncircular motions.
Compared to simulated galaxies where noncircular mo-
tions result in noticeable underestimations of circular
"velocities (Oman et al. 2019), the noncircular amplitude"
"of ∼ 2 km/s in AGC 242019 is much less than the sim-
ulated values of 20-30 km/s. Therefore, we expect that"
the noncircular motion of AGC 242019 should not affect
"the derived rotation curve of dark matter. Finally, the"
"derived �potsin2φ2, as shown in Figure 13 (f), suggests"
a spherical gravitational potential.
(6) The triaxiality of a dark matter halo: In this
"study a spherical dark matter halo is assumed, while a"
halo has been found to be moderately triaxial in nu-
merical simulations (Jing & Suto 2002; Bailin & Stein-
"metz 2005). However, a typical triaxial mass distribu-"
tion results in only a small deviation in the density from
the spherical assumption. Within the scale radius of
"the halo, the difference is only 10-20%, which is much"
smaller than the required variation of a factor of 3 to de-
crease the inner slope by 0.5 (Knebe & Wießner 2006).
Numerical modeling of the rotation curve further sug-
gests that the halo triaxiality cannot significantly change
the shape of the curve to make an intrinsic cusp to be
a core (or vice versa) in the observed data (Kuzio de
Naray et al. 2009; Kuzio de Naray & Kaufmann 2011).
(7) Beam smearing: 3DBarolo takes the beam
smearing into account in the tilted-ring fitting (Di
Teodoro & Fraternali 2015). 3DBarolo first builds a
gas disk in three spatial dimensions and three veloc-
"ity dimensions, and then convolves this artificial disk"
to the observed spatial resolution for comparison with
the observed 3-D datacube to derive the best-fitting pa-
rameters. It has been shown that 3DBarolo is able to
recover the rotation curve even at a low spatial reso-
"lution, i.e., two resolution elements over the semimajor"
axis (Di Teodoro & Fraternali 2015). The semimajor
"axis of AGC 242019 is resolved into ∼ 7 beams in the
Hi map. In addition, the Hα map has a rebinned spa-"
tial resolution (4′′ in diameter) that is two times higher
than the Hi map. Although our Hα clumps are mainly
distributed along the major axis with a narrower spa-
"tial extent, the overall shape of the Hα-derived curve"
"is consistent with the Hi curve, demonstrating that the"
beam smearing effect on the Hi ’s rotation curve has been
largely removed by 3DBarolo (Di Teodoro & Fraternali
2015).
(8) The contributions from molecular gas and
ionized gas: The very low surface density of AGC
242019 results in a low mid-plane pressure with a Pext/k
". 103 cm−3 K, which gives a molecular-to-atomic gas ra-
tio of . 5% (see their Figure 3 and Equation 12 in stud-
ies of nearby galaxies (Blitz & Rosolowsky 2006; Leroy"
et al. 2008)). We also checked that the atomic gas alone
is sufficient to place the galaxy in the extended Schmidt
"law (Shi et al. 2011, 2018), consistent with a negligible"
fraction of molecular gas.
The ionized gas mass can be estimated from the Hα
"luminosity by MHII = mp
LHa"
"3.56×10−25Ne
(Osterbrock &"
"Ferland 2006), where mp is the proton mass, LHa is the"
"Hα luminosity in erg/s, and Ne is the electron volume"
"density in cm−3. By assuming a low Ne of 100 cm
−3,"
"we found that, even at the peak spaxel as shown in Fig-"
"ure 4 (c), an ionized gas mass surface density of 0.025"
"M�/pc
2 is too small to affect the derived rotation curve"
of dark matter.
5. DISCUSSIONS
Through measurements of the dynamics of atomic and
"ionized gas, we demonstrate that the dark matter halo"
of AGC 242019 can be well fitted by the cuspy profile as
"described the NFW model, while excluding cored mod-"
els including ISO and Burkert ones. We here discuss
its constraints on the alternatives of standard cold dark
"matter, implications for the role of feedback and impli-"
cations for formation of UDGs.
5.1. Implications for the alternatives of standard cold
dark matter
5.1.1. Fuzzy cold dark matter
"Through numerical simulations, a halo of fuzzy cold"
dark matter is found to be composed of a soliton core
superposed on an extended halo (Hu et al. 2000; Schive
et al. 2014). The latter can be represented by the NFW
"model, while the former can be approximately described"
"ρc(r) ≈
1.9(mψ/10"
"−23eV)−2(Rc/kpc)
−4"
"[1 + 9.1× 10−2(r/Rc)2]
8"
"M�pc
−3,"
where mψ is the particle mass and Rc is the core radius.
The soliton core is linked to the total halo through the
"core-halo relationship (Schive et al. 2014), which gives"
"Rc = 1.6(mψ/10
−22eV)−1(Mh/10"
"9M�)
−1/3kpc. (17)"
"As shown in Figure 9 (b), a NFW model fits the den-"
"sity profile of AGC 242019 very well, which shows negli-"
gible residual density for the soliton core to account for.
"As a result, the possible contribution to the dark-matter"
density from the soliton core should not exceed the ob-
"served error at all radii, which can be used to constrain"
"the mψ. For each radius, we estimated the density of"
"the soliton core as a function of the particle mass mψ
with the best-fitted Mh=(3.5±1.2)×1010 M� through"
A cuspy halo 17
the above two equations. It is found that the measure-
ments at the innermost two radii give the strongest con-
straints on mψ. The 3-σ observed errors at two radii
"constrain the mψ range to be < 0.06×10−22 eV or >
2.7×10−22 eV . Compared to the constraint from Lyα
forest in which mψ < 1.0×10−22 eV or mψ > 23×10−22
eV, the dynamics of AGC 242019 gives a factor of about"
20 times smaller constraint on the upper-bound of the
"lower range. As shown in Figure 14 (a), if adopting the"
"3% HPD halo mass of 1.5×1010 M� , mψ < 0.11×10−22
eV or mψ > 3.3×10−22 eV whose upper-bound of the
lower range is still 10 times lower than the constraint by"
the Lyα forest. If somehow our error is underestimated
"by a factor of 2, the upperbound of the lower range only"
"increases by a factor of ∼ 1.6, and the lowerbound of the
upper range decreases by a factor of ∼ 1.2. Therefore,
the constraint by AGC 242019, along with the one from"
"the Lyα forest, is inconsistent with the typical mψ of"
"∼ 10−22 eV that is required to explain the dynamics of
other galaxies with cored dark-matter halos (Hu et al."
2000; Schive et al. 2014). It is thus found that there
is no mψ value that can reconcile all the observational
facts.
5.1.2. Self-interacting Dark Matter
Self-interacting dark matter transmit the kinetic en-
ergy from the outer part inward to form a constant den-
"sity core. For the interaction to be efficient, the scat-"
"tering rate per particle should be important, that is at"
least once over the galaxy age (Spergel & Steinhardt
2000; Rocha et al. 2013; Tulin & Yu 2018):
"Γ(r)tage≈ρ(r)(σ/m)vrms(r)tage∼1, (18)"
"where is Γ(r) is the scattering rate per particle, ρ(r) is"
"dark matter density at a radius of r, σ/m is the cross"
section per particle mass and vrms is the relative velocity
of dark matter particles. The above equation can be re-
written as:
"1 cm2/g
≈("
9.2 Gyr
"tage
)("
"0.01 M�/pc
3"
"ρ(r)
)("
50 km/s
"vrms
). (19)"
"For AGC 242019, the NFW model fits the rotation"
curve well down to the innermost radius. This sets the
upperlimit to the radius of a possible density core and
the lowerlimit to the above ρ(r) if dark matter is self-
interacting in AGC 242019. If the halo forms around
"z=2, we got tage = 10 Gyr. The vrms is set to be the"
"virial velocity at the virial radius, which is 47 km s−1 ."
we have σ/m < 1.63 cm2/g for AGC 242019.
"As shown in Figure 14 (b), existing studies prefer"
somewhat larger σ/m on galaxy scales (Elbert et al.
2015; Kaplinghat et al. 2016; Zavala et al. 2013) and
smaller values on cluster scales (Kahlhoefer et al. 2015;
Randall et al. 2008; Harvey et al. 2015; Kaplinghat et al.
2016). Such a velocity dependence of the cross section
seems to reconcile results over different scales (Kapling-
"hat et al. 2016). However, the cuspy dark matter halo of"
"AGC 242019 may challenge this simple picture, whose"
upperlimit to σ/m is somewhat in tension with the
lowerbound of the σ/m range as required by cored halos
of other dwarf galaxies.
5.1.3. Warm Dark Matter
"In warm dark matter, the density core has a size that"
can be approximately by Hogan & Dalcanton (2000);
Macciò et al. (2012)
r2core =
4πGQmax
"< v2rms >

where vrms is the velocity dispersion (i.e. the mass) of
the halo. Qmax is the maximum phase density as given
"Qmax = 1.64× 10−3(

ρcr"
"keV
)4"
"M� pc
−3"
"(km s−1)3
, (21)"
"where m is the mass of warm dark matter, ρL
ρcr"
is the
local density relative to the critical density.
"keV
= 0.37"
"(ρL/ρcr)0.25
∗ ("
"rcore
)0.5("
"< v2rms >
0.5"
)0.25.
"As shown in Figure 14 (c), the innermost radius of"
the cuspy halo of AGC 242019 leads to m > 0.23 keV .
The figure also includes the constraints from the LIT-
TLE THINGS galaxies (Oh et al. 2015) that are derived
from the core radius and the velocity at the outermost
measurable radius listed in their Table 2. It seems that
"there is no consistent mass range that can explain all ob-
servational facts. Warm dark matter is known to have"
a “catch-22” problem: the requirement for the particle
mass to solve the cuspy-core problem will result in no
formation of small galaxies at the first place. Our dis-
covery of a cuspy dark matter halo in AGC 242019 will
"further challenge the warm dark matter scenario, such"
"that, even on kpc scales, the required particle mass can-"
not reconcile with the constraint that accounts for cored
halos in some other dwarf galaxies.
5.1.4. The modified Newtonian dynamics
Unlike massive disk galaxies whose baryonic disk sur-
face density rises exponentially toward their galactic
"centers, AGC 242019 shows a much flatter profile with"
a density deficit in the central region. Such a distinct
spatial offset between the baryonic matter and the dy-
namical mass leads to an increasing baryonic matter

"relative to dark matter at larger radii, in contrast to"
galaxies in general. This can be quantified by the loga-
rithmic relationship between the observed radial accel-
eration and the baryonic radial acceleration as shown
in Figure 14 (d). From the inner (smaller symbols) to
"larger radii (larger symbols), the data are more closer to"
"no dark matter line, demonstrating the increasing bary-"
onic matter relative to the dark matter at larger radii.
The modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND)
paradigm (Milgrom 1983) has been proposed as an
alternative to dark matter theory for interpreting dy-
"namical features. However, MOND cannot explain the"
dynamics of AGC 242019 as specified by the radial
acceleration relationship shown in Figure 14 (d). The
"relationship has a slope of 0.15±0.11 as given by the
linear fitting of the data with errors on both axes (Kelly"
"2007). However, the MOND only allows a slope ranging"
A cuspy halo 19
from 1.0 in the classical regime to 0.5 at the low ac-
celeration limit by adjusting its fundamental constant
a0. The slope of AGC 242019 is thus 3.2-σ below the
"threshold in the MOND, although it lies on the the"
extrapolation of the relationship defined by late-type
galaxies (Lelli et al. 2017).

It is found that the effect of baryonic feedback on the
density profile of dark matter depends on the stellar-
to-halo mass ratio (M∗/Mhalo) (e.g. Di Cintio et al.
"2014; Tollet et al. 2016), as shown in Figure 15. In"
"the low M∗/Mhalo regime (< 0.01%), the feedback is"
not strong enough to expel baryons and no dark-matter
"core forms. In the high M∗/Mhalo regime (> 3%),"
the significant contribution to the potential from bary-
onic matter cancels out the feedback effect and even
"produces a cuspier profile. In between, the stellar"
feedback can efficiently alter the density profile and a
flattest density profile forms around M∗/Mhalo=0.6%.
The above result is independent of model parameters
"such as star formation threshold, initial mass func-"
"tion, supernovae energy etc. However, AGC 242019"
"has a stellar mass of (1.37±0.05)×108 M� and a halo
mass of (3.5±1.2)×1010 M� , leading to M∗/Mhalo of
(0.39±0.13)% , which is close to the ratio where a flat-
test slope should form in simulations. AGC 242019 is"

thus inconsistent with the above M∗/Mhalo dependence
of the inner dark-matter profile.
Some other studies emphasize the importance of star
formation threshold on the effect of the stellar feed-
back (e.g. Governato et al. 2010; Beńıtez-Llambay et al.
"2019). If the threshold for gas to form stars is high, a"
large amount of gas can accumulate in the center of a
halo and dominate the potential before star formation
takes place. The subsequent feedback-driven massive
outflows or repeated multiple outflows alter the orbits
of dark matter to produce a dark-matter core. On the
"other hand, for low star formation threshold, gas is ex-"
pelled by feedback before it contributes significantly to
the potential. A dark-matter cuspy profile thus pre-
serves. This scenario at least partly explains the forma-
tion of dark-matter cores in some simulations (Di Cintio
et al. 2014; Fitts et al. 2017; Macciò et al. 2017) while not
in others (Bose et al. 2019). The simulation by Beńıtez-
Llambay et al. (2019) predicts an intact cuspy dark-
matter density profile independent of the M∗/Mhalo if
"star formation threshold is low. As shown in Figure 15,"
AGC 242019 is consistent with their prediction. As a
"UDG, AGC 242019 does have a low gas and stellar mass"
surface density with ongoing star formation as revealed
by the GALEX far-UV image. This indicates that on
sub-kpc scales star formation in AGC 242019 can pro-
ceed at a very low gas mass surface density that is on
"the order of 1 M�/pc
2 or 0.4×(100pc/h) cm−3, where h"
"is the scale height of the gas disk. However, its star for-"
mation efficiency (SFR/gas=0.03 Gyr−1) is much lower
"than that in spiral galaxies (∼0.3 Gyr−1) (Leroy et al.
2008; Shi et al. 2011), inconsistent with that adopted in"
"the simulations. Therefore, low star formation thresh-"
old should not be simply the physical cause for a cuspy
profile in AGC 242019.
"Besides the star formation threshold, the duration of"
star formation may be also important as recognized in
some simulations (Read et al. 2016a). As long as star
"formation proceeds long enough, e.g., ∼10 Gyr for a halo
mass of 109 M� and a longer timescale for a larger halo,"
a halo core always form. AGC 242019 has a halo mass of
"(3.5±1.2)×1010 M� , and its low concentration implies
late formation time (see next section), two of which may"
explain its cuspy profile given the above scenario.
5.3. Implications for formation of UDGs
UDGs are low-stellar-mass dwarfs but with sizes typ-
ical of spiral galaxies (Abraham & van Dokkum 2014;
Leisman et al. 2017). They were found in all environ-
"ments including galaxy clusters, galaxy groups and field."
Many mechanisms have been proposed to understand
their origin: they may be normal dwarf galaxies but ex-
perience star-formation feedback that re-distributes gas
and stars to larger radii (Governato et al. 2010; Di Cintio
et al. 2014; Jiang et al. 2019); they may live in a high-
spin dark matter halo with extended gas distributions
and low efficiencies in converting gas into stars (Amor-
isco & Loeb 2016); some environmental effects such as
ram-pressure stripping or tidal puffing may be also im-
portant in formation of UDGs (Yozin & Bekki 2015;
Jiang et al. 2019).
The dark matter halo of AGC 242019 has a mass of
"(3.5±1.2)×1010 M� , which is typical of a halo hosting
a dwarf. This suggests that AGC 242019 is not a failed"
"massive galaxy, unlike other UDGs found in clusters"
(van Dokkum et al. 2016; Beasley et al. 2016). Although
"UDGs may have diverse origins, our measurements are"
more reliable. In studies of van Dokkum et al. (2016)
"and Beasley et al. (2016), the halo mass was inferred"
from 1-2 velocity data-points by assuming a halo shape
especially the concentration.
The cuspy halo of AGC 242019 also suggests that the
feedback has not been strong over its history to expel
a large amount of baryonic matter to large distances.
"Otherwise, a cored halo should have already formed like"
in other dwarf galaxies as suggested by feedback mod-
els (Navarro et al. 1996; Governato et al. 2010). AGC
242019 thus has experienced weak feedback over its his-
tory. This seems to be consistent with the deviation of
UDGs from the Tully-Fisher relationship: gas and stars
are not expelled out of the disk so that a UDG contain
more baryons at a given maximum circular velocity that
roughly represents the halo mass (Mancera Piña et al.
2020). AGC 242019 has a maximum circular velocity
"of 47 km s−1 and a baryonic mass of (9.88±0.36)×108
M� , placing it slightly above the Tully-Fisher relation-"
ship too. With the accurate measurement of the halo
"mass, AGC 242019 is found to be off both the M∗
vs. Mhalo and Mbaryon vs. Mhalo relationships (Santos-"
Santos et al. 2016). The low SFR of AGC 242019 also
suggests weak ongoing stellar feedback as implied by the
relationship between the SFR and the ionized gas veloc-
ity dispersion (e.g. Yu et al. 2019). Our regular velocity
"field with small non-circular motion as shown in § 4.2 is
consistent with weak ongoing feedback too."
The halo of AGC 242019 has a small concentration
"of 2.0±0.36 , which is much smaller than the median
concentration of 15 at the same halo mass in the local"
Universe as expected from simulations (Macciò et al.
2007). This difference is most likely because that AGC
242019 is an isolated halo that origins from a tiny initial
density peak in the early time and collapses recently.
It is found that the halo concentration decreases with
later formation time (Zhao et al. 2003; Lu et al. 2006).
A cuspy halo 21
A “young” halo thus suggests late formation of AGC
"242019, which seems to be consistent with the findings"
of UDGs in cosmological simulations (Rong et al. 2017).
The specific angular momentum can be derived from
the rotation curve combined with the stellar and gas
mass profiles. The mass profiles were extended to 15 kpc
following the same procedure that estimates the bary-
"onic contribution to the rotation curve (see § 3.1.3 and
§ 3.1.4). The rotation curve is extended to 15 kpc too
by combining the best-fitted NFW rotation curve plus"
"the baryonic contribution. As shown in Figure 16 (a),"
it is found that AGC 242019 has an angular momentum
that is consistent with dwarf irregular galaxies at the
"same baryonic mass (Butler et al. 2017). However, as"
"discussed before, AGC 242019 has a higher baryon/halo"
mass ratio as compared to galaxies in general. We de-
rived the halo masses of dwarf irregulars following Butler
et al. (2017) and compared them with AGC 242019. As
"shown in Figure 16 (b), AGC 242019 still has a similar"
specific angular momentum at a given halo mass as com-
pared to the average of dwarf irregulars. The result may
be against the model that a UDG forms in a high-spin
dark matter halo (Amorisco & Loeb 2016).
"As shown in § 5.2, AGC 242019 has a low star forma-
tion efficiency, consistent with the model of Amorisco &"
Loeb (2016). If placing it on the extended star formation
"law (Shi et al. 2011, 2018), we found that AGC 242019"
follows the law as shown in Figure 16 (c). This suggests
that its low star formation efficiency is regulated by its
low stellar mass surface density.
"In summary, AGC 242019 forms in a dwarf-size halo"
"with late formation time. It has weak feedback, low"
star formation efficiency and a normal specific angular
momentum of baryons at a given halo mass.
6. CONCLUSIONS
We have carried out the spatially-resolved mapping of
"gas dynamics toward a nearby UDG, AGC 242019. It is"
found that AGC 242019 has a cuspy dark matter halo
"at a high confidence, which demonstrates the validity"
of the cold dark matter paradigm on subgalactic scales.
Our main conclusions are
(1) AGC 242019 has an overall regular velocity field.
"After subtracting the baryonic contribution, the rota-"
tion curve of dark matter is well fitted by the cuspy pro-
file as described by the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
"model, while the cored profiles including both the"
pseudo-isothermal and Burkert models are excluded.
The result is robust against various systematic uncer-
tainties.
(2) The central density slope of dark matter halo is
"found to be -(0.90±0.08) at the innermost radius of 0.67
kpc."
(3) AGC 242019 poses challenges to alternatives of
standard cold dark matter by constraining the particle
"mass of fuzzy dark matter to be < 0.11×10−22 eV, or >
3.3×10−22 eV , the cross section of self-interacting dark
matter to be < 1.63 cm2/g, and the particle mass of"
"warm dark matter to be > 0.23 keV, all of which are in"
tension with other constraints.
(4) AGC 242019 lies on the extrapolation of the radial
acceleration relationship as defined by spirals and dwarf
"galaxies. However, the slope of the relationship defined"
"by AGC 242019 is 0.15±0.11 , 3.2-σ below the threshold
(0.5) of the modified Newtonian dynamics."
"(5) In the cold dark matter paradigm, the cuspy halo"
of AGC 242019 thus supports the feedback scenario
that transforms cuspy halos to cored halos as frequently
"seen in other galaxies. However, the detailed physical"
process is unclear. The cuspy halo of AGC 242019 is
inconsistent with the stellar-to-halo-mass-ratio depen-
"dent model, while consistent with the star-formation-"
"threshold dependent model. But even for the later, the"
observed star formation efficiency (SFR/gas) is much
lower than what is adopted in simulations. It may be
consistent with the scenario that the duration of star
formation is the key driver.
"(6) As a UDG, AGC 242019 has a halo mass of"
"(3.5±1.2)×1010 M� , implying its formation in a dwarf-
size halo. The cuspy halo further suggests weak feedback"
over the history. The small concentration of its halo is
consistent with late formation time. Its specific angular
momentum of baryons is consistent with the average of
dwarf irregulars at a given halo/baryonic mass. Its star
"formation efficiency (SFR/gas) is low, probably due to"
the low stellar mass surface density.
