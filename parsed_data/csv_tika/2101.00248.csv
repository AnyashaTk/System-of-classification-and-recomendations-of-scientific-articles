ABSTRACT
"We characterize in detail the two ∼0.3 pc long filamentary structures found within the subsonic
region of Barnard 5. We use combined GBT and VLA observations of the molecular lines NH3(1,1)"
"and (2,2) at a resolution of 1800 au, as well as JCMT continuum observations at 850 and 450µm at a"
"resolution of 4400 au and 3000 au, respectively. We find that both filaments are highly super-critical"
"with a mean mass per unit length, M/L, of ∼80 M�pc−1, after background subtraction, with local
increases reaching values of ∼150 M�pc−1. This would require a magnetic field strength of ∼500µG to
be stable against radial collapse. We extract equidistant cuts perpendicular to the spine of the filament"
and fit a modified Plummer profile as well as a Gaussian to each of the cuts. The filament widths
"(deconvolved FWHM) range between 6500-7000 au (∼0.03 pc) along the filaments. This equals ∼2.0
times the radius of the flat inner region. We find an anti-correlation between the central density and"
"this flattening radius, suggestive of contraction. Further, we also find a strong correlation between the"
power-law exponent at large radii and the flattening radius. We note that the measurements of these
three parameters fall in a plane and derive their empirical relation. Our high-resolution observations
provide direct constraints of the distribution of the dense gas within super-critical filaments showing
pre- and protostellar activity.

1. INTRODUCTION
Dense cores are the places where stars form (see re-
views by di Francesco et al. 2007; Ward-Thompson
et al. 2007; Bergin & Tafalla 2007). They present non-
thermal subsonic velocity dispersions (Fuller & Myers

1992; Goodman et al. 1998; Caselli et al. 2002) and rep-
resent the end of the turbulent cascade (Larson 1981).
One of the most popular molecular tracers to study
the dense gas within and around dense cores is ammo-
"nia, NH3. This is because the NH3(1,1) transition traces"
"material with densities starting at a few 103 cm−3. Also,"
"due to its hyperfine structure, it is a useful determinant"
of optical depth and kinematic properties. In addition
"the inversion transitions NH3(1,1) and NH3(2,2) usu-"
"ally can be observed simultaneously, as they are only"

separated by 28.1 MHz. The observation of these two
transitions provide measurements of temperatures and
column density (Friesen et al. 2017).
"By mapping dense cores in NH3(1,1), it was found"
that they show an almost constant level of non–thermal
"motions, within a certain “coherence” zone (Goodman"
et al. 1998). The term “coherent core” describes the
dense gas where non-thermal motions are roughly con-
"stant, and typically smaller than the thermal motions,"
independent of scale (see also Caselli et al. 2002).
Wide field dust continuum observations with the Her-
schel Space Observatory have revealed that filaments are
"commonplace throughout molecular clouds, with lengths"
ranging from 0.5 pc up to several tens of pc. It was also
"established that they host most of the dense cores, with"
bound ones located predominantly in filaments with
transcritical to super-critical masses per unit length (e.g.
"André et al. 2014; Arzoumanian et al. 2018, 2019). From"
"these dust continuum observations, it is argued that the"
width of those filaments are close to 0.1 pc (Arzouma-
"nian et al. 2011, 2019)."
Studies using molecular line observations have also
identified filamentary structures. Since molecular lines
"provide kinematic information, the filamentary struc-"
tures are sometimes also analyzed taking into account
their coherence in velocity. Identified filaments us-
ing molecular lines usually have smaller length than
those filaments seen by Herschel. A single several pc
long filament identified with Herschel can show several
(in a few cases intertwined; Hacar et al. 2013; Hen-
shaw et al. 2013) velocity-coherent filamentary struc-
tures when studied through molecular lines (Fernández-
López et al. 2014; Hacar et al. 2017; Suri et al. 2019;
Chen et al. 2020). Suri et al. (2019) find that the fila-
ment widths in the Orion A molecular cloud varies be-
"tween 0.02 and 0.3 pc using C18O(1-0), while filaments"
as narrow as 0.01 pc have been found in the OMC-1 re-
"gion using NH3(1,1) observations (Monsch et al. 2018)."
"Regarding their stability, the velocity-coherent struc-"
"tures or ‘fibers’ in Hacar et al. (2013, 2017), were shown"
to have masses per unit length close to or below the
stability value. Similar smaller scales filaments were
"also identified within the coherent, subsonic region of"
Barnard 5 (hereafter B5; Pineda et al. 2011). At least
one of the narrower filaments found in B5 displays an av-
eraged radial profile that is different than those derived
for the Herschel filaments.
Although efforts have been made to study the frag-
mentation of the filaments from the theoretical (e.g.
"Fiege & Pudritz 2000a; Hanawa et al. 2017, 2019)"
"and the numerical side (e.g. Smith et al. 2014, 2016;"
Tomisaka 2014; Kirk et al. 2015; Seifried & Walch 2015;
"Clarke et al. 2019; Heigl et al. 2020), the observational"
efforts have been focused on the fragments themselves
(e.g. Pineda et al. 2015; Kainulainen et al. 2016) and an
observationally driven understanding of filament frag-
mentation has yet to be established. The analysis of
observations is usually performed on the average den-
sity profile. Hence it is unclear if and how the density
profile and width of a filament that is undergoing frag-
mentation changes along the spine of the filament (i.e.
its main axis). A robust observational determination of
these properties along the spine of a filament would pro-
vide a strong constrain to theories of filament formation
and evolution.
"In this work, we focus on a region located in the"
"Perseus star-forming region at a distance of (302 ±
21) pc from the Sun (Zucker et al. 2018). This region,"
"called B5, has nearly constant subsonic non-thermal ve-"
"locity dispersion, covering an area of ∼ 0.4 pc × 0.6 pc
and hosts at least one young stellar object (YSO), B5-"
"IRS1 (Fuller et al. 1991). High angular resolution (6 ′′,"
1800 au) NH3 observation reveals filamentary substruc-
tures within the subsonic region (Pineda et al. 2011).
"Embedded in these filaments are, in addition to the"
"already mentioned YSO, three gravitationally bound"
"dense gas condensations (Pineda et al. 2015), forming"
a wide-separation quadruple system. This quadruple
system appears to be the result of fragmentation of the
"dense gas filaments. Here, we use these high angular res-"
"olution, high density tracer observations of NH3 to study"
in detail the density profile of the filamentary structure
embedded in the coherent zone of B5.
The paper is structured as follows. In Sec. 2 we
present the observational data used in this paper. In
Sec. 3 we report the results of the analysis of the fila-
mentary structure. These results are discussed in Sec. 4.
We conclude the paper in Sec. 5.
2. OBSERVATIONS
We use observational data from three different tele-
scopes: Continuum maps at 450 and 850µm obtained
"with the James-Clerk-Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), and"
combined observations of two metastable ammonia tran-
"sitions, NH3(1,1) and (2,2), obtained with the Robert"
C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and the Very
Large Array (VLA). These observational data have al-
ready been published (Pineda et al. 2015). For clarity we
briefly list the important details of these observations.
2.1. James-Clerk-Maxwell Telescope (JCMT)
Observations at 450µm and 850µm of the B5 cloud
have been performed using the Submillimetre Common-
Use Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2 Holland et al. 2013)
Super-critical filaments in B5 3
at the JCMT (project code: M13BU14) during grade
1 weather. The 450µm and 850µm observations were
"carried out simultaneously on 2013 August 16 and 23,"
and 2013 September 3. The iterative map-making tech-
nique is used with the command makemap (Chapin et al.
"2013) of the Starlink software suite1, with a pixel size"
"of 0.5 ′′ to match the NH3(1,1) VLA map (see Sec. 2.2)."
Details of the data reduction can be found in Pineda
et al. (2015). The maps have a spatial resolution of
9.8 ′′ (3000 au) at 450µm and 14.6 ′′ (4400 au) at 850µm.
The noise level in the emission free regions is 0.23 mJy
pixel−1 at 450µm and 0.026 mJy pixel−1 at 850µm.
2.2. Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and
Very Large Array (VLA)
GBT observations of the B5 region have been car-
ried out between 2009 December 23 and 2010 March 21
(project number 08C-088). Two 12.5 MHz windows have
"been centered on NH3(1,1) and NH3(2,2), and observed"
in frequency switching mode. The spectral resolution of
the data is 0.04 km s−1. Details on the data processing
can be found in Pineda et al. (2010).
The single-dish GBT data have been combined with
high resolution interferometric data obtained with the
VLA. The VLA observations have been carried out in
the D-array configuration on 2011 October 16-17 and
in the DnC-array configuration on 2012 January 13-14
(project number 11B-101). The WIDAR correlator was
configured such that 2 basebands with 4 MHz bandwidth
"were centered on NH3(1,1)f and NH3(2,2), with a spec-"
tral resolution of 0.049 km s−1. Detailed information on
the data processing can be found in Pineda et al. (2015).
The spatial resolution of the final map is 6.0 ′′ (1800 au).
3. RESULTS
3.1. Morphology of the subsonic region in B5
The substructure of the B5 coherent region is more
easily identified in the high-contrast NH3 integrated in-
"tensity image than in the Herschel images, since NH3
does not trace the more extended structure seen in the"
Herschel dust continuum emission due to NH3 either
being not present or having very low abundance.
We characterise the morphology of the coherent region
employing astrodendro (Rosolowsky et al. 2008) on the
"NH3(1,1) integrated intensity map. By using a clipping"
method astrodendro assigns emission above a certain
threshold (contour level) as associated with an object.
We provide the minimum value to be considered in the
"map (0.03 Jy beam−1 km s−1, i.e. 10 times the rms),"
1 http://starlink.eao.hawaii.edu/starlink
the height threshold value that determines if a leaf will
"be a single entity or not (0.01 Jy beam−1 km s−1), and"
a minimum number of pixels for a leaf to be considered
a single entity (250 pixels). Fig. 1 shows the identified
substructure with different contours.
Two independent clumps are identified: B5-clump1
and B5-clump2. While B5-clump1 appears smooth and
"without signs of active star-formation (quiescent), B5-"
clump2 breaks up further and shows clear signs of frag-
mentation. We identify two independent filamentary
structures: B5-fil1 and B5-fil2. Along the spines of both
"filamentary structures we identify three leafs, represent-"
"ing three gas condensations B5-cond1, B5-cond2, and"
B5-cond3. This finding is in agreement with Pineda
"et al. (2015), in which the three condensations along"
with the protostellar source B5-IRS1 were found to
be bound and on their way to form a wide separa-
"tion quadruple system. Furthermore, here we identify"
"lower level over-densities along both filament spines,"
which might provide the seeds for future fragmentation
(pre-condensations). The peak intensities of these pre-
condensations are about 25 % lower than the faintest
condensation.
3.1.1. General properties of the substructures
"We simultaneously fit the NH3(1,1) and NH3(2,2)"
datacubes using pySpecKit (Ginsburg & Mirocha 2011)
"to obtain information on the NH3 column density, the"
kinetic temperature and the velocity field. Details of
this fitting procedure are given in Appendix A. The re-
sulting property maps are shown in Fig. 2.
"For each substructure, we list the mean properties"
obtained from the pySpecKit fitting in Tab. 1. This
"includes the NH3 column density, kinetic temperature,"
line-of-sight velocity and non-thermal velocity disper-
"sion. The non-thermal velocity dispersion σnt is calcu-
lated from the fitted velocity dispersion σv as"
"σnt =
√
σ2v − σ2th, (1)"
where σth is the thermal velocity dispersion.
We notice that the filaments have a lower mean kinetic
temperature compared to the clumps. It is also inter-
esting to note that B5-cond1 which is embedded in B5-
"fil1 has a mean kinetic temperature of 8.5 K, while the"
other two condensations B5-cond2 and B5-cond3 have
higher mean kinetic temperatures of 10.7 K. These two
"condensations are embedded in B5-fil2, relatively close"
to the YSO B5-IRS1 and likely affected by the stellar
feedback. The line-of-sight velocities are comparable
"for all structures, suggestive of shallow velocity gradi-"
ents along the line-of-sight within the coherent zone of
B5. The non-thermal velocity dispersion is sub-sonic as

increase at the position of the condensations and the
centroid velocity map shows variations where the addi-
tional clumpy substructure appears.
3.2. Filamentary structure
"3.2.1. Filament length and profiles perpendicular to
filament spines"
We employ the python-based package radfil (Zucker
& Chen 2018) to further characterize both filamentary
"structures. Based on the provided NH3(1,1) intensity"
"map and a mask, radfil employs the package fil_finder"
(Koch & Rosolowsky 2015) to define the spine of the fil-
"aments. Following the spines of the filament, we deter-"
mine filament lengths of 0.24 pc and 0.31 pc for B5-fil1
"and B5-fil2, respectively. Going along the filament spine,"
we extract equidistant cuts perpendicular to the spine
using a sampling frequency of 12 pixels. This yields
roughly a one beam separation between individual cuts
"(6 ′′ beam, 0.5 ′′ pixelsize). The resulting profiles are"
shifted such that the center coincides with the peak in-
tensity. The spine and the perpendicular cuts are shown
in Fig. 3.
"To investigate the filament properties, we follow the"
approach presented by Arzoumanian et al. (2011) and
adopt the idealized model of a cylindrical filament with
a radial density n(r) and column density Σ(R) profile as

monly, the filament width is defined as the full-width-at-"
"half-maximum, FWHM, of a Gaussian fit to inner part of"
the cuts (e.g. Arzoumanian et al. 2011; Panopoulou et al.
"2017). Hence in addition to fitting a Plummer function,"
we also fit a Gaussian to the innermost (8000 au) part
"of the cut, taking into account the constant background"
emission.

"where AG is the amplitude, σG is the variance, and µG
is the expected value. From this the FWHM is cal-"
"culated as FWHM = 2σG

"into account by deconvolving the FWHM, following"
"Könyves et al. (2015), i.e. the deconvolved FWHM,"
"FWHMd =
√"
"(FWHM2 −HPBW 2), where HPBW
is the half-power beamwidth in au. For our observa-"
"tions, the HPBW is 6 ′′, corresponding to ∼ 1800 au at
the distance of B5. For the Plummer fits, we convolve"
the Plummer-like function with the 6 ′′ Gaussian beam
prior to fitting.
"To investigate the global properties of the filaments,"
"we first fit the average profiles of each filament. In Fig. 4,"
we show the averaged profiles in solid black. The indi-
vidual profiles are superimposed in light gray. When
"fitting the profiles, we restrict the fitting range to avoid"
contamination from peak structures from the other fila-
ment. The background emission is determined by fitting
a constant to the flat outer edges of the profile cuts. We
"fit three different versions of Eq. 2, (i) the exponent is"
"fixed to 2, (ii) the exponent is kept as a free parame-"
"ter, and (iii) the exponent is fixed to 4. The latter is"
the Ostriker (1964) solution for an isothermal filament
in hydrostatic equilibrium. The best-fit of all three ver-
"sions are shown in Fig. 4 in gold, orange, and blue"
respectively.
We list the fitting results in Tab. 3 in the appendix
"(data set ‘NH3, 6
′′’). We use the Akaike Information"
"Criterion (AIC) to evaluate the goodness of the fits,"
where the model with the lowest AIC value is the pre-
"ferred one. For both filaments, the lowest AIC value is"
determined for the fit with a Plummer function where
the exponent has been kept as a free parameter.
We then fit each individual perpendicular cut with a
Gaussian and a Plummer-like profile where the exponent
"is kept as a fitting parameter. From this fitting, we"
"obtain the variation of the filament parameters (mass,"

"method (a), we convert the JCMT 450µm background-"
corrected2 flux density in B5-cond1 to gas mass assum-
"ing a gas-to-dust ratio of 100 (Hildebrand 1983), a dis-"
"tance of 302 ± 21 pc (Zucker et al. 2018), a dust temper-
ature of 9 ± 1 K (deduced from the kinetic temperature
map and assuming that the dust temperature is cou-"
"pled to the gas temperature), and optically thin dust"
"with a dust absorption coefficient of κ450µm = 6.4 ±
0.81 cm2g−1 (Ossenkopf & Henning 1994). For the same"
"condensation, B5-cond1, we measure the background-"
"corrected2 flux density in the integrated NH3(1,1) map."
This yields an ammonia-to-mass conversion factor of
"(1.5 ± 0.7) M�Jy−1. For method (b) we convert the
ammonia column density derived from the pySpecKit"
fitting assuming an abundance of ammonia with respect
"to H2 of 10
−8.5 (Friesen et al. 2017). The resulting"
mass maps agree within a factor of two with each other
(method (b) yields a factor of two higher mass compared
to method (a)). The ratio of both maps is smooth and
does not show any strong gradients. All mass-dependent
calculations in this work will be performed on the basis
of the mass map derived with the dust-scaling method
"(a), since it is a conservative estimate."
"For the entire filaments B5-fil1 and B5-fil2, we mea-"
sure background corrected flux densities of 6.29 Jy and
"8.97 Jy, respectively in the NH3(1,1) integrated intensity"
map. We determine the background as the pixel within
"the filament with the lowest flux density (∼0.4 mJy for
both filaments). This is very likely overestimating the"
real background and hence it results in a very conserva-
tive mass determination. We obtain total background
corrected masses of MB5-fil1 = 9.4 M� and MB5-fil2 =
13.4 M�.
3.2.3. Filament mass per unit length
"We determine the mass per unit length, M/L, to be"
"39.2 M�pc
−1 for B5-fil1 and 43.2 M�pc"
−1 for B5-fil2.
We note that this is a conservative estimate due to the
aggressive background determination.
A more realistic approach encompasses determining
"the local variation of filament mass. Here, for each cut"
"perpendicular to the filament spine, the background is"
determined by fitting a constant to the outer edges of
the cuts. The determined background values are 0.05 –
0.06 mJy. We subtract this background when calculat-
ing the mass enclosed in the filament cut. To obtain the
"mass per unit length, we divide the mass contained in"
the individual cut by the length of the cut in the direc-
tion of the filament spine. In panel (b) of Fig. 5 we show
"2 We determine the background as the pixel within the structure
with the lowest value."
the variation of filament background corrected mass per
unit length along the filament spine. The mean value
"is 74.2 M�pc
−1 for B5-fil1 and 83.3 M�pc"
"−1 for B5-fil2,"
"which we also list in Tab. 2. Due to the ∼1-beam sepa-
ration between the cuts and the filaments being rather"
"straight, the overlap of individual cuts and hence the"
"duplication when determining the mass, is minimal (see"
Fig. 3).
The critical value (M/L)crit for an isothermal cylinder
of gas in hydrostatic equilibrium is (Ostriker 1964):
"(M/L)crit =
2c2s
G
∼ 16.6"
"(
Tgas
10 K"
")
M� pc"
"−1, (5)"
"where cs is the sound speed of the gas, G is the gravita-"
"tional constant, and Tgas is the gas temperature. Both"
filaments exceed this critical value on average by a fac-
tor of 3-4. Locally this can even increase by factors of 5.
"Both filaments are supercritical, which means that their"
thermal pressure is insufficient to support them against
gravitational collapse. They should collapse further un-
less there are means providing additional support (e.g.
magnetic fields). This is discussed in Sec. 4.3.
3.2.4. Central density
Similar to the determination of the flux-to-mass con-
"version factor ξ outlined in Sec. 3.2.2, we calculate a"
flux-to-column-density factor Ξ as
"κν µH2 mH ΩBν(Td)
, (6)"
"where G is the gas-to-dust ratio (G = 100.; Hilde-
brand 1983), κν is the dust absorption coefficient at"
"the frequency ν, µH2 is the molecular weight per hy-"
"drogen molecule (µH2=2.8; Kauffmann et al. 2008), mH
is the mass of the hydrogen atom, Ω is the area (in"
our case of B5-cond1) and Bν(Td) is the Planck func-
tion evaluated at the dust temperature Td. We de-
termine a 450µm flux-to-column-density factor of Ξ =
"(4.4 ± 1.9)1025Jy−1cm−2. From the flux measured for
B5-cond1 in both the JCMT 450µm and the NH3(1,1)"
"map, we determine an ammonia-to-column-density con-"
"version factor of η = (1.25 ± 0.53) 1026 Jy−1cm−2.
We fit the observed intensity profile of the cuts per-"
pendicular to the filament spine with a modified Plum-
"mer function (similar to Eq. 2, see Sec. 3.2.1), where the"
fitting parameter A is given as:
"A =
n0ApRflat"
"η
. (7)"
This allows us to determine the central density n0. From
"the fit to the averaged profile of the filament cuts, we"
determine a central density of (1.7 ± 0.7) 106 cm−3 for
Super-critical filaments in B5 9
"B5-fil1 and (1.4 ± 0.6) 106 cm−3 for B5-fil2. In the panel
(c) of Fig. 5, we show the variation of central density"
"along the filament spines for both filaments, determined"
from the individual fits to the filament profiles. The
mean of the central density derived from the individual
"fits is 1.8× 106 cm−3 for B5-fil1 and 1.5 × 106 cm−3 for
B5-fil2, just slightly higher compared to the value deter-"
mined from fitting the averaged profile (see also Tab. 2).
"As expected, we see an increase in central density to-"
wards the location of all three condensations. We note
that the profiles of the variation of central density along
the filament spines visually appear to be similar when
one flips one profile and aligns the condensations. This
"is further evaluated in Sec. 4.1. The central density, on"
"the order of 106 cm−3, is comparable to central densities"
found in pre-stellar cores like L1544 (Crapsi et al. 2005).
3.2.5. Filament width and exponent
"From the Gaussian fit of the averaged profiles, we ob-"
"tain a deconvolved FWHMd of (6200 ± 30) au for B5-
fil1 and (6900 ± 30) au for B5-fil2, which corresponds
to ∼ 2Rflat for the Plummer fits, where the exponent p
has been kept as a free parameter. Given their lengths,"
"we determine aspect ratios, i.e. length over FWHMd, of"
"17:1 and 10:1 for B5-fil1 and B5-fil2, respectively."
We then apply the same Gaussian fitting to each in-
dividual cut along the filament spines as described in
Sec. 3.2.1. Panel (e) in Fig. 5 shows the variation of
Rflat and FWHMd along the spines of both filament.
The mean of FWHMd is 6500 au for B5-fil1 and 7200 au
for B5-fil2 (see also Tab. 2). Both values agree well with
the results from fitting the average profile. The devia-
tion could be caused by the higher uncertainty in the fits
due to the lower signal-to-noise towards the tips of the
filaments. We discuss the determined filament widths
further in Sec. 4.2.
The mean of Rflat is 3300 au for B5-fil1 and 3800 au
for B5-fil2. Hence the mean of Rflat increases by about
"20 – 30 %, when fitting the individual profiles as op-"
posed to fitting the averaged profiles. This increase is
likely linked to the increase in the exponent. Fitting the
averaged profile with a Plummer profile where the expo-
nent has been kept as a free parameter yields exponent
"values of p ≈ 3. When fitting the individual profiles, we
determine a mean value of p ≈ 3.5. A value of p = 4
represents a special case of an isothermal filament in hy-"
"drostatic equilibrium (Ostriker 1964). Lower values of p,"
"1.5 < p < 2.5, are typically found in molecular cloud fil-"
aments like e.g. IC5146 (Arzoumanian et al. 2011) using
dust continuum emission maps. Monsch et al. (2018) on
"the other hand report the detection of a narrow filament,"
"Rflat = 0.013 pc (i.e 2680 au), with a steep exponent,"
"p = 5.1, in the Orion A OMC1 region using the dense"
"gas tracer NH3. Along the spine, we notice a trend of"
"decreasing Rflat towards the condensations, i.e. towards"
"increasing n0. Similarily, we notice an increase in the"
exponent when Rflat increases. These (anti-)correlations
are further discussed in Sec. 4.5.
3.2.6. Kinematics
"In Fig. 6 we show the line-of-sight velocity, vlsr and the"
velocity dispersion σv along both filament spines. There
is a mild gradient in correspondance with the conden-
"sations, suggestive of inflowing material. This has also"
"been suggested by Hacar & Tafalla (2011), where they"
show the velocity oscillations along filamentary struc-
tures in Taurus. It is noticeable that B5-cond1 falls
"at a peak, while B5-cond2 and B5-cond3 do not. This"
could be related to the protostar B5-IRS1 affecting the
line-of-sight velocity structure in B5-fil2. The velocity
"dispersion σv, including both thermal and non-thermal"
"motions, shows an increase in B5-fil1 towards B5-cond1"
and in B5-fil2 towards the location in between the other
two condensations. This might be caused by the proto-
"stellar object B5-IRS1, which is located nearby."
4. DISCUSSION
4.1. Similarities between spine profiles
We noticed that visually the spine profiles of B5-fil1
and B5-fil2 appear similar if one starts following them
from the end at which their embedded condensations are
located and scales them to the same length. To quantify
"this further, we have inverted the spine profiles of B5-fil2"
"shown in Fig. 5, i.e. we follow the spine of this filament"
from North to South. We rescale the filament length by
a factor of 0.767 to match it to the length of B5-fil1.
We then interpolated the spine profiles of B5-fil2 and
extract profile values at the same equidistant positions
as for B5-fil1. An example of the resulting spine profiles
of this procedure is shown for the peak intensity spine
profile on the right side in Fig. 7. We then calculate the
Pearson’s R statistic between both filaments for each of
"the following properties: peak intensity, mass per unit"
"length M/L, central density n0, Plummer-exponent p,"
Rflat and FWHMd. We apply a shift to the spine profiles
of B5-fil2 and calculate the Pearson’s R statistics to find
the best alignment between the filaments. The variation
of the Pearson’s R values as a function of shift is shown
on the left side in Fig. 7. The variation of the correlation
is similar for all parameters. Shifting the spine profiles
of B5-fil2 by 0.01 pc to the North of this filament results
in a high correlation between all parameters. This shift
aligns the position of B5-cond1 with B5-cond2.

The filaments we study here are embedded within the
coherent core of Barnard 5. In this subsection we com-
pare the properties derived for these filaments to the
properties of the ‘Herschel ’ filaments.
"The Herschel Gould Belt Survey (HGBS, André et al."
2010) has mapped star-forming regions at five different
"wavelengths (70 – 500µm), from which the HGBS team"
has derived H2 column density maps at the native res-
"olution of ∼36 ′′ and at a medium resolution of 18.4 ′′
following the procedure presented in Palmeirim et al."
"(2013). In their recently published study, Arzouma-"
nian et al. (2019) investigate eight of these star form-
"ing regions and identify in total ∼ 600 individual fila-
ments that have an aspect ratio > 3. For this sample"
of filaments they derive distributions of filament prop-
"erties (see their Tab. 3), such as the length of the fil-"

We compare this to the results from fitting the aver-

"filaments are short (L = 0.28 pc), more super-critical"
"(M/L = 41.2 M�pc
−1), steeper (p = 3.0), and narrower"
(FWHMd = 0.03 pc) than the Herschel filaments.
"When using molecular lines to study filaments, prop-"
erties such as the inferred filament widths seems to be
dependent on the observed molecule. For 55 dense fibers
"identified in Orion’s Integral Shape Filament, Hacar"
et al. (2018) find the distribution of filament width peak-
"ing at 0.035 pc using N2H
+. Panopoulou et al. (2014)"
on the other hand infer a broad distribution of filament
width peaking at 0.4 pc in the Taurus molecular cloud
using 13CO. Studying the Orion A molecular cloud us-
"ing C18O, Suri et al. (2019) finds a varying filament"
"width between 0.02 and 0.3 pc, mostly in agreement"
with the dust continuum based study by Arzoumanian
et al. (2019). They attribute the large spread to the
amount of substructure present within a filament. In
"many of these cases however, the spatial resolution of"
the molecular line data used to determine the filament
widths is often better by a factor of 2 – 4 compared to
the medium-resolution H2 column density map derived
from the Herschel continuum observations.
The difference in the filament properties found for the
B5 filaments could be due to different angular resolution
or the fact that ammonia is a high density tracer and as
such picks out only the spine of the filaments.
Angular resolution: We smooth the high-resolution
"NH3(1,1) integrated intensity map to the medium-"
"resolution of the Herschel column density map, i.e."
18.4 ′′. We use the filament spine determined using
"fil finder on the high-resolution NH3(1,1) integrated in-"
tensity map and extract equidistant cuts perpendicular
to the spines. We average the cuts and apply the same
fitting procedure as described in Sec. 3.2.1. The de-
tails of this processing as well as the results are given in
Appendix C. The averaged profiles of the B5 filaments
"become even steeper (p = 4.14), and while their width"
"increases, they remain narrow (FWHMd = 0.05 pc)."
High-density tracer versus continuum: We use the
medium-resolution H2 column density map derived for
Perseus that is publicly available on the HGBS web-
page3. We apply the same processing as for the
"smoothed NH3(1,1) integrated intensity map described"
above. The details of this processing are given in Ap-
pendix C. The averaged profiles of the B5 filaments re-
"main steep (p = 3.33), their widths increases marginally"
(FWHMd = 0.06 pc). The central column density is
"higher (N0H2 = 1.3 × 10
22 H2 cm"
−2) compared to the
Herschel filaments. There is only very little differ-
ence between the fitting results of smoothed high-density
"tracer and the H2 column density map, indicating that"
"NH3(1,1) is not filtering out the extended wings of fila-"
ments and hence is a good tracer of filamentary struc-
tures.
"In summary, the physical properties (length, width,"
"volume density, density profile) of the filamentary sub-"
structure present within the coherent core of B5 are sig-
nificantly different from those measured in Herschel fil-
"aments. This is not surprising, considering the higher"
3 http://www.herschel.fr/cea/gouldbelt/en
Super-critical filaments in B5 13
density environment within which the B5 filamentary
"substructure has formed, and it suggests that environ-"
mental conditions play a crucial role in shaping the phys-
ical characteristics of filaments in general.
4.3. Can the filaments be magnetically supported?
"Both filaments are supercritical, but the turbulence"
"present in the coherent core (sonic Mach number, Ms ="
σnt/cs = 0.5) is insufficient to support them against
gravitational collapse. Hence they should be in a state of
"collapse – unless magnetic fields are present, which could"
provide additional support against gravitational collapse
(Fiege & Pudritz 2000a; Seifried & Walch 2015). This
poses the question of how strong a magnetic field would
need to be to stabilize the filaments.
We present here a first attempt to estimate the mag-
"netic field strength in B5, which has not yet been mea-"
sured. A toroidal field does not stabilize the filament
against radial collapse (Fiege & Pudritz 2000a). A
poloidal field that is perpendicular to the spine of the
filament has also been found to not stabilize it (Seifried
& Walch 2015). This leaves a poloidal field that is par-
"allel to the filament, which has indeed been found to"
stabilize a filament (Fiege & Pudritz 2000a; Seifried &
Walch 2015). We use this orientation to estimate the
mininum magnetic field required to fully stabilize the
"filaments against collapse, which would ultimately pre-"
vent any fragmentation happening.
The critical mass per unit length for an isothermal
cylinder is given in Eq. 5 (Ostriker 1964). The cylinder
can be further stabilized by turbulence and magnetic
"field. Taking the turbulence into account, Fiege & Pu-"
dritz (2000a) derive a modified critical mass per unit
length (see their Eq. 12):
"(M/L)crit,nt =
2σ2v
G
, (8)"
where σv is the velocity dispersion of the gas including
thermal and non-thermal (nt) motions (see Eq. 1).
Taking the magnetic field Bz parallel to the spine of
"the filament into account, Fiege & Pudritz (2000a) de-"
termine:
"(M/L)crit,mag =
2σ2v +"
"B2z
4πµpmHn0"
"G
, (9)"
where µp = 2.37 is the mean molecular weight per
"free particle (Kauffmann et al. 2008), and mH is"
the hydrogen atom mass. Assuming that our fila-
"ments are gravitationally stable, i.e. the observation-"
ally measured mass per unit length (M/L)obs equals
"(M/L)crit,mag, evaluating Eq. 9 for the magnetic field"
"Bz, and using Eq. 8 yields"
Bz = σv
"√
8πµpmHn0"
"(
(M/L)obs"
"(M/L)crit,nt
− 1
)
. (10)"
In Fig. 8 we show the distribution of required mag-
netic field strength Bz to support the filaments. The
meanBz is 510µG for B5-fil1 and 515µG for B5-fil2. We
notice an increase in required magnetic field strength to-
"wards the condensations up to values of ∼950µG. Since
fragmentation seems to be already ongoing towards the"
condensations this is not unexpected. We exclude the
tips of the filaments as they deviate from the cylinder
assumption. We note that the holes in the profiles orig-
inate from the kinetic temperature being undetermined
at the respective position.
"Another region, also embedded in the Perseus molec-"
ular cloud and hence sharing the same parental molecu-
"lar cloud as B5, is Barnard 1 (B1). The B1 clump hosts"
several pre- and protostellar cores at different evolution-
"ary stages. Recently, Coudé et al. (2019) determine the"
magnetic field strength of B1 to be 120µG using JCMT
polarization data. Chapman et al. (2011) report the
plane-of-sky magnetic field strength in the nearby star-
forming region Taurus to range from 10 to 40µG using
near-infrared polarization observations. Sugitani et al.
"(2011), on the other hand determine a rough estimate"
of the magnetic field strength in the Serpens cloud to
"be a few × 100µG. Liu et al. (2019) report magnetic
field strengths towards a low-mass starless core in the"
ρ Ophiuchus cloud of 103 - 213µG using three different
methods and JCMT 850µm dust polarization observa-
"tions. Also towards Ophiuchius, Pattle et al. (2020)"
report magnetic field strengths ranging between 72 –
366µG.
Our inferred value of the magnetic field strength is an
upper limit. It exceeds many of the measured values
in other (low-mass) star-forming regions or clumps. So
while it may still be possible that the filaments could be
"marginally supported by magnetic pressure, additional"
observations are required to quantify this.

The simplest case of cylindrical fragmentation is that
"of an isothermal, pressure-supported, infinitely-long fila-"
ment. The gravitational fragmentation of such a system
"has a critical wavelength of λcrit = 3.94H, where"
"H2 =
2 c2s"

(Hacar & Tafalla 2011; Stodólkiewicz 1963; Ostriker
1964). Taking the average central density of the fil-
"aments of n0 = 10

"9 K, yields a critical wavelength of λcrit = 7400 au"
(0.04 pc). We determine the closest separation between
"two structures along the filament spines to be 0.045 pc,"
between B5-cond2 and B5-cond3. The separation be-
tween B5-cond1 and B5-precond2 along the filament
spine is 0.05 pc.
But this approach neglects the influence of turbulence
and magnetic fields on the critical wavelength. Fiege &
Pudritz (2000b) investigate the effect of the magnetic
field and its orientation on the critical wavelength. For
"a poloidal magnetic field parallel to the filament spine,"
they find that the scale for the separation of the frag-
ments increases with increasing magnetic field strength.
This could mean that some of our identified substructure
"within the filaments is spaced too closely. However, to"
further investigate the influence of the magnetic field on
the separation of the fragments will require a measure-
ment of the magnetic field orientation and the magnetic
field strength.
4.5. Filament Evolution
"As mentioned in Sec. 3.2.5, we notice a relation be-"
"tween Rflat, n0 and the exponent p along the spines of"
"these filaments. To investigate this further, we plot the"
"relation between all three parameters with each other in
Fig. 9. Especially clear is the correlation between the"
exponent p and Rflat. The anti-correlation between the
central density and Rflat is less clear due to the high er-
"ror associated with the central density, to which the un-"
certainty in the temperature determination contributes
the most. The best-fit linear fits shown in Fig. 9 take
the associated uncertainties into account. The emerging
trend is that dense filaments are narrower and filaments
deviate from the fiducial isothermal filament model as
they become denser and narrower.
To derive an empirical relation between all three pa-
"rameters, we fit a plane to the three-dimensional param-"
"eter space,"
"Rflat = α1

"106cm−3

"Figure 10. Correlation between the flattening radius Rflat,

where α1 and α2 are scaling parameters and β is the
intercept of the plane. Since all three parameters have
"a measurement error associated with them, we use the"
Hyper-fit package (Robotham & Obreschkow 2015) to
fit a plane in 3D. This package allows to fit linear mod-
els to multi-dimensional data with multivariate Gaus-
sian uncertainties and provides access to a multitude of
fitting algorithms. We employ the Nelder-Mead algo-
"rithm and obtain the following values: α1 = -320 ± 71,
α2 = 1544 ± 111, and β = -1153 ± 360. Fig. 10 shows
the reprojected hyperplane."
This provides the first observational prescription of
the evolution of the physical parameters of the filaments
dependent on Rflat. Although this relation might not be
"universal, it shows the first clear evolution of a filament"
that is collapsing or fragmenting revealing the global
trends.
For an isothermal filament in hydrostatic equilibrium
"(exponent p = 4), Arzoumanian et al. (2011) state that"
the flattening radius Rflat corresponds to the thermal
"Jeans length λJ, which is anti-correlated to the central"
column density Σ0. They investigate three low-mass star
"forming filaments, Aquila, IC5146, and Polaris and find"
"a lack of anti-correlation between the filament widths,"
which they determine as the deconvolved FWHM from
"the Gaussian fit to the profile, and the column density"
"(see their Fig. 7). However, from fitting a Plummer-like"
function to the mean column density profile of the fila-
ments they determine the exponent p to range between
"1.5 and 2.5, i.e. less steep than the exponents of B5-fil1"
and B5-fil2. They determine a flattening radius Rflat =
"2000 – 16000 au, i.e. only a small subsection has similar"
"values as B5-fil1 and B5-fil2. Similarily, Suri et al. (2019)"
analyze C18O observations of the high-mass star form-
ing region Orion A. They determine the widths of the
"625 individual, relatively short (<1.7 pc), filaments that"
they identify. Using the column density map derived
"from Herschel data (Stutz & Kainulainen 2015), they"
find no (anti-)correlation between filament widths and
column density (see their Fig. 11). On the other hand
they do find a correlation between filament widths and
number of shoulder in the radial intensity profiles de-
"tected, suggestive of (unresolved) substructures within"
the filaments. Therefore it is possible that their analysis
is e.g. affected by optical depth effects or the peak col-
umn density could be underestimated due to the large
Herschel beam.
It could be possible that ammonia is tracing higher
density material and hence we are able to see the ex-
pected inverse relation between Rflat and the central
density n0. A similar investigation for other filaments
would be needed to confirm the relationship observa-
tionally. In addition numerical simulations are required
to investigate if and under which circumstances these
correlations appear.
5. SUMMARY
"In this paper, we analyze previously published com-"
bined VLA and GBT ammonia data together with
JCMT continuum data of Barnard 5. Embedded in
"the coherent region we find two clumps, one quiescent"
and the other one containing two filamentary structures.
Embedded in the filaments are three condensations and
along the spines of the filaments we find signs of addi-
tional clumpy structures. We characterize the filament
properties in detail by fitting both a Plummer function
and a Gaussian to equidistant cuts extracted perpendic-
ular to the filament spines.
"• Both filaments are narrow and dense. Their de-
convolved FWHM range between 6200 – 7000 au,"
"i.e. 2× the flattening radius of the Plummer func-
tion, and their average central density is on the"
order of 106 cm−3. Their aspect ratios are 17:1
and 10:1.
"• The line-of-sight velocity is ∼10.2 km s−1 and the
velocity dispersion along the filament spines is"
"0.1 km s−1, but increases towards the location of"
the condensations.
"• Both filaments are super-critical, exhibiting mass
per unit length values of ∼ 80 M�pc−1. Locally
this value increases up to 150 M�pc"
16 Schmiedeke et al.
"• We estimate the required magnetic field strength
to stabilize the filaments, ultimately stopping fur-"
"ther fragmentation, to be on the order of ∼500µG.
Since we see signs of ongoing fragmentation, we"
conclude that this magnetic field strength is an
upper limit.
"• We fit the radial profiles perpendicular to the fila-
ment spines and see a variation in power-law expo-"
nent and width along the filament. Their maxima
are coincident with the peak positions of the con-
"densations, which could be related to the filament"
evolution.
"• We find a strong correlation between the Plummer
exponent and the flattening radius. We also find"
an anti-correlation between the central density and
"this flattening radius, suggestive of contraction."
The measurements of these three parameters (cen-
"tral density, Plummer exponent and flattening ra-"
dius) fall in a plane and we derive their empirical
relation. Numerical simulations are needed to see
if and under what circumstances these correlations
are being seen.

APPENDIX
A. LINE FITTING
"We simultaneously fit the NH3(1,1) and (2,2) lines using the cold-ammonia model (Friesen et al. 2017) in pySpecKit"
"(Ginsburg & Mirocha 2011). This model assumes that both transition have the same excitation temperature, Tex and"
"that only the (1,1) and (2,2) levels are populated, i.e. the model does not present hyperfine anomalies (Stutzki et al."
"1984). The best fit is obtained by minimizing the χ2, which also provides an uncertainty for each parameter. Input"
"parameter guesses are based on (a) velocity centroid of the line for vlsr, (b) intensity-weighted second moment of the"
"velocity around the centroid for the velocity dispersion, σv, (c) log10(N/cm
−2) = 14.5, (d) TK = 12 K, and (e) Tex ="
"3 K, based on the temperature of the cosmic-ray background radiation (2.73 K). We include all pixels in the fit where"
"the NH3(1,1) line has a S/N ratio ≥ 5. We account for the channel response by applying the following correction to
the velocity dispersion:"
"√
σ2v,fit −"
dvchan
"2ln2
, (A1)"
"where σv,fit is the velocity dispersion from the fit and dvchan is the channel width."
We perform additional masking to remove poor fit results on a pixel-by-pixel basis for each parameter map. The
"line-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion can be reliably obtained with a good fit of the NH3(1,1) line, therefore we"
flag only those pixels with an associated uncertainty of >0.02 km s−1 in vlsr or σv. Determination of the excitation
"and kinetic temperatures, Tex and TK , as well as the ammonia column density NNH3 , requires a good fit for both, the"
"NH3(1,1) and the NH3(2,2) transitions. An inaccurate kinetic temperature yields an erroneous excitation temperature."
"Hence we require a S/N ratio ≥ 12 for the NH3(1,1) line and a S/N ratio ≥ 3 for the NH3(2,2) line, as well as the
associated uncertainties of the temperature fits σfit,T <2 K. For the uncertainty of the ammonia column density, we"
"require σfit,log10(N/cm−2) < 1.0. In addition to that, an accurate determination of the ammonia column density depends"
"on good determination of both temperatures, Tex and TK (Ho & Townes 1983; Friesen et al. 2009). Hence, if a pixel"
"has been flagged in the temperature maps, it will also be flagged in the column density map."
"Fig.11 shows the NH3(1,1) and NH3(2,2) beam-averaged spectra of six regions in the map, corresponding to the"
"YSO B5-IRS1, the three condensations, B5-precond1, and B5-clump1, . Their respective locations are indicated by"
"the orange dot in the contour map. The spectra clearly show the hyperfine splitting in the NH3(1,1) transition thanks"
"to the narrow velocity dispersions. The final maps of ammonia column density NNH3 , kinetic temperature TK , center"
"velocity vlsr, and velocity dispersion σv are shown in Fig.2."
B. CONVERSION FACTORS
B.1. Ammonia-to-mass conversion by scaling
"We measure the flux density in B5-cond1 in the JCMT 450µm map, which is bright and without a protostar, to"
"estimate its mass. To determine the total mass of the filaments, we use the JCMT 450µm map to scale the NH3(1,1)"
"integrated emission map, which is more sensitive to the filamentary structure. In the first step, we calculate the"
flux-to-mass conversion factor ξ based on the conditions in B5-cond1 using:
"ξ = G
d2"
"κνBν(Td)
, (B2)"
"where G is the gas-to-dust ratio (G = 100.; Hildebrand 1983), d is the distance to the object (d = (302± 21) pc; Zucker
et al. 2018), κν is the dust absorption coefficient at the frequency ν, and Bν(Td) is the Planck function evaluated at"
the dust temperature Td.
"To determine the dust temperature, we fit a Gaussian to the distribution of kinetic temperatures within the filaments"
"(see Sec. A), and obtain a mean temperature of Tk = (9 ± 1) K. This assumes that the dust temperature is coupled
to the gas temperature. We also assume that the dust is optically thin, covered in thin to thick ice mantles, and"
coagulated at (105 – 107) cm−3. We interpolate the corresponding tabulated dust opacities provided by Ossenkopf &
"Henning (1994) to a wavelength of 450µm and then determine a mean dust absorption coefficient κ450=(6.4 ± 0.8) cm2
g−1. With that, we derive a SCUBA flux-to-mass conversion factor of ξ=(0.5 ± 0.2) M�Jy−1."

"We determine the background emission for both the JCMT 450µm map and the integrated NH3(1,1) map as the"
lowest-value pixel within the contour of B5-cond1. We note that this will yield very conservative mass estimates.
For B5-cond1 we measure a background corrected flux density of 0.99 Jy in the JCMT 450µm map. For the same
"condensation, we measure a background corrected flux density of 0.35 Jy in the integrated NH3(1,1) map. This yields"
an ammonia-to-mass conversion factor of (1.5 ± 0.7) M�Jy−1.

B.2. Ammonia-to-mass conversion from column density
We calculate the mass from the ammonia column density map on a pixel-by-pixel basis using
"M = µH2 mH Apixel

", (B3)"
"where µH2 is the molecular weight per hydrogen molecule (µH2 = 2.8; Kauffmann et al. 2008), mH is the atomic"
"hydrogen mass, Apixel is the size of the pixel (assuming a distance of d=302 pc), NNH3 is the ammonia column density"
"from the fit (see SubSec. A), and XNH3 is the abundance of ammonia with respect to H2. For a sample of clouds with"
"similar conditions, Friesen et al. (2017) determined the abundance of ammonia with respect to H2 to be XNH3 = 10
−8.5"
on average.
B.3. Comparison
The resulting mass maps for the filaments agree within a factor of two with each other. The mass map derived from
the column density is a factor of 2 higher compared to the mass map derived by scaling the continuum. The residual
between both maps is smooth and does not show any strong gradients. All mass-dependent calculations in this work
were performed on the basis of the mass-map derived with the dust-scaling method.

C. COMPARISON OF FILAMENT WIDTH AT 18.2 ′′ RESOLUTION
B5 was observed with Herschel PACS and SPIRE as part of the Herschel Gould Belt Survey (HGBS; André et al.
"2010). H2 column density maps at two different spatial resolutions (36
′′ and 18.2 ′′) are available on the HGBS"
webpage. The original resolution H2 column density map was derived from SED fitting of the 160 – 500µm maps
on a pixel-to-pixel basis (for details see e.g. Pezzuto et al. 2020; Könyves et al. 2015; Pezzuto et al. 2012). The
18.2 ′′ resolution H2 column density map was determined using a multi-scale decomposition technique as described in
Palmeirim et al. (2013).

"a constant to determine the background emission level, followed by fitting a Gaussian profile to the innermost part."
"For the profiles of the H2 column density map, we adjust the range for the the background emission fitting, since the"
emission is more extended compared to the NH3 integrated intensity map. The fitting ranges for the Gaussian and
Plummer fits are adjusted slightly to exclude contamination from nearby structures. The fit ranges are indicated with
vertical lines in panels C and D in Fig. 13. The fit results are summarized in Tab. 3 and discussed in Sec. 4.2.

D. ASSESSING DEGENERACY IN FITTING HIGH-CONTRAST PLUMMER PROFILES
We examine the reliability of the filament properties using our fitting method outlined in Sec. 3.2.1. To this end we
"generate a suite of synthetic profiles, with given Rflat, exponent p, and peak intensity A to sample the parameter space"
uniformly. We set the constant background level to the mean of the background level of the fitted profiles in this work
"(0.06 mJy). We add Gaussian noise with a σ of 0.02 mJy, derived from the integrated intensity map of NH3(1,1) and"
convolve the synthetic profile with the 6 ′′-Gaussian beam. We uniformly sample the parameter space of Rflat between
"2000 au and 10000 au, and the exponent p between 2.0 and 6.0. Arzoumanian et al. (2019) define the contrast C0 of a"
profile as
"C0 =
Ipeak − Ibkg"
"Ibkg
, (D4)"
"where Ipeak and Ibkg are the peak and background intensity of the profile, respectively. For the correlation plot in"
"Fig. 9, we exclude all perpendicular profiles that are at the tips of the filaments. For the remaining filaments, the"
contrast ranges between 8 and 60. Values larger than 2.0 are commonly considered high-contrast profiles. To test the
"same contrast regime, we set the peak intensity A between 0.54 mJy and 3.66 mJy. In total we sample 4,000 unique"
parameter sets and fit each of them for 20 different noise seeds.
"Input parameter guesses are based on the fit of a Gaussian to the innermost part of each profile, where (1) the"
"Gaussian amplitude is used as the initial guess of the Plummer A parameter, and (2) the Gaussian σ divided by 2 is"
used a an initial guess for Rflat. For the exponent we set the initial guess to 3 (the mean of the parameter space). We
"employ the same fitting range as for the profile fitting performed in the paper, i.e. we fit the profile between -6000"
and 15000 au. Hence we cut off one shoulder of the profile and include the major part of the shoulder on the other
side. We convert the fitting parameter A to central density using Eq. 7.
We perform additional masking to remove poor fit results on a profile-by-profile basis. We remove all profiles with an
"associated uncertainty >1500 au in flattening radius Rflat, > 1.2 in the exponent p, and > 3.4 × 106 [cm−3] in central
density n0. These are three times the maximum of the uncertainty of each parameter in the fit of the observational"
profiles.
In Figure 14 we show the relation between each fitted parameter and the corresponding input parameter. For all
"parameters, the fitted values recover the input values within the uncertainties. The uncertainties increase towards"
larger values of Rflat and steeper profiles. This has mainly to do with the profiles becoming wider and the fitting range
"cutting off before the shoulder is reached. However, the mean of all fit recovers the input values."
