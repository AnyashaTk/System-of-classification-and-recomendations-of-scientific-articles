Metastable Helium Absorptions with 3D Hydrodynamics and
Self-Consistent Photochemistry II:
"WASP-107b, Stellar Wind, Radiation Pressure, and Shear Instability"
"Lile Wang1, Fei Dai2"
ABSTRACT
"This paper presents simulations of the metastable helium (He∗) observations of WASP-107b, so"
far the highest signal-to-noise ratio detection that is confirmed by three different instruments. We
employ full 3D hydrodynamics coupled with co-evolving non-equilibrium thermochemistry and ray-
"tracing radiation, predicting mass loss rates, temperature profiles, and synthetic He∗ line profiles and"
light curves from first principles. We found that a stellar wind stronger than solar is demanded by
the observed heavily blueshifted line profile and asymmetric transit light curve. Contrary to previous
"beliefs, we argue that radiation pressure can be important for Lyα observations but not He∗. We"
"found WASP-107b is losing mass at a rate of Ṁ ' 1.0 × 10−9 M⊕ yr−1. Although Ṁ varies by
< 1 % given constant wind and irradiation from the host, shear instabilities still emerge from wind"
"impacts, producing ∼ 10 % fluctuations of He∗ transit depths over hour-long timescales. The common
assumption that He∗ transit depth indicates the fluctuation of Ṁ is problematic. The trailing tail is"
"more susceptible than planet adjacency to the shear instabilities, thus the line profile is more variable"
"in the blue-shifted wing, while the transit light curve is more variable after mid-transit. We stress"
"the synergy between Lyα (higher altitudes, lower density) and He∗ (lower altitudes, higher density)"
"transit observations, particularly simultaneous ones, yield better understanding of planetary outflows"
and stellar wind properties.

1. INTRODUCTION
The “He i 10830 Å line” or the “metastable helium
line” (He∗ line for short) transitions between the 23S
"and the upper 23PJ (J = 0, 1, 2) states are radiatively"
decoupled from the ground state (for a magnetic dipole
"transition) and have slow spontaneous decay rates: A '
1.3 × 10−3 s−1 (Drake 1971). The high cosmic abun-
dance of helium, the absence of interstellar absorption"
and the observability from the ground together enable
the He∗ lines as a unique probe of atmospheric outflows
from exoplanets. The first secure detection of He∗ in
transmission was made for WASP-107b with the Hub-
ble Space Telescope (Spake et al. 2018). This detection
rekindled decade-long interest in this transition (Seager
& Sasselov 2000; Turner et al. 2016; Oklopčić & Hirata
2018); many more detections around other exoplanets

have been made since then (e.g. Allart et al. 2018; Nort-
mann et al. 2018; Salz et al. 2018; Kirk et al. 2020; Ninan
et al. 2020).
There is no surprise that WASP-107b was the first
exoplanet to show He∗ detection. The host is young
"(∼ 600 Myr from gyrochronology) and active (chromo-
spheric activity index S = 0.89), expected to give out"
strong high-energy radiation that powers planetary pho-
"toevaporative outflow. The host’s spectral type is K6,"
which is right at the sweet spot of EUV-FUV flux ra-
tio that maximally favors the He∗ absorption (Oklopčić
2019; Paper I). The planet is puffy and susceptible to
outflows: it has a mass of an icy giant (0.12 MJup) but
a radius closer to that of Jupiter (0.94 MJup). The op-
"tical transit depth is ∼ 2.2 %, while the He∗ transit
depth is a whopping ∼ 7 %. The mean density of the
planet is only ∼ 0.19 g cm−3, which is reminiscent of
the anomalously low-density planets ”super-puffs” (e.g."
Libby-Roberts et al. 2020; Chachan et al. 2020). Wang
& Dai (2019) and Gao & Zhang (2020) proposed that
“super-puffs” may appear inflated due to high-altitude
dusts or hazes elevated by an outflowing atmosphere; the
near-infrared HST observation (Kreidberg et al. 2018)
is indeed suggestive of high-altitude condensates par-
tially muting the transmission features. WASP-107b
is also dynamically interesting. Dai & Winn (2017)
suspected the planet is on a polar orbit due to the
"lack of repeating spot-crossing events. More recently,"
"a Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement by Rubenzahl, R."
et al (in prep) confirmed this suspicion and thus de-
mands a dynamically hot formation and evolution path-
way that may involve the non-transiting planet 107c
"(P ∼ 1100 days, M sin i ∼ 110 M⊕; Piaulet, C. et al.,
submitted)"
These reasons render WASP-107b a unique and inter-
esting system. The He∗ transits of WASP-107b have
been observed multiple times (Spake et al. 2018; Al-
lart et al. 2018; Kirk et al. 2020). Its well-resolved line
profile exhibits asymmetric shape skewing towards the
"blue-shifted wing, which suggests a comet-like tail. The"
line ratio of three different 23PJ levels also seems to
deviate from the simple quantum degeneracy ratio of
1:3:5 (or 1:8 given that the two latters are not distin-
guishable). Having been confirmed by different instru-
"ments (CARMENES; Keck/NIRSPEC), these features"
are likely attributed to the morphology and kinematics
"of planetary outflows, rather than instrumental effects."
The He∗ dataset of WASP-107b potentially very re-
vealing and should be analyzed in detail. Two models
have been presented in the literature: the 1D isothermal
model by Oklopčić & Hirata (2018) assumes the density
and velocity profile of a Parker Wind (Parker 1958). The
"model has to assume, rather than predict, the mass loss"
"rate and temperature of the outflow. Moreover, 1D mod-"
els are unable to capture the full orbital dynamics and
cannot produce a comet-like tail. The alternative model
is the EVaporating Exoplanets code (EVE; see Bourrier
et al. 2015; Allart et al. 2018). The lower layer (ther-
mosphere) of this model is also a Parker Wind solution;
the upper layer is a Monte-Carlo particle simulations
with He particles under the influence of planetary and
stellar gravity and radiation pressure. As we will elabo-
"rate later in this work, nevertheless, particle-based code"
may not be appropriate for simulating He∗ transits. The
authors of EVE acknowledged that the particle-based
treatment of radiation pressure accelerates the outflow
way too quickly: they had to artificially decrease the
"stellar spectrum near the He∗ lines by a factor of ∼ 50
to achieve reasonable agreement with the observations"
of WASP-107b.
"In this work, we applied to WASP-107b our model"
"that conducts 3D hydrodynamics, self-consistent ther-"
"mochemistry, ray-tracing radiative transfer, and espe-"
cially the processes that populate and destroy He∗ (see
"the first paper in the series, Wang, L. & Dai, F., submit-"
ted; Paper I hereafter). Starting from the observed stel-
"lar and planetary properties, and making assumptions"
of the high energy spectral energy distribution (SED) of
"the host, we can predict the mass loss rate, the temper-"
"ature profile, the ionization states and the various He∗"
simulations of WASP-107b. We will also use WASP-
"107b as a case study to investigate how stellar wind,"
radiation pressure and shear instability affect planetary
outflows and their observability.
"This paper is structured as follows: in §2, we will
briefly described our model and simulation setup. In §3,
we present the fiducial model of WASP-107b that shows"
"remarkable agreement with observation. §4, we perturb
the fiducial model in various parameters to investigate"
"§6 summarize the paper and figure out prospective im-
provements for the future."
2. METHODS
2.1. Basic Setup
Our numerical simulation suite was described in de-
"tail in Paper I. For a brief re-cap, our simulation is car-"
ried in 3D with gravity of both the host star and the
"planet, and the effects of orbital motion including cen-"
trifugal and Coriolis forces. Our code computes ray-
tracing radiative transfer and non-equilibrium thermo-
chemistry simultaneously with hydrodynamics. For sim-
"plicity, we assume circular orbit and that the planet"
"is tidally locked, adopting a co-rotating planet-centric"
"frame. We focus on the upper layer of the atmosphere,"
including a quasi-isothermal layer assumed to have equi-
"librium temperature, and an outflowing region irradi-"
ated by high-energy photons. The boundary conditions
are set so that the observed mass and transit radius of
the planet can be reproduced. We describe the high-
energy spectral energy distribution (SED) of the host
star with 6 characteristic energy bins: (1) 2 eV for the
near-infrared and optical bands; (2) 7 eV for far ultravi-
olet (FUV) photons (“soft FUV”; note that these pho-
tons can ionize He∗); (3) 12 eV for the Lyman-Werner
(“LW”) band FUV photons that photodissociate molec-
"ular hydrogen, (4) 20 eV for “soft” extreme ultraviolet"
(“soft EUV”) photons that ionize hydrogen but not he-
"lium, (5) 40 eV for EUV and soft X-ray (“hard EUV”)"
"photons that ionize helium, and (6) 3 keV photons for"
the X-ray. We make synthetic observations including
He∗ line profiles and transit light curves in the vicinity of
He∗ line. To further facilitate comparisons between ob-
"servation and simulations, we compute summary statis-"
"tics such as the equivalent widths 〈Wλ〉 ≡

reverse shock, and any streamline crossing the outer sonic surface must go through the reverse shock front. The middle panel

ported a K6 host star with a mass of M∗ = 0.69 M� and
"a radius of R∗ = 0.66 R�, and an effective temperature"
"of T∗,eff = 4430 K. Planet b orbits its host on a near-"
"circular but polar orbit (Dai & Winn 2017, Piaulet, C."
"et al, submitted; Rubenzahl, R. et al, submitted). The"
semi-major axis is a = 0.055 AU where the equilibrium
temperature is Teq = 740 K; the transit light curve in-
dicates a small impact parameter (b = 0.07 Dai & Winn
"2017). WASP-107b has an optical transiting radius of
Rp ' 0.94 RJup and a mass Mp ' 0.12 MJup."
2.2. Including Stellar Wind and Radiation Pressure
The He∗ observables of WASP-107b is highly sugges-
tive of an outflow morphology similar to a comet-like
"tail, as the reader will find out shortly (§3.1, 3.2). We
explore two possible mechanisms that may give rise to"
the comet-like tail: stellar wind and radiation pressure.
"For stellar winds, although realistic patterns of stellar"
"winds could be very complicated, we take a very basic"
approach here. The stellar wind is injected as a hydro-
"dynamic flow in a simulation, with two velocity com-"
ponents in the planet frame: (1) a radial component
"centered at the host star, and (2) a headwind due to"
orbital motion of the planet. The first component has
the radial wind speed as a parameter; the second one is
set to be equivalent to the orbital velocity of the planet.
The regions of interactions between the stellar wind
and the planet outflow are illustrated by Figure 1. De-
pending on whether the velocity already becomes su-
personic before being decelerated and deflected by the
"impinging stellar wind, a fluid element in the planet out-"
flow should go through the sonic critical surface twice
(part of streamlines in “Case A” and “Case B”) or once
"(the complement part of streamlines in Cases A and B,"
and all streamlines in “Case C”). We note that a stream-
line in Cases A and B must go through the reverse shock
when and only when it crosses the sonic critical surface
twice. The first sound crossing occurs at smaller radii
(“inner” sonic surface) as the fluid element is acceler-
"ated by the thermal pressure gradient. However, as the"
"upwind part is impinged by the stellar wind, the stream-"
line travels through a reverse shock and is decelerated to
"subsonic. The fluid element then changes its direction,"
and become deflected to move in the night side. The con-
"finement due to stellar wind then becomes weaker, and"
the fluid element is allowed to expand like in a de Laval
nozzle before eventually becoming supersonic again at
a second (“outer”) sonic surface. Other streamlines go
"through the inner sonic surface only, and never touches"
the outer sonic surface or the reverse shock front.
Stellar winds impose more stringent Courant-
"Friedrichs-Lewy conditions: each model takes ∼ 51 hr to
run on a 40-core, 4-GPU computing node of the Popeye-"
Simons Computing Cluster. To accelerate the conver-
"gence of our simulations, in addition to the “adaptive"
"coarsening” technique in Paper I, we also adopt a two-"
"step scheme of simulation: (1) turn on hydrodynamics,"
"thermochemistry and radiative transfer, run the simu-"
"lation for ∼ 15 τdyn until the model almost reaches the
quasi-steady state without stellar winds; (2) turn on the"
"stellar wind and continue the simulation for & 200 τdyn
until the final quasi-steady state is reached. The dynam-"
"ical timescale for a T ∼ 104 K photoevaporative outflow
around WASP-107b is estimated as τdyn ∼ 4.8× 103 s:"
"τdyn ∼
GMp
c3s
∼ 1.2×103 s×"
")−3/2
."
To ensure that the simulations are not limited by the
"spatial resolution of simulation grid, we ran a model with"
"a higher resolution (Nlog r×Nθ×Nφ = 192×192×128)
and the results are most identical to that of our standard"
grid (Figure 3).
Another potentially influential factor is the radiation
pressure. We added this effect to our ray-tracing ra-
diative transfer procedures by explicitly computing the
momenta deposited by the photons absorbed or scat-
"tered. As §5.1 will discuss, the radiative pressure on
He∗ transitions plays a very minor role on the overall"
dynamics and He∗ observables.
3. WASP-107b:
AN OUTFLOW SHAPED BY STELLAR WINDS
3.1. Observation Results
"Quantitatively, we directly compare our synthetic ob-"
servations to He∗ line profiles and light curves. The He∗
transmission spectrum of WASP-107b is both spectrally
and temporally resolved with different spectrographs:
NIRSPEC and CARMENES (Spake et al. 2018; Allart
et al. 2019; Kirk et al. 2020). We also carried out an
independent analysis of the transit observed from NIR-
"SPEC on the Keck telescope on April 6th, 2019 (same"
as Kirk et al. 2020). Our data reduction is carried out
"using the procedures described in Zhang, Z. et al. (sub-"
mitted). He∗ transits have been observed by several
different instruments and different transit events (Fig-
ure 4). Despite the differences in instrumental charac-
"teristics and reduction pipelines, previous He∗ observa-"
tions agree with each other on the following features: (1)
"a non-Keplerian, blueshifted (∼ 2− 3 km s−1) line pro-
file; (2) a line ratio that deviates from the 1:3:5 (viz. the"
quantum degeneracies; apparently 1:8) among three He∗
transitions; (3) elongated ingress and egress timescales
"in He∗ transit light curves. Finally, in the temporally"
"resolved observation (Kirk et al. 2020), there is a hint"
of asymmetry in the outflow morphology that the egress
lasts longer than the ingress while the egress is more

3.2. Fiducial Model Setup and Necessity of Stellar
"As noted in Paper I, consistent 3D hydrodynamic sim-"
ulations with all physics are not sufficiently fast for a
comprehensive exploration of the parameter space using
Markov Chain Monte Carlo or even just gradient de-
"scent. Instead, we adopt the parameters based on the"
reported stellar and planetary conditions. The optical
and near-infrared fluxes (represented by the hν = 2 eV
bin) simply accord with the host star radius and effective

temperature. The high energy SED of the host star is
much more uncertain. Guided by the results in our Pa-
"per I, i.e. how various high-energy radiation bins affect"
"the atmospheric outflow and He∗ observables, we hand-"
tuned the high-energy SED until reasonable agreement
with the observations. The resulting high-energy SED
is fairly typical or slightly more active than a K5 star
(Gudel 1992; France et al. 2016; Youngblood et al. 2016;
"Loyd et al. 2016; Youngblood et al. 2017; Oklopčić 2019),"
but we also note that WASP-107b has a relatively short
"rotation period of 17 days, and the ∼ 600 Myr host star
has a strong chromospheric S index (0.89) (Dai & Winn"
2017).
"In addition to tuning the high-energy SED, we found"
it crucial to include stellar wind components in our sim-
ulations to adequately reproduce the existing He∗ ob-
servations. We first run a series of no-wind model as
we did in Paper I for WASP-69b. The resultant out-
"flow is largely spherically isotropic, without prominent"
comet-like tail. Figure 4 presents the He∗ line pro-
file and light curves produced in the no-wind fiducial
model (other parameters are the same as those in Ta-
ble 1). The overall equivalent width of the line pro-
"file is weaker (〈Wλ〉 ' (7.6 ± 0.2) Å in the fiducial
model, but 〈Wλ〉 ' 5.0 Å in the no-wind model). More
importantly, the line profile does not have a stronger"
"blueshifted wing, which has been validated by several"

r corresponding to the curve length along the streamline on
the bottom abscissa. As explained by §2.2 and the Case A

tical dotted lines; note that the right of them is close to the

different instruments.The impinging stellar wind stag-
nates the outflow flowing towards the host star (i.e. the
"redshifted wing), pushing the outflow to the night-side"
(the blueshifted wing). The transit light curve in the no-
wind model is also much more symmetric compared due
to the lack of comet-like tail trailing behind the planet.
"In short, a no-wind model struggles, if ever possible, to"
reproduce the various He∗ observations of WASP-107b.
"On the other hand, the windy model successfully repro-"
duced observed He∗ line profiles and light curves. We
now examine the windy model in detail.

Figure 2 presents the simulation results of our fiducial
"model, with a stellar wind modulating the outflow mor-"
phology. Each panel centers at the planet’s frame; the
"host star is located to the left of the this plot, and the"
stellar wind impinges on the photoevaporative outflow
at an angle given by the ratio between the radial veloc-
ity component and the headwind (orbital) component.
"A bow shock of Mach number ∼ 2.0 forms above the
day-side of the planet, heating the downstream flow to"
"T ∼ 4× 106 K (second panel of Figure 2). As shown by
the streamlines, the photoevaporative outflow from the"
planet is stalled at the day-side and directed by stellar
"wind to the night-side, forming a prominent tail trailing"
the planet’s orbital motion.
Along the thick streamline in Figure 2 (which quali-
"tatively resembles the “typical” streamline in Figure 1),"
we plot the spatial variation of key hydrodynamic and
thermochemical quantities both as a function of radius
from the planet core and the arc length along the stream-
"line in Figure 3. Looking at the outflow velocity first,"
a fluid element traveling on the streamline may experi-
"ence multiple sound crossings, as is shown by the Case"
"A in Figure 1 (see also §2.2). We note that this ef-
fect is strongest at the upwind side where outflow is"
impinged by stellar wind; it is much weaker elsewhere
and the reverse shock may no longer exist. The lower
panel of Figure 3 indicates that the population of He∗
is determined primarily by the equilibrium between re-
combination excitation and collisional de-excitation at
"smaller radii. At larger radii (& 102 R⊕), photoioniza-"
tion by soft FUV photons starts to take over. This is
very similar to our results in Paper I for WASP-69b.
The middle panel of Figure 3 shows another interest-
ing feature. When the streamline crosses the the planet’s
"shadow, photoionization due to soft FUV from the host"
"star vanishes. However, recombination excitation con-"
tinues in the shadow of the planet and thus creates a lo-
cal bump of higher He∗ abundances. We call this effect
the “shadow tail”. Such a feature is difficult to observe
in transits as it always hides in the planet’s shadow. If
"one is ever able to resolve this photoevaporative outflow,"
one may see the shadow tail emitting more strongly in
He∗ compared to other parts of the outflow. Such a
"“two-tail” morphology is remarkably similar to the dust
and ion tails of a comets, although with different under-"
lying physics.

falls into the “valley” between the J = 0 transition and

inated by blueshifted materials in the tail trailing be-
"hind the planet. On the red wing λ = 10833.7 Å, the"
"tail is much less relevant, and the extinction are gen-"
"erated by materials much closer to the planet. Again,"

this is attributed to the kinematics and morphology: the
"planetary outflow is impinged by the stellar wind, and"
the outflow on the day-side or the headwind direction is
stagnated.
"Finally, we remind the reader that due to its large"
"aperture, Keck/NIRSPEC is able to resolve the He∗"
both spectrally and temporally. Figure 5 presents the
observed and simulated variation of He∗ absorption in
time and wavelength space together as a heatmap. The
vertical dotted lines are the rest-frame wavelengths of
"three He∗ transitions, the horizontal dashed lines are the"
expected ti to tiv (starts/ends of the ingress/egress) of
the planet’s transit. Our simulation with stellar winds
successfully reproduces the key feature: since most of
the He∗ is produced by the comet-like tail trailing the
"planet (Figure 6), the strongest absorption occurs after"
"mid-transit, while the pre-ingress absorption is much"
weaker than the post-egress one. This feature is also
manifested by the asymmetry in the transit light curve
(Figure 4). The outflow morphology loses spherical
symmetry; the part ahead of the planet and behind
"the planet are both blueshifted. As a result, the He∗"
line profiles seen pre-ingress and post-egress are both
more blueshifted compared to the mid-transit line pro-
file. This is again consistent with the NIRSPEC obser-
vation.
4. PARAMETRIC STUDIES
The previous section elaborates the fiducial model
"for WASP-107b. We found that, by including stellar"
"winds, the simulation quantitatively reproduces various"
observed features of the He∗ transits. This section in-
vestigates how the outflow morphology and He∗ observ-
ables are affected by each model parameter (Figures 7
"and 8). We set a series of models, each differs from the"
fiducial model by one parameter only unless specifically
indicated. Table 2 and Figure 8 summarize the models
and their corresponding key He∗ observables.

or to terminate before reaching the outer boundary because the streamlines are projected. Note that Models 107-4 and 107-6
comply with the Case C in Figure 1."
Paper I found that He∗ transit observation are pri-
marily determined by soft FUV (which destroys the He∗
state) and the EUV bands (which is most important in
driving the photoevaporative outflow; interested read-
ers are referred to Paper I for more details); the Lyman-
Werner and X-ray bands play secondary roles. We found
very similar results for WASP-107b after including stel-
"lar winds, by running a separate test simulation exclud-"
ing X-ray photons (not presented in this paper) that
yields almost identical morphology and observables to
"the fiducial one. In Model 107-1 through 107-3, we raise"
"stellar fluxes in the soft FUV (hν = 7 eV), soft EUV"
"(20 eV), and hard EUV (40 eV) bands, respectively."
Model 107-1 increases the soft FUV flux by a factor
"of 10. As we have noted earlier, soft FUV does not"
inject significant heat into the atmosphere and has mi-
nor effects in driving the planetary outflow. Its mass
loss rate is very similar to that in the fiducial model
"[(Ṁ/10−9 M⊕ yr
−1) = 1.08 versus 1.02]. Soft FUV is"
nonetheless capable of photoionizing the He∗ state ef-
"ficiently, slicing the equivalent widths by a factor of 2"
"[(〈Wλ〉/10−2 Å = 3.7 versus 7.6). Models 107-2 and 107-
3 raise the soft and hard EUV flux level by a factor of 10,"
"respectively. As expected, intense EUV fluxes boosted"
"the photoevaporation rates, indicated by the stronger"
"mass loss rate and equivalent width. What is curious,"
"Figure 8. Similar to Figures 4 but for the models in §4.2 and Table 2. Left column compares Models 107-1 through 107-3 to
the fiducial 107-0, and the right column does the comparison for Models 107-4 through 107-6 to 107-0. The window function
for the light curves are the same as the one used to yield Figure 4."

"however, is that in 107-3, the planetary outflow is so"
strong that it is push back the bow shock with stellar
wind on the day-side to much higher altitudes. In order
to fully contain the pushed-back contact surface and the
"bow shock, we use rout = 800 R⊕ for the outer radial"
boundary of 107-3. 1 This effect is so strong that we be-
"gin to see the day-side (pre-ingress) material in redshift,"
and the overall He∗ line profile is now biased towards the
"red wing (Figure 8, upper panel). This strong day-side"
outflow also manifests as a reversed asymmetry in the
"He∗ light curve, where the ingress is more extended and"
"stronger than the egress (Figure 8, lower panel). This"
qualitative change in behavior will possibly constrain
the balance of high-energy radiation strengths between
the stellar wind and the planetary outflow.
4.2. How Stellar Winds Shape Outflows
In hydrodynamic simulations (no magnetic effects in-
"cluded), the interactions between stellar winds and plan-"
etary outflows should be determined by the wind ram
"pressure (∼ ρwindv2wind), as a function of the density
(ρwind) and velocity (~vwind). Fortunately, this degener-"
acy between wind density and velocity can be potentially
"broken by orbital motion, i.e. the headwind component"
of the stellar wind.
"On one hand, Model 107-4 quadruples the density"
"ρwind and halves the velocity vwind, thus keeping the"
radial (from host to planet) component of ram pressure
roughly the same as in the fiducial model. The headwind
"component, caused by the Keplerian motion vK of the"
"planet, is held constant here. Lower velocity shear yields"
a less turbulent trailing tail with weaker shear instabili-
"ties. As a result, the tail lags behind the planet in both"
"velocity and spatial sense, producing a more blueshifted"
"line profile [(∆vpeak/km s
−1) = −4.5, versus −3.5 for"
"the fiducial], and a more asymmetric light curve. On the"
"other hand, in Model 107-5 which doubles the velocity"
"but quartered the density, the tail is now influenced by"
the radial component more heavily. It is primarily di-
"rected towards the night-side, and displays considerably"
more vigorous shear instabilities due to greater velocity
shears. The He∗ light curve has much weaker post-egress
"absorption, while the equivalent width sees more vari-"
"ability [(〈Wλ〉/10−3Å) = 7.4 ± 0.4, versus 7.6 ± 0.2 in
the fiducial model]. Finally, Model 107-6, only increases"
the density ρwind by a factor of two. Having the same
"1 We carried out another simulation run that has rout = 400 R⊕
(same as other runs) for the radial boundary, while all other phys-
ical conditions remain the same as Model 107-3. It is confirmed
that this test run (not shown in the paper) has all quantitative
characteristics almost identical to 107-3, despite that its mass
loss rate is ∼ 5 % greater."

5. DISCUSSIONS
5.1. Tail: Stellar Wind or Radiation Pressure?
"As we have shown in the previous sections, the exist-"
ing He∗ observations of WASP-107b are suggestive of a
comet-like tails that trail the photoevaporating planet.
What is the mechanism that give rise to these tails? Is
it stellar wind or radiation pressure or a combination
of these two effects? When studying the Lyα outflow
"for exoplanets, previous studies often attributed tran-"
sit asymmetry to radiation pressure (e.g. Bourrier et al.
"2015, 2016). Recent works in He∗ followed suit: in an"
EVE simulation of WASP-107b (a collisionless particle-
"based simulations; Allart et al. 2018, 2019), the authors"
found that their prescription of radiation pressure ac-
"celerates the outflow way too quickly, producing a tail"
that is directly pointing away from the night-side of the
planet. Their prescribed effect of radiation pressure is
so strong that the authors had to artificially decrease
the stellar spectrum near the He∗ lines by a factor 50
to achieve reasonable agreement with the observations of
"WASP-107b. We argue, in this work, that their particle-"

based simulation is not adequate to account for the effect
of radiation pressure on He∗ transitions.
We must first clearly distinguish the Lyα transition
and the He∗ transitions. The lower state of Lyα is the
"ground state of neutral hydrogen, while He∗ (i.e. the"
23S state of helium) is relatively much more difficult to
"populate, and has a much lower abundances throughout"
"the domain of interest (. 10−5, Figure 3; see also Paper
I; Oklopčić 2019). Meanwhile, the product of Einstein A"
coefficient and the overall element abundance for helium
"is also ∼ 102 times smaller than Lyα . Consequently, the
altitude where most He∗ absorption occurs is often much"
lower than Lyα absorption region. The gas density in
"these regions is significantly higher, and the mean free"
path (MFP) of momentum transfer are much shorter.
"In our simulations, we typically see n(H+) & 106 cm−3,
and an MFP of λ = 1/[n(H+)σ] . 103 cm (see also
Thomas & Humberston 1972; Draine 2011). This is"
"∼ 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the hydrody-
namic length scales. Such a contrast in length scales"
"demands a hydrodynamic treatment, instead of a col-"
"lisionless particle-based one. What is more, the mo-"
menta deposited into He∗ by absorption are quickly di-
"luted and thermalized by more collisions. In contrast,"
the collisionless particle-based treatment such as EVE is
"more appropriate for simulating the Lyα outflow, since"
the density where most Lyα absorption occurs is much
"lower: in our simulations, we have n(H+) . 10−1 cm−3"
"and the MFP is λ ∼ 1010 cm ∼ 10 R⊕. Neutral hy-
drogen atom there are essentially decoupled from other"
"components of the gas, and are indeed susceptible to"
the momentum deposited by the absorption of Lyα .
"Nonetheless, as far as the He∗ observations are con-"
"cerned, the radiation pressure on Lyα can be safely ig-"
nored.
Figure 9 compares the magnitudes of acceleration
(force per unit mass) by radiation pressure (where most
"He∗ absorption occurs), gas pressure gradient, and in-"
"ertial force (including stellar and planetary gravitation,"
"centrifugal force, and Coriolis force). Radiation pres-"
sure in this model is more than three orders of magni-
"tude weaker than the pure hydrodynamic effects. Again,"
the high density of He∗ absorbing region maintains suf-
ficiently strong momentum coupling of different species
and guarantees quick dilution of the momenta injected
by Lyα photons. The photons here heat rather than
push the planetary outflow.
"In addition, we set up a verification test simulation to"
numerically examine the effect of radiation pressure. We
added two more photon energy bins in our ray-tracing
radiative transfer module: one has hν = 10.2 eV for
"Lyα , and hν = 1.15 eV for the metastable helium"
lines whose flux is of a typical K-type stars (Wood et al.
"2005). For simplicity, we assume that the cross-sections"
for photon momentum absorption for these two energy
"bins are equal to the line-center value, and we ignored"
the dispersion of photons in the frequency space. We
note that these assumptions should only amplify the ef-
fects of radiation pressure. This simulation produced
almost identical result as a no-radiation-pressure model
"in terms of hydrodynamic and thermochemical profiles,"
as well as He∗ observables.
"In summary, at least for He∗ lines, radiation pressure"
only plays a minor role in shaping the outflow morphol-
"ogy and kinematics. Stellar wind, as we have shown in"
"previous section, is essential in reproducing various ob-"
"served features He∗ transitions. We propose that, should"
future observation of He∗ show strong deviations from
"a “quiescent” line ratio (∼ 1 : 8) or an asymmetry in
line profile or light curve, it may be regarded as an in-"
"dication of stellar winds, whose properties can be con-"
strained with detailed 3D hydrodynamic simulations.
"Figure 11. Similar to Figure 6 but for the wavelengths (λ/Å) ∈ {1215.3, 1215.7, 1215.9} near the Lyα line."
5.2. Shear Instability
At the contact surface that separates the stellar wind
"and the photoevaporative outflow, there is region of"
large shears in velocity. Shear instabilities are gener-
"ated here, manifesting themselves as billowing outflows."
"We found that since the sonic surface is located at much
lower altitude (Figure 1; see also Figure 3), the outflow"
mass-loss rate is not affected by these shear instabili-
"ties. If the host star high-energy SED is held constant,"
the mass loss rate stays rather stable (< 1 % fluctua-
"tion) at about Ṁ ' 1.02 × 10−9 M⊕ yr−1 in our fidu-
cial model of WASP-107b. However, the He∗ absorption"
"takes place at higher altitudes (Figure 6), and is directly"
influenced by shear instabilities. Fluctuations of tran-
"sit depths have relative amplitudes ∼ 5 % to ∼ 20 %
at different wavelength, while the typical timescale is"
"∼ 0.2 day (Figure 10). In contrast, in our WASP-69b
model in Paper I, shear instabilities are not excited since"
stellar wind was not included. He∗ absorption shows a
". 0.5 % temporal variations.
An interesting prediction associated with shear insta-"
bility is that there should be much stronger fluctuations
in the blueshifted wings of He∗ line profiles. More-
"over, in the He∗ light curve, the variability should be"
much stronger after the mid-transit point. The reason
is that shear instability takes time and space to grow:
its spatial extent is still small in the redshifted head
"part of the outflow, but fully developed when it enters"
"the blueshifted tail. In Figure 4, the gray shaded region"
indicates the amplitudes of variability due to shear bil-
"lows, and clearly demonstrates this fluctuation-induced"
"asymmetry. Up to the composition of this paper, two"
"He∗ transits have been reported; more transits, prefer-"
"ably from the same instruments, are needed to evaluate"
the fluctuation asymmetries.
5.3. Line Ratio Probes Kinematics Instead of Density
It has been suggested that the line ratios between
three transition of the He∗ can tell us about the den-
sity of the underlying outflow. If all three lines are
"not saturated, the line ratios between the triplet should"
"be proportional to 1:3:5, or their quantum degeneracies."
Considering that the two longer-wavelength transitions
"are often blended together thermally and kinematically,"
the line ratio should be 1:8. Now if the density of the

upper panel has a saturated shape but the excess absorption
does not reach 〈∆�〉 = −1, because (1) the extinction by
planet core is subtracted from the total absorption, and (2)
the full ingress of the Lyα absorption region is delayed by
the stellar wind."
outflow is high enough that the transitions start to sat-
"urate, the line ratio may begin to deviate from 1:8 and"
hint us about the number density of He∗ in the outflow.
"However, as we have seen in Paper I for WASP-69b,"
"most of the He∗ extinction happens at high-altitude,"
"low-density regions of 101−2 R⊕ (see Figure 6, showing"
the mid-transit extinction at three characteristic wave-
lengths near the He∗ transitions). The lines are far from
"saturation in these regions. In other words, the line ra-"
tios can not directly probe the density distribution at
least for WASP-107b.
We do observe a line ratio of about 1:4 in our fidu-
"cial model of WASP-107b, which is significantly differ-"
ent from the 1:8 expected by quantum degeneracies. It
is noted that this deviation is primarily caused by the
kinematics of the outflow: the peak due to two longer-
wavelength transitions are blueshifted by the wind by
"up to ∼ 20− 30 km s−1, that its blueshifted wing start
to invade the shorter-wavelength transition. We will see"
in the next subsection that the line ratio and the exact
shape of the He∗ will serve as a probe of the outflow
kinematics and in turn the properties of stellar wind.
Here we present an example that one can semi-
quantitatively constrain the stellar wind density and ve-
locity using the He∗ observation. We shall focus on the
"contact discontinuity, i.e. the boundary separating the"
"stellar wind and the planetary outflow (Figures 1, 2)."
The distance of contact discontinuity from the planet
can be estimated by equating the total pressure of a pho-
toevaporative outflow to the ram pressure of the stellar

"rcd ∼ 45 R⊕ with the parameters in Table 1. This is
reasonably accurate with visual inspection of Figure 2."
We note that if the stellar wind intensity is similar to
"the Sun at an a = 0.055 AU orbit, which roughly has"
"ρwind ∼ 3 × 103 mp cm−3 and vwind ∼ 300 km s−1 at
∼ 0.05 AU (see Venzmer & Bothmer 2018 and refer-
ences therein), rcd ∼ 240 R⊕ would be inconsistent with
the observations on WASP-107b. Such stronger stellar"
wind experienced by WASP-107b is perhaps not surpris-
"ing, given its closer-in orbit, and the relative youth and"
higher activity of the host star.
5.4. Synergy between Lyα and He∗ Observations
This section briefly discusses how observing transits
of an exoplanets in both Lyα and He∗ can be syner-
gistic in helping us understand its atmospheric outflow.
"First of all, we reiterate the point made in §5.1 that
most Lyα absorption happens at much higher altitudes"
than He∗ absorption. The low density at higher alti-
tude means that Lyα radiation pressure may start to
reshape the morphology of neutral hydrogen; while the
"at lower altitude of He∗ absorption, radiation pressure"
heats rather than pushes the planetary outflow. This
potentially allows us to disentangle the influence of ra-
"diation pressure and stellar wind, and disentangle the"
inner and outer parts of the planet outflow.
We produced synthetic line profiles and light curves
in the Lyα band for WASP-107b in Figure 12 and Fig-
ure 11. Note that we did not account for the extinc-
tion due to the interstellar medium. We also note that
Lyα observations are currently unavailable for WASP-
107b and will probably remain the case given the dis-
tant host and the expected strong UV extinction. How-
"ever, we still notice that the line profile is blueshifted"
significantly while Lyα light curve shows much more
pronounced asymmetry with elongated egress. Both of
these observations are qualitatively similar to other exo-
"planets observed in Lyα (e.g., GJ 436b; see also Ehren-"
"reich et al. 2015; Bourrier et al. 2015, 2016). It is also cu-"
rious that radiation pressure alone could not produce as
strong as an asymmetry produced by stellar wind. The
no-wind model produces deep Lyα transit light curve
that ingress and egress elongated to similar extent. An-
other prediction we can predict from joint Lyα and He∗
is that the absorption fluctuation due to shear insta-
bilities should be stronger in Lyα than in He∗; and
Lyα fluctuations should lag behind He∗ fluctuations.
"The reason is, again, most Lyα absorption happen at"
higher altitude than He∗ absorption. Instabilities grows
as it propagates from lower altitude region to higher al-
titudes. The shaded bands in Figure 12 illustrate the
simulated variations in Lyα absorption.
Some of the points raised here were also suggested by
McCann et al. (2019) who focused hot Jupiters. Af-
"ter all, transit observations in He∗ and Lyα , particu-"
"larly multiple simultaneous transit observations, will be"
instrumental in helping us understand the morphology
and kinematics of atmospheric loss on different spatial
"scales. With such observations, we may also acquire"
more knowledge about the characteristics and variabil-
ities of stellar wind from the host star. Hybrid models
combining hydrodynamics with particles-based simula-
tions are perhaps mandatory to fully characterize the
various species of the outflow at highest altitude espe-
cially neutral hydrogen.
6. SUMMARY
This paper presents simulations of the metastable he-
lium absorption lines in the transmission of WASP-107b.
We employ full 3D hydrodynamic simulations to model
"the dynamics of evaporating planetary atmospheres, in"
which non-equilibrium thermochemistry and ray-tracing
radiative transfer are co-evolved. The processes that
populate and de-populate the metastable state of neu-
tral helium are included in the thermochemical network
and solved consistently. These allow us to predict the
"mass loss rate, the temperature profile, and synthetic"
observation in both Lyα and He∗; we note that previous
works often have to assume or prescribe the first two.
"By exploring the parameter space, we find a plau-"
sible model for WASP-107b that also involves a stel-
lar wind stronger than the solar wind. This model
launches a photoevaporative outflow with a mass-loss
"rate of Ṁ ' 1.0 × 10−9 M⊕ yr−1. The predicted He∗
line profiles and light curves exhibit reasonable agree-"
ment with existing observations. Time-averaged trans-
"mission spectrum has a ∼ 1 : 4 > 1 : 8 line ratio, while
the light curve holds a considerable asymmetry about"
the transit median. A comet-like tail trailing the planet
is a natural explanation of these observations. We argue
that such a tail is the result of a relatively strong stellar
"wind rather than radiation pressure, because (1) the low"
"overall abundance ofHe∗, and (2) the photon momenta"
deposited by absorption and scattering are quickly ther-
malized by collisional momentum relaxation. The in-
"coming stellar wind triggers shear instabilities, and the"
"He∗ transit depth fluctuates by 5 − 20 % at a roughly
∼ 0.2 day timescale consequently. Tuning the character-
istics of stellar wind in a plausible range does affect the"
spectral line shapes through alternating the direction
"and configuration of the tail, yet the equivalent width"
is largely invariant. The Lyα transmission spectra and
light curve synthesized using the fiducial Model 107-0
suggest stronger light curve asymmetry and variabilities
due to shear instabilities. We propose that surveys of
exoplanets in Lyα and He∗ simultaneously are crucial
for understanding planetary outflow and stellar wind.
"Looking ahead, planetary outflow modulated by stel-"
lar winds may extract positive or negative orbital an-
gular momentum from the planet via dynamical (anti-
")friction (Li et al. 2020), and may then lead to migra-"
tions of planetary orbits. Planetary magnetic fields and
the fields carried by stellar winds or coronal ejecta may
also play essential roles in shaping the dynamics of an
evaporating close-in planet. Future simulations should
have magnetohydrodynamics involved in these processes
"with improved consistency, and potentially shed light on"
