ABSTRACT
"Using a 3D global solver of the linearized Euler equations, we model acoustic oscillations over back-"
ground velocity flow fields of single-cell meridional circulation with deep and shallow return flows as
well as a double-cell meridional circulation profile. The velocities are generated using a mean-field
hydrodynamic and dynamo model – moving through the regimes with minimal parameter changes;
counter-rotation near the base of the tachocline is induced by sign inversion of the non-diffusive action
of turbulent Reynolds stresses (Λ-effect) due to the radial inhomogeneity of the Coriolis number. By
"mimicking the stochastic excitation of resonant modes in the convective interior, we simulate real-"
ization noise present in solar observations. Using deep-focusing to analyze differences in travel-time
"signatures between the three regimes, as well as comparing to solar observations, we show that current"
"helioseismology techniques may offer important insights about the location of the return flow, how-"
"ever, that it may not be possible to definitively distinguish between profiles of single-cell or double-cell"
meridional circulation.

1. INTRODUCTION
"Meridional mass flows are characterized by large circulation structures, redistributing angular momentum and mag-
netic flux (Hathaway et al. 2003) throughout the convective interior of the Sun. Doppler measurements have been used"
"to study the surface expressions of these circulation cells in detail (Duvall 1979; Hathaway 1996; Ulrich 2010), showing"
strong poleward flows (20 m s−1) in each hemisphere. The Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) (Scherrer et al. 1995)
"of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) (Domingo et al. 1995), its successor – the Helioseismic Magnetic"
"Imager (HMI) (Scherrer et al. 2012) aboard the Solar Data Observatory (SDO) spacecraft (Pesnell et al. 2012), as well"
as the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) (Harvey et al. 1996) have been instrumental in providing the long
term observational data needed to analyze these structures.
Applying techniques in local helioseismology to these observations allows us to probe below the solar surface
(Christensen-Dalsgaard 2002; Gizon & Birch 2005); cross-correlating measurements of surface oscillations provides
insight into the structure of flows that advect acoustic rays resonating throughout the convective interior. While
measurements in subsurface layers (> 0.96R�) have remained relatively consistent (e.g. Giles et al. 1997; Zhao &
"Kosovichev 2004), complications arise when attempting to probe deeper into the solar interior. The return flow of the"
"circulation cell has historically been theorized to sit near the tachocline (∼ 0.72 R�), with a velocity weaker than that
of the surface flow by an order of magnitude (∼ 2 m s−1) (Giles 1999) – the minimal impact of these flows, along with"

"systematic errors that are not yet fully understood (Rajaguru & Antia 2020), lead to significant difficulties in clearly"
resolving deep meridional circulation structures.
"The manifestation of these difficulties can be seen in the variability of inferred meridional velocity profiles, with"
"more recent estimates of much shallower return flow depths (from ∼ 40 to ∼ 70 Mm; Mitra-Kraev & Thompson
(2007); Hathaway (2012) respectively). The nature of the single-cell model has also been put into question with a"
helioseismic analysis of HMI data (Zhao et al. 2013; Chen 2019) inferring a two-cell structure – a result whose viability
"has been validated by numerical, convectively driven, MHD/HD simulations (Brun & Toomre 2002; Miesch et al. 2006;"
"Guerrero et al. 2013; Matilsky et al. 2019). Recent analysis of MDI and GONG data, however, continues to insist"
on the single-cell model (Gizon et al. 2020) – typically employed by mean-field simulations of the Sun (Rempel 2005;
Hotta & Yokoyama 2011; Küker et al. 2011; Kitchatinov 2013) and other late-type stars (Kitchatinov & Olemskoy
2012).
The transition between single- and double-cell circulation structures has been explored in conjunction with anti-Solar
and Solar profiles of differential rotation in the convectively driven hydrodynamic models of Guerrero et al. (2013);
Gastine et al. (2014); Käpylä et al. (2014); Featherstone & Miesch (2015). These simulations highlight the impact
"of angular momentum transport by non-diffusive turbulent Reynolds stresses via gyroscopic pumping (the Λ-effect,"
Ruediger (1989); Kichatinov & Rudiger (1993)). Mean-field modeling has shown that altering this parameter (Λ)
"(Bekki & Yokoyama 2017) can induce the formation of counter-rotation cells in the lower convection zone, with Pipin"
& Kosovichev (2018) demonstrating that radial variations of the Coriolis number near the tachocline can be a potential
physical basis for inducing a sign inversion in Λ.
"In this paper, we employ the GALE (Global Acoustic Linearized Euler) code (Stejko et al. 2021), simulating the"
"propagation of acoustic waves through shallow and deep single-cell, as well as double-cell regimes of meridional back-"
"ground flows – generated by the mean-field non-linear hydrodynamic and dynamo models of Pipin & Kosovichev (2018,"
"2019). These models allow us to examine the helioseismic signatures generated by each regime, as well as offering a"
baseline for the low-end of variance in travel-time measurements that characterize shallow single-cell and double-cell
meridional circulation – generated by minimal parameter changes near the base of the tachocline. Previous conclu-
sions on the nature of meridional circulation circulation structure have been inferred with the aid of ad-hoc models
(Zhao et al. 2013; Chen 2019; Hartlep et al. 2013; Gizon et al. 2020); we hope that a forward-modeling approach to
examining velocity profiles generated by mean-field models will lend important insights into observations made with
current helioseismology techniques.
"This paper is organized as follows. In §2 we briefly describe the formulation of the GALE code. In §3 we outline
the deep focusing method used to measure travel-time differences of acoustic rays propagating throughout the solar"
"interior, and in §4, we present the results of these measurements on three models (K1, M1 & M2) of meridional
circulation. In §5 we offer an analysis and discussion of these results."
2. MODEL BACKGROUND
The GALE (Global Acoustic Linearized Euler) algorithm (Stejko et al. 2021) solves the conservation form of the
"linearized compressible Euler equations on a fully global 3-dimensional grid: 0 ≤ φ ≤ 2π, 0 < θ < π, 0 < r ≤ R�. The
linear approximation is solved for perturbations of the potential flow field (denoted by a prime), over background field"
terms (denoted by a tilde) derived from the standard solar model S (Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 1996).
"∂t

"∂t

"∂t
= −"
"(

"p̃

")
. (3)"
"Υ is defined as the divergence of the momentum field m (Υ = ∇·m = ∇·ρu), computing perturbations in the potential
flow field and omitting solenoidal terms in our governing equations. Perturbations are initiated by a randomized"
"source function (S), mimicking the stochastic excitation of acoustic modes in the convective interior (Woodard 1984)."
Governing Eqns. (1) - (3) are computed in the pseudo-spectral regime through spherical harmonic decomposition
"(f =
∑
lm aYlm) of field terms (Υ, ρ, p, u) using the Libsharp spherical harmonic library (Reinecke & Seljebotn 2013)."
Meridional Circulation 3
"The current form of our governing equations (Eqns. 1 - 3) are solved in a vector spherical harmonic (VSH) basis, while"
"the material derivative is solved in its Cauchy conservation form (∇ : (m′ũ + ρ̃ũu′)) using a symmetric tensor spherical
harmonic (TSH) basis. This formulation allows for the use of recursion relations to compute derivatives tangent to"
"the surface of the sphere (∂/∂θ, ∂/∂φ), resulting in the 1D radial relations we solve in our time-discretization scheme."
The conservation of energy (Eq. 3) is computed as a relationship between pressure and the compressible momentum
"field in the adiabatic approximation (Christensen-Dalsgaard 2014), where heat transfer is neglected. Convective action"
in the background model is treated separately by isolating the Brunt-Väisälä frequency (N2). In order to avoid
"growing convective instabilities, we set the slightly negative values of the Brunt-Väisälä frequency in the convection"
"zone (N2 < 0) to zero – obviating the need to modify background profiles of density, pressure and the adiabatic"
"ratio (Γ1), see Hanasoge et al. (2006); Parchevsky & Kosovichev (2007); Papini et al. (2014). A full description and"
validation of the model’s algorithm can be found Stejko et al. (2021).
3. METHOD
The spatial resolution of the model is set by the spherical harmonic degree l = 200. This value corresponds to an
"azimuthal resolution of Nφ = 600 and a latitudinal resolution of Nθ = 450, chosen to avoid aliasing errors during"
sampling. This resolution allows for the detection of signals throughout the convection zone to an upper limit of
"∼ 0.96R�. The temporal cadence of the model is 3 seconds with data being saved at 1 minute intervals for a total
of 67 hours (4000 minutes) – a time-scale too short to effectively resolve signals in the convection zone (Braun &"
Birch 2008). We can improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by increasing the background velocities in our model
"by a factor of 36 (see Hartlep et al. (2013)), mimicking the SNR we would expect in approximately a decade of solar"
observations – within the operational time-frame of HMI.
Acoustic oscillations traveling through the solar interior are advected by regimes of mean mass flows in the convection
zone. Measuring perturbations on the solar surface allows for the application of local helioseismology techniques (see
Gizon & Birch (2005)) in order to infer the structure of these internal flow velocities. We employ the technique of
"deep focusing (Charbonneau 2005; Zhao et al. 2009), in which radial velocity perturbtaions at two points on the"
"model surface, separated by some angular distance (∆), are cross-correlated. The resulting correlation signal forms"
"the charectristic profile of a Gabor wavelet (Kosovichev & Duvall 1997; Giles 1999; Nigam et al. 2007), which can be"
described by the function:
"Ψ(τ,∆) ∝
∑
δv"
")]
exp"
"[

δω2"
")2]
. (4)"
"τ is the time-lag between the signals, ω0 and δω are the central frequency and width of the frequency filter respectively."
"v = ω/
√
l(l + 1) is the horizontal phase velocity and u = ∂ω/∂kh is the horizontal group velocity. The function is"
summed over a narrow range of phase velocities δv. We fit this function (Eq. 4) to our cross-correlated signal using
"the iterative Levenberg-Marquardt method, providing an estimate of the time-lag from the group and phase velocities."
"In order to measure the impact of meridional flow fields on acoustic rays, we subtract the time-lag (τ) of southward"
traveling waves from their northward traveling counterparts (δτNS). The ray-path approximation (Giles 1999) then
offers a basis for inferring the magnitude of the velocity field in the direction of the travelling acoustic ray (assuming
the path of the ray Γ0 remains unperturbed).

"Although this functions omits non-linear effects of large flow velocities, it serves as a good approximation of travel-time"
differences – seen by computed travel-time comparisons in Fig. 4.
"This method is applied to the surface mesh-grid of our model, sampled at approximately 300 km above the photo-"
sphere (1.0004R�). Each pixel (Nθ x Nφ = 450 x 600) is treated as a center point around which cubic hermite splines
are used to remap a 60◦ x 60◦ patch into azimuthal equidistant coordinates (Postel’s proejection) at a resolution of
"approximately 0.6◦ per pixel. Great circle distances (∆) are selected at every interval (1.2◦) from 0◦ to 60◦, for"
which 30◦ wide sectors in the north and south (2 pixels in radius) are averaged and cross-correlated with each other.
This signal can be enhanced by averaging over every point in the longitude (Nφ = 600) and smoothed by averaging
"±3◦ (±5 pix) in the latitude. We can further smooth our data by averaging the diameter of each great circle over
±2.4◦, where travel time offsets are interpolated to an estimated time-lag using the ray-path approximation (Thank"

you to Dr. Ruizhu Chen for suggesting this smoothing technique). The application of this method allows for the
measurement of acoustic travel times and inferences of meridional velocities throughout the convection zone – from
the convective-radiative interface at the tachocline (0.70R�) to near the solar surface (0.96R�). An illustration of the
"remapping and pixel selection technique, along with corresponding acoustic ray-paths through the model interior can"
be seen in Fig. 1.

coordinates, pixels are selected in 30◦ wide northern and southern sectors (2 pixels in radius). Right) The acoustic ray-paths

4. MERIDIONAL PROFILES
"We apply the deep focusing method (§3) to three profiles of meridional circulation generated by non-linear mean-
field hydrodynamic and dynamo models. The first is a single-cell meridional circulation model with a deep return flow"
situated near the base of the tachocline – based on the mean-field model of Kichatinov (2004) and described as model
M2 in Pipin & Kosovichev (2018); in this paper we will refer to this model as K1 in order to avoid confusion. The
"next two are a shallow single-cell, with return flow at approximately 0.80R�, and a double-cell meridional circulation"
profile referred to as M1 and M2 respectively in Pipin & Kosovichev (2019). These meridional velocities are used as
"the background terms (ũr,ũθ) in our governing equations (1-3). The latitudinal velocities (ũθ) for the models (M1 &"
"M2) are shown in Fig. 2, with streamlines representing the circulation profile."
We characterize internal meridional flow profiles by plotting N-S travel-time differences (δτNS) as a function of their
"travel distance (∆ = 12◦ − 42◦) – corresponding to an increasing depth in the convection zone (r = 0.93R� − 0.72R�
). In Fig. 3, we show 5 latitudinal averages (30◦N − 50◦N, 10◦N − 30◦N, 10◦S − 10◦N, 10◦S − 30◦S, 30◦S − 50◦S) of
these travel-time differences for our regimes of meridional circulation. Measured travel-time differences (solid lines)"
are compared to theoretical travel-time differences (dashed lines) computed using the ray-path approximation (Eq. 5).
"Randomized functions are used to generate the oscillatory signal in our source (S, Eq. 2, see Stejko et al. (2021) for"
a detailed description) resulting in unique profiles of realization noise – of which three different profiles are shown for
"models K1, M1 and M2 (Fig. 3). To measure the bounds of our noise, we use 100 unique source functions on a model"
with no background flows; the noise can then be characterized as the standard deviation (σNS) of the measured signal
from zero:
"√√√√ 1
N"
"N∑
i=1"
δτ2i . (6)
Error-bars in Fig. 3 show one standard deviation of the noise. We can improve the SNR in our measurements
"significantly – especially at larger travel distances, by applying a phase-velocity filter to our data prior to deep focusing."
"The filter is defined as a Gaussian function in phase-velocity space (Nigam et al. 2007) with a width of σ = 0.05v,"
where v is the phase speed (ω/l(l + 1)). The resulting travel-time differences can be seen at the bottom of Fig. 3.

30◦S − 50◦S. Dashed lines are theoretical times computed using the ray-path approximation (Eq. 5). Error bars show the
standard deviation of the measured realization noise (σNS , Eq. 6)."
"Comparing the signals from the three models, we see a noticeable variation in the travel-time differences of the"
"deep single-cell (K1) profile – showing a much less rapid decrease with travel distance, resulting in a gap wider than"
one standard deviation of the noise throughout a large part of the convective interior. The shallow single-cell and
"double-cell regimes (M1 and M2 respectively) however, fall within one standard deviation of the range of realization"
"noise, even with the significant increase in the SNR through the application of a phase-velocity filter. These results"
6 Stejko et al.
"have positive implications for distinguishing between deep and shallow single-cell meridional circulation, however"
the differences between shallow single- and double-cell profiles are much more subtle; using current helioseismology
"techniques, within the time-frame of HMI measurements (∼ 10 years), any definitive statements on whether meridional
circulation has one or two cells may be difficult to make."
"In order to highlight systematic errors present in our model, as well as compare our measurements to ray-path"
"theory, we subtract noise profiles from our measurements of travel-time differences in models K1, M1 and M2, for the"
phase-speed filtered data-set (Fig. 4) – revealing a close and consistent agreement with the travel-time differences
computed using the ray-path approximation.

(c) under the application of Gaussian phase-speed filter (σ = 0.05vp) with profiles of noise subtracted, showing 5 latitudinal
averages spanning 30◦N − 50◦N, 10◦N − 30◦N, 10◦S − 10◦N, 10◦S − 30◦S, 30◦S − 50◦S. Dashed lines are theoretical times
computed using the ray-path approximation (Eq. 5)."
"We further compare our models to the publicly available data from the analysis of Gizon et al. (2020) (Fig. 5),"
"scaling the travel-time differences computed using the ray-path approximation in our models (K1, M1 & M2), to their"
travel-time measurements using MDI/GONG observations for Solar Cycle 24 (2008-2019). It is apparent that the
level of noise is too large to draw significant conclusions distinguishing single- and double-cell regimes of of meridional
"circulation (M1 & M2), however the measurements do seem to be more consistent with shallower return flow (M1) as"
opposed to a deeper one (K1).

Gizon et al. (2020). Latitude ranges in both hemispheres (10◦N − 30◦N, 10◦S − 30◦S) are averaged in order to reduce noise
and are compared to dashed lines representing latitudinal averages for models K1, M1 and M2 as measured using the ray-path
approximation (Eq. 5). Error-bars are computed as the standard deviation (σ, Eq. 6) of the travel-time differences in the
10◦N − 10◦S latitude range from zero."
Meridional Circulation 7
5. DISCUSSION
The question on the nature of meridional circulation remains an outstanding one. Large variations in inferences
have been made using similar local helioseismology techniques – from a double-cell meridional circulation profile seen
in HMI observations (Zhao et al. 2013; Chen 2019) to recent re-assertions of a single cell profile from MDI/GONG
"data (Gizon et al. 2020). The feasibility of the two regimes has been explored in recent years, with convectively driven"
MHD and HD models reproducing the necessary environment for both.
The actual differences may lie somewhere in between the large variations inferred in the two models. To that end
we test the feasibly of discerning between deep and shallow single-cell as well as double-cell profiles of meridional
"circulation, generated by the same mean-field model, operating with minimal parameter changes (K1 in Pipin &"
Kosovichev (2018) – referred to as M2 in their paper; M1 & M2 in Pipin & Kosovichev (2019)). Using the GALE code
"(Stejko et al. 2021) to simulate the stochastic excitation of acoustic modes throughout the convective interior, we apply"
the deep focusing method to measure the resulting travel-time differences. Analyzing the profiles of realization noise
generated by the model shows that the maximal differences between a shallow single-cell and double-cell regime fall well
within one standard deviation of error for both phase-speed filtered and unfiltered deep-focusing measurements. The
"deep single-cell profile (K1), however, shows enough differences to be distinguishable from the two other models (M1"
& M2). Comparing the resulting profiles to a decade of solar observations shows that while any definitive statements
"on the prevalence of either a single- or double-cell regime should be taken with a grain of salt, meaningful conclusions"
on the nature of the return flow are within the reach of current techniques in helioseismology.
