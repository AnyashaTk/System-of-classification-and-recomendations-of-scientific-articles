ABSTRACT
"Context. This paper forms the second part of our study on how the neglect of Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (Non-LTE,
NLTE) conditions in the formation of Fe i 6301.5 Å and the 6302.5 Å lines influences the atmosphere obtained by inverting their
Stokes profiles in LTE. The main cause of NLTE effects in these lines is the line opacity deficit due to the excess ionization of the Fe i
atoms by the ultraviolet (UV) photons in the Sun.
Aims. In the first paper, the above photospheric lines were assumed to have formed in 1DNLTE and the effects of horizontal radiation
transfer (RT) were neglected. In the present paper, the iron lines are computed by solving the RT in 3D. We investigate the influence
of horizontal RT on the inverted atmosphere and how it can enhance or reduce the errors due to the neglect of 1DNLTE effects.
Methods. The Stokes profiles of the iron lines are computed in LTE, 1DNLTE and 3DNLTE. They all are inverted using an LTE
inversion code. The atmosphere from the inversion of LTE profiles is taken as the reference model. The atmospheres from the inversion
of 1DNLTE profiles (testmodel-1D) and 3DNLTE profiles (testmodel-3D) are compared with it. Differences between reference and
testmodels are analysed and correspondingly attributed to NLTE and 3D effects.
Results. The effects of horizontal RT are evident in regions surrounded by strong horizontal gradients in temperature. That is along
the granule boundaries, regions surrounding magnetic elements and its boundaries with intergranular lanes. In some regions, the 3D
effects enhance the 1DNLTE effects while in some, they weaken. In the small region analysed in this paper, the errors due to neglecting
the 3D effects are less than 5% in temperature. In a majority of the pixels, the errors are less than 20% in both velocity and magnetic
field strength. These errors are also found to survive when the Stokes profiles are spatially and spectrally degraded to the resolution
of SST or DKIST.
Conclusions. The neglect of horizontal RT is found to introduce errors not only in the derived temperature but also in other atmo-
spheric parameters. How large the errors are depends on how strong the local horizontal gradients are in temperature. Compared to
the 1DNLTE effect, the 3D effects are more localised to specific regions in the atmosphere and overall less dominant."

1. Introduction
"The nature of radiative transfer problem for any stellar atmo-
sphere diagnostic is inherently multi-dimensional and coupled
with the effects of Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (Non-
LTE). For the solar atmosphere, one of the early studies where
the two-dimensional (2D) radiative transfer problem was solved
is in the construction of a spicule model by Avery & House
(1969) based on the Ca ii K line. This was followed by papers of
Cannon (1970); Cannon & Rees (1971); Avrett & Loeser (1971);
Cannon (1971) among others, who solved the 2D transfer equa-
tion to study the solar chromosphere, derive solar atmospheric
models and so on. Stenholm (1977); Stenholm & Stenflo (1977,
1978) studied the effects of horizontal irradiation on Stokes pro-
files in magnetic flux tubes by solving the 2D transfer equation in
cylindrical geometry. For a detailed review on this, see Carlsson
(2008)."
"A few years later Nordlund (1985) for the first time stud-
ied the spectral line formation in three-dimensions (3D) with
NLTE effects in a realistic 3D model atmosphere. Since then,
the 3DNLTE computations on 3D model atmospheres have been
used to compute spectral lines of, for example, lithium (Asplund"
"et al. 2003), oxygen (Kiselman & Nordlund 1995; Asplund et al.
2004, 2005; Pereira et al. 2009; Prakapavičius et al. 2013; Stef-
fen et al. 2015), iron (Lind et al. 2017), manganese (Bergemann
et al. 2019), barium (Gallagher et al. 2020), for the determina-
tion of their abundances in solar and other stellar atmospheres.
Recently, forward modeling of Chromospheric lines such as the
Ca ii 8542 Å (Leenaarts et al. 2009), Na i D1 line (Leenaarts
et al. 2010), Hα (Leenaarts et al. 2012, 2015), Mg ii h & k lines
(Leenaarts et al. 2013), and the Ca ii H & K lines (Anusha & Na-
gendra 2013; Bjørgen et al. 2018) were carried out in 3DNLTE
to understand the line formation and to study different chro-
mospheric features observed with these lines. Sukhorukov &
Leenaarts (2017) synthesized the Mg ii h & k, Lyα and Lyβ lines
taking into account the complexities of partial frequency redis-
tribution in 3DNLTE. Bergemann et al. (2019) modeled different
chromospheric lines observed in active regions using 3DNLTE
computations."
"In the present paper, we focus on the 3DNLTE effects in the
Fe i 6301.5 Å and 6302.5 Å lines formed in a network region.
Although their line core formation height is in the upper photo-
sphere, they are affected by the NLTE conditions in the atmo-"

"sphere. This is because of the over-ionization of the Fe i atoms
by the ultra-violet (UV) photons. This underpopulation of Fe i
atoms results in line opacity deficit and lowers the departure co-
efficient to a value below unity. Due to their formation height, the
lines are also affected by the source function deficit. Depending
on which of two effects dominates, the NLTE lines are either
weaker or stronger than the LTE lines. These effects have now
been known for more than four decades and are discussed in the
papers by Athay & Lites (1972); Rutten & Kostik (1982); Rut-
ten (1988); Solanki & Steenbock (1988); Shchukina & Trujillo
Bueno (2001), to name a few. In all these papers, the radiative
transfer equation was solved in one-dimension (1D) and the ef-
fects of multi-dimensions were neglected. In a series of papers,
Holzreuter & Solanki (2012, 2013, 2015) for the first time com-
puted the photospheric iron lines at 5247 Å, 5250 Å, 6301.5 Å
and 6302.5 Å in 3DNLTE using different model atmospheres,
namely, a simple flux tube model, 3D hydrodynamic (HD) sim-
ulation and 3D Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. They
presented a detailed comparison of the Stokes profiles computed
in LTE, 1DNLTE and 3DNLTE and highlighted the importance
of accounting for the 3DNLTE effects in these lines. However, no
comparison with observations was made. Lind et al. (2017) mod-
elled the observed centre-to-limb variation in intensity for many
iron lines, different from the above four, by solving the 3DNLTE
radiative transfer and measured the solar iron abundance."
"Since the Fe i 6301.5 Å and 6302.5 Å lines are extensively
used for solar photospheric diagnostics, it is important to ac-
count for the multi-dimensional NLTE effects in their analysis.
The routinely employed Stokes profiles inversions assume that
the lines are formed in LTE, which is always 1D in diagnostic
radiative transfer. Neglecting the 3DNLTE effects introduces er-"
"rors in the derived atmospheric model. Understanding by how
much the 3DNLTE effects influence the inverted atmosphere is
the main aim of the present study. In the first paper of this series,
we assumed the iron lines to be formed in 1DNLTE conditions
and estimated the errors in the atmosphere derived by inverting
their Stokes profiles using an LTE inversion code (Smitha et al.
2020, hereafter paper I). We found that neglecting the 1DNLTE
effects introduces errors in the measurement of all atmospheric
parameters. In temperature the errors can be as large as 13% and
in the line-of-sight (LOS) velocity, magnetic field strength, the
errors can go upto 50% or more. Even the measurement of mag-
netic field inclination is prone to errors when the 1DNLTE ef-
fects are neglected. These effects were evident in Stokes profiles
at granules, intergranular lanes, magnetic elements, their bound-
aries, basically in every region with strong vertical gradients in
temperature, LOS velocity or magnetic field."
"In the present second paper of this series, we account for the
horizontal radiative transfer (RT) effects in the iron lines and in-
vestigate how they influence the inverted atmosphere. Similar to
paper I, we compute the Stokes profiles in LTE and 3DNLTE
conditions, and invert them using an LTE inversion code. The
LTE inversion of LTE profiles is self-consistent and we treat the
derived atmospheric model as a reference. The inverted atmo-
sphere from the LTE inversion of 3DNLTE profiles is not self-
consistent, so that any departures with respect to the reference
model can be attributed to the 3DNLTE effects. More details on
this approach will be discussed in the sections below. As dis-
cussed in (Holzreuter & Solanki 2012, 2013, 2015), the hori-
zontal RT effects can either weaken or strengthen the 1DNLTE
effects. In the present paper, we investigate by how much the"

were synthesized in LTE, 1DNLTE and 3DNLTE using a mod-
ified version of the RH code (Uitenbroek 2001). The modifica-"

"tions are explained in Holzreuter & Solanki (2012). The details
of the computational setup for the 3DNLTE run are described in
Holzreuter & Solanki (2013, 2015). The snapshot of the MHD
simulation used for the synthesis is the same as the one used
in paper I. It was generated using the MuRaM code (Vögler
et al. 2005) and has a grid spacing of 5.82 km in the xy−direction
and 7.85 km in the vertical direction. Since solving the radiative
transfer equation in 3D is computationally expensive and time
consuming, the line profiles were synthesized over a smaller re-
gion shown in Figure 1. In the rest of the paper, we refer to this
smaller region as simply, the ""sub-region"". It comprises a kilo-
Gauss strength magnetic structure embedded in an intergranular
lane and surrounded by sections of three granules. The contin-
uum image in Figure 1 shows strong horizontal gradients in the
intensity, an indicator of the susceptibility of this region to 3D
RT effects (Holzreuter & Solanki 2013)."
"We use an Fe i atomic model with 23 levels coupled by 33
line transitions and 22 bound-free transitions. The missing UV
opacity was treated using a fudge factor (Athay & Lites 1972).
The other details of the model atom and profile synthesis are
described in Holzreuter & Solanki (2013, 2015) and in paper I."
2.2. Inversion of Stokes profiles
"The Stokes profiles computed in LTE, 1DNLTE and 3DNLTE
were inverted in LTE using the SPINOR code (Solanki 1987;
Frutiger et al. 2000). The code returns a simple atmospheric
model with five parameters, temperature (T ), line-of-sight veloc-
ity (vLOS), and magnetic field vector (B, γ, χ), at optical depths,
log(τ) = 0.0,−0.9 and −2.0 corresponding to the chosen three
inversion nodes. They were chosen based on the optimum place-
ment discussed in Danilovic et al. (2016). The log(τ) scale is
constructed at a reference wavelength of 5000 Å. Further details
on the inversion can be found in paper I."
"For the normalization of the Stokes profiles, we use the spa-
tially averaged continuum intensity (〈Ic〉). Since the 3D NLTE
profiles are computed only over the sub-region, the 〈Ic〉 is dif-
ferent from the 〈Ic〉, that was used for the normalization of the
LTE and 1DNLTE profiles, which were computed over the whole
atmospheric cube, as described in paper I. For a consistent com-
parison with the 3DNLTE profiles, we have therefore repeated
the inversion of LTE and 1DNLTE profiles over the sub-region
using the 〈Ic〉 computed over that region."
3. Comparison of different atmospheres
"To compare the different inverted atmospheres and to investigate
the influence of NLTE and 3D RT effects on the atmospheric pa-
rameters, we use a strategy similar to that used in paper I. We
refer to the atmosphere obtained by inverting LTE profiles as
the ""reference model"". The atmospheres inferred from the inver-
sion of 1DNLTE profiles and 3DNLTE profiles are referred to
as ""testmodel-1D"" and ""testmodel-3D"", respectively. The refer-
ence model is used as the fiducial model to assess the amount
of change in the two testmodels. Maps of T, vLOS, B and γ at the
three inversion nodes log(τ) = 0.0,−0.9 and −2.0 in the refer-
ence model are shown in Figure 1."
"The sub-region chosen for the analysis of 3D effects contains
structures with a wide range of temperature, velocity and mag-
netic field values, which in addition vary with height in the at-
mosphere. While the stronger velocity fields and magnetic fields
can be determined with higher accuracy, the weak fields are quite
difficult to constrain, which results in uncertainties in the in-"
"verted atmosphere. The 3-node atmospheric model used here
for the inversions, though typical of the more complex mod-
els used to invert observations, is an over-simplification of the
complex MHD cube used for the spectral synthesis. Since there
is no uniquely correct way to compare this 3-node atmosphere
with the actual MHD cube, we believe there is no easy way to
quantify the accuracy of either the reference or the test models,
against the atmosphere used for synthesis. As discussed also in
paper I, this is the reason why we compare the testmodels with a
reference model atmosphere which also is a 3 node atmosphere
obtained from inversions and hence prone to the same uncer-
tainties, except for those introduced by neglecting NLTE or 3D
effects. Such a choice is expected to alleviate the contributions
from the inversion uncertainties in our analysis. In addition, the
results presented below come from a statistical study to isolate
the features/locations in the atmosphere where one can expect
1DNLTE and or 3D transfer effects, and to estimate how much
they can influence the inverted atmosphere. Hence, we assume
that any departures in testmodel-1D are purely due to 1DNLTE
effects, while the deviations in the testmodel-3D are the result of
a combination of 1DNLTE and 3D RT effects. In order to iso-
late the 3D RT effects from the 1DNLTE effects, we compare
testmodel-3D with testmodel-1D. The differences between them
are attributed to horizontal RT effects."
"Similar to paper I, we compute the simple and relative differ-
ences between the atmospheric models to compare each param-
eter. We define"
"∆xnD = xLTE − xnDNLTE; δxnD =
xLTE − xnDNLTE"
"xLTE
, (1)"
"where ∆x and δx represent the simple and relative differences
respectively. x is any atmospheric quantity, such as T, vLOS, B, γ
and nD stands for either 1D or 3D. To compare the two testmod-
els, we use"
"∆x3D1D = x
1DNLTE"
"− x3DNLTE; δx3D1D =
x1DNLTE − x3DNLTE"

"Since the atmospheric maps of the two test models look very
similar to the reference models, we only show the difference
maps in the following sections. However, the maps of all the
atmospheric quantities from testmodel-1D and testmodel-3D are
included in the Appendix A."
"After a statistical comparison between the different atmo-
spheric models, we go into the details of individual features sam-
pled by 5 representative spatial positions. Pos. 2, and pos. 4 are
identical to those used in paper I. However, Pos. 1 and pos. 3 are
moved in the y-direction to bring them into the black box indi-
cated in the continuum image in Figure 1. This black box indi-
cates the actual region that will be used for analysis in the rest of
the paper. In all the figures, only the region within this box is dis-
played. The region outside of this box has been neglected due to
the unphysical behaviour of the intensity profiles, which is a re-
sult of the non-periodic boundary conditions. This was identified
by performing two 3D calculations on different but overlapping
areas of the simulation box. Relative differences between inten-
sities and Equivalent Width (EW) of the profiles in this overlap-
ping area were compared. It was found that the influence of the
non-periodic boundary is restricted to the pixels near the bound-
ary of a computed domain. By removing the 32 rows/lines of
pixels nearest to each boundary, it could be ensured that the in-
fluence of the boundary on the profiles was smaller than 1% ev-
erywhere. More details on this are described in Holzreuter &
Solanki (in prep.). The new pos. 1 lies closer to the edge of the
granule, and pos. 3 within the same intergranular lane. Pos. 5 has"

"In the bottom node, the differences are non-zero and go up
to 2% (50 k – 100k), similar to what was observed also in pa-
per I. The reason for this is that within the spectral window
used for the synthesis of line profiles, the real continuum has
not been reached. In addition, the information from log(τ) = 0.0"
"is partly transported through the NLTE opacity of the line, and
thus the maps at log(τ) = 0.0 are different. Although the contin-
uum is computed in LTE for all the three runs (LTE, 1DNLTE
and 3DNLTE), one can expect to recover the same inverted tem-
perature in the bottom node only if a significant fraction of the
spectral range has true continuum in it. For the same reason, we
also have non-zero ∆T 3D at log(τ) = 0.0."
"In Table 1, we summarize the differences between the ref-
erence model, testmodel-1D and testmodel-3D. For each of the
four parameters, T, vLOS, B and γ, we first compute the simple
difference ∆ defined in Equation 1. Then we plot a histogram
for each case (not shown in this paper but similar histograms for
the 1DNLTE case are shown in paper I). The mean and standard
deviations (S.D.) of the histogram distribution for all the four at-
mospheric parameters at the three inversion nodes are given in
this table. The mean and S.D. gives us an estimate of how much
the two testmodels differ from the reference model and also from
each other."
"For the temperature, the mean and S.D. for the distribution
∆T 3D computed for the testmodel-3D is less than 100 K in all
the three nodes and comparable to the mean and S.D in the ∆T 1D
computed for the testmodel-1D. However in the top node, we see
an increase in the mean value of errors in testmodel-3D. This
means that over the sub-region considered here, on an average,
the 3D effects go in the same direction as the 1D NLTE effects,
making the difference to the reference model larger."
"To isolate the 3D effects from the 1DNLTE effects, we com-
pare testmodel-1D and testmodel-3D using Equations 2 and plot
them in the last two columns of Figure 4. Of the three nodes,
differences as large as 300 K are seen only in the top node. The
mean of ∆T 3D1D histogram is also the largest in this node, 21 K
and 43 K, respectively (Table 1). Differences are seen along the
strong magnetic element, the intergranular lane surrounding it,
and also in the granule-intergranular lane boundaries. These are
the regions with a strong horizontal temperature gradient. In the
top node, the ∆T 3D1D is positive along the magnetic structure (red
color). That is, the temperature in the testmodel-1D is higher
than in testmodel-3D. This is because of the horizontal irradia-
tion from the cooler surroundings, which makes the lines com-
puted in 3DNLTE stronger than in 1DNLTE, as also discussed
in Holzreuter & Solanki (2015). For example, the intensity pro-
files at Pos. 5 plotted in Figure 2, which lies within this magnetic
structure, clearly shows this effect. At this pixel, the 3DNLTE
profile is stronger than the 1DNLTE effects. But the δE and
δI are smaller for the 3DNLTE lines than the 1DNLTE lines.
The 3D effects produce changes in the opposite direction to the
1DNLTE effects. Thus, at log(τ = −2.0), the temperature in
the testmodel-3D is closer to the reference model than in the
testmodel-1D, see Figure 8."
"In Pos. 3, which is in an intergranular lane, the 3D effects
weaken the intensity profiles (see Figure 2). This is because
of the irradiation from the hotter surroundings. At this pixel,
the temperature in the testmodel-3D is higher than in both
testmodel-1D and reference model at log(τ) = −2.0, see Fig-
ure 8. This is an example of one such pixel where the 3D effects
further enhance the NLTE effects and neglecting them both will
introduce combined error as large as 250 K in the temperature at
the top node."
"Another interesting feature, represented by Pos. 4, is the
intergranular lane right next to a bright magnetic structure. It
is subject to hot irradiation from the magnetic structure on
one side and a granule from the other side. Accordingly, the
3DNLTE intensity profiles of the two lines are weaker than the
1DNLTE profiles. The differences in residual intensities between"

"3DNLTE and LTE runs have decreased. The testmodel-3D re-
turns a T (log(τ) = −2.0) value closer to that found by the refer-
ence model (see Figure 8)."
"The temperatures at pos. 1 and pos. 2 are much less affected
by 3D effects compared to the other three positions discussed
above. At Pos. 1, we see that the 3DNLTE profiles are slightly
weaker than the 1DNLTE profiles, whereas at Pos. 2, they are
nearly the same. This can be explained based on the nature of
the surrounding environment, in a way similar to the other three
cases discussed above."
"In the above five representative pixels, the 3DNLTE effects,
in intensity, are seen to mostly affect the depth of the line pro-
file, which results in differences in temperature between different
models in the top node. In the central node, the ∆T 3D1D are quite
small and are observed to have significant values only in a few
pixels close to the magnetic structure. The δT 3D1D is mostly less
than 1%. The line wings are much less affected by the 3D ef-
fects. In the bottom node, the ∆T 3D1D and δT"

1D is nearly zero. The"
"mean of the histogram distributions are also nearly zero in both
the central and bottom nodes."
3.2. Line-of-sight velocity
"We now discuss how the LOS velocity in the testmodel-3D devi-
ates from the reference model. From the simple difference and
relative difference maps shown in Figure 5, the errors in the
testmodel-3D are of similar magnitude as in the testmodel-1D.
These errors are concentrated at the boundaries of the granules,"
"and along the intersection of the intergranular lanes and the mag-
netic structure. In these regions, the plasma is highly turbulent
with strong velocity gradients. The 1DNLTE effects are more
dominant than the 3D effects. We also see that in a fraction of
the pixels, the relative differences are large (>50%). These come
from regions of smaller velocities in the MHD cube. But the ab-
solute error is more or less independent of the actual value. Like
in paper I, we again neglect pixels with vLOS < 10 m/s to avoid
smaller denominators in Equation 1. The mean and standard de-
viations of the histograms ∆v1D and ∆v3D given in Table 1 are
comparable, while these values for ∆v3D1D are a few times 10 m/s."
"The errors in the measurement of vLOS at the five representa-
tive spatial positions in testmodel-1D and testmodel-3D (see Fig-
ure 8) are of similar magnitude. At Pos. 1 and Pos. 2, velocities
in testmodel-1D and testmodel-3D match closely with the refer-
ence values. In the intergranular lane, at pos. 3, errors are large
in both the testmodels at log(τ) = −0.9 and 0.0. Here, a Doppler
shift in the line core can be clearly seen in Figure 2. The velocity
at Pos. 4. is quite interesting, because in testmodel-1D its value
is close to the reference value, but in the testmodel-3D the error
has increased significantly at all three nodes. As discussed in pa-
per I, this is a point in the intergranular lane next to a magnetic
structure. It is in a region of extreme gradients in flow velocities
due to the tilting of magnetic flux sheet into the adjacent gran-
ule (see Figure 10 of Holzreuter & Solanki 2015). In this case
we see that the 3D effects further strengthen the 1DNLTE ef-
fects resulting in a large deviation of the measured value in the
testmodel-3D. In Pos. 5, which is inside the magnetic structure"

"sandwiched between cooler environments, we observe the op-
posite. That is, the 3D effect has weakened the 1DNLTE effect,
thus reducing the error in the measured velocity, similar to the
behaviour noticed for the temperature."
"Holzreuter & Solanki (2013) found that the Doppler shifts in
the 1DNLTE profiles differ from the 3DNLTE profiles only by
about 100 m/s. When we compare the velocity maps from the
two test models (last two columns in Figure 5), the overall influ-
ence of 3D effects on the velocity determination is quite small.
3D RT effects are mostly observed at the boundaries of intergran-
ular lanes and magnetic structures, which also happen to be the
regions of strong 1DNLTE effects. The histograms of the ∆3D1D
maps peak at zero in all three nodes with a standard deviation
below 40 m/s."
3.3. Magnetic field
"Based on the calculations in a flux tube model, Stenholm & Sten-
flo (1978) noted that multi-dimensional RT effects can influence
the magnetic field measurements. This was further corroborated
by the findings of Holzreuter & Solanki (2012). We find this to
be true also in an MHD cube. However statistically, the general
properties of the difference maps ∆B1D and ∆B3D are similar,
like in the case of temperature and velocity measurements. This
is the case also for the magnetic field inclination and its differ-
ence maps plotted in Figure 7. From Figure 6, the relative dif-
ference δB3D is as high as 50% or more for smaller values of
BLTE < 300 G, similar to δB1D. But in a majority of the pixels,
the relative difference is within 20%. The errors in testmodel-3D
are smaller in the central node as it is best constrained in the"
"inversions. A part of the errors at log(τ) = 0 are due to the diffi-
culties in measuring small-scale weak fields close to the surface
(notice the larger noise in panels from last rows of Figs. 6 and
7). However, the presence of clear structure at log(τ) = 0.0 in
the diff between testmodels 1D and 3D, just as for other nodes,
suggests that these difference could be due to 1DNLTE and hor-
izontal transfer effects."
"When we focus on the 3D effects in particular, differences
between the testmodel-1D and testmodel-3D are bigger in the
top and bottom nodes, and much less in the central node. In the
top node, the 3D effects show up in pixels along the magnetic
structure and a patch on the upper left which is at the intersec-
tion of a granule, an intergranular lane and a magnetic structure.
The polarization profiles show variations due to 3D effects in this
region (not shown in the paper) and this influences the inverted
field strength. In addition, due to the different temperatures of
the plasma within this small junction, we can expect the hori-
zontal irradiation to affect the equivalent widths of the lines and
thus affect the magnetic field strength. We also see the 3D ef-
fects around this region in the derived temperature maps of Fig-
ure 4. The δB3D1D maps in the top node suggest that the overall
field strength in testmodel-3D is lower than in testmodel-1D."
"When we consider the individual profiles, the 3D effects are
seen to not only affect the intensity but also the polarization, al-
beit to a much smaller extent. When the polarization signals are
small, isolating the effects of 3D radiative transfer from the un-
certainties in the inversions becomes difficult. Stenholm & Sten-
flo (1978) and Holzreuter & Solanki (2012) found that the 3D
RT effects weaken the Q/Ic and V/Ic profiles. Of all the 5 po-
sitions in our selection, the V profiles at pos. 1 show notice-"

"able weakening by 3D effects. Although small differences in the
3DNLTE case are seen also in linear polarization, the profiles
are quite weak (<1%). When we examine the inclination maps
in the reference model around pos. 1 (Figure 1), the inclination
changes quite drastically. This can contribute to the horizontal
transfer effects in the polarization profiles. We see differences
as large as 50° between the inclinations found in testmodel-1D
and testmodel-3D in pos. 1 and the region surrounding it, at all
the three nodes (Figures 7, 8). Since such a large difference is not
specific to one isolated pixel but is observed over an extended re-
gion following the boundary between the granule-intergranular
lane, it is possible that the horizontal transfer effects are playing
a role. In particular, the 3D effects at this position have shifted
the measured inclination further away from the reference value."
"At pos. 5, we see the exact opposite as all the Stokes profiles,
I/Ic,Q/Ic,U/Ic and V/Ic show strengthening from the 3D ef-
fects. This supports the findings of Holzreuter & Solanki (2015)
that the horizontal RT strengthens the line at the centers of mag-
netic elements. The effect is especially clear in the 6301.5 Å
line. In the second line at 6302.5 Å, the 3D effects weaken the π
components and strengthen the blue σ components in both Q/Ic
and U/Ic profiles. This is because of the regions with different
temperatures surrounding pos. 5. The magnetic field strength at
log(τ) = −2.0 in testmodel-3D has shifted closer to the reference
value but away from it in the bottom node."
"At the other three positions, pos. 2, pos. 3 and pos. 4, the po-
larization profiles computed in 3DNLTE are slightly weaker than
the 1DNLTE profiles (Figure 3). The errors due to the neglect of"
"3D effects are at some nodes enhanced and in others, reduced
(Figure 8)."
4. Effects of spatial and spectral degradation
"In paper I, we showed that the 1DNLTE effects in the Stokes pro-
files survive even when they are spatially averaged. In the present
paper, we have conducted a similar test to check the strength of
3DNLTE effects when the Stokes profiles are degraded both spa-
tially and spectrally. For this, we consider the specifications of
the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP, Scharmer et al.
2008) at the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST, Scharmer et al.
2003). The data were degraded to a spectral resolution of 60 mÅ,
and a spatial resolution of 0.1"
". The spectral and spatial point
spread functions (PSF) were assumed to be Gaussian. In addi-
tion, we added a Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of
1x10−3Ic. The inversions were done in a similar way to the case
without any degradation (Section 2.2)."
"Figure 9 shows the effects of spectral smearing and noise
on the Stokes profiles from Figure 3. Due to their weak sig-
nals, the polarization profiles are more affected by such a spec-
tral degradation than the intensity profiles. The differences be-
tween the 1DNLTE and 3DNLTE profiles, although small in the
non-degraded case, are still observed after spectral smearing and
wavelength rebinning. The values of δE′ and δI′, computed us-
ing Equation 4, are close to the values measured for the origi-
nal profiles. In a few cases such as at Pos. 1 and Pos. 2, spectral
degradation has reduced δI′1 by a small amount."

inversion of spatially and spectrally degraded profiles are com-"

4, both in the simple difference and in relative difference maps.
While in some regions, the spatial and spectral degradation has
reduced the 3DNLTE effects, in some other regions, we see dif-
ferences much larger than before. The latter could be a result
of spatial binning. This is because, such an effect was also seen
in paper I (see Figure 12 of that paper) where the profiles were
only spatially binned and no other degradation was applied. The
spatial smearing and noise can also further enhance this effect.
The LOS velocity and magnetic field maps shown in Appendix B
also show similar behaviour."
"We repeated this test by degrading the data to the specifi-
cations of the Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP, Elmore et al.
2014) instrument at the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope
(DKIST). Since the ViSP observes at a much higher resolution
that the CRISP, the effects of 1DNLTE and horizontal transfer
were seen at close to the same level as in the original simulation."
5. Summary and conclusions
"In continuation to paper I, we here study the errors introduced in
the inverted model atmosphere when 3D radiative transfer effects
are neglected. We selected a small region of the large MHD cube
used in paper I to perform the 3DNLTE computations and then
invert the profiles using the LTE inversion code, SPINOR. The
derived atmosphere, called testmodel-3D, is then compared with
the reference model obtained from the inversion of LTE profiles.
Any departure between the two is attributed to 3DNLTE effects.
In addition to this, we also compare the atmospheric model from
the inversion of 1DNLTE profiles called the testmodel-1D, over"
"the same region. The testmodel-1D and testmodel-3D are com-
pared to isolate the 3D RT effects."
"Holzreuter & Solanki (2013, 2015) nicely summarized that
the 3D effects weaken the lines when there is horizontal irradi-
ation from hotter surroundings, and it strengthens the line pro-
file when the surroundings are cooler. It is the derived quanti-
ties in such regions that show departures in testmodel-3D com-
pared to testmodel-1D. This is observed along the boundaries
of magnetic structures and their surrounding intergranular lanes,
granules-intergranular lane boundaries, and in pixels inside mag-
netic structures affected by irradiation from cool intergranu-
lar lanes. Since the 3D effects can weaken or strengthen the
1DNLTE line profiles, it can either enhance or reduce the de-
parture from the reference model."
"Figure 11 demonstrates where in the sub-region of the cube,
the 3D effects enhance or weaken the 1DNLTE effects. Pixels in
black highlight the regions where 3D effects enhance 1DNLTE
effects, that is, the values in testmodel-3D are further shifted
away from the reference model compared to those in testmodel-
1D. Regions highlighted in white show the opposite effect, they
are the regions where the 3D effects weaken the 1DNLTE ef-
fects. Regions in grey represent pixels where the 3D effects are
weak and so do not fall into either of the two categories. The
threshold values for dividing the pixels into the above described
three categories are 50 K, 100 m/s, 100 G and 10° in T, vLOs, B
and γ, respectively."
"It can be seen from this figure that, the 3D effects are most
prominent in and around the magnetic structure and they clearly
affect the temperature and velocity measurements. Since the 3D
effects mostly affect the line core, we see their influence more"

"clearly in the top node. Of the regions that are affected (black
and white patches), the departures range between 50 K – 100 K."
"In velocity maps, the influence of 3D effects can alter the val-
ues between 100 m/s – 500 m/s. We also see some effects in the
central and bottom nodes, in regions of strong velocity gradients,
such as at pos. 4 shown in Section 3.2 and discussed in paper I.
These gradients are difficult to recover in the simple 3-node at-
mospheric model used by us."
"In the case of magnetic field strength and inclination, the
white and black patches are scattered all across the sub-region.
The errors in the magnetic field strength due to the neglect of
3D effects is in the range 100 G – 500 G and in inclination, it
is between 10° – 50°. We see significant influence of 3D effects
on the measured magnetic field inclination along a patch below
a magnetic structure, as discussed in Section 3.3. Only in this
patch, the errors are larger than 50° in a few pixels."
"To conclude, the errors introduced in the inverted atmosphere
due to the neglect of 3D RT effects are not as large as the errors
when NLTE effects are neglected completely, at least over the
sub-region analysed here. The 3D effects are more localised to
regions surrounded by strong horizontal gradients in tempera-
ture and intensity, such as magnetic flux concentrations (Carls-"
"son et al. 2004). Neglecting their effects not only introduces er-
rors in temperature determination but, to a lesser extent, also in
other parameters. In Section 4, we have tested how the spatial
and spectral degradation of the Stokes profiles in the presence
of noise, affects the 1DNLTE and horizontal radiative transfer
effects. The difference maps comparing the reference and test-
models show a similarity to the case without degradation. This
demonstrates that even at low spectral and spatial resolutions, the
statistical nature of the errors introduced in the inverted atmo-
sphere by the neglect of 1DNLTE and/or 3D effects can remain
the same."
"The 3D effects can be expected at granular boundaries, inter-
granular lanes and magnetic bright points. In the construction of
atmospheric models for photospheric bright points (e.g., Shelyag
et al. 2010; Hewitt et al. 2014), the 3D effects are neglected al-
though they can affect the temperature stratification. Given the
results of this study, we expect that the 3DRT effects are also im-
portant in other photospheric features such as sunspots where we
observe horizontal gradients in temperatures across the umbra-
penumbra boundaries, penumbral filaments and spines, bound-
aries of light bridges, and umbral dots. The atmospheric diag-
nostics of these features (Socas-Navarro et al. 2004; Riethmüller"
