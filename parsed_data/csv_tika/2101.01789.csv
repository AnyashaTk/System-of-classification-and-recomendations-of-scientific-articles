Abstract 
 
We present observations obtained with the 10-m Keck telescopes of the forbidden SO a1D à X3S- 
rovibronic transition at 1.707 µm on Io while in eclipse. We show its spatial distribution at a resolution of 
~0.12” and a spectral resolution of R ~2500, as well as disk-integrated spectra at a high spectral resolution 
(R~15,000). Both the spatial distribution and the spectral shape of the SO emission band vary considerably 
across Io and over time. In some cases the SO emissions either in the core or the wings of the emission 
band can be identified with volcanoes, but the largest areas of SO emissions usually do not coincide with 
known volcanoes. We suggest that the emissions are caused by a large number of stealth plumes, produced 
through the interaction of silicate melts with superheated SO2 vapor at depth. The spectra, in particular the 
elevated wing of the emission band near 1.69 µm, and their spatial distribution strongly suggest the presence 
of non-LTE processes in addition to the direct ejection of excited SO from the (stealth and other) volcanic 
vents.

1. Introduction 
"Io’s forbidden SO 1.707 µm rovibronic 
transition, a1D à X3S-, was discovered in 1999 
when the satellite was observed while in eclipse 
(in Jupiter’s shadow) with the NIRSPEC 
spectrometer on the Keck telescope (de Pater et 
al., 2002). The emission was attributed to SO 
molecules in the excited a1D state at a rotational 
temperature of 1000 K, ejected from the vent at a 
thermodynamic quenching temperature of ~1500 
K. At the time Loki Patera was suggested as its 
source, a volcano that was exceptionally active 
during that period. In subsequent years the disk-
integrated SO emission was observed to vary 
substantially over time, in a manner not 
inconsistent with Loki Patera’s activity (Laver et 
al., 2007). With a total of eight datasets, de Kleer 
et al. (2019a) showed that the SO total band 
strength across all eight dates is not correlated 
with incident sunlight, Io’s orbital phase, the time 
since Io was last in sunlight, Jupiter’s System III 
longitude, or thermal hot spot activity.  "
"In November 2002 Io was observed with Keck’s 
NIRSPEC spectrometer coupled to the Adaptive 
Optics (AO) system (de Pater et al., 2007). The 
authors observed Io moving through the slit to get 
a map of the SO distribution. They identified a 
latitudinal variation in SO: most emission came 
from the equator and the south, and practically no 
emission was detected in the north, despite the 
presence of several thermally-bright volcanic hot 
spots in the north. "
"Hence the presence of this emission band remains 
rather mysterious. Rotational temperatures vary 
from ~400 K up to ~1000 K, but in all datasets to 
date the wings and shoulders of the emission band 
could not be matched by equilibrium models at 
any temperature. "
"To further investigate the nature of the SO 
emission, we observed Io in eclipse with the near-
infrared integral field spectrograph OSIRIS, 
coupled to the AO system, on the Keck II "
"

Horizons database: 
https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi#results "
"telescope in July 2010 and on Keck I in December 
2015. On the latter date we observed 
simultaneously with the NIRSPEC spectrometer 
at a high spectral resolution (de Kleer et al., 
2019a). We obtained one additional high spectral 
resolution dataset with NIRSPEC on Keck II in 
April 2019.  
 
All observations are described in Section 2; the 
data reduction and results in Section 3, with a 
detailed analysis and discussion in Section 4. We 
end with conclusions in Section 5. 
 "
2. Observations  
"On UT 27 July 2010 and 25 December 2015 we 
observed Io while in eclipse with the W. M. Keck 
Observatory’s OSIRIS (OH Suppressing 
InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph; Larkin et al., 
2006) coupled to Keck’s adaptive optics (AO) 
system (Wizinowich et al., 2000). OSIRIS’ 
nominal spectral resolution is  l/Dl = 3700 
(roughly 0.5 nm) . We used a platescale of 
0.1”/pixel during both epochs, providing a Field-
of-View (FOV) of 4.2”x6.4”. The OSIRIS data 
reduction pipeline was used for flat-fielding, sky 
subtraction, cosmic ray removal, channel level 
adjustment and the removal of crosstalk, before 
extracting the spectra in the form of a data-cube 
(i.e., RA and DEC along the x- and y-axes; 
spectral channels along the z-axis). Before the 
data-cubes were used for science, they were 
rotated by the difference between the position 
angle of the spectrometer on the sky (PA-SPEC) 
and Io north on the sky1; in addition, the cubes 
were rotated by 3.60 to correct for the rotation of 
the lenslet array relative to the dispersion axis of 
the grating2; the latter is aligned to rows on 
the detector. Hence, in our final image data-
cubes Io north is up. "
"On UT 25 December 2015 and 15 April 2019 we 
observed Io-in-eclipse with the near-infrared 
spectrometer NIRSPEC  (McLean et al., 1998) at 
its highest spectral resolution (R ~ 25,000) in the  "

"HD11603. The images taken with the Kcont (2.27 
µm), Lp (3.78 µm), and Ms (4.68 µm) filters were 
published by de Pater et al. (2014); the Hcont 
filter (1.58 µm, extending over 1.5688 – 1.5920 
µm) image is used in this paper for calibration 
purposes (Section 3). Several images are shown 
in Figure 1. 
 
At 13:00 UT we switched instruments from 
NIRC2 to OSIRIS. While Io was still in sunlight, 
we took spectra in the KN2 band (2.036 – 2.141 
µm) to image the 3n1+n3 SO2-ice band on Io 
(Schmitt et al., 1994). A second SO2-ice band 
image data-cube was obtained one day later, on 
28 July 2010. The pixel scale (and FOV) for these 
KN2 data varied between 0.02” (FOV: 
0.90”x1.28”) and 0.035” (FOV: 1.58x2.24”), at a 
spectral resolution, R ~ 2,500. One exposure was 
taken on Io, and one on the sky nearby (i.e., 
completely off Io), each 300 sec long.  
 
Before Io went into eclipse, we took an image 
data-cube of Io-in-sunlight with the HN4 filter 
(1.652 – 1.737 µm) at R ~ 2,500 and a pixel size 
of 0.1”; we used Io itself for wavefront sensing. 
We used this same setup when Io was in eclipse, 
except that we used Callisto for wavefront 
sensing. Callisto was 35” away from Io at the start 
of the eclipse, and moved 6” towards Io during 
the observing sequence (Fig. 2a). The long axis 
of the OSIRIS FOV was ~10o inclined relative to 
Io’s direction of motion. We manually performed 
the variable off-set guiding: right before starting 
the exposure we calculated what the offset would 
be about a minute into the future (each 15-sec 
exposure took 1-1.5 min in real time), so that we 
could offset the telescope by the correct amount 
to get Io in the FOV.  
 
We obtained 32 image data-cubes of Io-in-
eclipse, each with an integration time of 15 
seconds. Observations started when Io went into 
eclipse, at 14:48 UT, and continued until 15:31 
UT, ~25 min before the end of the eclipse, at 
which time we switched back to NIRC2 to take a 
few images of Io-in-eclipse. Unfortunately, no "

"reliable NIRC2 images were obtained during the 
eclipse period. OSIRIS sky frames were taken at 
the beginning, near the middle and end of the 
observing run. During the 43 min we observed Io, 
the satellite rotated 6 deg in longitude, which is 
~0.06” at the center of Io’s disk, i.e., about half a 
pixel size. Due to the differential motion between 
Io and Callisto, Io moved (i.e., was smeared) over 
0.12” on the sky during the 15-sec exposure, 
which is roughly 1 pixel in our observations. 
These effects were ignored. 
 
2.2 UT 25 December 2015  
 
On UT 25 December 2015, OSIRIS was on the 
Keck I telescope, while the NIRC2 camera and 
NIRSPEC spectrometer were on the Keck II 
telescope. Both telescopes were used to observe 
Io before and while in eclipse. On Keck II we 
imaged Io with NIRC2 in 8 different filters 
between 1.6 and 5 µm (Fig. 1; see also de Kleer 
and de Pater, 2016; de Pater et al., 2017; de Kleer 
et al., 2019b). Like for the 2010 data, the Hcont 
image was used for flux calibration purposes. 
Photometric calibration was performed on the 
nearby standard star HD226863. 
 
When Io was in eclipse, the satellite was observed 
with OSIRIS on Keck I at a medium spectral 
resolution (R ~ 2,500), and with NIRSPEC on 
Keck II in high spectral resolution mode (R ~ 
15,000). The NIRSPEC data are presented in de 
Kleer et al. (2019a). As in July 2010, the SO 
OSIRIS spectra were taken with the HN4 filter. 
One image data-cube was taken before Io went 
into eclipse. After the satellite entered Jupiter’s 
shadow Ganymede was used for wavefront 
sensing. Coincidentally, Ganymede came out of 
eclipse almost the moment Io went into eclipse. 
To be precise, Ganymede entered partial eclipse 
during egress at 13h:38m, and was completely 
illuminated by 13h:47m. Io entered partial eclipse 
during ingress at 13h:45m, and by 13h:48m Io was 
completely in Jupiter’s shadow.  Before 
Ganymede came out of eclipse, we took a few 
exposures of Ganymede-in-eclipse, while using "
"Io for wavefront sensing. These data were also 
taken in the HN4 filter, and are summarized in 
Section 3.4. During the entire Io-in-eclipse 
observing period, the two satellites remained very 
close together (5—7.3”). Figure 2b shows the 
viewing geometry and position of the FOV for the 
2015 date; to optimize efficiency, the long axis of 
the FOV was oriented along Io’s direction of 
motion, so the satellite drifted through the FOV. 
As in 2010, we manually performed the variable 
off-set guiding. Sky frames were taken at the 
beginning and end of the observing run. 
 
We obtained 44 image data-cubes of Io-in-
eclipse, each with an integration time of 30 
seconds. Observations started when Io went into 
eclipse, at 13:48 UT, and continued until 14:57, 
right when Io disappeared behind Jupiter. Io 
rotated almost 10 degrees during this period, 
which induces a rotational smearing at the center 
of the satellite of 0.09”, or just about 1 pixel. The 
differential motion between Io and Ganymede 
resulted in a smearing of only 0.05” during each 
30-sec scan. These effects were ignored. 
 
2.3 UT 15 April 2019  
 
On UT 15 April 2019 we observed Io-in-eclipse 
with the NIRSPEC spectrometer in its high 
spectral resolution mode on the Keck II telescope, 
soon after the spectrometer (an echelle 
spectrograph) had undergone a major upgrade. 
This upgrade allowed for observations over a 
somewhat broader bandpass per order than 
previously possible. As discussed in de Kleer et 
al. (2019a), in December 2015 spectra were taken 
over the wavelength range ~1.694 – 1.717 µm, 
while in 2019 we covered the range 1.680 to 
1.731 µm. As in December 2015, we used a slit 
with a length of 12” and pixel size of 0.129”; we 
choose the broadest possible slit-width, which is 
0.72”. This results in a spectral resolution of 
R~15,000 (McLean et al., 1998). The total 
integration time per Io-in-eclipse spectrum was 
120 sec, and the airmass was close to 1.4 both for 
Io and the calibrator observations. Analogous to "

resources/photometric-standards/ukirt-bright-standards 
 "
"our OSIRIS observations, we manually 
performed variable off-set guiding to keep 
eclipsed-Io on NIRSPEC’s slit. Sky frames were 
taken at the beginning and end of the observing 
run. 
 
Before Io went into eclipse, we took spectra of the 
satellite while in sunlight to test our procedure of 
manually updating Io’s tracking rate to keep the 
slit on the satellite while integrating; these spectra 
were later used for calibration purposes (Section 
3.3). We continuously took images of the satellite 
with the slit-viewing camera, SCAM, to verify 
that Io was still on the slit (both in sunlight and in 
eclipse).  
 
At the beginning of our night, we observed Io 
with NIRC2 in 9 different filters between 1.6 and 
5 µm (Fig. 1). The Hcont image was used for flux 
calibration purposes, as for the OSIRIS data. 
Photometric calibration was performed using the 
nearby standard star BS 64414. 
 "
"3. Data Reduction & Results 
 
3.1 NIRC2 Observations   
 
Three images were obtained with NIRC2 in each 
filter, one in each of 3 quadrants on the detector 
(the lower left quadrant, which has many 
artifacts/bad pixels, was not used). Median 
averaging provides a sky background.  "
"All images were processed using standard near-
infrared data reduction techniques (flat-fielded, 
sky-subtracted, with bad pixels replaced by the 
median of surrounding pixels). The geometric 
distortion in the Keck images was corrected using 
the “dewarp” routines provided by Brian 
Cameron of the California Institute of 
Technology for the 2010 and 2015 data5, and the 
solution provided by Service et al. (2016) for the 
2019 data.  The individual images were aligned 
and co-added to increase signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR). Images of Io at different near-infrared 
wavelengths are shown in Figure 1. While the "

 "
"Hcont images have been used to calibrate the 
OSIRIS and NIRSPEC data as discussed below, 
the other images show which volcanoes are 
active, useful for comparison with the spatial 
distribution of the SO emissions. The precise 
location of these volcanoes, as measured from the 
NIRC2 images, was used to determine both the 
center of Io’s disk on OSIRIS image data-cubes, 
and Io’s orientation on the sky when the satellite 
was in eclipse and its limb could not be seen. "
"3.2 OSIRIS SO Observations  
 
After the individual frames of each data-cube (32 
in 2010, 44 in 2015) were inspected and bad 
pixels removed by replacing them with the 
median of the 8 surrounding pixels, the image 
data-cubes needed to be aligned since each data-
cube was located at a slightly different position 
on the FOV (Sections 2.1, 2.2). We used the 
brightest thermal source, Loki Patera, visible in 
each individual data-cube, to align all of them. 
The data-cubes were then averaged on each day 
to provide a final spectral image data-cube of Io-
in-eclipse. Since Io is so close to Jupiter, and in 
2015 also very close to Ganymede, we modeled 
the background by fitting polynomials (2-degree) 
to each row on each image plane (e.g., each 
wavelength) of the data-cube, after “blocking 
out” Io. In 2015, we also needed to fit 
polynomials (1-degree) to each column, 
presumably due to the proximity of Ganymede. 
These background image data-cubes were 
subtracted from the data. The spatial resolution in 
our final image data-cubes, as determined from 
scans through Loki Patera, was ~0.12”. 
 
The image data-cubes were calibrated with 
photometrically calibrated Hcont images of Io 
while in sunlight, obtained with NIRC2 on the 
same nights (Sections 2, 3.1). At wavelengths 
corresponding to the Hcont filter, Io’s total 
intensity can be attributed entirely to reflected 
sunlight (Fig. 1). The total flux density from Io in 
the Hcont image in July 2010 was 6.4 x 10-8 ergs 
s-1 cm-2 µm-1; in December 2015 it was 3.9 x 10-8 
ergs s-1 cm-2 µm-1. The difference in intensities is 
caused by the fact that Io was much further from 
both the Sun and the Earth in Dec. 2015 (Table 
1); the ratio [rD(2015)/rD(2010)]2=1.655, which "
"is equal to the ratio in the Hcont flux density 
between 2015 and 2010. These measured 
intensities scale with the total counts in an 
OSIRIS image of Io in the HN4 band while the 
satellite was still in sunlight. The latter image was 
constructed by averaging an image data-cube of 
Io-in-sunlight over wavelength. Spencer et al.’s 
(2004) spectrum of Io shows that the reflectivity 
of the satellite does not vary much with 
wavelength between 1.57 (shortest wavelength in 
the Hcont filter) and 1.74 µm (longest wavelength 
in the HN4 filter). Assuming no variation in 
reflectivity, we multiplied the total flux in the 
Hcont image by 0.80 to account for the decrease 
in solar flux from 1.58 to 1.695 µm, the central 
wavelengths in each band.  We then used these 
values to calibrate the OSIRIS HN4 spectra. The 
spectra were further converted into photons s-1 
cm-2 µm-1. In order to compare the total flux 
densities in our two datasets with each other and 
with previous observations of SO, we scaled the 
SO disk-integrated spectral data-cubes (with 
units in photons s-1 cm-2 µm-1 ) to correspond to a 
geocentric distance of 4.08 AU, the distance of Io 
at the time of the very first detection, 24 
September 1999 (de Pater et al., 2002). Since the 
SO emission does not depend on solar insolation, 
we only scaled the intensities with the difference 
in geocentric distance (squared). The units on the 
disk-resolved data-cubes are presented in units of 
photons s-1 cm-2 sr-1 µm-1. 
 
Since the SO emission band is in a wavelength 
region where telluric emissions/absorptions are 
essentially absent, as shown from observations of 
A stars for telluric correction, the data did not 
need to be corrected for telluric 
emissions/absorptions, which helped keep the 
SNR as high as possible. 
 
A fully calibrated disk-integrated spectrum for 
both epochs is shown in Fig. 3, top-row, with 
superposed blackbody curves for a temperature of 
550, 675, and 800 K. In both years, the 
background is matched quite well by a 675-K 
blackbody; in 2010 the area of this high 
temperature is ~50 km2; in 2015 it is ~120 km2. 
The middle row shows the disk-integrated 
spectrum after subtraction of these blackbody 
curves. These spectra, as all (OSIRIS and"

the center portion of the line; the chi-square curves as a function of rotational temperature are indicated in the bottom 
row. Units are in photons/s/cm2/µm; one can convert these to steradians by dividing by Io’s solid angle (at 4.08 AU).

"NIRSPEC) spectra in this paper, are Hanning 
smoothed over 5 pixels6. Note that both the 
background flux (top row) and line strength 
(middle row) was a factor of 2-3 higher in 2015 
than in 2010, after the data were scaled to an 
Earth-Io distance of 4.08 AU. Hence these 
differences are intrinsic to Io, or in other words 
the SO emission was much stronger in 2015 than 
in 2010. 
 
Figure 4 shows images of Io-in-eclipse, averaged 
over the entire HN4 filter; clearly, the total 
emission is dominated by thermal emission from 
Io’s volcanoes. The total intensity of Io-in-eclipse 
in 2010 is 4.6 x 10-12 ergs s-1 cm-2 µm-1, which is 
~0.01% of Io’s intensity in sunlight. In 2015 we 
measure an intensity of 8.1 x 10-12 ergs s-1 cm-2 
µm-1, or 0.026% of sunlit Io. As shown, in both 
years Loki Patera was the brightest hot spot. 
Judging from the periodic brightenings observed 
at Loki Patera (de Kleer & de Pater, 2016; de 
Pater et al., 2017), in both years the volcano was 
at the beginning of a brightening phase. Although 
the low spatial resolution of the images precludes 
an accurate determination of Loki Patera’s 
intensity at 1.7 µm, a rough estimate gives ~0.4 
GW/sr/µm in 2010, and ~1 GW/sr/µm in 2015 
(this may be contaminated with flux from 
Amaterasu Patera; see de Kleer & de Pater, 
2016). These numbers should be increased by 
~20-25% due to the emission angle 
(foreshortening) effect, resulting in ~0.5 
GW/sr/µm in 2010, and ~1.2 GW/sr/µm in 2015.  
For comparison, in 2015 an intensity of 1.1 ± 0.2 
GW/sr/µm was measured at 2.2 µm (de Pater et 
al., 2017). 
 
In order to assess the spatial distribution of SO 
gas over Io, we have to subtract the satellite’s 
continuum emission as accurately as possible. 
We therefore created background images from 
the spectra at both epochs that do not contain SO 
emissions, i.e., we averaged over wavelengths 
shorter than 1.68 µm and longer than 1.73 µm. 
These images, which look similar to those shown 
in Fig. 4, need to be scaled with wavelength to "
" 
6 Spectra were Hanning smoothed as follows: 
[F(i)+0.5*(F(i-1)+F(i+1))+0.25*(F(i-2)+F(i+2))]/2.5, with 
F the intensity at pixel i. "
"remove the continuum emission in the HN4 filter. 
We used a 1-pixel spectrum of Loki Patera at its 
peak intensity (Fig. 5; note that the SO emission 
band is essentially absent in a 1-pixel spectrum 
since it is hidden in the noise of Loki Patera’s 
thermal flux density) to determine a blackbody 
curve that matches this spectrum; these curves are 
superposed on the spectra in Figure 5 for both 
2010 and 2015. A good match to the data is 
provided by a blackbody curve of 675 K in both 
years, just like for the disk-integrated spectra 
(Fig. 3). This is not surprising, since Io’s thermal 
flux density is dominated by Loki Patera. The 
same blackbody spectrum also matches the slope 
of a 1-pixel spectrum of Janus Patera in 
December 2015, as shown in Figure 5. After Loki 
Patera, the brightest source in July 2010 was 
Kanehekili Fluctus. Although a lower (~550 K) 
temperature provides a better fit to this much 
fainter volcano, scaling the background with a 
slope in wavelength given by the 675 K profile 
will eliminate most of Kanehekili’s thermal 
emission. We note that the brightness 
temperature results for Janus Patera and 
Kanehekili Fluctus agree well with previous 
measurements (de Pater et al., 2014b). Other 
volcanoes are too faint to determine a blackbody 
temperature.   
 
We thus scaled the background image data-cube 
for each year with the slope of these Loki  Patera 
spectra, and subtracted the scaled background 
image data-cube from the spectral data-cubes. 
Figure 6 shows the results after combining 
(integrating) the image data planes within the 
narrow core of the SO emission band (panels b, 
e: 1.705-1.709 µm), and within the wings of the 
emission band (panels c, f: 1.686-1.720 µm minus 
the core at 1.705-1.709 µm). Panels a and d show 
the emission integrated over the entire emission 
band (1.686-1.720 µm) before removing the 
background emission; as shown, the latter images 
look very similar to those in Figure 4. Clearly, the 
SO emission is only a very small fraction of the 
total emission, and shows no obvious correlation 
with the bright hot spots. We further notice that, "
"although the emissions in the core of the line 
broadly agree with those in the wings, that there 
are some distinct differences as well. This will be 
discussed in more detail in Section 4. 
 
We superposed a circle outlining the satellite 
itself on each of the panels in Figure 6. Since we 
cannot see the limb of Io-in-eclipse, we used the 
volcanoes in Figure 4 with the position as 
determined from NIRC2 images during these 
epochs (Fig. 1; de Pater et al., 2014 and de Kleer 
et al., 2019b). We estimate the uncertainty in this 
process to be better than ~0.01”, or ~40 km at the 
center of Io’s disk, which translates into almost 
1.50 deg in latitude/longitude at disk center 
(increasing with the inverse of the cosine of the 
emission angle away from disk center). The 
uncertainty in the positions of hot spots is 
typically of a similar magnitude (see above 
mentioned papers), so we assign a total error of 
~20 at disk center, increasing towards the limb.     
 
3.3 NIRSPEC SO Observations  
 
The high spectral-resolution SO NIRSPEC 
observations obtained simultaneously with 
OSIRIS data on 25 December 2015 were 
discussed in de Kleer et al. (2019a). A similar 
experiment was conducted on UT 15 April 2019, 
when Io moved from sunlight into eclipse at UT 
13h:48m.  During the observations we dithered Io 
up and down the slit in an ABBA pattern, so that 
the difference of the two exposures (A-B) 
provided sky-subtracted spectra of the satellite. 
By UT 14:45, 14 min before occultation by 
Jupiter, Io had come too close to the planet to 
obtain more usable spectra. We obtained a total 
of six A-B image pairs with echelle setting7 1 and 
another two using echelle setting 2, both in filter 
5(H). The wavelength range 1.681 – 1.714 µm 
was covered in order 45 in setting 1. This range 
was extended to 1.680 – 1.731 µm by using more 
orders (44 and 45) and the two slightly different 
echelle settings (1 and 2). Since we obtained 
much less data in setting 2, the noise in the final "

equal to 36.88; Setting 2: echelle setting of 62.48 and cross 
disperser of 36.62.   "
"combined spectrum is not constant over 
wavelength.  
 
The data reduction, including flat-fielding, spatial 
and spectral mapping, and image rectification, 
was performed using the REDSPEC pipeline8, 
using a combination of  arc-lamps (Ar, Kr, Xe, 
Ne lines) for spectral calibration. The REDSPEC 
pipeline provided images A-B, which were 
further processed using custom IDL scripts.  
 
Figure 7a shows the central part of one of the A-
B images obtained from the REDSPEC pipeline, 
with a positive and a negative spectrum of Io. 
After separating the two spectra in each image, 
and inverting the negative spectra, they were 
aligned, median averaged, and corrected for 
telluric lines by dividing the spectrum by a 
normalized spectrum of HIP 85755 (also known 
as c Oph), a 4.8 mag Be star. The final image over 
the same frequency range as in panel a for echelle 
setting 1, order 45, is shown in Figure 7b.  
 
We then integrated the intensity at each 
wavelength in all four median-averaged images 
(i.e., one image each of orders 44 and 45 of the 
two echelle settings 1 and 2) over 12 rows (i.e., 
over 1.55”), centered at the peak emission. This 
provided four partially overlapping spectra, 
which were aligned in intensity with order 45, 
echelle setting 1. The geocentric velocity of Io 
was ~ -19 km/s during the eclipse (i.e., moving 
towards the Earth), implying a Doppler shift 
correction of 0.11 nm. However, since the 
observed spectra were already perfectly aligned 
with the model (Section 4), no  Doppler shifts 
were applied (perhaps there was a small 
imperfection in the wavelength calibration). 
(Note that the spectral resolution for the OSIRIS 
spectra is low enough that doppler shifts can be 
ignored.)  The spectra were then combined to give 
one spectrum ranging in wavelength from 1.680 
to 1.730 µm. At wavelengths where spectra 
overlapped, we used the best (highest SNR) 
setting/order. We also removed artifacts in the 
spectrum (such as the vertical bad stripe in Fig. 7) "

"Calibration was performed in a similar way as for 
the OSIRIS observations. The NIRC2 
observations in the Hcont filter resulted in a total 
intensity of 4.2 x 10-8 ergs s-1 cm-2 µm-1. 
Converting the July 2010 and December 2015 
intensities to the April 2019 epoch, however, 
shows an intensity of 4.7 x 10-8 ergs s-1 cm-2 µm-

the difference in airmass, which was ~2.4 for the 
NIRC2 observations in April 2019, and between 
1.35 – 1.5 in 2010 and 2015. For a standard H 
band opacity (t~0.06) we would need to increase 
the intensity in 2019 from 4.2 x 10-8 to 4.5 x 10-8 
ergs s-1 cm-2 µm-1 to make them consistent with 
the 2010 and 2015 photometry. Instead of 4.5 x "

Although our slit width of 0.72” does not entirely 
cover Io, by assuming the total intensity of sunlit 
Io to be equal to 3.77 x 10-8 ergs s-1 cm-2 µm-1, we 
can convert the observed counts/s to a total 
intensity of the satellite, and use this conversion 
factor for the Io-in-eclipse spectra. The final 
spectrum, after smoothing4 with a Hanning filter 
and normalizing to a geocentric distance of 4.08 
AU (Section 3.2) is shown in Figure 7c.

for the 2010 and 2015 observations, the 
continuum level of 6.2 photons s-1 cm-2 µm-1 
corresponds to an effective emitting area of 85-90 
km2. In subsequent figures we have subtracted 
this continuum emission. 
 
3.4 Ganymede in Eclipse 
 
We obtained four 30-sec frames of Ganymede-in-
eclipse on 25 December 2015, while using Io-in-
sunlight for wavefront sensing. After aligning, 
co-adding (averaging image data-cubes), and "
"averaging the final image data-cube over 
wavelength, the satellite was clearly visible 
despite being in Jupiter’s shadow, as shown in 
Figure 8a. The total intensity of Ganymede-in-
eclipse is (7±1) x 10-12 ergs s-1 cm-2 µm-1 (at 
D=5.152 AU), or ~7 mJy. Panels b and c show 
disk-integrated spectra of Ganymede. Panel b 
shows the total signal from the satellite, while 
panel c shows the signal after subtraction of the 
continuum. The continuum was obtained by 
averaging the image data-cube over wavelengths 
outside of the SO band (panel a). Both spectra 
show that Ganymede does not emit detectable SO 
emissions.  
 
Due to Ganymede’s proximity to Io, Ganymede 
received a flux from Io (assuming zero phase 
angle) that is 1.34x106 larger than Io’s flux 
received on Earth. However, due to the large 
phase angle under which Ganymede sees Io, 
~168o, the flux from Io received by Ganymede is 
~103 down from that seen near 0o phase angle 
(Simonelli and Veverka, 1984), which makes it 
~5x10-5 ergs s-1 cm-2 µm-1. This number will be 
enhanced by Io’s thermal emission. If we assume 
a total thermal emission equal to that observed 
from Io-in-eclipse, enhanced by 1.34x106 due to 
the difference in distances between Io with the 
Earth and Io with Ganymede, we get a flux  of 
~1x10-5 ergs s-1 cm-2 µm-1, which increases 
Ganymede’s total flux density only slightly. 
Hence the flux density received on Earth from 
Ganymede due to Io-shine, assuming a perfect 
100% reflectivity, will only be 2.3 x 10-15 ergs s-1 
cm-2 µm-1, i.e., roughly a factor of 3000 less than 
was received. Such large discrepancies between 
expectations and observations were also seen and 
discussed by Tsumura et al. (2014). They 
attributed Ganymede’s (and other Galilean 
satellites’) glow during an eclipse to forward 
scattered sunlight by hazes in Jupiter’s upper 
atmosphere. Our observations support their 
hypothesis.

"same way as in Laver & de Pater (2008; 2009). 
Because they were centered at different 
longitudes than in Laver & de Pater, by 
combining the two sets of maps we are now able 
to construct a complete SO2-ice map at 2.1258 
µm. This map, together with a map of the 
reflectivity at 2.1 µm and a Voyager visible-light 
map are shown in Figure 9. Superposed are the

patera on the Voyager map are typically also dark

show a higher infrared reflectivity. The SO2-ice 
(equivalent width) map shows a distribution that 
is concentrated near the equator, which is 
consistent with the findings by McEwen et al. 
(1988) and with the Galileo/NIMS equivalent 
width maps at 2.79 and 3.35 µm by  Carlson et al. 
(1997), but differs from Carlson et al.’s"

"Several authors have suggested that the various

sensitivity to the size of frost grains (Schmitt et 
al., 1994; Carlson et al., 1997; Douté et al., 2001; "
"Laver and de Pater, 2009), where the weakest 
(1.98 and 2.12 µm) ice bands are sensitive only to 
large-grained (> 700 µm) ice deposits, and the 
stronger absorption bands are quite sensitive to 
small grain sizes. The strong 3.77 and 4.07 µm 
absorption bands are even sensitive to thin (few 
mm) veneers of micron-sized grains, which 
appear to be abundant at the higher latitudes. 
Geissler et al. (2001) and Laver & de Pater (2009) 
explain that the formation of coarse-grained SO2 
snowfields near the equator and thin veneers of 
small-grained frosts at higher latitudes  result 
from a combination of sublimation (at low 
latitudes), condensation (at latitudes > 27o), and 
thermal annealing (at low latitudes). "

"4. Data Analysis & Discussion 
 "
"4.1 Spatial distribution of SO Emission 
 
Figure 6 shows that the spatial distribution of SO 
changed between the two epochs9, while neither 
epoch shows a strong correlation with the bright 
volcanic hot spots in panels a and d (and Figure 
4). To investigate the correlation between SO 
emissions and volcanic centers in more detail, we 
indicated the locations of several volcanic sites 
on the panels (each indicated by an x); a legend 
to this Figure is provided in Table 2. This Table 
lists all the volcanic sites on the observed 
hemisphere where plumes had been detected in 
the past, in addition to a few volcanic hot spots 
seen in our continuum maps or potential 
candidates for some of the SO emissions. Typical 
uncertainties in the location of these sites are of 
order ~2-50 (Section 3.2). 
 
In several instances the peak SO emission does 
coincide with a volcanic center, but there 
certainly is not a clear one-on-one 
correspondence between patches of SO emissions 
and known volcanoes. A good correspondence 
between a volcanic site and SO emission in the 
core of the emission band (Figs. 6b, e) is seen, 
e.g., near Loki (x12), Karei Patera (x1), Fjorgyn 
Fluctus (x23), and Hiruko Patera (x17) in 2010, and 
Acala Fluctus (x18), Surt (x19), and Creidne Patera 
(x20) in 2015.  Sometimes the wings of the 
emission band (Figs. 6c, f) are highly suggestive 
of a volcanic source, such as near Loki (x12) in 
both epochs, and near Mazda Patera (x14), N. 
Lerna (x10) and over Acala Fluctus in 2015. 
Plumes have, or may have, been present in the 
past at several of these locations (Table 2). 
Although the very bright SO emission patch in 
2010 (panel b) is surrounded by Ukko Patera (x2), 
PFU1063 (x22) and Surt (x19), and the western 
bright patch in 2015 (panel e) is surrounded by 
Karei Patera (x1), Ukko Patera (x2), and Fjorgyn 
Fluctus (x23), there is no good correspondence 
between these bright SO patches and one unique 
volcanic site. In contrast, the eastern patch of SO "
" 
9 The main difference between our 2010 and 2015 
observations is the geometry (Table 1); we do not think this "
"emissions in 2015 is clearly co-located with 
Acala Fluctus. 
 
In Figure 10 we superpose a reprojected map of 
the SO core emission on a USGS geologic map of 
Io (Williams et al., 2011). The approximate 
outline of the strong SO wing emissions (red 
patches in Figs. 6c, f) is indicated by black boxes; 
these are usually offset from the location of the 
core of the emission band, except for Acala 
Fluctus in 2015, and north of Loki Patera in 2010. 
In 2015 the SO wing emission is strong in the 
region north-east to the horse-shoe-shaped patera 
(lake) itself, at Loki,  while not much core 
emission is visible.  The Voyager spacecraft 
detected plumes in this region in 1979 (McEwen 
et al., 2004). Figure 10 further shows that the 
large area of strong SO (core) emission in 2010 is 
located over an area characterized as “red-brown 
plains”, bordered by structures filled with 
undivided mountain (mu) and flow (fu) materials, 
white plains material (Pbw), and undivided (Pfu) 
and dark (Pfd) patera floor materials, indicative of 
eruptions in the (distant) past. In 2015 the bright 
SO emissions are also in areas near dark (fd) and 
undivided (fu) flow materials, as well as areas 
overlain by white bright plains material, i.e., 
regions dominated by SO2 frost.  
 
A comparison with the SO2 ice map in Figure 9 
does not reveal an obvious connection of SO 
emissions to SO2 frost, although in 2015 the large 
patches of SO emissions are within ~15-200 of the 
equator, where we expect relatively thick large-
grain ice deposits based upon our 2.12 µm 
observations; this is also a region of bright plain 
deposits as shown in Figure 10. The large area of 
SO emissions in 2010, centered near 350o W. 
longitude, 35o N. latitude coincides with the 
small-grained SO2-ice deposit revealed by Douté 
et al. (2001). Unfortunately, the western patch of 
SO emissions in 2015 is over a region not mapped 
by Douté et al. (2001). We conclude from these 
comparisons that many of the SO emissions not 
associated with known volcanic sources appear to 
be located over regions of SO2 frost. 
 "
"could translate into such a difference in the locations of the 
SO emissions. "
"Although it is possible that SO upon escaping a 
volcanic vent is redistributed spatially by winds, 
the connection of some SO locations to known 
volcanic sites, and in particular several with 
known past plume activity, argues against winds 
redistributing the volcanic gases. The figures, we 
think, are highly suggestive of more than a single 
compact source of SO, such as the presence of a 
(perhaps large) number of  “stealth” plumes, an 
idea originally suggested by Johnson et al. (1995) 
to explain the patchiness in the SO2 atmosphere 
as inferred from UV and microwave 
observations. The authors suggest that, in contrast 
to the “low-to-moderate entropy” Prometheus 
plume (Kieffer et al., 2000), stealth plumes are 
“high-entropy” eruptions from a reservoir of 
superheated SO2 vapor in contact with silicate 
melts about 1.5 km below the surface at pressures 
of ~40 bar and temperatures of ~1400 K. Such 
plumes would consist of essentially pure gas, i.e., 
without dust or condensates, so that they cannot 
be detected in reflected sunlight. Such plumes 
can, and have been, detected during eclipse 
observations, such as the plumes and diffuse 
glows that were imaged by the Galileo spacecraft 
over Acala Fluctus (McEwen et al., 1998). Faint 
glows and numerous tiny point source emissions 
were also detected in eclipse images by the New 
Horizons mission in the general area where we 
see the bright SO patches in 2015 (Spencer et al., 
2008). No specific gas emissions could be 
specified, however, in those broad-band (400-900 
nm) Lorri images. The authors interpreted the 
emissions as being caused by nonthermal, likely 
plasma-related, near-surface processes. In 
contrast to the Galileo and New Horizons data, 
however, we do not see emissions on the limb of 
Io, as might be expected if the emission process 
is related to magnetospheric plasma processes.  
 "
"In the original paper on the detection of the 
forbidden SO 1.707 µm rovibronic transition (a1D 
à X3S-) on Io (de Pater et al., 2002), the authors 
show that the SO electronic states are equilibrated 
at a quenching temperature of ~1500 K, which, as "
" 
10 Calculated as: [Si (obsi - modeli)2]/s2, summed over all 
points i in the narrow core of the emission line; s is the 
standard deviation in the spectrum. "
"expected, is well above the rotational temperature 
of the gas. Since they could not explain the 
emissions in any other way (e.g., through electron 
impact, Joule heating, ionospheric 
recombination), they stated: “The only plausible 
explanation for the observed SO emissions is 
direct ejection of excited SO from the volcanic 
vent.” They suggested Loki as its source, which 
was particularly bright at infrared wavelengths at 
the time. In the present paper we suggest that 
excited SO is ejected directly from a large 
number of stealth volcanoes, where temperatures 
at depth are of order 1400 K. These emissions 
cover the large patches of SO emissions we see in 
Figures 6 and 10, which includes Acala Fluctus. 
In addition, as shown by a direct correlation with 
some volcanoes (e.g., Loki, Karei Patera, Fjorgyn 
Fluctus, Surt), excited SO must be directly 
ejected from most active volcanoes.  "
"4.2 Spectral Shape of OSIRIS SO Emission 
 
In order to learn more about the characteristics of 
the SO emission, such as the temperature(s) of the 
emitting gas and potential non-LTE effects in 
addition to the spatial variations discussed above, 
we constructed spectra integrated over several 
small and a few larger areas, as indicated 
graphically on Figure 11. The spectra integrated 
over the large rectangles are shown in Figure 12; 
those over the small ones in Figure 13.  
 
We modeled the SO emission assuming local 
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) as in de Pater 
et al. (2002) and Laver et al. (2007). As shown by 
the latter authors, the width of the core of the 
emission band increases with the rotational 
temperature. Best fits to the central part or core of 
the spectra (1.705 – 1.709 µm) are shown by red 
lines in Figures 3 and 12; these fits were obtained 
from the minimum values in chi-square fits10, as 
shown graphically for the disk-integrated spectra 
in the bottom row of Figure 3. Such graphs can 
also be used to derive the uncertainty in these fits: 
by doubling the chi-square minimum values, we 
find a rotational temperature for the disk-"

than the original image (the images in Figures 4, 6 were processed in the same way). Superposed are small annotated 
squares (8x8 pixels), and larger rectangles (38x14 pixels in 2010, and 34x14 pixels in 2015). The bright volcanoes 
seen in the continuum map (Loki Patera and Kanehekili Fluctus in 2010; Loki Patera and Janus Patera in 2015) are 
indicated by solid black squares within  the small square. Spectra integrated over these rectangles and squares are 
shown in Figs. 12 - 14. "

"integrated spectra of 350+400-150 K in 2010, and 
500+150-125K in 2015. The middle row in Figure 3 
also shows profiles for rotational temperatures of 
gas 200 K warmer (blue lines) and colder (cyan 
lines) than the best-fit curves. In Figure 12 we 
only indicate the best fit temperatures. Lower 
limits to these values are typically 100-150 K 
below the best-fit values, and upper limits are 
usually 200-400 K above the indicated values; the 
errorbars are quite sensitive, though, to the 
precise region that is modeled. Although, as 
shown, the center part of the emission bands can 
be matched well with these LTE models, it is 
clear that none of these models match the 
extended structure (“shoulders” or wings) of the 
emission bands, in particular near 1.69 µm; this 
mismatch is a clear indication of multiple 
temperatures and/or non-LTE effects. 
 
Spectra of smaller regions (small boxes in Fig. 
11) are shown in Figure 13. Despite the relatively 
low SNR in the spectra, one can notice several 
interesting phenomena, in particular when also 
comparing the spectra with the spatial 
distribution of emissions in Figures 6 and 10. In 
2010, the core of the emission band is most 
clearly detected in regions A (SNR~7.1, as 
determined from Fig. 6), C (SNR~6.8), D 
(SNR~5.8) and E (SNR~5.6), and can be 
distinguished at Loki (SNR~5.5), Kanehekili 
(SNR~4) and perhaps in region H (SNR~3.5). In 
some regions the wings of the emission band are 
quite bright; we note in particularly Loki 
(SNR~7.5) and region B (SNR~5.6), where the 
wings are clearly present, but the core of the 
emission band can hardly be distinguished above 
the wings. In 2015 the core of the emission band 
is clearly visible near Janus Patera (SNR~6), and 
regions A (SNR~8.2), C (SNR~13.5), and D 
(SNR~13.5), while the wings are visible at 
several locations where the core of the emission 
band is not or only faintly visible above the 
wings, such as at Loki (SNR~7.3), E (SNR~7.8), 
F, G, and L (each with SNR~4-5). The emission 
bump at 1.69 µm is particularly strong in regions 
C and D in 2015, but is visible at several other 
locations as well (e.g., B, C in 2010; Loki, Janus, "
"A and E in 2015). The narrow emission band 
cores in most of these spectra are suggestive of 
temperatures of order a few 100 K, while the 
rotational temperature for regions C and D in 
2015 are of order 600 K, just as for the Center 
region in Figure 12. Clearly, there is a lot of 
heterogeneity in both the shape and the spatial 
distribution of the SO emissions.  
 "
"De Kleer et al. (2019a) analyzed the 2015 high 
spectral resolution data obtained with NIRSPEC 
on Keck II at the exact same time as we observed 
with OSIRIS. In order to fit their data, they 
adopted a gas population where the high and low 
rotational levels are populated according to 
Boltzmann distributions at a high and a low 
temperature. They obtained a best fit to the 
spectra using c1F(T1) + c2F(T2), with F the model 
intensity at temperature T1=186 K and T2=1500 
K, and the ratio c2/c1 = 5/611.  In Figure 14 we 
superpose essentially the same model on our 
OSIRIS 2015 spectra, normalized to the peak 
intensity of each spectrum. Panel a) shows the 
disk-integrated SO profile as determined from the 
final spectral image data-cube.  Panel b) shows 
the center part of Io (yellow box in Fig. 11) and 
panels c) and d) show spectra integrated over the 
small boxes C and D in Figure 11. As shown, the 
model fits both the core of the emission band and 
the wings quite well, except for the 1.69 µm 
bump. This bump, though, fell outside of the 
2015 NIRSPEC wavelength coverage, which was 
between 1.694 and 1.717 µm. However, it seems 
quite impossible to adapt the model to fit this 
emission bump. "
"To gain a better understanding of the emission 
line complex, we show transitions grouped by 
branch in Figure 15 for a temperature of 300 and 
1500 K. The transitions covering the extended 
emission branch increase at the higher 
temperatures. Indeed, the shoulders of the SO 
emission can be more or less matched by 
increasing the temperature, as shown by the cyan 
line in Fig. 14b. However, an increased 
temperature broadens the main component of the  "

"line profile, which has not been observed. The 
combination of two temperature profiles, a low 
and a high T, solves this problem to some extent, 
as shown by the three curves in Fig. 14b. 
However, all these combinations fail to show 
enhanced emission at 1.69 µm. This can only be 
brought about by adding a gas component at a 
high temperature, and including only high 
rotational states, such as J > 50 at 1800 K, shown 
in Figure 14a. This is a pure thought-experiment, 
though, as it seems physically implausible to only 
excite the high J states, or collisionally de-excite 
only the low J states. "
"4.3 Spectral Shape of April 2019 
NIRSPEC SO Emission "
" 
As shown in OSIRIS spectra (e.g., Fig. 14), we 
often see an emission bump near 1.69 µm. This 
emission feature has been seen in most of our 
older NIRSPEC observations at a similar (i.e., 
medium) spectral resolution as our OSIRIS data 
(de Pater et al., 2002; Laver et al., 2007). The 
feature is at times very prominent; it clearly is 
variable both in time (based upon this paper and 
previous measurements) and with location (this "

unfortunately, not covered by our 2015 high 
spectral resolution NIRSPEC data. To remedy 
this shortcoming, we observed Io-in-eclipse again 
with NIRSPEC at high spectral resolution on 15 
April 2019, using a spectral setting that did cover 
the 1.690 emission bump. These data were shown "

"Figure 16c shows the entire 2019 NIRSPEC 
spectrum smoothed down to the approximate 
resolution of the OSIRIS data (black line). 
Superposed is the above model, smoothed down 
to the same spectral resolution (in red). The 2015 
disk-integrated OSIRIS spectrum from Fig. 14a, 
normalized to the NIRSPEC spectrum, is also 
superposed. The 2015 OSIRIS, 2019 NIRSPEC 
and the de Kleer model agree quite well at 
wavelengths 1.698—1.712 µm. At longer 
wavelengths the NIRSPEC spectrum was taken 
with Echelle setting 2 (Fig. 7c), where the SNR 
was much lower. The drop in NIRSPEC intensity 
at 1.712 µm is caused by bad data (see Fig. 7c). 
Shortwards of 1.698 µm the difference is caused 
by the 1.69 µm bump. Note that a small bump at 
this wavelength is visible in the 2019 NIRSPEC 
data. As mentioned above, this bump varies both 
in time and location on the disk, and hence the 
fact that we do see differences in strength should 
not be unexpected. The model, though, does not 
match either bump. 
 
Recently, Bernath and Bittner (2020) presented a 
new line list for the a1D à X3S- transition. They "
"provide line lists for both the 0-0 and 1-1 bands. 
In Figure 17 we compare our data with these new 
models. The results for matching only the 0-0 
band (as in de Kleer et al’s work) is very similar 
to the model in Figure 16a,b. The model in Figure 
17a,b shows the best fit for the combined 0-0 and 
1-1 bands. The temperatures were quite similar as 
before: T1=80 K and T2=1120 K. However, the 
ratio c2/c1 ~ ¼, i.e., roughly a factor 4 lower than 
before. The separate 0-0 and 1-1 band model 
components are also shown. We note that the 
emission bumps in the model near 1.717 µm 
(qR13 and qQ12) are not visible in the data, while 
the 1.69 µm emissions in the data (rQ1, rR12) are 
not obvious in the model. 
 
 
Figure 17c shows smoothed profiles, as in Figure 
16c. The new model does not match the observed 
emission bumps near 1.69 µm, while the 1.717 
µm emissions in the 1-1 band are not obvious in 
the data (although it might be weakly present in 
the OSIRIS spectrum). The 1.69 µm bump, or at 
least elevated temperatures at 1.69—1.70 µm, are 
visible in high-temperature models. The magenta "

emission bumps near 1.717 µm, which are not as

much too broad in the core of the line (see also 
Fig. 14b). Since the strong qQ12 component of 
the emission in the 1-1 band had not been seen in 
past observations, and the 1.69 µm emission 
bump (rR12) is much stronger in the data 
compared to their model, Bernath and Bittner 
(2020) concluded that there is a lack of 
thermodynamic equilibrium in the Io emissions. 
Their statement is confirmed by the data 
presented in this paper.  Hence, in addition to our 
conclusion that much of the observed SO 
emission is caused by direct ejection of excited 
SO molecules from a large number of stealth 
plume volcanoes, the data also indicate the 
presence of non-LTE processes, perhaps caused 
by the complicated interaction of volcanic plumes 
with the atmosphere and surface frost (see, e.g., 
Zhang et al., 2003). 
 
 "
"5. Conclusions 
 
We observed the forbidden SO a1D à X3S- 
rovibronic transition at 1.707 µm with the field-
integral spectrometer on the Keck telescope on 27 
July 2010 and 25 December 2015 while the 
satellite was in eclipse; the spatial resolution was 
~0.12” and spectral resolution R ~2,500 over a 
range 1.652-1.737 µm. From simultaneously 
obtained NIRSPEC spectra over 1.694 – 1.717 
µm at a high spectral resolution (R~15,000) on 25 
December, de Kleer et al. (2019a) obtained a best 
fit to the total emission by using two 
temperatures: T1=186 K and T2=1500 K in almost 
equal proportions. A similar model with T1=100 
K and T2=1120 K matches new high spectral 
resolution NIRSPEC data obtained on 15 April 
2019, covering a wavelength range 1.680-1.731 
µm. However, none of these models could not 
match the emission bump near 1.69 µm, observed 
in the OSIRIS and new NIRSPEC data, as well as 
most previous medium resolution NIRSPEC 
spectra. While writing this paper, and after de 
Kleer et al.’s (2019a) publication, Bernath and 
Bittner (2020) published a new line list for the a1D 
à X3S- transition. This new (updated) model can "
"be matched to the data by decreasing the high-
temperature contribution in the model by a factor 
of  ~4 (c2/c1=1/4), with temperatures T1=80 K and 
T2=1120 K. This model does not provide a better 
match to the 1.69 µm emission bump; 
temperatures of order 1600 K are needed to match 
this emission bump, but such models do not fit the 
core of the emission line. The 1-1 band in the new 
model shows emission bumps near 1.717 µm, 
which are not obvious in the data. Both the 
presence of the 1.69 µm and absence of the 1.717 
µm emissions in the data led Bernath and Bittner 
(2020) to conclude that “SO is not in 
thermodynamic equilibrium”, a conclusion we 
support in this paper.   
 
The main scientific results of our paper can be 
summarized as follows: 
 "
"• There is considerable variability in the 
shape of the SO emission spectrum both 
across the disk and over time. In addition, 
the detailed spatial distribution differs 
between the core of the emission band 
(1.705-1.709 µm) and the wings. 
 "
"• The center of the line (1.705-1.709 µm) 
is indicative of rotational temperatures 
varying from a few 100 to ~600 K, 
depending on location. The wings of the 
emission band are indicative of high 
(>1500 K) temperatures and non-LTE 
effects.  "
" 
• In some cases the SO emissions in the "
"core and/or the wings of the emission 
band can be identified with volcanoes. 
Most large SO emission patches, 
however, do not coincide with known 
volcanoes or volcanic constructs, with 
the exception of the eastern complex in 
2015, which overlaps with Acala Fluctus. 
Evidence of past volcanic activity is, 
however, usually seen around these 
areas. (SO emissions are seen, e.g., over 
Loki (N/NE of Loki Patera), Karei 
Patera, Fjorgyn Fluctus, Surt, Creidne 
Patera, Mazda Patera and the North 
Lerna region). 
 "
"•  The large areas of SO emissions in 2015 
are located close to the equator where our 
new  SO2-ice maps indicate the possible 
presence of SO2 ice deposits. In 2010 the 
emissions are over an area where Douté 
et al. (2001) detected a thin veneer of 
micron-sized SO2 ice grains.  
 "
"• We suggest the large patches of SO 
emissions to result from a large number 
of stealth plumes (Johnson et al., 1995),  
i.e., “high-entropy” eruptions from a 
reservoir of superheated SO2 vapor in 
contact with silicate melts at about 1.5 
km depth. The emissions are caused by 
the direct ejection of excited SO from 
these volcanic vents. The emissions are 
thus suggestive of widespread stealth 
volcanism. 
 "
"• The spectra (in particular the wings of the 
emission band, the 1.69 µm bump, and 
absence of the 1.717 µm emissions) and 
their spatial distribution show signatures 
of non-LTE processes, confirming the 
following statement in de Pater et al. 
(2002): “it is difficult to compete with the 
fast radiative decay rate of 2.2 s−1 (Klotz 
et al. 1984) to enforce an equilibrium 
population of electronic states, so LTE 
might not prevail even near the surface 
and a volcanic vent.” "
" 
• On 15 December 2015 we observed "
"Ganymede in eclipse before Io went into 
eclipse. The observed glow from 
Ganymede is most likely caused by 
sunlight scattered in the forward 
direction by hazes in Jupiter’s upper 
atmosphere, as originally proposed by 
Tsumura et al. (2014). No SO emissions 
were detected. "
