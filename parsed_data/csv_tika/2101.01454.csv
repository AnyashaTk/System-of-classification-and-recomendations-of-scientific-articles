ABSTRACT
We have measured trigonometric parallaxes for four H2O masers associated with dis-
tant massive young stars in the inner regions of the Galaxy using the VLBA as part of
"the BeSSeL Survey. G026.50+0.28 is located at the near end of the Galactic bar, per-"
haps at the origin of the Norma spiral arm. G020.77−0.05 is in the Galactic Center re-
gion and is likely associated with a far-side extension of the Scutum arm. G019.60−0.23
and G020.08−0.13 are likely associated and lie well past the Galactic Center. These
"sources appear to be in the Sagittarius spiral arm, but an association with the Perseus"
arm cannot be ruled out.

1. INTRODUCTION

"
2 Xu et al."
"Mapping the Milky Way’s spiral structure is a challenging enterprise, since distances can exceed"
10 kpc and dust in the plane obscures optical light. The use of maser parallax measurements with
Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) (Xu et al. 2006; Hachisuka et al. 2006) has allowed as-
"tronomers to determine far more precise distances. Recently, VERA Collaboration et al. (2020)"
published a compilation of astrometry results. Together with the National Radio Astronomy Obser-
"vatory (NRAO) Very Long Baseline Array’s (VLBA) key science project, the Bar and Spiral Structure"
"Legacy (BeSSeL) Survey summarized in Reid et al. (2019), a total of more than 200 parallaxes and"
proper motions of maser sources have been measured. A significant portion of the spiral arms of
"the Milky Way have now been characterized (e.g., Choi et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2014, 2019; Sato et al."
"2014; Reid et al. 2019), especially within 5 kpc of the Sun (Xu et al. 2013, 2016; Hodges 2016)."
"However, for very distant regions of the Milky Way, especially towards the Galactic Center, a paucity"
of parallax measurements still limits our understanding of the Galactic spiral structure. In order to
"improve upon this, as part of the BeSSeL Survey, we present trigonometric parallaxes of four distant"
star-forming regions toward the inner Galaxy.
2. OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS
"We observed 22-GHz H2O masers towards four star-forming regions over 16 epochs with the VLBA,"
under program BR210; each epoch consisted of a 7-hr track. We scheduled observations near the
"peaks of the sinusoidal parallax signature in right ascension, since the amplitude of the declination"
signature is considerably smaller. Calibration procedures followed our well documented BeSSeL
Survey (Reid et al. 2009).
The parallax and proper motion of each source were fitted simultaneously using the obtained
data. We added “error floors” in quadrature to the formal position uncertainties to achieve post-
fit residuals with χ2 per degree of freedom near unity for both coordinates. Since uncompensated
tropospheric delay differences between the masers and the background quasars usually dominate the
"systematics, and these delay differences are essentially the same for all maser spots in a source, we"
conservatively inflated formal parallax errors by the square-root of the number of maser spots used.

Table 1 summarizes parallaxes and proper motions results. Additional details on observations and
analysis are presented in the APPENDIX A.
Since water masers in star forming regions form in outflows with expansion velocities typically 10s
"of km s−1, assigning a VLSR to the central star which excites the masers can be uncertain at the ±10"
"km s−1 level. Therefore, we instead adopt the VLSR measured with dense molecular tracers (e.g., NH3"
and CH3OH) for the associated molecular cloud.
Our distances to G019.60−0.23 and G020.08−0.13 resolve a long-standing controversy as to whether
"the sources are at their near kinematic distance (∼4 kpc, Georgelin & Georgelin 1976; Petriella et al."
"2013) or the far (∼13 kpc, Kolpak et al. 2003; Ranasinghe & Leahy 2018). Their parallax distances of"
"13.2+2.2
−1.7 kpc and 15.2"
"+2.7
−2.0 kpc strongly favor the far distance. The kinematic distance of G020.77−0.05"
"is ∼11.6 kpc (Urquhart et al. 2018) based on the HI self-absorption technique, but its parallax dis-"
"tance of 8.1+0.9
−0.8 kpc is much less, suggesting its luminosity is just half its previous estimate. For"
"G026.50+0.28, its kinematic distance of ∼6.3 kpc (Molinari et al. 1996; Qiu et al. 2012) agrees with"
"the parallax distance of 6.3+0.5
−0.4 kpc."
4 Xu et al.
3. GALACTIC DISTRIBUTION
Since the major spiral arms of the Galaxy have long been known to produce fairly well-defined
"arcs and loops in 21 cm and CO longitude-velocity (l, v) diagrams, the BeSSeL project assigns maser"
sources to spiral arms based on their well-determined positions in such diagrams — even before
"their parallaxes are measured. Figure 1 shows traces of the spiral arms in a CO (l, v) diagram of"
"the first Galactic quadrant, with the positions of the present four maser sources overlaid. Figure 2"
shows the same four sources as green polygons on the plane of the Galaxy along with the 200 maser
parallax measurements (circles) from Reid et al. (2019). The error bars represent 1-sigma distance
uncertainties.
Since the sources G019.60−0.23 and G020.08−0.13 have the same velocity and are separated by
"less than one half degree on the sky, it seems likely that they are physically associated. Judging"
"from Figure 1, both appear to be in the Sagittarius arm, although an association with the Perseus"
"arm cannot be ruled out. This is especially true since it is difficult to determine the (l, v) locus"
of the distant Perseus arm in this very crowded section of the diagram (see Figure 8 in Reid et al.
"2016). As shown in Figure 2, our parallax distances are likewise consistent with both sources being"
"in the Sagittarius arm, although judging from this figure alone the Perseus arm is favored. Although"
"G020.08−0.13 falls almost exactly on the Outer arm in Figure 2, an association with that arm can"
be confidently ruled out based on the velocity separation of 43 km s−1 between this source and the
"Outer arm locus in Figure 1. If both sources lie in the Sagittarius arm, they hint at the need for a"
"modification of the spiral arm fit shown in Figure 2, with the arm moving slightly farther out and"
"perhaps even merging with the Perseus arm at low Galactic longitudes. However, tighter distance"
errors on these sources and others will be required before such an adjustment can be confirmed.
"G020.77−0.05 presents an interesting case. Its (l, v) position in Figure 1 places it in the near side"
"of the Scutum arm, but its parallax distance places it much closer to an extension of that arm to"
the far side (Figure 2). These two results can be reconciled if the source has a velocity anomalously
low by about 20 km s−1. This is entirely possible given the small Galactic radius of the source and
"its proximity to the end of the Galactic bar. Indeed, as discussed below, this source has very large"

"Figure 1. Location of masers superposed on a CO (l, v) diagram from (Dame et al. 2001); the spiral arm"
traces are from Reid et al. (2016). Solid and dashed lines correspond to the near and far portions of arms
"interior to the Solar circle. The CO (l, v) diagram is optimized to best display the intense inner-Galaxy"
"arms, so the Perseus and Outer arms are not well represented here."
"peculiar motions in the plane of the Galaxy. Based on these findings, we tentatively suggest that the"
far portion of the Scutum arm extends from a Galactic longitude of 25◦ (corresponding to a Galactic
"azimuth of 90◦) down to at least a longitude of 20◦ (azimuth 100◦). However, we caution that the"
"Norma arm could also be a candidate for extension, and the Norma and Scutum arms may even"
merge there. Clearly more parallax measurements are needed to untangle these possibilities.
"G026.50+0.28 is in a very crowded region of the inner Galaxy. Its (l, v) position is consistent with"
both the near side of the Norma arm and the far side of the Scutum arm. Our parallax distance
"of 6.3+0.5
−0.4 kpc resolves this choice in favor of Norma. The source is located near the end of the bar,"

Note—The Galactic “Univ” model and solar mo-
tion found by Reid et al. (2019) were used to cal-
culate the peculiar motions.
We calculate the peculiar (non-circular) motions for these four sources using the methodology
described in Reid et al. (2009) with the Galactic model and solar motion of Reid et al. (2019). The
"results are listed in Table 2. For G019.60−0.23 and G020.08−0.13, the peculiar motions are consistent"
"with Us and Ws magnitudes <∼ 10 km s
−1; the uncertainties in the Vs values are too large for"
meaningful analysis. These large Vs uncertainties can be traced to a large motion in Galactic longitude
"scaled by their Galactocentric radii. These radii have ±2 kpc uncertainties, as their parallax distance"
uncertainties map almost directly to radii. This is discussed in detail in APPENDIX B.
Both G020.77−0.05 and G026.50+0.28 appear to have some very large peculiar motions in the
"plane of the Galaxy. They have motions toward the Galactic center (Us) of about 30 km s
−1, and"
"these are significant at the 2σ level. Formally, G020.77−0.05 has a peculiar component of 56 km s−1"
"counter to Galactic rotation. However, this estimate is dependent on extrapolation of the “Universal”"
rotation curve fitted to sources with Galactic radii > 4 kpc. Either G020.77−0.05 is orbiting the
"Galaxy considerably slower than indicated by the rotation curve, indicating a significantly elliptical"
"orbit, and/or the rotation curve is a too simplistic model for this region."
4. SUMMARY
8 Xu et al.
In order to extend our knowledge of the distances to sources in the distant regions of the Milky
"Way, we measured the parallaxes and proper motions of four masers associated with massive young"
stars. The results of G019.60−0.23 and G020.08−0.13 hint at a modification of the Sagittarius arm
"model of Reid et al. (2019). Near the Galactic bar, many sources (G020.77−0.05, G026.50+0.28"
"and others in Immer et al. (2019)) have significant non-circular motions, suggesting the bar’s strong"
gravitational potential has a significant effect.

6. APPENDIX B
Here we combine the steps documented in Reid et al. (2009) to obtain source peculiar motions:
"Us (toward the Galactic center), Vs (in the direction of Galactic rotation), Ws (toward the north"
Galactic pole).
Us = vHelio cos b cos (ℓ+ β)
−Dµb sin b cos (ℓ+ β)
−Dµℓ cos b sin (ℓ+ β)
− (V⊙ +Θ0) sin β
"+ U⊙ cos β,"
Vs = vHelio cos b sin (ℓ+ β)
−Dµb sin b sin (ℓ+ β)
+Dµℓ cos b cos (ℓ+ β)
+ (V⊙ +Θ0) cos β
+ U⊙ sin β
"Ws = (Dµb cos b+ vHelio sin b+W⊙),"
where vHelio is the heliocentric radial velocity. µℓ and µb are proper motions in Galactic longitude
(ℓ) and latitude (b) (converted from those measured in the eastward and northward directions); β
is Galactocentric azimuth (defined as 0 toward the Sun and increasing in the direction of Galactic
"rotation); (U⊙, V⊙ + Θ0,W⊙) describe the non-circular motion of the Sun; Θs is the rotation speed"
"of Galaxy at source, and D is its distance from Sun."
Using the following relations
sin (ℓ+ β)
"Rs = −Dp cos (ℓ+ β) +R0 cos β,"
16 Xu et al.
"where Dp = D cos b, R0 and Rs are Galactocentric radii of Sun and sources, we obtain"
"Dµℓ cos b sin (ℓ+ β) = µℓR0 sin β,Dµℓ cos b cos (ℓ+ β) = µℓ(R0 cos β − Rs). Then,"
Us = vHelio cos b cos (ℓ+ β)
−Dµb sin b cos (ℓ+ β)
− (µℓR0 + V⊙ +Θ0) sin β
"+ U⊙ cos β,"
Vs = vHelio cos b sin (ℓ+ β)
−Dµb sin b sin (ℓ+ β)
+ (µℓR0 + V⊙ +Θ0) cosβ − µℓRs
+ U⊙ sin β
"For G019.60−0.23 and G020.08−0.13, uncertainties in the measured motions and distances lead to"
"terms of ∼ 10 km s−1 for Us in Eq. 1. However, for Vs the term µℓRs can contribute to a substantial"
uncertainty of
"σ2 = R2sσ
2
µℓ
+ µ2ℓσ"
"dominated by the second term containing σ2Rs . For µℓ ≈ 7.2 mas y
−1 and σRs ≈ 2 kpc, this leads to"
an uncertainty of σ ≈ 70 km s−1.
