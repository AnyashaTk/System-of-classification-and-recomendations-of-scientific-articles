"ABSTRACT
We propose a new model for treating solid-phase photoprocesses in interstellar ice"
"analogues. In this approach, photoionization and photoexcitation are included in more
detail, and the production of electronically-excited (suprathermal) species is explic-
itly considered. In addition, we have included non-thermal, non-diffusive chemistry
to account for the low-temperature characteristic of cold cores. As an initial test of
our method, we have simulated two previous experimental studies involving the UV
irradiation of pure solid O2. In contrast to previous solid-state astrochemical model
calculations which have used gas-phase photoabsorption cross-sections, we have em-
ployed solid-state cross-sections in our calculations. This method allows the model to
be tested using well-constrained experiments rather than poorly constrained gas-phase
abundances in ISM regions. Our results indicate that inclusion of non-thermal reac-
tions and suprathermal species allows for reproduction of low-temperature solid-phase
photoprocessing that simulate interstellar ices within cold (∼ 10 K) dense cores such
as TMC-1."

1. INTRODUCTION
"While gas-phase and surface reactions on bare carbonaceous or silicate dust grains contribute to
cosmic chemistry, the energetic processing of cosmic ices within dark, dense molecular clouds via pho-
tochemistry (initiated by non-ionizing radiation) and radiation chemistry (initiated by ionizing radi-
ation) is thought to be the dominant mechanism for the interstellar synthesis of prebiotic molecules
(see, for example, review: (Arumainayagam et al. 2019)). Rate-equation based modeling treatments
of UV-induced condensed-phase photochemistry have been moderately successful in reproducing the
abundances of complex organic molecules (COMs) observed toward hot cores/corinos (Shingledecker
et al. 2019b; Grassi et al. 2014; McElroy et al. 2013; Garrod 2013). However, recent detections of
several COMs (e.g., methyl formate (HCOOCH3) and dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3)) in cold (∼ 10 K)
dense cores (Vastel et al. 2014; Taquet et al. 2017; Scibelli & Shirley 2020; Bacmann et al. 2012;
Jiménez-Serra et al. 2016; Öberg et al. 2010), albeit in smaller abundance than in hot cores, have
led to the search for alternative mechanisms for complex molecule production through cold or non-
thermal mechanisms (Shingledecker et al. 2018; Vasyunin et al. 2017). A recent radiolysis-related
computational study (Shingledecker et al. 2019b) has provided an explanation for the unprecedented
observations of chemical synthesis at temperatures as low as 10 K in starless and prestellar cores. In
this modified bulk-chemistry method involving radiolysis by cosmic rays, radicals produced within
the ice are considered to be trapped and attempt to react with a neighbor with approximately every
vibration. In the study described herein, we use this non-diffusive mechanism to revise the treatment
of solid-phase photoprocesses in astrochemical models to account for the complex organics observed
in cold cores. A recent study by Jin & Garrod (2020) utilizes a non-diffusive rate-based model which
demonstrates the dependence of COM production on non-diffusive reactions between radicals and ice
species in cold astrochemical environments and achieves considerable success in reproducing observa-
tions toward prestellar core L1544. In contrast to that study, the model presented here incorporates
(1) the detailed inclusion of photoionization and photoexcitation, and (2) explicit consideration of
the production and reaction of electronically excited radicals (suprathermal species).
One of the main processing mechanisms of ices in molecular clouds is radiation chemistry, which"
"involves ionization and the production of copious numbers of low-energy (< 15 eV) electrons, which
are thought to be the dominant species involved in radiation chemistry (e.g.,(Arumainayagam et al.
2010)). Ionizing radiation present in this environment include MeV to TeV cosmic rays (∼ 85% H+,
∼ 13% He2+, ∼ 1% heavy bare nuclei, and ∼ 1% electrons) and high-energy photons (e.g., vacuum
ultraviolet photons with energies higher than ∼ 10 eV, extreme ultraviolet, X-ray, and γ-ray).
Whereas high-energy photons contribute to radiation chemistry in dense molecular clouds, low-"
"energy (< 10 eV) photons (e.g., far (deep)-UV (4.1 – 6.2 eV)) initiate photochemistry, a process that
does not involve direct ionization, but instead involves reactions of electronically-excited species. The
UV interstellar radiation field, consisting of radiation from nearby stars, is extinguished by dust well
before reaching the interior of dark, dense molecular clouds where prebiotic molecules are synthesized.
However, a local secondary UV field exists to initiate photo-processing of dust grain ices (Prasad &
Tarafdar 1983). Cosmic rays excite gaseous molecular hydrogen, resulting in Lyman and Werner"

"band emission with an estimated flux of ∼ 103− 104 photons cm−2 s−1 (Gredel et al. 1989; Cruz-Diaz
et al. 2014; Shen et al. 2004). Although this spectral distribution includes high-energy (10 to 13.6
eV) photons, over half of the secondary UV field consists of low-energy (< 10 eV) photons capable of
photochemistry by exciting condensed species which may then react within the ice. Except during
high photon-flux laser experiments which may involve multi-photon processes, photochemistry is
subject to the Bunsen-Roscoe law, which states that the photochemical yield is directly proportional
to dose, irrespective of dose rate; this law allows for extrapolation from laboratory experiments to
real astrochemical predictions, though even these low-flux experiments utilize fluxes much higher
than those experienced by ice in dark, dense molecular clouds.
Astrochemical models provide a critical link between the fundamental chemical information revealed"
"by laboratory experiments and predictions and observations of chemical abundances in the interstellar
medium. Most models utilize a rate-based approach due to the convenience and speed of that
method, though Monte Carlo models have been used to more accurately simulate processes such as the
catastrophic impact of high energy radiation or multi-layer interactions (Cuppen et al. 2017; Öberg
2016). Because all such simulations involving reaction networks and rate-equations are extremely
sensitive to input parameters, these models generally become more successful as parameters are
better constrained by laboratory experiments. Abundances of several COMs in hot cores/corinos
are well reproduced by modern rate-equation-based computational models, which include a coupled
gas-phase and grain-surface chemistry or three-phase (gas, surface, and bulk) chemistry (Cuppen
et al. 2017).
Abundances of COMs in cold (∼ 10 K) cores, however, are generally underpredicted. Most astro-"
"chemical models that include bulk-phase processes require thermal diffusion before reaction (Cuppen
et al. 2017); however, in the low-temperature conditions of starless and prestellar cores, this ther-
mal motion within the bulk ice is not feasible. Several explanations for the formation of COMs in
cold dense cores have been proposed, including: (1) photo-processing followed by reactive desorp-
tion (Watanabe & Kouchi 2002; Chuang et al. 2017; Aikawa et al. 2008; Herbst & van Dishoeck
2009; Jin & Garrod 2020), (2) gas-phase reactions (Balucani et al. 2015; Codella et al. 2020), and
(3) astrophysical-shock-catalyzed chemistry (James et al. 2020), (4) methanol reactive desorption on
CO-rich ices (within the catastrophic CO-freeze-out zone of pre-stellar cores), followed by gas-phase
chemistry (Vasyunin et al. 2017). The model presented herein instead assumes that reactive species
are trapped within the bulk ice, but have the possibility of reacting with neighboring molecules during
each vibration. This work is an extension of a previous study (modeling the physicochemical effects
of astrochemical O2 and H2O ice-analogue bombardment by energetic protons), which revealed the
importance of considering fast non-thermal reactions in these systems (Shingledecker et al. 2019b).
In what follows, we apply this assumption to the case of photon irradiation of cosmic-ice analogues.
The model, as utilized in this work, includes only photon-initiated ice processing, including both
excitation and ionization events. Cations produced via ionization are assumed to quickly recombine
with a secondary electron, resulting in the electronically excited parent molecule, which can then
dissociate into electronically-excited products. Models such as ours are essential for interpreting
planetary and interstellar ice data generated by past, upcoming, and ongoing NASA missions such
as Spitzer, Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), and the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST)."
4 Mullikin et al.
"As a proof of concept, this new model is used to simulate two published laboratory studies that
monitored the processing of O2 ice by < 10.8 eV photons. Given that interstellar ice mantles are
likely segregated into polar and apolar layers, it is useful to “tune” the model to simulate the photo-
processing of a single species accurately, and then these species-specific models may be combined
to simulate processing of the layers of more realistic cosmic ice analogues (Tielens et al. 1991;
Pontoppidan 2006; Öberg et al. 2009, 2011). The first study (Gerakines et al. 1996) employed a
microwave-discharge hydrogen-flow lamp (MDHL) with a photon flux of 2.2×1014 photons cm−2 s−1.
The MDHL spectrum closely reproduces the calculated dark, dense molecular cloud secondary UV
spectrum above 115 nm (below 10.8 eV). However, the fraction of Lyman alpha emission in a MDHL
spectrum can change significantly based on the experimental settings such as microwave power and
gas pressure (Ligterink et al. 2015). In Gerakines et al. (1996), oxygen ices (∼ 100 nm in thickness)
were deposited at ∼ 10 K inside a vacuum chamber 10−7 Torr, mimicking conditions relevant to
those of interstellar ices in cold cores. Two capping layers of argon precluded both contamination
and significant desorption from the ices during photon irradiation. The oxygen ice was irradiated
with photons for one hour corresponding to a maximum fluence of 7.9 × 1017 photons cm−2, corre-
sponding to approximately a million years of secondary interstellar UV irradiation. Production of
O3 during the irradiation was monitored via the 1043 cm−1 IR feature of O3.
In the second experiment (Raut et al. 2011), a pulsed ArF excimer laser (193 nm), defocused using"
"a MgF2 lens, with a flux of ∼ 2.3 × 1014 photons cm−2 s−1, was used to irradiate O2 ices 80–84 nm
thick. The use of 6.4 eV photons precludes radiation chemistry. The maximum fluence was 9.3×1018
photons cm−2. A vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 10−9 Torr and an ice temperature of
22 K simulated interstellar-like conditions. The ozone column density as a function of fluence was
monitored via the 1043 cm−1 and 2109 cm−1 IR features of O3.
The goal of the present work is to improve the current understanding of ice chemistry initiated"
"by interstellar secondary UV radiation within dark, dense molecular clouds during the starless and
prestellar stages well before the formation of protostars and planets. The successful reproduction of
experimental results herein indicates that the inclusion of non-thermal reactions and suprathermal
species will allow for more accurate modeling of interstellar photoprocessing of ices in cold cores.
Additional tuning of the model for other species, such as water, will render the model suitable for
predicting cold-core COM abundances attributable to photo-processing of mixed ices."
2. METHODS
2.1. Theory
"As in Shingledecker & Herbst (2018), the starting point of our proposed model is the assumption
that the interaction between a UV photon and some target species, A, results in one of the following
outcomes:"
A; A+ + e− (P1)
A; A+ + e− → A∗ → B∗ + C∗ (P2)
A; A∗ → B + C (P3)
A New Method for Simulating Photoprocesses 5
A; A∗ (P4)
"Here, the curly arrow (;) represents the absorption of a photons, B and C are dissociation products,
and * indicates an electronically excited (suprathermal) species. Of the four processes given above,
(P1) and (P2) correspond to the photoionization of A to the cation A+— followed by the rapid
recombination of the charged products in the case of (P2) — and are relevant in solids for hν '
10 eV (Arumainayagam et al. 2019). Similarly, (P3) and (P4) account for photoexcitation to the
excited state A∗, with (P3) leading to the photodissociation of A. One advantage of separating
photoionization and photoexcitation is that the former can be enabled or disabled based on the
energy of the incident photons.
The rate coefficients of photoionization and dissociation processes, kphoto, are usually calculated"
kphoto =
"∫
σ(λ)I(λ)dλ (1)"
"where here, σ(λ) and I(λ) are wavelength-dependent cross-section and photon flux, respectively. This
formula can also be expressed as"
kphoto =
"∫
σ(λ)I(λ)dλ∫
I(λ)dλ"
"∫
I(λ)dλ = σ̄Φ (2)"
"where σ̄ is the average cross-section, and Φ is the integrated photon flux. Following Shingledecker &
Herbst (2018), we can then express the rates of (P1) – (P4) in the following way:"
kP1 = Peσ̄ionΦδ (3)
kP2 = (1− Pe)σ̄ionΦδ (4)
kP3 = Pdisσ̄excΦδ (5)
kP4 = (1− Pdis)σ̄excΦδ. (6)
"Here, Pe is the electron escape probability (Elkomoss & Magee 1962), which we assume as a first
approximation is equal to zero. A more comprehensive model will need to relax this approximation to
account for the effects of low-energy secondary electrons thought to be the primary agents of radiation
chemistry. All ionized molecules are assumed to quickly recombine to form an excited molecule which
will subsequently dissociate, react, or be quenched. Quenching by the surrounding ice is assumed to
be the dominant relaxation mechanism rather than radiative relaxation, and the attempt frequency is
used as the first-order rate constant for this process (Shingledecker et al. 2019a). In reality, electronic
excitations (excitons) may diffuse from the interior of the ice to the selvedge where they can drive the
desorption of species into the gas (Thrower et al. 2011; Marchione et al. 2016). Pdis is the dissociation
probability, which is ∼ 1 in the gas, but in solids, we assume it to be 0.5 as a first approximation.
This value was adjusted to account for spectral characteristics in later simulations. Dissociation"

"products can recombine to reform the parent species, but this recombination is not assumed to occur
preferentially to – or is calculated differently than - any other possible chemical reaction with other
bulk species the fragments could undergo. The δ is a fitting factor that was introduced to account for
assumptions of the model and absolute uncertainties in experimental data such as photon flux. More
explicitly, δ is sensitive to, e.g., (a) the reactions and photoproducts included in the chemical network,
(b) the associated branching fractions or cross sections, as well as (c) the methods for treating the
underlying physical processes employed in the code. Thus, reasonable agreement between calculated
and experimental data obtained assuming δ ≈ 1 for all photoprocesses would suggest that (a), (b),
and (c) capture the salient features of a given system. Conversely, shortcomings in (a), (b) or (c) can
be compensated for to some degree by adjusting δ values to yield best agreement with experimental
results. For photoprocesses occurring in the bulk of optically thick ices, an extinction factor, �, can be
included in Eqs. (3) – (6) to account for the reduced photon flux relative to the ice surface. Because
the two experimental studies of interest used optically thin ices, the extinction factor was set equal
to 1."
2.2. Model
"In this work, we have utilized the MONACO model (Vasyunin et al. 2017), previously modified by us,
to simulate ice radiation chemistry experiments (Shingledecker et al. 2019b). This code, written in
Fortran 90, solves a system of coupled differential equations describing the evolution of the abundance
of each species in our network. Unlike comparable astrochemical models, the model described herein
accounts for electronically-excited suprathermal species produced during photo-processing of ices.
Table 1 presents all photon-induced and non-photon-induced (reactions involving products of the
initial photo-processing) reactions included in the model network for O2. Reactions occurring in the
selvedge, considered to be the top four monolayers of the ice (Vasyunin & Herbst 2013), are assumed
to occur via the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, and rate coefficients are calculated using the
standard formula for diffusive processes. For reactions in the bulk, rate coefficients are calculated
using the non-diffusive formula of Shingledecker et al. (2019b),"
kfast = fbr

, (7)"
A New Method for Simulating Photoprocesses 7
"where fbr is the branching fraction, Tice is the ice temperature, EABact is the activation energy in Kelvins
for reaction, Nbulk is the total number of bulk species in the simulated ice, and νA0 is the characteristic
(hereafter, trial) vibrational frequency (Herbst & Millar 2008).
In our model, species in the selvedge can, in principle, desorb both thermally as well as following"
"exothermic association reactions, with the latter being treated by the method of Garrod (2008) with
a standard efficiency of 1%. To mimic the Gerakines experiments where such desorption would be
inhibited due to the presence of a capping noble gas layer, thermal, chemical, and photodesorption
processes were disabled in our models. The ices studied by Raut and coworkers lacked such a noble gas
cap, and thus some amount of desorption would have occurred during the course of the experiment.
However, given the fairly low temperature (22 K) of the bulk ice, we assume that thermal desorption
is negligible over the timescale of the experiment. Moreover, photodesorption for the Raut et al.
experiments was also disabled, since the desorption rate is not well constrained (Fayolle et al. 2013;
Bulak et al. 2020) and our focus for this study was, in any case, the chemistry occurring within the
bulk ice. Chemical desorption is included for the simulation of the Raut et al. data but was found
to have a negligible impact on the bulk chemistry we describe in detail below.
Rate constants for photon-induced reactions are dependent on the average cross-sections (σ̄), pho-"
"ton flux (Φ), and the fitting factor (δ) as described in §2.1. Each product of photoionization or
photoexcitation is treated as being trapped in a cage of neighboring bulk species molecules; reactions
involving suprathermal species are assumed to be barrierless. Non-photon-induced reactions are as-
sumed to occur non-diffusively, with rates of reaction between any two species being proportional to
their abundances in the ice (Shingledecker et al. 2019b).
For the pure O2 ice, we use the chemical network (Table 1) initially described in Shingledecker"
"et al. (2017) and used in the microscopic Monte Carlo model, CIRIS, and later modified for use in
rate-based kinetic codes in Shingledecker et al. (2019b). The choice of O2 as the bulk species for this
initial test of the model is appropriate given the relative simplicity of the products and subsequent
possible reactions, especially compared to species such as water or methanol. The selvedge, which
comprises the chemically distinct region near the top of the mantle, is considered to be the top four
monolayers of the ice (Vasyunin & Herbst 2013).
Parameters relevant to the simulation of laboratory experiments include ice thickness, photon"
"fluence (photon flux multiplied by irradiation time), and photon energy; these values were obtained
directly from the manuscripts of the experiments chosen for simulation. The trial frequency, ν,
parameterizes the vibrational frequency of a molecule, used as the pre-exponential factor in calculating
bulk rate coefficients. The model assumes that with every vibration, there is a probability that a
molecule will react with a neighboring molecule (Eq. (7)). For all simulations, the vibrational
frequency was set to 1× 1015 s−1, which is reasonable, assuming RRKM theory. Increasing the value
by orders of magnitude has negligible impact on model simulations, while reducing the value below
1× 1015 s−1 resulted in significant deviations from experimental data.
Specific to each photoprocess included in the chemical network are cross-sections and the δ fitting"
"factor. Branching ratios for reactions with more than one product channel were assumed to occur
with equal probability in early simulations, and later adjusted to match spectral characteristics.
Cross-sections were obtained from various sources, as detailed below."

of values are shown which were found to yield agreement with the data within

"We directly tested the validity of our new method by replicating experimental data of O2 ice
irradiation with UV photons (< 10.8 eV). In contrast to simulations of poorly constrained gas-
phase abundances in ISM regions, this method allows the model to be tested using well-constrained
experiments. Simulated pure oxygen ice experiments shared the use of interstellar-like temperatures
and pressures. The results of these simulations are described below."
3.1. Microwave discharge hydrogen flow lamp source
"Previous work by Gerakines et al. (1996) provides excellent data with which to quantify the validity
of our approach. Their experiments on pure O2 were carried out at 10 K. They utilized a microwave
discharge hydrogen flow lamp (MDHL), two layers of inert argon, film thicknesses on the order of 0.1
µm, photon fluxes of ∼ 1014 photons cm−2 s−1, and an irradiation time of ∼ 1 hr (Gerakines et al.
1996; Jenniskens et al. 1993). The O3 production curve given in figure 8 of Gerakines et al. was
digitized for comparison to the model output of O3 abundance (Fig. 1). Listed in Table 2 are the
effective cross sections, σ̄, for this experiment. To calculate the effective solid-phase cross section for
O2 photoabsorption, first a reported spectrum of solid-phase O2 absorption (but not cross section)
as a function of wavelength was digitized (Lu et al. 2008). Next, this absorption data was scaled to
the digitized solid phase cross section data of Mason et al. (2006) in order to obtain cross section
values over a broader wavelength range corresponding to the spectrum of a MDHL. The spectrum
of a MDHL (Jenniskens et al. 1993) was digitized, and intensity and cross section were multiplied
together at each wavelength. Finally, the product was integrated over all wavelengths and divided
by total flux (Eq. (2)). The effective solid-phase O3 photoabsorption cross section was calculated
by first scaling gas-phase absorption data from Sivaraman et al. (2014) to gas-phase cross section
data from the Leiden database (Heays et al. 2017). Solid-phase absorption data taken in the same
laboratory (Sivaraman et al. 2014) were multiplied by the same scaling factor. The resulting solid-
phase photoabsorption cross section data as a function of wavelength was used to calculate effective
solid-phase cross section. To obtain cross section values for the excited-state reaction path (e.g.,"

"(P4)) and the dissociation path (e.g., (P3)), total photoabsorption cross-sections were multiplied by
the corresponding branching ratio. Average solid-phase cross sections for O2 and O3 photoionization
were obtained by using gas phase cross section data from the Leiden database but shifting all data
points by 1.5 eV for application to condensed species (Kahn 2015; Yu et al. 1975). After inserting the
experimental parameters of ice thickness, photon flux, photon-irradiation time, and reaction cross
sections, the δ fitting factors given in Table 2 were obtained by manually adjusting to maximize
the agreement with experimental data. The optimized steady-state O3 abundance agrees with the
experimental value to within 5%.
Only the δ fitting factor for O2 photodissociation varied from 1.0 for agreement with the experi-"
"mental data. Given the broad absorption cross-section peak even in the solid-phase spectrum and
the high probability of dissociation following photoabsorption for gaseous O2, a simulation was run
with a branching ratio of 99:1 for O2 dissociation to O2 excited-state reaction, the results of which
are shown in Fig. 2. All δ values could then be set to 1.0 for similar agreement to experimental
data as when the dissociation and excited-state reactions were assumed to be equally likely but a

3.2. Pulsed 193 nm ArF excimer laser source
"A different condensed-phase O2 experiment (Raut et al. 2011), which utilized a pulsed laser UV
source, was also simulated to test the validity of our model. These experiments were conducted at
22 K with a film thickness of ∼ 80 nm, a photon flux averaging ∼ 1014 photons cm−2 s−1, and a
total fluence of ∼ 1019 photons cm−2 with 193 nm (6.4 eV) photons. The O3 abundance data in
Figure 5 of Raut et al. was digitized for comparison to the model output. Because the O3 abundance
was reported as column density, the model output was scaled to account for the thickness of the
ice. In this case, cross-sections were provided in the experiment manuscript: the solid phase 193
nm photoabsorption cross section for O2 and O3 are reported as 4.2 × 10−19 cm2 and 4.3 × 10−19
cm2, respectively. To confirm these reported cross sections, two independently reported spectra of
solid state O2 absorption (but not cross-section) as a function of wavelength were digitized (Cruz-Diaz"

"et al. 2014; Lu et al. 2008). Each included data at 193 nm. Next, a published spectrum of solid-phase
O2 cross section as a function of wavelength was also digitized (Mason et al. 2006); this spectrum did
not include data at 193 nm. The absorption spectra were then scaled to the cross-section spectrum.
The values found in the scaled data at 193 nm matched the cross-section values used by Raut et al.
to within 25%.
Since Raut et al. included error values in their experimental data, a python script was used to"
"find optimized δ fitting factors which would maximize agreement with experimental data. “Maximal
agreement” was considered as any model output which fell entirely within upper and lower error.
Our script iteratively ran the model over a range of δ values for each process and indicated which
combinations of δ values resulted in model outputs which agreed with the data within experimental
error; these are given in Table 2. Because there is a range of outputs which may fall within upper and
lower error, there are correspondingly ranges of δ values for the most influential processes. Simulation
results using δ values within this range are shown in Fig. 3."
12 Mullikin et al.
"As displayed in Table 2, the δ fitting factors, although close to unity, vary somewhat between the
simulations of the two experiments. When branching ratios are adjusted from the initial assumption
of equal likelihood to more realistic values, all fitting factors could be set to 1.0 for the Gerakines
experiment. As noted in §2.1, the δ fitting factors should be interpreted as effectively accounting
for other factors (e.g., absolute uncertainties in the experimental data) not explicitly considered in
the code. The fact that all δ values given in Table 2 are close to unity indicates that the overall
contribution of such unknown effects is likely small and are unlikely to be significant sources of
uncertainly in astrophysical simulations.
In our models, it was found that our O3 abundances were most sensitive to variations in the δ"
"value for the O2 ; 2O process, thereby revealing the importance of the O + O2 reaction on the
overall abundance of ozone. This finding reveals another useful role for the δ values, namely, that of
highlighting key reactions for a given species based on how sensitive the calculated abundance is to
variations in the assumed values of δ.
While the current model provides reasonable agreement with the findings of the considered exper-"
"iments, a number of areas could be addressed in future studies that could increase both agreement
with empirical data as well as the underlying physical realism of the simulation. As mentioned, the
focus of this work has been on processes occurring in the mantles of thin ice films similar to those
that coat interstellar dust grains, all of which were optically thin, and thus, we have not considered
the effects of extinction that would be of particular importance in optically thick ices. To investigate
this effect in more detail, a multi-layer model which more explicitly treats the vertical structure of ice
mantles, such as the macroscopic Monte Carlo code described in Vasyunin & Herbst (2013), would
be more appropriate.
Moreover, given the focus of this study on bulk chemistry, we have not considered photodesorption"
"processes occurring in the top several monolayers of the ice. Current values used in models for these
kinds of processes are not well constrained, however, our method of directly simulating laboratory
experiments using astrochemical codes represents a promising means by which suitable values could
be obtained.
Additionally, it is known that the absorption of photons of different energies will change both the"
"efficiency and products of photo-processes (Fayolle et al. 2013, 2011; Fillion et al. 2014). Absent
theoretical/experimental cross-sections for photoprocesses as a function of energy, we have as a
first approximation assumed that, for example, the photodissociation of O2 produces with equal
probability 2O∗ and 2O, but not O∗ + O.
Finally, because subionization UV photons dominate the MDHL lamp/ArF laser UV, it is likely that"
"the role of low-energy electrons is not significant in this study. To simulate the effects of secondary UV
radiation within dark, dense molecular clouds, this model must be modified to include secondary low-
energy electron-induced process such as dissociative electron attachment that can occur at electron
energies almost as low as 0 eV."
4. CONCLUSIONS
"We have simulated the < 10.8 eV UV photodissociation of solid O2 at 10-22 K by a microwave-
discharge hydrogen flow lamp and an ArF excimer laser using a rate-based model. Our method-
ology incorporates: (a) non-diffusive bulk reactions for radicals and other reactive species and (b)
a new theoretical method for simulating photoprocesses which, for the first time, distinguishes be-
tween photoexcitation and photoionization. We explicitly account for the production and reactivity"
A New Method for Simulating Photoprocesses 13
"of short-lived suprathermal photoproducts. In contrast to previous condensed phase astrochemi-
cal model calculations that have used gas-phase photoabsorption cross sections, we have employed
solid-phase cross sections in our calculations. This method allows the model to be tested using
well-constrained experiments rather than poorly constrained gas-phase abundances in regions of the
ISM. The semi-quantitative agreement of the model with experimental O3 abundances obtained in
two different laboratories indicates that the methodology is promising for simulating interstellar ice
photoprocessing. This new computational method, focusing on non-diffusive reactions for radicals
and suprathermal species, results in improved agreement with experimental data compared to tech-
niques that rely on bulk thermal radical diffusion, an unlikely mechanism at the exceedingly low
temperatures of cold cores. Ultimately it would be fruitful to incorporate these types of rate-based
photoprocessing calculations into models that account for atom addition, gas-phase reactions, and
cosmic-ray bombardment. Such models, together with observations and laboratory simulations, are
necessary for a fundamental understanding of interstellar chemistry which is the likely source of
prebiotic molecules in the universe."
