ABSTRACT
"In its first encounter at solar distances as close as 𝑟 = 0.16AU, Parker Solar Probe (PSP)
observed numerous local reversals, or inversions, in the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF),
whichwere accompanied by large spikes in solarwind speed. Both solar and in situmechanisms
have been suggested to explain the existence ofHMF inversions in general. Previouswork using
Helios 1, covering 0.3–1AU, observed invertedHMF to becomemore commonwith increasing
𝑟, suggesting that some heliospheric driving process creates or amplifies inversions. This study
expands upon these findings, by analysing inversion-associated changes in plasma properties
for the same large data set, facilitated by observations of ‘strahl’ electrons to identify the
unperturbed magnetic polarity. We find that many inversions exhibit anti-correlated field and
velocity perturbations, and are thus characteristically Alfvénic, but many also depart strongly
from this relationship over an apparent continuum of properties. Inversions depart further
from the ‘ideal’ Alfvénic case with increasing 𝑟 , as more energy is partitioned in the field,
rather than the plasma, component of the perturbation. This departure is greatest for inversions
with larger density and magnetic field strength changes, and characteristic slow solar wind
properties. We find no evidence that inversions which stray further from ‘ideal’ Alfvénicity
have different generation processes from those which are more Alfvénic. Instead, different
inversion properties could be imprinted based on transport or formation within different solar
wind streams.

1 INTRODUCTION
"‘Inversions’ in the polarity of the heliosphericmagnetic field (HMF)
occur when a magnetic flux tube has observed polarity opposite to
that where it connects back to the Sun. Inversions can occur when
the field becomes locally reversed, and have been observed across a
range of heliospheric distances and latitudes, with durations ranging
from minutes to longer than a day (e.g., Kahler & Lin 1994; Balogh
et al. 1999; Crooker et al. 2004; Yamauchi et al. 2004;Matteini et al.
2013; Owens et al. 2020). Parker Solar Probe (PSP, Fox et al. 2016)
observations of inversions close to the Sun have renewed interest
in their origin and evolution. PSP found magnetic inversions to
be ubiquitous in the inner (down to 0.16AU) heliosphere. These
inversion durations range from some seconds to hours (Dudok de
Wit et al. 2020). The change in the field orientation is matched with
an oppositely-directed spike in the bulk velocity (Bale et al. 2019;
Kasper et al. 2019). The anti-correlated field and velocity change,
as well as the relatively stable density and magnetic field strength,
during these inversions suggests that they are Alfvénic, and the"

"anti-sunward spike in velocity indicates outward propagation. These
Alfvénic magnetic inversions are often referred to as ‘switchbacks’
(however this term is also at times used more broadly as a synonym
of magnetic inversion). Alfvénicity has also been noted as a key
characteristic of inversions observed in the fast solar wind elsewhere
in the heliosphere, e.g., at 0.3AU (Horbury et al. 2018) and >1AU
(Matteini et al. 2013)."
"The origins of magnetic inversions are not well understood
and may provide insight into the processes which generate the solar
wind. Following the opening of a coronal magnetic loop through
interchange reconnection (a key process in many solar wind mod-
els Fisk 2003; Antiochos et al. 2011), the newly-opened magnetic
flux tube will have an S-shaped kink embedded within it (see e.g.,
Figure 1 of Crooker et al. 2002). This kinked magnetic structure
propagates upwards through the corona at approximately the local
Alfvén speed. Different modelling approaches have demonstrated
that these kinks may survive to reach solar distances observable by
PSP (Zank et al. 2020) or further (Tenerani et al. 2020) as magnetic
inversions. This model for inversion formation has been applied in
the past to use inversions as a solar wind tracer of coronal reconnec-
tion (e.g., Crooker et al. 2002, 2004; Owens et al. 2013). Recently,"

"the ubiquity of PSP switchbacks has been cited as evidence sup-
portive of the interchange model of the solar wind (Fisk & Kasper
2020)."
"Rather than being initially created at the Sun, inversions in the
HMF could form as a result of numerous in situ processes during
solar wind transport between the Sun and the observer. Modelling
by Squire et al. (2020) has demonstrated that switchbacks could
gradually develop in the solar wind as a result of the growth of
Alfvénic turbulent fluctuations due to solar wind expansion. Earlier
work by Landi et al. (2005, 2006) showed that velocity shears can
sufficiently distort the field to form inversions through interaction
with outward-propagating large scale Alfvén waves (i.e., low fre-
quency Alfvénic turbulence) which create a misalignment between
the radial solar wind flow and the magnetic field direction."
"The large scale structure of the solar wind has also been ex-
plored as a mechanism for in situ inversion generation. Similar to
the model of Landi et al. (2006), Owens et al. (2018, 2020) describe
how magnetic flux tubes threaded by solar wind speed shears can
form inversions at the location of the shear, due to the flux tube
convecting radially at different speeds along its length. This process
can also be related to solar wind formation processes, as such shears
along a flux tube can arise as a result of interchange reconnection
at the tube’s footpoint, leading to a time variation in the plasma
source at the flux-tube base. Owens et al. (2020) found evidence
for such a formation process from analysis of large scale (duration
> 0.3 days) inversions at 1AU, which were found to statistically
coincide with both velocity shears, and changes in heavy ion com-
position - a signature of connectivity to different source regions.
Inversions could also be driven through the draping of the HMF
over ejecta associated with solar wind transients such as interplan-
etary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) or plasma blobs (Lockwood
et al. 2019). The above driving of inversions through distortion by
streams and structures cannot be expected to produce inversions for
which a typical Alfvénic field and flow correlation exists. Stream
shear will produce a structured velocity field at the inversion, while
draping will involve compression."
"Macneil et al. (2020b) performed a statistical study of inverted
HMF occurrence using data from theHelios 1 spacecraft. They used
the direction of the suprathermal beam of electrons known as the
‘strahl’, which predominantly travels away from the Sun along the
HMF (Feldman et al. 1975; Hammond et al. 1996; Pierrard et al.
2001) to discriminate between locally inverted HMF and true sector
reversals. The primary result of this study was that the occurrence
of inverted HMF increases between 0.3 and 1AU. If inversions
generated at the Sun tend to naturally decay with distance, then this
result supports the view that a significant fraction of inversions are
actively driven in the heliosphere, possibly by one or more of the
processes discussed above. Velocity shears (Landi et al. 2006) or
other in situ processes could also be acting to amplify inversions
which are generated at the Sun, contributing to this trend. As a
corollary, since this trend is only reported between 0.3 and 1AU, it
is thus possible that inversions observed within 0.3AU by PSP may
have different causes to those found at 0.3–1AU."
"A further result of Macneil et al. (2020b) was that inversions
did not exhibit a particular bias in the direction of deflection of
the azimuthal magnetic field. For this reason, a driving process
such as turbulence was favoured as an explanation for the increase
in inverted HMF. However, subject to a range of caveats, other
processes could still reasonably contribute. Recent studies on the
near-Sun switchbacks observed by PSP indicate that they occur in
clusters (Dudok de Wit et al. 2020), within which the deflections"
"tend to be in the same direction (Horbury et al. 2020), suggesting a
coronal origin is more likely for those inversions."
"PSP-observed switchbacks are mostly Alfvénic disturbances,
exhibiting correlated velocity and magnetic field variation, which
propagate along the field in the anti-sunward direction. For an
Alfvénic fluctuation:"
𝛿v = ±𝛼𝛿B (1)
"where 𝛼 =
√
𝑟𝐴𝑣𝐴/𝐵0, 𝑟𝐴 is the Alfvén ratio (the ratio of kinetic to"
"magnetic energy in the fluctuations), 𝑣𝐴 is the local Alfvén speed,
and 𝐵0 is the magnitude of the unperturbed magnetic field (e.g.,
Matteini et al. 2013; Horbury et al. 2018). In the solar wind, 𝑟𝐴 is
typically < 1. 𝑟𝐴 decreases with solar distance in the inner helio-
sphere, reaching around 0.4–0.5 for fast wind and around 0.25 for
slow wind near 1AU, with a degree of spread (Marsch & Tu 1990;
Bruno & Carbone 2005; Borovsky 2012). The ‘+’ sign in Equation
1 applies for inward HMF sectors, and the ‘−’ sign for outward sec-
tors, for fluctuations that propagate in the anti-sunward direction.
In Section 2.2, we rectify the observations such that the outward
sector case applies at all times, and so we continue using only the
‘−’ form of this expression. Assuming that |𝐵| = 𝐵0 throughout the
fluctuation (i.e., the field vector is rotating on a spherical surface),
then 𝛿v can be expressed as a function of the deflection angle of
the field. If we further assume this rotation to lie in the 𝑅–𝑇 plane
(in RTN coordinates) then the field rotation will take the form of an
azimuthal deflection; Δ𝜙. For the purpose of this study, |Δ𝜙 | > 90°
indicates inverted HMF, as this is the threshold beyond which the
field is directed opposite to its unperturbed direction. Assuming
that the unperturbed field orientation is the nominal Parker spiral
direction, then Δ𝜙 = Δ𝜙𝑃 ≡ 𝜙 − 𝜙P, where 𝜙 is the azimuthal field
angle, and 𝜙𝑃 is the Parker spiral angle. The change in the velocity
component parallel to the nominal Parker spiral direction, 𝑣 ‖ , is
then"
"𝛿𝑣 ‖ =
√
𝑟𝐴𝑣𝐴[1 − cos(Δ𝜙𝑃)], (2)"
"and the component orthogonal to the Parker spiral direction in the
𝑅-𝑇 plane is"
"𝛿𝑣⊥ = −
√
𝑟𝐴𝑣𝐴 sin(Δ𝜙𝑃). (3)"
"Equation 2 can be understood intuitively by noting that when B
initially follows the Parker spiral direction, any |Δ𝜙𝑃 | > 0 is a de-
crease in the Parker spiral component of B (as long as its magnitude
is constant). Given Equation 1, this must then produce an increase
in the corresponding velocity component, 𝑣 ‖ . In cases where the
ideal Parker spiral does not adequately describe the background
magnetic field (i.e., there is an angular offset between the true back-
ground field angle 𝜙0 and 𝜙𝑃) the estimated values of bothΔ𝜙𝑃 and
𝛿𝑣 ‖ (⊥) will be altered. The impact of this on attempts to characterise
Alfvénic inversions are assessed in Appendix A."
"Alfvénicity is a key observational feature of inversions, particu-
larly for the near-Sun switchbacks observed by PSP.More generally,
the relationship between field and velocity perturbation during in-
versions is useful to investigate in detail, given that some suggested
mechanisms for generating inversions above will not necessarily
produce an Alfvénic relation. Alfvénic inversions were shown to
exist in fast solar wind in the inner portion of the Helios orbit
(around 0.3AU) by Horbury et al. (2018), and in high-latitude fast
wind at distances>1AU byMatteini et al. (2013), but further insight
on inversion properties over a continuous range of distances and in
other solar wind conditions can still be extracted from the Helios
data set. In this paper we extend this work and the work of Macneil
et al. (2020b); performing analysis of changes in proton velocity,"

"density, and magnetic field magnitude as a function of magnetic
field azimuthal deflection. We do so over the full time range of
the Helios 1 data set, enabled by the magnetic sector information
provided by the strahl. This allows us to analyse how the Alfvénic,
or otherwise, nature of magnetic inversions changes with distance
from the Sun, and for different solar wind conditions. Section 2
describes the Helios 1 data used in this study, and the methodology
for identifying inverted HMF and calculating the deflection angle.
Section 3 describes the results, which are discussed in the context
of the production of HMF inversions in Section 4. We draw con-
clusions in Section 5. Two appendices are included which report on
additional details of the methodology."
2 DATA AND METHODOLOGY
2.1 Helios Data
"We use data from Helios 1, covering a distance range of 0.3–1AU,
over the years 1974–1981. The data and methodology sections of
Macneil et al. (2020a,b) describe this data in detail, and we sum-
marise here. Electron and proton data for the study are obtained
on 40 s cadence from the Helios Plasma Experiment (E1). Proton
measurements were made with the E1-I1 ion instrument. We use
fitted moments of the proton velocity distribution function (VDF)
from the reanalysed Helios ‘corefit’ data set (Stansby et al. 2018).
Electron VDFmeasurements were made with the E1-I2 electron in-
strument. Vectormagnetic field data from theHeliosMagnetic Field
Experiment (E2) are time-averaged to the same 40 s cadence, and
combined with the electron VDFs to produce electron pitch angle
distributions (PADs) from which the strahl direction is extracted to
identify the HMF morphology (details of the processing to produce
the PADs can be found in Macneil et al. 2020a)."
"Removal of a portion of the data from our study is necessary
because the limited field of view of E1-I2 regularly causes the main
component of the strahl electron beam to fall outside of the detector
aperture. We follow the same removal of data described in Macneil
et al. (2020b) (adapted from methods in Maksimovic et al. 2005;
Štverák et al. 2009); discarding samples where the out-of-ecliptic
magnetic field component, 𝐵𝑧 , is large relative to the total field
magnitude 𝐵: 𝐵𝑧/𝐵 > 0.156. We also exclude a further portion of
data where properties of the electron PADs do not allow a strahl
direction to be determined (details in Macneil et al. 2020a)."
2.2 Inversion Identification and HMF Deflection Angle
"In typical solar wind conditions, strahl electrons travel anti-sunward
along the field. Intervals where the strahl instead travels sunward
are thus identifiable as local HMF inversions. We determine the
strahl orientation for each electron PAD using the method detailed
in Macneil et al. (2020a), which also identifies instances of bidirec-
tional strahl and strahl drop outs which we then remove from this
study. Since the unperturbed HMF follows the Parker spiral, unin-
verted HMF which is positive (negative) relative to the expected
Parker spiral direction will have a parallel (anti-parallel) oriented
strahl beam. Inverted HMF which is positive (negative) along the
expected Parker spiral direction will have anti-parallel (parallel)
strahl. This information, summarised in Figure 1 of Macneil et al.
(2020b), is used to tentatively classify all HMF samples which have
a detectablemono-directional strahl as either uninverted or inverted."
"To mitigate the effect of possibly mis-identified inverted HMF
on our results, we apply a further restriction on the samples which"
"are categorised as inverted based on the above strahl procedure. This
is motivated by the existence of a subset of inverted HMF samples
which show evidence of mis-identification, detailed in Appendix B.
To remove these, we select for inverted HMF which takes the form
of a clear deviation from the background magnetic field direction,
i.e., a temporary reversal in the field. We do so by computing the
magnetic field component along the nominal Parker spiral direction,
𝐵𝑃 , for all samples in a 12 hr window centred on each tentative
inverted HMF sample. We use a 12 hr window to match that used
to characterise the background solar wind in the majority of the
results below. For each window, we compute the modal value of 𝐵𝑃 ;
𝑀𝐵𝑃 . Tentative inverted samples are only considered to be local
inversions, and thus preserved in this study, if they have the opposite
polarity to 𝑀𝐵𝑃 . A similar method of inversion identification is
used in place of strahl measurements by e.g., Badman et al. (2020).
Tentative inverted samples where 𝐵𝑃 has the same polarity as𝑀𝐵𝑃
are discarded from the study. This restriction effectively removes the
set of inverted HMF samples which are likely to be falsely-identified
inversions. A consequence of this procedure is that inverted HMF
which does not take the form of a deviation from a clearly-defined
backgroundmagnetic field (such as large scale inversions, inversions
which occur near the heliospheric current sheet, or inversions which
are indicated by only strahl and not a magnetic field deflection)
are also removed. It is difficult to disentangle these real inversions
from the falsely identified ones, so we take the cautious approach
of removing them all. Following these steps, a total of 5620 valid
inverted HMF samples remain, out of 197972 valid samples overall.
Results and conclusions of this study thus specifically apply to
inverted HMF which takes the form of a temporary reversal relative
to the background magnetic field. Consequences of this restriction
are discussed further in Section 4.1 and Appendix B."
"Having classified samples into inverted and uninverted HMF,
we produce estimates of Δ𝜙𝑃 from Section 1 by subtracting the
HMF azimuthal angle, 𝜙, from the nominal Parker spiral direction.
We rectify Δ𝜙𝑃 by 180° for any samples with anti-parallel strahl,
since uninverted HMF with this strahl alignment will belong to the
negative magnetic sector. Thus, assuming a perfect Parker spiral,
all unperturbed field will have Δ𝜙𝑃 = 0°, and all inverted field will
have |Δ𝜙𝑃 | > 90°. This approach allows us to study relationships
between plasma properties and deflection angle, even for inversions,
for which the deflection angle would be ambiguous at |Δ𝜙𝑃 | > 90°
without rectification. This step is what enables the analysis of the
entire Helios 1 data set, without splitting into individual streams or
sectors."
3 RESULTS
"As described above, HMF inversions are often accompanied by a
spike in solar wind velocity, which for an Alfvénic perturbation
will occur in the velocity component parallel to the unperturbed
magnetic field, 𝑣 ‖ . We compute 𝑣 ‖ as the component of the proton
velocity vector projected on to the nominal Parker spiral direction.
We compute differences between a 1 hr rolling averaged 𝑣 ‖ , centred
on a time 𝑡, 〈𝑣 ‖〉1 hr (𝑡), and the result of the same averaging process
for 𝑣 ‖ centred on the hour before and after:"
𝛿𝑣 ‖± (𝑡) = 〈𝑣 ‖〉1 hr (𝑡) − 〈𝑣 ‖〉1 hr (𝑡 ± 1 hr). (4)
"Comparing consecutive hourly averages will smear out enhance-
ments which have duration less than tens of minutes, or greater
than 2 hours. We use an hourly average as a compromise between
capturing smaller scale or shorter duration changes in velocity and"

"reducing the noise in the result which comes from a shorter average.
Data are classified based upon the sign of 𝛿𝑣 ‖+ (𝑡) and 𝛿𝑣 ‖− (𝑡). The
occurrence is shown as 2-dimensional histograms in Figure 1. We
display histograms for all samples, and for inverted HMF separately,
for three radial distance bins centred on 𝑟 = 0.39, 0.65, and 0.90AU.
The histograms have one velocity bin in each 𝛿𝑣 ‖+–𝛿𝑣 ‖− quadrant,
such that each is analogous to a contingency table. A schematic to
the left of the figure illustrates the time series profile of 𝑣 ‖ which is
indicated by each quadrant of the table. These are (clockwise from
top left) declining, temporary spike, increasing, and temporary dip.
We have excluded data for which |𝛿𝑣 ‖±/𝑣𝐴 | ≤ 10−3, where 𝑣𝐴
is the local Alfvén speed, such that small changes in velocity are
considered to be zero, and not included. This procedure removes
between 0.5–1.5% of the relevant data points for the inverted HMF
histograms, but makes little difference as to the relative proportions
in each quadrant."
"The 𝛿𝑣 ‖± contingency tables for all valid samples are shown in
the top row of Figure 1. The declining velocity quadrant is the most
common at all distances, which is consistent with the overall declin-
ing velocity profile of the solar wind due to rarefactions (see e.g.,
Gosling & Pizzo 1999). The least common quadrant corresponds to
increasing velocity, which we expect for the same reason. Contrast
these results with the 𝛿𝑣 ‖± contingency tables for locally inverted
HMF. At all distances, the velocity spike quadrant corresponds to
over half of the samples. The increase in the velocity spike quadrant
in comparison to the uninverted case comes at the expense of all
velocity quadrants. The declining quadrant in the middle distance
bin for inverted samples is noticeably greater than that for the other
distance bins. This irregularity may be a result of some sampling
effect, since the middle bin has the fewest samples. Through this
section, the middle distance bin will often show some degree of
discrepancy relative to the other two, more well-populated, bins."
"The clear velocity spike signal for inversions is quite remark-
able given the point noted above regarding the inversion duration.
The prevalence of these spikes seenwith the±1 hr differencemethod
indicates that a number of these inversions have velocity spikes"
"which are resolvable on hourly scales. Estimating 𝛿𝑣± using larger
rolling average windows and time offsets (up to 12 hours) in Equa-
tion 4 produces results consistent with those above. While the de-
clining quadrants in each histogram become more prominent, an
enhancement in the velocity spike sector is present for the inverted
HMF histograms, in the two innermost distance bins, over their un-
inverted counterparts. The histogram for the outer distance bin is
the first to lose the clear spike signature as the averaging and offset
times are increased."
"Figure 1 shows that inversions preferentially feature a spike in
velocity along the Parker spiral direction. However, it does not give
insight into themagnitude of the spike, or how it relates to the degree
of deflection of the field. To address this, we define the values 𝛿𝑣 ‖
and 𝛿𝑣⊥ by subtracting rolling averages of 𝑣 ‖ and 𝑣⊥, calculated
within a given time window, from the 40 s data. 𝑣⊥ is computed
as the velocity component orthogonal to the nominal Parker spiral
direction in the 𝑅-𝑇 plane. We use the following general formula to
compute 𝛿𝑣 ‖ and 𝛿𝑣⊥:"
𝛿𝑋 = 𝑋40 s − 〈𝑋〉Yhr (5)
"for parameter 𝑋 , where𝑌 is the duration of the averaging window in
hours. The averagingwindow is centred on the time stamp of the 40 s
observation. A 12 hr average is used here, roughly corresponding
to the expected large scale solar wind structure duration. Results
are qualitatively similar for other values of 𝑌 . 𝛿𝑣 ‖ and 𝛿𝑣⊥ are then
normalised by the mean Alfvén speed over the same time window:"
"〈𝑣𝐴〉Yhr =

"𝐵

"The use of 40 s data to estimate 𝛿𝑣 ‖ (⊥) implicitly limits the scope of
results acquired with this method to inversions with duration around
this time scale or greater. Conversely, the 12 hr averaging time for
the background velocity is effective for inversions of duration <6 hr."

plotted are theoretical values of 𝛿𝑣 ‖ and 𝛿𝑣⊥ as a function of Δ𝜙𝑃 ,

Equations 2 and 3. The values of"

𝑟𝐴 (which effectively controls"
"the amplitudes of the Alfvénic lines) are 0.7, 0.6, and 0.5 (corre-
sponding to 𝑟𝐴 ' 0.48, 0.36, and 0.25), for the 𝑟 = 0.39, 0.65,
and 0.90AU distance bins, respectively. These values are chosen
by inspection to best agree with the data across all values of Δ𝜙𝑃 ,
as minimising fits to the data is strongly biased towards the high
data occurrence near Δ𝜙𝑃 = 0. These curves thus only serve for
illustrative purposes. Note that the chosen values of 𝑟𝐴 are not en-
tirely arbitrary, since typically 𝑟𝐴 < 1 in the solar wind and 𝑟𝐴 is
observed to decrease with distance (Marsch & Tu 1990; Bruno &
Carbone 2005)."
"𝛿𝑣 ‖/𝑣𝐴 data follows the general trend illustrated by the
Alfvénic line; larger deflections of the magnetic field from the
Parker spiral direction correspond to greater enhancements in 𝑣 ‖
relative to the unperturbed value (i.e., the rolling mean). This trend
is clearest in the two innermost distance bins. 𝛿𝑣 ‖/𝑣𝐴 is roughly
bound between a lower value just below zero, and an upper value
which traces the chosen Alfvénic lines. In the outermost distance
bin, the spread of 𝛿𝑣 ‖/𝑣𝐴 is generally greater, and a larger portion
of the samples have 𝛿𝑣 ‖/𝑣𝐴 which falls below the Alfvénic line."
"Samples for which |Δ𝜙𝑃 | > 90° (roughly the inverted HMF
cut off) obey similar trends to those where |Δ𝜙𝑃 | < 90°. The
one dimensional histograms of 𝛿𝑣 ‖ (located to the right of each"
"panel) show that 𝛿𝑣 ‖ is approximately centred around zero for the
uninverted samples (blue), but is skewed towards positive values for
the inverted samples (orange) as a result of the trend for increasing
𝛿𝑣 ‖/𝑣𝐴 with increasing |Δ𝜙𝑃 |."
"𝛿𝑣⊥/𝑣𝐴 also exhibits trends with Δ𝜙𝑃 . Most notably there
tends to be 𝛿𝑣⊥/𝑣𝐴 > 0 (< 0) for Δ𝜙𝑃 > 0 (Δ𝜙𝑃 < 0). This is
clearest with the least spread for the innermost distance bin. The
spread of 𝛿𝑣⊥/𝑣𝐴 about the Alfvénic lines appears wider than for
Δ𝜙𝑃 , and in each sector the Alfvénic line does not appear to be
as effective an upper bound (although note these histograms have
different 𝑦-axis scales). There is also greater asymmetry in the
positive and negative Δ𝜙𝑃 sectors of the histograms."
"For each distance bin, we plot in Figure 3 histograms of the
difference between the measured values of 𝛿𝑣 ‖ (again with 12 hr
averaging in Equation 6) and the respective chosen Alfvénic lines
in Figure 2 (𝛿𝑣 ‖theory; the theoretical result of Equation 2 for the
appropriate value of Δ𝜙𝑃 and prescribed 𝑟𝐴). This serves for a
qualitative analysis, since our chosen values of 𝑟𝐴 can not be correct
for all samples in each distance bin."
"For all distances in Figure 3, uninverted samples have
(𝛿𝑣 ‖12hr − 𝛿𝑣 ‖theory)/𝑣𝐴 concentrated about zero, and skewing
slightly negative. This reflects the tendency for samples shown in
Figure 2 to follow, and fall just below, the Alfvénic lines, which for
uninverted samples are close to zero. The distributions for inverted
samples in Figure 3 have a larger negative extension than for the
uninverted samples. Despite this, they also extend to roughly the
same positive level as for the uninverted samples. This result again
shows 𝛿𝑣 ‖12hr to be roughly bound between chosen Alfvénic lines"

a combination of factors, including the individual values of 𝑟𝐴 and
the distributions of Δ𝜙𝑃 in each distance bin."
3.1 Separation by Collisional Age
"To test whether background solar wind conditions have a bearing
on inversion properties, proton collisional age, 𝐴𝑐 , can be used
to classify the solar wind as an alternative to solar wind speed.
Traditionally ‘slow’ solar wind tends to a higher collisional age
(e.g., Figure 2 of Kasper et al. 2008) than the ‘fast’ solar wind. 𝐴𝑐
expresses the number of collisional time scales, 𝜏, which elapse
over the course of the solar wind’s propagation to the observer:"
"𝐴𝑐 =
𝑟"
"𝑣𝑟 𝜏
(7)"
"where 𝑣𝑟 is the proton radial velocity. This formulation assumes the
solar wind speed and the collision time is constant over all distances.
Here we employ the proton self-collisional age from Maruca et al.

"The inclusion of other parameters in calculating 𝐴𝑐 allows for an
alternative classification to using solar wind speed alone, which has
been found at times to not clearly separate solar wind intervals of
different solar origin (e.g., Stansby et al. 2020), and may bias our
results since it is an important factor in computing 𝛿𝑣 ‖ . Splitting the
Helios data into further groups in this way may increase the clarity
of trends which we infer from e.g., Figure 2, since variable factors
should be more consistent for similar solar wind streams."
"To employ 𝐴𝑐 as an indicator of solar wind type, we choose
thresholds with which to split the data based on the lower and
upper quartile values of 𝐴𝑐 observed in each distance bin. Since we
are only comparing 𝐴𝑐 within individual bins, we shall refer to the
samples which fall below the lower (exceed the upper) quartile value
as low (high) ‘relative’ collisional age. By construction, the low and
high relative collisional age samples make up the same proportion
of samples in each distance bin. This ensures a classification which"
"is relatively consistent with distance, since the distribution of solar
wind type should not change strongly with 𝑟 (excluding the effects
of interaction regions)."
"Figure 4 displays histograms of 𝛿𝑣 ‖/𝑣𝐴 and 𝛿𝑣⊥/𝑣𝐴 similar
to Figure 2, but for only those solar wind samples with low relative
𝐴𝑐 , per the above definition. We again plot the Alfvénic lines from
Equations 2 and 3, using the same values of 𝑟𝐴. The histograms of
Δ𝜙𝑃 show a deal of asymmetry for inverted and uninverted flux,
which is probably a result of the reduction in number of samples due
to further splitting the data. Overall, 𝛿𝑣 ‖/𝑣𝐴 and 𝛿𝑣⊥/𝑣𝐴 data in
Figure 4 track the Alfvénic lines remarkably closely in comparison
to the data set as a whole, shown in Figure 2. The 1-dimensional
histograms of 𝛿𝑣 ‖/𝑣𝐴 show that very few samples fall near 𝛿𝑣 ‖ = 0
for invertedHMF.While in all bins theAlfvénic relationship is clear,
𝛿𝑣 ‖/𝑣𝐴 and 𝛿𝑣⊥/𝑣𝐴 both become more spread out with increasing
distance from the Sun."
"Figure 5 follows the same format as Figure 4 but for high
relative 𝐴𝑐 values in each distance bin. In general 𝛿𝑣 ‖ is more
spread out at all angles, but with some correlation with Δ𝜙𝑃 found
at the larger angles. The data here do not follow the Alfvénic lines
as closely as the full data in Figure 2 or the low relative 𝐴𝑐 data in
Figure 4; 𝛿𝑣 ‖ and 𝛿𝑣⊥ both more commonly fall below. This may
be related to the lower 𝑟𝐴 which is characteristic of the slow solar
wind (Marsch & Tu 1990; Bruno & Carbone 2005). Additionally,
more samples are found around 𝛿𝑣 ‖ = 0 than for the low relative 𝐴𝑐
data. 𝛿𝑣⊥, however, is still predominantly > 0 (< 0) for Δ𝜙𝑃 < 0
(> 0). We also note that the number of inverted HMF samples in
the high relative 𝐴𝑐 quartile of data is in all bins greater than the
number in the low relative 𝐴𝑐 quartile."
3.2 Variations in Density and Field Strength
"We now explore the changes in plasma density and magnetic field
intensity associated with these inversions. Figure 6 plots 𝛿𝑛/〈𝑛〉, the
normalised difference between proton density for a given sample
and the 12 hr running average calculated per Equation 6, against
Δ𝜙𝑃 , in the same form as the first row of Figure 2. Generally
𝛿𝑛/〈𝑛〉 exhibits greater spread at larger |Δ𝜙𝑃 |. The one dimensional
histograms to the side of each plot show that 𝛿𝑛/〈𝑛〉 for uninverted
HMF is approximately centred on zero. Conversely, for inverted
HMF 𝛿𝑛/〈𝑛〉 is skewed slightly positive. Inverted HMF samples
thus tend to have slightly larger changes in density than uninverted
samples, and these changes in density tend towards being increases.
One exception to this is at Δ𝜙𝑃 & 120° in the inner distance bin,"

we compute root median square (RMedS) values of 𝛿𝑛/〈𝑛〉, to
compare the characteristic size of 𝛿𝑛/〈𝑛〉 for inverted and uninverted
data. RMedS values for uninverted (inverted) HMF samples are in
the ranges 0.21–0.22 (0.25–0.29) for each radial bin, confirming
the slightly larger changes in density associated with larger HMF

boldface here represents the magnitude of the magnetic field vector:

verted HMF samples. For uninverted samples 𝛿𝐵/〈𝐵〉 is centred
around zero, while for inverted samples it skews towards negative
values. Note that 𝛿𝐵/〈𝐵〉 for inverted samples in the central distance
bin is distributed quite irregularly, with values at positive and nega-
tive extremes for the Δ𝜙 > 90° sector. Weak decreases in 𝐵 during
inversions were observed in several of the switchbacks observed by
PSP (Figure 2a of Bale et al. 2019). RMedS values of 𝛿𝐵/〈𝐵〉 in
uninverted (inverted) HMF samples range 0.06–0.09 (0.11–0.13).
The typical change in magnetic field magnitude during inversions
is thus slightly larger than that at other times."
"We further investigate the association between 𝛿𝑛/〈𝑛〉 and
𝛿𝐵/〈𝐵〉, and the Alfvénic 𝛿v-𝛿B relationships reported above. To
do so we split the data in each distance bin into upper and lower
quartiles of |𝛿𝑛/〈𝑛〉| and |𝛿𝐵/〈𝐵〉|, and reproduce the 𝛿𝑣 ‖/𝑣𝐴 his-
tograms of Figure 2 for each subset of data. These are shown for
|𝛿𝑛/〈𝑛〉| in Figure 8 and |𝛿𝐵/〈𝐵〉| in Figure 9. The sets of histograms
generated using the data within the lower quartiles of |𝛿𝑛/〈𝑛〉| and
|𝛿𝐵/〈𝐵〉| (top rows of each figure) generally follow the illustrative
Alfvénic lines reasonably closely. The inner distance bin for low
|𝛿𝐵/〈𝐵〉| exhibits the Alfvénic relationship particularly clearly. The
𝛿𝑣 ‖/𝑣𝐴-Δ𝜙𝑃 relationships here are in general quite similar to the
low relative 𝐴𝑐 data."
"The histograms generated using the data within the upper quar-
tiles of 𝛿𝑛/〈𝑛〉 and 𝛿𝐵/〈𝐵〉 (bottom rows of each figure) have a far
greater spread, mostly below the Alfvénic lines. However, there is
still a visible trend of increasing 𝛿𝑣 ‖/𝑣𝐴 with increasing |Δ𝜙𝑃 |. In
the outer distance bin, the data within the upper quartiles of |𝛿𝑛/〈𝑛〉|
and |𝛿𝐵/〈𝐵〉| values (bottom-right histograms of Figures 8) show
the weakest trends. The 1-dimensional histograms of 𝛿𝑣 ‖ on the
right hand side of these panels show that the inverted HMF samples"
"have a considerable component which falls near 𝛿𝑣 ‖ = 0. These re-
sults show differences in the 𝛿v-𝛿B relationship are associated with
𝛿𝑛/〈𝑛〉 (and 𝛿𝐵/〈𝐵〉), or the compressibility associated with the
fluctuation. There is possible weak bias in this analysis, since larger
|𝛿𝑛/〈𝑛〉| and |𝛿𝐵/〈𝐵〉| are associated with slightly greater Δ𝜙𝑃 for
inversions (as shown by the 1-dimensional Δ𝜙𝑃 histograms above
each panel)."
4 DISCUSSION
4.1 Limitations and Caveats for Results
"Several factors are important for a nuanced interpretation of this
study’s results. First, because inversions exist on a range of scales
(Matteini et al. 2013; Owens et al. 2020; Dudok de Wit et al. 2020)
there is no one ideal time scale for this analysis. Thus our results
here reflect the available minimum 40 s time resolution and chosen
averaging times in Equations 4 and 6. We have produced Figure 2,
from which we first recovered 𝛿v-𝛿B relationships, using 1, 4, 12,
and 24 hr averages for the background, and find that 12 hours best
exhibits the Alfvénic trend with least spread, although it is present
for all time scales."
"Due to field of view limitations of the Helios E1 instrument
we impose a condition in Section 2 (detailed in Macneil et al.
2020a) which excludes HMF samples with large non-azimuthal
field components. A consequence of this is that only those large
field deflections which are aligned roughly within the 𝑅-𝑇 plane
are considered in this study. Our results thus strictly only apply
for inversions which occur through azimuthal field deflections. This
aspect of the analysis likely contributes to the clarity of the Alfvénic
trend as seen in e.g., Figure 2, since the derivation of Equation 2
assumes that the field rotates only in the azimuthal plane."
"Δ𝜙𝑃 represents the magnetic field azimuthal deflection angle
away from the ideal Parker spiral direction. Analysis using Δ𝜙𝑃
assumes that the unperturbed magnetic field direction, 𝜙0, is well-
represented by the Parker spiral angle 𝜙𝑃 . Employing rolling aver-
ages to instead estimate the background field would be problematic
for this study, since local magnetic inversions strongly perturb the
field and will influence such averages. Offsets between 𝜙0 and 𝜙𝑃
will lead to an additional spread in 𝛿𝑣 ‖ (⊥) for an otherwise ideal"

"Alfvénic fluctuation, as demonstrated through modelling in Ap-
pendix A. If the errors in field angle are statistically symmetric,
this will lead to a spread in 𝛿𝑣 ‖ which extends more below the true
Alfvénic relationship than above.Meanwhile, the error in 𝛿𝑣⊥would
manifest in a more even spread above and below the Alfvénic line,
but which is greater for larger field deflections. Both of these are
roughly compatible with the observed spreads in 𝛿𝑣 ‖ (⊥) . Conclu-"
"sions regarding the overall spread in these parametersmust therefore
recognise this contribution."
"Section 2 details the additional step taken in classifying in-
verted HMF, in which we discard samples which appear to be
inverted based on electron PADs, but do not possess the non-
dominant field polarity in a rolling 12 hr window. This removes
a sub-population of inversions which were possibly mis-identified"

"based on strahl alone. As highlighted in Appendix B, this procedure
will also remove inversions which occur near a sector boundary,
occur in bursts, or are large in size. Removing these inversions may
have a knock-on effect for our results, since they would all be likely
to appear non-Alfvénic when comparing e.g., 𝛿𝑣 ‖ to Δ𝜙𝑃 . This
is because of difficulties in estimating an accurate background ve-
locity under these conditions, in addition to the possibility of such
inversions, particularly those near the HCS, being non-Alfvénic.
Large scale inverted HMF which is embedded in the solar wind and
so does not produce a local deflection in the field (e.g., Crooker
et al. 2004) will also be removed by this method. Thus, the conclu-
sions drawn below only apply for inversions which take the form of
clearly-defined, transient, field deflections. This likely contributes
to the clarity of the relationships found in the previous section."
4.2 𝛿v-𝛿B Correlation During Magnetic Inversions
"Results in Figure 2 show that azimuthal departures of the field
from the Parker spiral direction, including large deflections which
constitute HMF inversions, are often accompanied by increases in
the Parker spiral velocity component 𝑣 ‖ . The magnitude of the 𝑣 ‖
increase is such that 𝛿𝑣 ‖ is roughly bound between zero and the
chosen Alfvénic lines. Thus, at greater |Δ𝜙𝑃 |, larger 𝑣 ‖ enhance-
ments are accessible. This, and the observation that 𝛿𝑣⊥ rarely has
the opposite sign to the illustrative Alfvénic lines, indicates that in-
versions studied here commonly propagate anti-sunward along the
background field, and are Alfvénic in nature. For the purpose of this"
"discussion section, we shall consider inversions to be ‘Alfvénic’ if
the deflection which inverts the field is coincident with an anti-
correlated change in the plasma velocity, i.e., as would be shown
in Figure 2. Alfvénic inversions have been observed prior in the
inner portion of the Helios 2 orbit by Horbury et al. (2018). Here
we find clear evidence of Alfvénic inversions, particularly in the
innermost distance bin, but also over the full Helios distance range,
including several years of data, and for a range of solar wind types.
These results agree with the correlation between field azimuthal
angle and velocity enhancement in Ulysses measurements of polar
coronal hole wind > 1AU, as reported by Matteini et al. (2013),
who also demonstrated their Alfvénic nature. Figure 1 shows that
inversions most commonly exhibit a ‘spike’ in their 𝑣 ‖ profile, in
contrast with the overall data which mostly exhibit a decreasing pro-
file. This is also consistent with a majority of these samples being
Alfvénic switchbacks, where the reversal in the field is simultane-
ous with a short-lived velocity enhancement (Horbury et al. 2018;
Bale et al. 2019; Kasper et al. 2019). These spikes are revealed in
hourly-averaged 𝑣 ‖ differences, so Alfvénic profiles of much longer
or shorter duration inversions may be missed in our analysis."
"We consider an ‘ideal’ Alfvénic fluctuation to have 𝑟𝐴 = 1,
indicating energy balance between the magnetic field and plasma
components of the fluctuation. The illustrative Alfvénic lines on
Figure 2 have 𝑟𝐴 < 1, indicating that the energy of such a fluctua-
tion is weighted towards the magnetic field rather than the plasma,
as is typical of the solar wind (Marsch & Tu 1990; Bruno & Car-
bone 2005). A given sample falling below the Alfvénic line, as most"
"MNRAS 000, 1–14 (2020)"
"inverted HMF samples do in Figure 2, indicates that even less of
the energy in the fluctuation is contained in the plasma, and thus
it is further from the ideal Alfvénic case. This may be related to
the properties of the surrounding plasma, or the fluctuation itself.
Independently measuring 𝑟𝐴 to verify this is problematic however,
because it requires quantifying 𝛿v and 𝛿B, which is in essence the
analysis already carried out here. Many inverted HMF samples, par-
ticularly in the outermost distance bin, have 𝛿𝑣 ‖ and/or 𝛿𝑣⊥ very
close to, or just below, zero. For an Alfvénic fluctuation, this would
require extremely small 𝑟𝐴, since Equations 2 and 3 depend on√
𝑟𝐴. The spread in estimated 𝛿𝑣 ‖ due to offsets between 𝜙0 and 𝜙𝑃
may be partially responsible, but this is unlikely at large Δ𝜙𝑃 . Thus
there are some inversions here for which an Alfvénic description is
probably inappropriate (non-Alfvénic). However, there is no clear
cutoff in 𝑟𝐴 below which we can consider the inversion as clearly
non-Alfvénic. These inversions thus exist as fluctuations in a con-
tinuum between non-Alfvénic and Alfvénic (albeit with a dominant
magnetic field component)."
"A reasonable upper bound on 𝛿𝑣 ‖ (⊥) is established using
Alfvénic lines with an 𝑟𝐴 which drops off with 𝑟 (Figure 3 as well as
e.g., Figure 9). Thus, the upper limit of the portion of energy con-
tained in the plasma component of these deflections decreases with
distance, in a roughly linear fashion. (A more dedicated study of the
variation in 𝑟𝐴 would be better suited to quantify this drop-off.) In
this way the inversions depart further from the ideal Alfvénic case
with 𝑟. Decreasing overall Alfvénicity with increasing 𝑟 has been
observed prior over the solar distances considered in this study (e.g.,
Roberts et al. 1987; Bruno et al. 2007), and appears to be consistent
with this observation. If inversions are being formed locally, then
the upper bound on 𝛿𝑣 ‖ is consistent with their forming with energy
partitioning consistent with local 𝑟𝐴. If they are otherwise formed
at the Sun, then the velocity component of the fluctuation decays
more rapidly than that in the field component, in line with 𝑟𝐴 for the
solar wind overall. In the same data set as the present study, Mac-
neil et al. (2020b) observed the greatest fraction of inverted HMF
samples near 1AU, where we find inversions to also be the furthest
from ideally Alfvénic (particularly for high relative collisional age
solar wind). Thus, while inversions commonly follow something
akin to an Alfvénic relationship with Δ𝜙𝑃 , strong Alfvénicity is not
a prerequisite for inversions to exist."
"Considering samples with a low collisional age (𝐴𝑐) relative to
the rest of the distance bin reveals a far clearer Alfvénic relationship
than is found for the data set as a whole. The grouping around
the chosen Alfvénic lines for the inner two distance bins in Figure
4 indicates a consistent 𝑟𝐴. Few inverted HMF samples fall near
𝛿𝑣 ‖ = 0, so an Alfvénic description is appropriate for nearly all of
the studied inversions with low relative collisional age. This could
simply be related to the general Alfvénic nature of the fast solar
wind, which low 𝐴𝑐 proxies for. The increased spread in 𝛿𝑣 ‖ (⊥)
furthest from the Sun may be a result of decreasing Alfvénicity, or
perhaps increased offsets between 𝜙𝑃 and 𝜙0."
"Meanwhile, high relative 𝐴𝑐 samples are far more spread out
in 𝛿𝑣 ‖ , and fall short of the same Alfvénic lines. Particularly in the
outer distance bin, many large field deflections fall near 𝛿𝑣 ‖ = 0,
indicating that Alfvénic character is very weak or absent for such
inversions. This is consistent with the low Alfvénicity associated
with the slow solar wind. It could also be related to a greater de-
gree of solar wind processing, if departures from ideal Alfvénic
properties are here a result of transit effects. Interestingly, there are
more inverted HMF samples with high than low relative collisional
age. This further cements that clear Alfvénic signatures are not a
requirement for inverted HMF to exist."
"Solar wind density (𝑛) and magnetic field intensity (𝐵) do not
change greatly during magnetic inversions, indicating that most of
these inversions are atmost onlyweakly compressible. The tendency
for a slight decrease in 𝐵 during some PSP-observed inversions has
been reported previously by Bale et al. (2019). The weak increase
in 𝑛 may be related to pressure balance structures. Weak com-
pressibility is compatible overall with the established properties of
PSP-observed switchbacks (Bale et al. 2019; Horbury et al. 2020).
From Figures 8 and 9, the spread in 𝛿𝑣 ‖ (⊥) is greater at larger 𝑟
and for larger changes in 𝑛 and 𝐵, such that 𝛿𝑣 ‖ in the outermost
distance bin, for large changes in 𝑛, shows very little enhancement
at larger Δ𝜙𝑃 . This suggests that although most inversions studied
here have low compressibility or are incompressible, higher relative
compressibility is associated with departures from ideal Alfvénic
signatures. The observations of less Alfvénic inversions occurring
in high relative collisional age solar wind are likely linked to this
result, since high collisional age is indicative of typical ‘slow’ solar
wind, which typically possesses more compressive features. A very
clear Alfvénic relationship emerges in Figures 8 and 9 when small
changes in 𝑛, and particularly 𝐵, accompany the inversion. This is
intuitive from the derivation of the Alfvénic 𝛿𝑣 ‖⊥ relationships in
Equations 2 and 3, where constant 𝐵 is an explicit assumption."
"Greater departures from ideal Alfvénicity for inversions with
greater 𝛿𝑛 and 𝛿𝐵, and high relative collisional age, could be ex-
plained on one hand by exposure to compressive structures or fluc-
tuations in the solar wind eroding the characteristic Alfvénic 𝛿v-𝛿B
correlation. Such processing, specifically through magnetic com-
pressibility, has been suggested to be responsible for reduction in
solar wind Alfvénicity as a function of 𝑟 by Bruno & Bavassano
(1991); D’Amicis & Bruno (2015). Under this framework, Alfvénic
and non-Alfvénic inversions could both be formed through similar
processes, such as through interchange reconnection at the Sun, or
growing turbulent fluctuations in the heliosphere (as favoured by
previous analysis of this data set Macneil et al. 2020b). How close
to ideally Alfvénic a given HMF inversion is would then be a result
of its evolution, rather than formation, and linked to the processing
within the surrounding plasma."
"An alternative explanation is that non-Alfvénic inversions
which tend to be more compressible are in fact formed through
a different process to the more Alfvénic inversions. Suitable can-
didate processes for creating non-Alfvénic inversions would be the
draping of the HMF over blobs, or inversion formation in regions of
solar wind shear, where gradients in density and field strength are
more likely present (see Section 1)."
"Of the two above options to explain discrepancies in inversion
Alfvénicity, the results of this study lead us to favour the first; that
variable Alfvénic signatures of inversions are a result of different
solar wind processing, likely related to the presence of compressive
structures or fluctuations. A key reason for this conclusion is that we
find no evidence to suggest that 𝛿𝑣 ‖ studied here does not exist in a
continuumbetween 𝛿𝑣 ‖ ≤ 0 (noAlfvénic signatures) and the chosen
Alfvénic lines, which represent a non-ideal Alfvénic relationship.
The gradual decrease in 𝑟𝐴 (both around the upper boundary of 𝛿𝑣 ‖
and for sampleswhich fall below it) and the increase in overall spread
of 𝛿𝑣 ‖ with heliocentric distance indicates that local effects are
indeed able to shift these inversions further from the ideal Alfvénic
case. Without a second, clearly non-Alfvénic, population which is
visible in the data, the existence of a single generation process for
the inversions included in this study is the simplest explanation for
these data. We stress that this argument applies only to the inverted
samples which take the form of deviations from a well-defined
background field direction, as described in Section 4.1. Some subset"

"of the samples discarded in constructing this data set could be part of
a secondary, entirely non-Alfvénic inversion population. However,
effective analysis of the inversions in this study has precluded the
investigation of this secondary population. Detailed investigation
into the relative prominence of such non-Alfvénic inversions will
require an alternative approach and is left to future work."
5 CONCLUSIONS
"In this study, we have performed an analysis of the evolving rela-
tionship between the deflection angle of the HMF and the change in
several plasma parameters, particularly the proton velocity vector,
over the entireHelios 1 data set, spanning 0.3 to 1AU.We have done
so with a particular focus on magnetic inversions, where the deflec-
tion magnitude is > 90°. This type of analysis is possible because of
the inclusion of strahl alignment as a means of rectifying samples
based onmagnetic sector. A large fraction of inverted HMF samples
exhibit an anti-correlated Alfvénic relationship between 𝛿B and 𝛿v.
This result is in general agreement with magnetic reversals and ve-
locity spikes observed previously both near and far from the Sun
(Matteini et al. 2013; Horbury et al. 2018; Kasper et al. 2019; Bale
et al. 2019). However, our results demonstrate that anti-correlated
𝛿B and 𝛿v for inversions is clear even in solar wind data with min-
imal discrimination by type; likely a result of observing down to
0.3AU with a large statistical data set, and selecting against sam-
ples with a strong non-azimuthal field component. The similarity of
the inversion properties with those observed inside 0.3AU by PSP
suggest the same structures exist over a wide heliocentric distance
range. However, PSP has observed inversions on time scales smaller
than those accessible using the present Helios data set. The promi-
nence of Alfvénic switchbacks in the PSP data may be a result of the
far greater Alfvén speed close to the Sun, which renders the velocity
component far more striking than similarly Alfvénic inversions far
from the Sun (as suggested by e.g., Matteini et al. 2013)."
"Examining the properties of inversions at increasing solar dis-
tance, 𝑟, we find that they depart further from the ‘ideal’ Alfvénic
case of energy balance between magnetic field and plasma further
from the Sun. This persists to the point where many inversions
are not recognisably Alfvénic under certain solar wind conditions,
and when approaching 1AU, indicating that Alfvénicity is not a
universal inversion property. The strongest departures from ideal
Alfvénic properties are observed coincident with larger changes in
𝑛 and 𝐵, indicating enhanced compressibility. We find no clear evi-
dence that inversions which are non-Alfvénic have different origins
to those which are close to ideally Alfvénic. We instead favour the
simple explanation that all inversions included in this study could
be formed by some common process, either locally or at the Sun.
From the conclusions of Macneil et al. (2020b), we favour growing
turbulent fluctuations as such a process. Differences in respective
𝛿B–𝛿v relationships could then arise due to transit effects in dif-
ferent solar wind streams. Entirely non-Alfvénic inversions, which
may exist and be discarded by the cautious analysis procedure in
this study, could be produced through alternative mechanisms. This
topic is left to future work."
"With the return of new in situ plasma composition data from
Solar Orbiter (Müller & St Cyr 2013), analysis of heavy ion compo-
sition within magnetic inversions will for the first time be possible
over a distance range similar to that covered in this study. Composi-
tion could be leveraged to examine whether inversions of different
dynamic properties (e.g., strongly Alfvénic) also have distinct com-
positional features, which would indicate different source locations"
"or processes (see compositional analysis of large scale inversions at
L1 by Owens et al. 2020)."

To estimate the impact on our results, we construct a simple ideal
model of 𝛿𝑣 ‖ (⊥) against Δ𝜙obs (observed Δ𝜙) for a 2-dimensional
Alfvénic fluctuation which obeys Equation 1. Beginning with a
unit magnetic field along 𝜙0, and an unperturbed velocity vector
(Δ𝜙 = 0°), we rotate the field through to Δ𝜙 = ±180° and calculate
the resulting velocity perturbation components 𝛿𝑣 ‖ (⊥)/𝑣𝐴, using
Equation 1 with"

𝑟𝐴 = 0.75. The left column of Figure A1 shows"

mated background field direction is different from the true vector
about which the perturbation is centred. To do so for a given offset
angle 𝜙offset, we take 𝛿𝑣 ‖ (⊥)/𝑣𝐴 as calculated above, and project
these components onto a new background magnetic field vector,
which is rotated by 𝜙offset, such that 𝜙obs = 𝜙0 + 𝜙offset. 𝜙offset > 0
means 𝜙obs > 𝜙0, reflecting an ideal Parker spiral angle which is
more radial than the true background angle."

centile values in steps of 5. These values are chosen as a pessimistic
estimate of the difference between 𝜙𝑃 and 𝜙0, and use percentile

"nents against Δ𝜙shifted = Δ𝜙obs − 𝜙offset. This accounts for the shift
to each 𝜙0, so that each line is centred around 0°. The left column of
the figure thus represents the effect of these offsets on an observed
𝛿𝑣 ‖ (⊥)/𝑣𝐴-Δ𝜙𝑃 relationship, while the right column isolates the
upward and downward shifts of the velocity components, without
the associated shift in angle."
"Figure A1 shows that 𝛿𝑣∗‖ is shifted down for both signs of
𝜙offset, while the shift in 𝛿𝑣∗⊥ depends on the sign of 𝜙offset. The
result of this, shown in the top left panel, is that non-zero 𝜙offset
causes the spread in observed 𝛿𝑣 ‖ to extend more towards values
below the Alfvénic line, particularly at 0° and ±180°. Larger 𝜙offset
leads to larger offsets in velocity. However, aside from the two
most extreme values of |𝜙offset | ' 50°, which we expect to be very
uncommon,most offsetswill lead to a relatively narrow spread about
the Alfvénic line in 𝛿𝑣∗‖ . Conversely, the spread about the Alfvénic
line for 𝛿𝑣∗⊥ increases with increasing |Δ𝜙obs |, such that the spread
in errors in 𝛿𝑣∗⊥ due to an offset field angle will be greatest for larger
Δ𝜙𝑃 , and smallest near Δ𝜙𝑃 = 0°."
APPENDIX B: ADDITIONAL INVERSION CRITERIA
"In Section 1 we describe an additional criteria which we apply
to refine our classification of inverted HMF. In this appendix we
shall provide the justification for taking this step. To recap Section
1, the first criteria for inverted HMF is that the strahl is oriented
in the anti-parallel (parallel) direction for positive (negative) HMF
polarity. The second, new, criteria is that the HMF polarity of a
given sample be opposite to the modal polarity over a 12 hrwindow
centred on that sample. Samples which meet the first criteria but
not the second are discarded."
"Figure B1 contains plots identical to Figure 4, 𝛿𝑣 ‖ (⊥) for low
relative 𝐴𝐶 samples, except do not discard inverted samples which
do not meet the second criteria. There is a clear additional popu-
lation of points, located around Δ𝜙𝑃 = ±180°. These samples are
concentrated around 𝛿𝑣 ‖ = 0 atΔ𝜙𝑃 = ±180°, and increase towards
Δ𝜙𝑃 = 0°. This trend is consistent with an Alfvénic relationship,
which is found in e.g., Figure 4, but shifted by 180°. This may be
due to incorrect rectification of Δ𝜙𝑃 . Mis-rectification would occur
when some samples are wrongly identified as inverted HMF. The
distributions of Δ𝜙𝑃 , shown above the 2-dimensional histograms,
also increase towards ±180°, which appears unusual compared to
the monotonic decrease which is present for Δ𝜙𝑃 at lower values."
"Mis-identification of inverted HMF could occur because the
strahl alignment is not being accurately determined, perhaps due
to a low overall strahl flux or otherwise anomalous distribution
function. Examining electron PADs corresponding to the samples
which fall in the additional populations in Figure B1, we find that
a sizeable fraction have a particularly low total strahl flux, which
supports this hypothesis. However, removing all samples with a
low strahl flux does fully not eliminate the apparently mis-rectified
population. Some further inverted samples in this population occur
just before or after bidirectional strahl is observed, indicating that
the sunward-travelling strahl (which we assume indicates inverted
HMF) may be instead due to the appearance of strahl PADs on
closed HMF (see Macneil et al. 2020b)."
"The second additional criteria for inversions, which we apply
for the data used in this study, is designed to mitigate the apparent
mis-identification of inversions by applying a separate verification
step. Comparing Figure B1 to Figure 4, we see that the additional
population is largely absent, indicating that the second criteria is"
"successful. The low relative 𝐴𝐶 data shown in these figures il-
lustrates the effect of this additional step most clearly, although a
similar effect is found when we make equivalent comparisons with
e.g., Figures 2 and 5."
"While the mis-rectification of inverted HMF appears to be
largely solved by introducing the second criteria, there are further
potential consequences of this approach. Primarily, some true HMF
inversions likely exist which do not coincide with a polarity which
is opposite to the background polarity in a 12 hrwindow. This could
be because they occur near the HCS (so the dominant polarity is
that of the opposite sector), they are particularly large or occur
in bursts (causing the inverted polarity to dominate over a 12 hr
window), or because the inversion does not coincide with a field
deflection visible in the time series, but is clear from the strahl data
(such as that shown in Figure 1 of Crooker et al. 2004). This true
inverted HMF will be removed by this step in our analysis. The
presence of these types of inversion may explain why the removal

"Figure B1. 2-dimensional histograms of 𝛿𝑣‖/𝑣𝐴 and 𝛿𝑣⊥/𝑣𝐴 against Δ𝜙𝑃 for three radial distance bins in the same format as Figure 4. The inverted HMF
samples included in this plot ( |Δ𝜙𝑃 | > 90°) are only subject to the first inversion criteria defined by the strahl. Above the top row of panels, the blue histogram
shows the distribution of Δ𝜙𝑃 for the samples included in the relevant 2-dimensional histograms. The orange histogram shows the distribution of Δ𝜙𝑃 for the
included inverted HMF samples only. The orange and blue histograms are normalised independently. To the right of each panel, normalised histograms show
the distribution of that panel’s 𝑦-axis parameter for uninverted and inverted HMF samples combined (blue line) and for inverted samples only (orange line)."
