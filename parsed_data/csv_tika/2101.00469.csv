ABSTRACT
Recent studies of ultra hot-Jupiters suggested that their atmospheres could have thermal inversions
"due to the presence of optical absorbers such as TiO, VO, FeH and other metal hydride/oxides."
"However, it is expected that these molecules would thermally dissociate at extremely high temperatures,"
"thus leading to featureless spectra in the infrared. KELT-9 b, the hottest exoplanet discovered so far,"
is thought to belong to this regime and host an atmosphere dominated by neutral Hydrogen from
"dissociation and atomic/ionic species. Here, we analysed the eclipse spectrum obtained using the"
"Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and, by utilising the atmospheric retrieval"
"code TauREx3, found that the spectrum is consistent with the presence of molecular species and is"
"poorly fitted by a simple blackbody. In particular, we find that a combination of TiO, VO, FeH and H-"
"provides the best-fit when considering HST, Spitzer and TESS datasets together. Aware of potential"
"biases when combining instruments, we also analysed the HST spectrum alone and found that TiO"
and VO only were needed in this case. These findings paint a more complex picture of the atmospheres
of ultra-hot planets than previously thought.
1. INTRODUCTION
"Models suggest that, in the atmospheres of ultra-hot"
"Jupiters, molecular compounds should evaporate. Some"
"of these, such as titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium"
"oxide (VO), were expected to efficiently absorb incident"
"flux high in the atmospheres of these planets, instigat-"
ing an increase in temperature (e.g. Hubeny et al. 2003;
Fortney et al. 2008). Studies have since searched for
"these thermal inversions, initially by comparing eclipse"
depths between the Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 µm chan-
nels and more recently by Hubble’s WFC3 (e.g. Arcan-
geli et al. 2018; Mansfield et al. 2018; Mikal-Evans et al.
2019; Edwards et al. 2020; Pluriel et al. 2020).
KELT-9 b orbits an A0V/B9V star (T = 10140 K)
"and, with a day-side temperature of ∼4500 K, is itself
hotter than many stars (Gaudi et al. 2017). Given the"
"extreme temperatures, the majority of molecules are an-"
ticipated to be dissociated leaving only atomic species
(Kitzmann et al. 2018). Ground-based high resolution
observations have detected a number of metals includ-
"ing iron, titanium and calcium (Hoeijmakers et al. 2018,"
2019; Yan et al. 2019; Cauley et al. 2019; Turner et al.
∗ These authors contributed equally to this work.
2020; Pino et al. 2020). Observations of KELT-9 b with
TESS and Spitzer have revealed an asymmetric transit
"(Ahlers et al. 2020), induced by the fast rotation of its"
host star. The rotation leads to a non-uniform struc-
"ture in the star, which has a larger and brighter equator"
"than the poles, whereas KELT-9 b orbits with a 87◦ spin-"
orbit angle. The planet has a low day-night temperature
contrast with indications for H2 dissociation and recom-
"bination (Wong et al. 2019; Mansfield et al. 2020). It is
subject to intense irradiation from the star and extreme"
atmospheric escape due to its large extended hydrogen
envelope reaching the Roche-Lobe limit (Yan & Hen-
ning 2018; Wyttenbach et al. 2020). Measurements of
the neutral iron line by Pino et al. (2020) imply the pres-
"ence of a thermal inversion, as does modelling by Fossati"
et al. (2020).
"Given the temperature of KELT-9 b, its day-side emis-"
sion spectrum was anticipated to resemble a blackbody
(Wong et al. 2019; Lothringer et al. 2018). Here we anal-
yse the Hubble WFC3 emission spectrum of KELT-9 b
"and find that, contrary to these predictions, the day-"
side spectrum deviates significantly from a blackbody.
We perform atmospheric retrievals to attempt to explain
"these features, finding optical absorbers are required,"
"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6516-4493

and we compare our results to the abundances expected
from equilibrium models.
2. HUBBLE DATA REDUCTION AND ANALYSIS
The Hubble WFC3 eclipse observation of KELT-9 b
was acquired as part of proposal 15820 (PI: Lorenzo
"Pino, Pino et al. (2019)). Hubble attempted to acquire"
the data on 21st November 2019 but there were issues
"with the guidance, with a failure in guide star acquisi-"
"tion and the pointing was completed using gyros only,"
making the data unusable. The observation was success-
fully repeated on 25th January 2020.
The visit utilised the GRISM512 aperture and SQ512
"subarray, with an exposure time of 92.538 s which con-"
sisted of 6 up-the-ramp reads using the SPARS25 se-
"quence. The visit had a scan rate of 0.438 ”/s, re-"
sulting in a scan length of 43.559 ” which stretches
"over approximately 335 pixels, one of the longest spatial"
scans completed thus far for exoplanet spectroscopy af-
"ter 55 Cancri e (350 pixels, Tsiaras et al. (2016b)). Both"
forward and reverse scans were used to increase the duty
"cycle. Additionally, a single F164N direct image was"
taken at the being of each orbit for wavelength calibra-
"We reduced the data using the Iraclis1, open-source"
software for the analysis of WFC3 scanning observa-
tions (Tsiaras et al. 2016a) and the reduction process
"included the following steps: zero-read subtraction, ref-"
"erence pixels correction, non-linearity correction, dark"
"current subtraction, gain conversion, sky background"
"subtraction, calibration, flat-field correction, and cor-"
rections for bad pixels and cosmic rays. For a detailed
"description of these steps, we refer the reader to the"
original Iraclis paper (Tsiaras et al. 2016a).
From the reduced spatially scanned spectroscopic im-
"ages, the white (from 1.1-1.7 µm) and spectral light"
curves were subsequently extracted. The spectral light
curves bands were selected such that the SNR is ap-
proximately uniform across the planetary spectrum. We
then discarded the first orbit of each visit as they present
"stronger wavelength-dependent ramps, and the first ex-"
posure after each buffer dump as these contain signifi-
cantly lower counts than subsequent exposures.
We fitted the light curves using the PyLightcurve
package2 which utilises the MCMC code ecmee (Foreman-
"Mackey et al. 2013) and, for the fitting of the white light"
"curve, the only free parameters were the mid-eclipse"
time and planet-to-star flux ratio. The other planet
and the stellar parameters were fixed to the values from
"1 https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/Iraclis
2 https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/pylightcurve"
"Wong et al. (2019) (a/R∗ = 3.191, i = 87.6
◦, T∗ ="
10170 K). It is common in HST WFC3 data to have ad-
ditional scatter that cannot be explained by the ramp
"model. For this reason, we scaled up the uncertainties"
"in the individual data points, for their median to match"
"the standard deviation of the residuals, and repeated"
"the fitting,"
"Subsequently we fitted the spectral light curves, with"
the mid-eclipse time fixed to that from the white fit and
thus the eclipse depth was the only free parameter. The
extracted eclipse spectrum is given in Table 1 while the
white and spectral light curve fits are given in Figures 1.
Also shown are an example detector image and the shifts
in the position of the spectrum on the detector over the
course of the observation. Shifts in the positioning of
the spectrum on the detector can cause significant sys-
tematics if uncorrected and Stevenson & Fowler (2019)
suggest that drifts which are smaller than 0.11 pixels
(0.15 mas) in the spectral plane are optimal for exo-
planet spectroscopy. The shifts seen here between ob-
servations are not significant and far smaller than those
seen for 55 Cancri e (Tsiaras et al. 2016b).
3. ATMOSPHERIC RETRIEVAL
"Once the spectrum is obtained, we extracted the in-"
formation content by performing a retrieval analysis
using the open-source framework TauREx 3 (Al-Refaie
et al. 2019). The planet is simulated assuming a plane
"parallel atmosphere of 100 layers, spanning the pres-"
"sure range from 106 to 10−5 Pa in log space, assuming"
"hydro-static equilibrium. Due to atmospheric outflows,"
the hydro-static equilibrium assumption might be in-
"valid, especially at low densities. In this paper, due to"
the relatively low information content obtained spectra
"which limits the regions probed to high pressures, we"
do not consider more complicated modelling of those
"phenomena. In the retrievals, the bulk planet parame-"
ters (mass and radius) are fixed to the literature values
"(Rp = 1.89 RJ, Mp = 2.88 MJ, Gaudi et al. (2017)) due"
to the availability of more accurate constraints from
transit and radial velocity techniques. We simulate the
stellar spectrum from the literature parameters and the
"PHOENIX model (Husser et al. 2013). In particular, for"
"stars like KELT-9, a strong 1.28µm H I line is expected"
(Malkan et al. 2002). Three free chemistry retrievals are
performed:
"• HST only: In this scenario, only the newly reduced
HST spectrum is considered."
"• HST+Spitzer: On top of the HST spectrum, we
attempted to include the Spitzer data point from Mans-"
"https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/Iraclis

"field et al. (2020) (ED = 0.3131 ± 0.0062 %). Previous
studies highlighted the danger of such approach as there"
is no guarantee that these datasets are compatible (e.g.
"Yip et al. 2018, 2020; Pluriel et al. 2020; Changeat et al."
2020).
"• TESS+HST: We also run a scenario including the
TESS data from Wong et al. (2019) (ED = 0.0065 ±
0.0015 %) is added to the retrieval. Of course, this is"
subject to the same caveats as the HST+Spitzer case.
"• TESS+HST+Spitzer: For completeness, we also
run a full scenario, which includes all the datasets."
"In those retrievals, the abundances for H2O (Polyan-"
"sky et al. 2018), TiO (McKemmish et al. 2019), VO"
"(McKemmish et al. 2016), CH4 (Yurchenko & Tennyson"
"2014), CO (Li et al. 2015), FeH (Dulick et al. 2003;"
Wende et al. 2010) and e− (John 1988) are considered
constant with altitude and retrieved with large volume
mixing priors between 10−12 and 1. While more com-
plex chemical profiles are potentially occurring in the
"atmosphere of KELT-9 b, the retrieval of more complex"
parametric chemical profiles leads to large degeneracies
in the case of HST (Changeat et al. 2019). In our re-
"trievals, e− is used as a proxy for the H− opacity, fol-"
lowing the implementation described in Edwards et al.
(2020). This description allows to calculate the bound-
free and the free-free absorptions of H− when assuming
"the Saha equation, but also removes the free chemistry"
approach for this particular species. Since two degen-
"erate free parameters are left (e− and H), we fixed the"
abundance of H using a 2-layer profile similar to what
is done in Edwards et al. (2020). We set the inflexion
"point of this profile at 1 bar, the mixing ratio for the"
surface at 10−6 and the mixing ratio for the top of the
atmosphere at 0.9. This profile is chosen to be consis-
tent with the equilibrium predictions in Figure 4 and
leaves only the e− abundance as a free parameter. It is
found that changing the assumption on the neutral H
profile does not impact the main conclusions and only
shifts the retrieved abundances slightly. The rest of the
atmosphere is filled with hydrogen and helium assuming
a solar composition (He/H = 0.17).
The thermal profiles are recovered using a free heuris-
tic approach interpolating between 3 freely moving
temperature-pressure points (NPoint profile). On top of
"the molecular absorbers, we include opacities from Col-"
lision Induced Absorption of the H2-H2 and H2-He pairs
as well as Rayleigh Scattering. The free parameters are
explored using the Bayesian algorithm MultiNest (Feroz
et al. 2009; Buchner et al. 2014) with an evidence tol-

4. RESULTS
The resulting best fit spectra from our Iraclis reduc-
"tion, from which we achieved an average precision of"
"36 ppm across 26 spectral channels, and the TauREx 3"
retrievals are provided in Figure 2.
"In all three of our free retrievals, water vapour is con-"
strained to abundances below 10−5. Such a result is
expected for planets of high temperatures like KELT-
"9 b, where the majority of water is expected to be ther-"
mally dissociated (e.g. Parmentier et al. 2018). Previous
studies of this planet predicted that the day-side tem-
peratures of KELT-9 b should lead to enhanced thermal
dissociation where molecules are not expected to sur-
"vive. Despite this, the KELT-9 b eclipse spectrum is"
consistent with the presence of emission features in the
HST wavelength range and is poorly fitted by a simple
planet blackbody (see green models in Figure 2). The
observed features in the HST range are attributed to a
"Figure 2. Extracted HST spectrum from our reduction with Iraclis (black), Spitzer photometric point (green) from Mansfield
et al. (2020), TESS photometric point (red) and the best-fit spectra from our three retrieval runs. We also provide in dashed
green the best fit planet blackbody of the HST spectrum (T = 4504 K) as well as the region between the blackbody spectra
at 4100K and 4800K in shaded green, illustrating the large feature sizes and differences between the HST, TESS and Spitzer
datasets. Note that the H I line at 1.28 µm, as well as the other lines separated in the green blackbody fit, are from the
PHOENIX model of the star (Husser et al. 2013)."
mix of species with near optical absorbing properties:
"TiO, VO, FeH and H- (see Figure 3). When only the"
"HST data is considered, the retrieved abundances for"
"TiO and VO are high (respectively log(TiO)= −3.7+0.5−0.7
and log(VO)= −3.9+0.5−0.7), while FeH and H- are not de-
tected. When the Spitzer photometric measurement at"
"4.5µm is included, the model converges to a more phys-"
ical solution containing large abundances of e- (log(e-)
"= −4.9+0.2−0.2), a proxy for the H- absorption coming from
the H2 thermal dissociation (Edwards et al. 2020). On"
"top of this, TiO is found at an abundance of log(TiO) ="
"−6.9+0.3−0.4, VO at an abundance of log(VO) = −6.7
+0.2
−0.2"
"and FeH at log(FeH) = −7.7+1.3−1.3.
While the presence of molecular species remains sur-"
"prising at those temperatures (Woitke et al. 2018), this"
provides a much more convincing picture than the HST
"only retrieval. Besides, the observed HST spectrum con-"
tains large absorption features that cannot be fit with H-
only and many atomic metals were already detected in
the atmosphere of this planet from the cross-correlation
"technique (Hoeijmakers et al. 2018). We highlight, how-"
"ever, that we can’t guarantee the compatibility of the"
"HST and Spitzer datasets, and that absolute offsets be-"
tween those two datasets could lead to large biases in
the retrieved abundances (e.g. Yip et al. 2020; Pluriel
"et al. 2020). Nevertheless, we find that adding TESS"
"to the retrieval, does not change much the retrieval re-"
sults (see posterior distribution and temperature struc-
"ture in Figure 3), which might provide indications that"
"the datasets from TESS, HST and Spitzer are compat-"
ible for this planet. The presence of these molecular
features in KELT-9 b might suggest that disequilibrium
processes and/or dynamical mixing with regions that
are much cooler (e.g. the night-side Wong et al. (2019))
"are allowing TiO, VO and FeH to remain stable in this"
atmosphere and be observed in this eclipse spectrum.
For the other molecules included in the model (CO and
"CH4), we do not recover any particular constraints."
We quantified the statistical significance of the ob-
served features in HST by comparing the logarithmic
"Bayesian evidence, log(E), of all our models with that"
of a baseline blackbody fit (log(E)base = 22.4 for HST
"alone, log(E)base = 23.8 for HST+Spitzer and log(E)base
= 31.5 for TESS+HST+Spitzer). The blackbody tem-"
peratures associated with these baseline models are 4504
"K, 4510 K and 4503 K respectively. In the free HST re-"
"trieval, the difference of log evidence is ∆log(E) = 185.5."
"When the Spitzer point is accounted for, the difference"
"is ∆log(E) = 190.3 and when TESS is added, ∆log(E)"
= 190.9. These strongly suggests that the observed fea-
tures are not arising from statistical fluctuations (Kass
& Raftery 1995) and that the presence of near-optical
"absorbers (TiO, VO, FeH and H-) is required to explain"
the spectrum of KELT-9 b.
"For the temperature structure, all the performed re-"
trievals are consistent with the presence of a thermal
inversion (see Figure 3). The thermal structure in the
HST+Spitzer and the TESS+HST+Spitzer runs are
"almost identical, with an inversion relatively deep in"
"the atmosphere (105 Pa). While cooler, the general"
temperature-pressure structure is consistent with the
findings in Fossati et al. (2020) and could allow for
molecular species to survive in the deeper layers. The
temperature reaches a maximum of about 5000 K. In
"the HST only case, we again find a thermal inversion"
although the temperature structure differs significantly
with the inversion occurring far higher in the atmosphere
(103 Pa). In Figure 3 the contribution functions are
"also plotted, highlighting two classes of models where"
different regions are probed depending whether Spitzer
"is included or not. In either case, the retrievals ex-"
"plore a region where a thermal inversion occur, with the"
molecules being seen in emission. The inclusion of TESS
"only shifts the contribution up in the TESS+HST case,"
which is expected due the optical wavelengths probing
much higher in the atmosphere.
The results for the TESS+HST run are also shown in
"the figures, but we find similar results to the HST only"
"run in terms of molecular detection and thermal profile,"
indicating that the additional information contained in
the TESS channel for this case is limited. We also in-
"vestigated the significance of each species, by performing"
"retrieval analyses on the TESS+HST+Spitzer case, re-"
moving the detected species one by one. The ∆log(E)
"were 186.5, 176.1, 185.2, 181.2 for the runs without TiO,"
"VO, FeH and H-, respectively. Given that the Bayesian"
evidence is significantly lower than the ∆log(E) = 190.9
"for the full model, the best statistical fit is the one con-"
"taining all four species. However, we caution that this"
result does not prove that other metal oxide/hydrides
and other absorbing species are not present in this at-
"mosphere. In fact, we noticed during the removal pro-"
"cess of the detected molecules, that the abundance of"
the remaining ones had the tendency to increase by a
few orders of magnitude to compensate for the removed
"absorption, thus indicating that if other absorbers are"
"indeed present, our retrieved abundances could be over-"
estimated. Model dependent behaviour such as this one
were thoroughly investigated in (Changeat et al. 2020).
5. DISCUSSION
The retrievals performed here explain the modular
shape of the KELT-9 b eclipse spectrum with a mix
of near-optical absorbers. The prevalence of these
molecules is higher than expected but we note that accu-
rate abundances are difficult to extract from the low res-
"olution, low wavelength coverage of HST, or even from"
"combined datasets. In addition to this, the extreme na-"
ture of KELT-9 b and its host star imply that conclu-
sions must be cautiously drawn from analyses of these
datasets.
A number of previous studies have found evidence for
"TiO, VO and H- using low resolution space-based emis-"
sion spectroscopy from HST and Spitzer (e.g. Haynes
et al. 2015; Mansfield et al. 2018; Mikal-Evans et al.
"2019; Edwards et al. 2020). However, given the narrow"
"spectral coverage and low resolution of the datasets, dis-"
tinguishing between different opacity sources is difficult.
Other hydrides and oxides that are not considered in
this work (e.g. Aluminium Oxide (von Essen et al. 2019;
"Chubb et al. 2020)), may be contributing to the near-"
infrared features. The ones chosen here are the most
likely from chemical models of ultra-hot Jupiters (Par-
mentier et al. 2018; Lothringer et al. 2018; Kitzmann
et al. 2018) while other abundant species (e.g. SiO)
do not have significant features in the WFC3 bandpass.
"Atomic and ionic species such as Fe, Fe+ or Ti+ were"
previously found in KELT-9 b but since their electronic
transitions occur in a much lower wavelength region
"than considered here (< 0.8µm), they were not included"
in our retrieval models (Sharp & Burrows 2007; Heiter
et al. 2015; Madhusudhan 2019; Ralchenko & Kramida
"2020). Nevertheless, the possibility exists that the abun-"
"dances of TiO, VO and FeH could be over estimated"
to account for additional absorption by missing species.
"Further data, covering shorter wavelengths, would help"
to investigate this scenario.
"In addition to this, the accuracy of retrievals are di-"
rectly linked to the quality and completeness of the
available linelists. While many of the ExoMol linelists
are suitably broad in pressure and temperature cover-
age for the majority of the currently-known exoplanet
"population, KELT-9 b lies far outside the norms. The"
"linelists of TiO (McKemmish et al. 2019), VO (McKem-"
mish et al. 2016) and FeH (Dulick et al. 2003; Wende
et al. 2010) are computed for temperatures up to 3500
K. While we used the latest versions from (Chubb et al.
"2020), our retrievals push to temperatures exceeding"
"3500 K, forcing us to fix the opacities to the highest"
"Figure 3. Retrieved posteriors and temperature-pressure profiles (top right) from our retrieval analyses. Blue: HST; orange:
HST+Spitzer; red:TESS+HST+Spitzer; purple: TESS+HST. The contribution functions are also shown, highlighting two
different classes of models, depending if Spitzer is included. Near-optical absorbers (TiO, VO, FeH and H-) are needed to
explain the observed spectrum. When the TESS point is added, the retrieval results are almost identical. The values listed are

"available temperatures, meaning that molecular lines"
might be missing. This could impact the accuracy of
"the retrievals presented here, potentially contributing"
"in the higher than expected retrieved abundances, even"
though we are not probing individual lines. Future work
"by groups such ExoMol, HITEMP and HITRAN would"
valuable for the study of such hot planets.
"For planets such as KELT-9 b, the irradiation differ-"
ence between the day and night-side is expected to in-
duce a large day-night temperature contrasts: the differ-
ence is expected to be around 2000 K (Wong et al. 2019;
Mansfield et al. 2020). These can lead to 3-dimensional
biases (e.g. Taylor et al. 2020; Feng et al. 2020; Changeat
& Al-Refaie 2020) due to the in-homogeneous day-side
"emission. In our retrieval, we employ a 1-dimensional"
"description of the atmosphere, which might not well rep-"
"resent the actual planet. Additionally, in such a com-"
"plex atmosphere, chemical species are not expected to"
be constant with altitude (e.g. Lothringer et al. 2018).
Previous work from Changeat et al. (2019) highlighted
that the small wavelength coverage of HST does not al-
low us to extract more complex chemical profiles unless
additional assumptions such as equilibrium chemistry
are adopted. Assuming such model to extract informa-
tion content from exoplanet spectra is dangerous as it
"would only provide a model dependent solution, driven"
by the model assumptions.
"Nevertheless, we also attempted an equilibrium chem-"
istry retrieval using the same chemical scheme for the
TESS+HST+Spitzer case. The results suggested that
equilibrium chemistry might not a valid assumption for
this planet: ∆log(E) = 172.2 for the equilibrium run
against ∆log(E) = 189.8 for the free run. In addi-
"tion to this, the equilibrium chemistry assumption lead"
to highly nonphysical retrieved parameters (log(Z) =
"2.0+0.1−0.1, log(Ti/O) = 1.7
+0.1
−0.1 and log(V/O) = 1.9"
"+0.1
−0.1)."
To compare the results from our free chemical re-
"trievals with predictions from self-consistent models, we"
plot in Figure 4 the chemical profiles obtained from as-
suming chemical equilibrium (GGchem: Woitke et al.
2018) with solar abundances and the thermal profile ob-
tained in the TESS+HST+Spitzer retrieval.
We find that our retrieved H2 dissociation in the
TESS+HST+Spitzer case are consistent with the
"GGChem estimates, in the region probed by the obser-"
"vations. For TiO, VO and FeH, however, we consistently"
retrieved a higher than expected abundances. From
the free chemical retrievals of the TESS+HST+Spitzer
"dataset, one finds the ratios Ti/H = 6.1 × 10−8 and
V/H = 1.0 × 10−7, which are comparable with solar
abundances if all the metals were in the form of those"
molecules. Given the ground based detections of atomic
"Figure 4. Chemical profiles for KELT-9 b assuming
equilibrium chemistry and the thermal profile from our
TESS+HST+Spitzer fit (dotted lines) and retrieved chem-
istry from the same retrieval (shaded regions). The 1 sigma
retrieved regions are also highlighted by the solid lines. The
chemical scheme used is from Woitke et al. (2018)."
"and ionic Ti (Hoeijmakers et al. 2018, 2019), the high"
abundance of TiO and potentially VO found here sug-
gests a super-solar metallicity or biases in our retrieved
"abundances. For Fe, we find that Fe/H = 1.2 × 10−8,
which is much lower than solar ratios. This ratio im-"
plies that the species must also be found in another
"form, which matches the findings in Pino et al. (2020)"
"who detected atomic Fe, even though their assumed"
self-consistent temperature structure from Lothringer
et al. (2018) differs from our retrieved ones.
"Disequilibrium processes, such as vertical or horizon-"
"tal mixing could also play an important role in distribut-
ing metal oxide/hydrides on the day-side of KELT-9 b"
(Kitzmann et al. 2018; Komacek et al. 2019; Drummond
"et al. 2020). To investigate those processes, one should"
compare the timescales of the creation and destruction
reactions with the timescales of dynamical processes.
"However, little is known regarding TiO, VO and FeH"
"kinetic reaction rate, limiting such studies, particularly"
for such an extreme object. If mixing processes are im-
"portant, estimates on the dynamical timescales for such"
atmosphere suggest a lower limit on the destruction rate
of the associated molecules between 104s and 106s (Line
"et al. 2011; Kitzmann et al. 2018). However, due to the"
"potential biases in the recovered molecular abundances,"
"even with firm knowledge of these timescales, it would"
be difficult to ascertain whether these processes were oc-
curring and were the cause of the increased abundances
of metal oxides and hydrides.
"Finally, the star KELT-9 is a fast rotating star with a"
non uniform structure that might not well be estimated
from our PHOENIX models. While these effects would
"be more important in the transit case, a better under-"
standing of the stellar properties might be needed to
extract more precise information regarding KELT-9 b.
"Hence, the abundances of optical absorbers recovered"
"here may well be overestimated. Nevertheless, the HST"
spectrum of KELT-9 b clearly shows a strong deviation
"from a blackbody and, while the physical interpretation"
of these features via retrievals may have been affected by
"the reasons above, this in itself is unexpected suggest-"
ing the planet may be very different from our a priori
assumptions.
6. CONCLUSION
"We analysed the HST eclipse spectrum of KELT-9 b,"
"the hottest transiting planet discovered so far, using"
open source reduction and retrieval frameworks. While
the extreme temperature of the planet’s day-side was ex-
pected to induce thermal dissociation of the main molec-
ular species and lead to an H- dominated spectrum with
"few broadband features, we find that the emission spec-"
trum of KELT-9 b contains rich features which imply the
presence of molecular species.
We explored 3 scenarios to ensure the consistency
of our dataset across different combinations of in-
"struments: HST only, TESS+HST, HST+Spitzer and"
"TESS+HST+Spitzer. In all those scenarios, we find"
that the atmosphere must have a thermal inversion and
that the observed features are well fitted by near optical
absorbers (TiO and VO). Water vapour is not recov-
"ered in any of the investigated models, which is consis-"
tent with predictions of the molecule being dissociated.
"When Spitzer is added, the retrievals (with/without"
TESS) are almost identical and the presence of FeH
"and H- is also detected. In essence, these retrievals"
"present a seemingly consistent picture, suggesting that"
the spectrum of KELT-9 b cannot be fitted with a sim-
ple blackbody and that the presence of metal oxides
and/or hydrides is required.
The extreme nature of this planet mean that future in-
vestigations in terms of atmospheric modelling and line
opacity calculations are required to overcome the limita-
"tions of this study. Nevertheless, the findings presented"
here contrast with the previous assumptions about the
"planet, bringing this extremely-hot Jupiter much closer"
to its ultra-hot Jupiter counterparts.
