ABSTRACT
"Extremely massive black holes, with masses ""BH > 10
9 M⊙ , have been observed at ever higher redshifts. These results create"
ever tighter constraints on the formation and growth mechanisms of early black holes. Here we show that even the most extreme
"black hole known, Pōniuā’ena , can grow from a 10 M⊙ seed black hole via Eddington-limited luminous accretion, provided"
"that accretion proceeds almost continuously, but is composed of a large number of episodes with individually-uncorrelated"
"initial directions. This chaotic accretion scenario ensures that the growing black hole spins slowly, with the dimensionless"
"spin parameter 0 <∼ 0.2, so its radiative efficiency is also low, n ∼− 0.06. If accretion is even partially aligned, with 20 − 40%"
"of accretion events happening in the same direction, the black hole spin and radiative efficiency are much higher, leading to"
significantly slower growth. We suggest that the chaotic accretion scenario can be completely falsified only if a 109 M⊙ black
"hole is discovered at I ≥ 9.1, approximately 150 Myr before Pōniuā’ena . The space density of extreme quasars suggests that"
"only a very small fraction, roughly one in 4×107, of seed black holes need to encounter favourable growth conditions to produce"
"the observed extreme quasars. Other seed black holes grow much less efficiently, mainly due to lower duty cycles, so are much"
more difficult to detect.
"Key words: accretion, accretion discs — quasars:general — galaxies:active"
1 INTRODUCTION
It is now generally accepted that most galaxies harbour supermas-
sive black holes (SMBHs) in their centres (Merloni & Heinz 2013;
Graham 2016). This is true both for galaxies in the Local Universe
"and at high redshift, where almost 200 quasars have been discovered"
at I > 6 (Willott et al. 2010; Carnall et al. 2015; Matsuoka et al.
2016; Bañados et al. 2016; Jiang et al. 2016; Mazzucchelli et al.
"2017; Reed et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2017; Matsuoka et al. 2018a,b;"
Reed et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2019; Vito et al. 2019). These quasars
"are typically powered by SMBHs with masses of order 109 M⊙ , yet"
"are seen at lookback times > 13 Gyr, i.e. when the Universe was"
less than 800 Myr old. The most extreme SMBH currently known is
"Pōniuā’ena with a mass of ""Pon = 1.5 × 10
9 M⊙ , seen at I = 7.515"
"(Yang et al. 2020), corresponding to C = 700 Myr after the Big Bang1."
These observations provide a rather tight constraint on the possible
models of the origin and early growth of SMBHs.
"In general, these models fall broadly into two groups (see"
"Inayoshi et al. 2019, for a review). One group considers SMBHs"

"growing from massive seeds: objects with masses ∼ 104 − 105 M⊙
(Ferrara et al. 2014) that form via direct gas collapse (Loeb & Rasio"
1994; Begelman et al. 2006; Dĳkstra et al. 2014; Chon et al.
"2016; Wise et al. 2019), an intermediate supermassive star stage"
(Regan & Haehnelt 2009; Volonteri & Begelman 2010; Begelman
2010) or due to rapid mergers of stars and/or individual stellar-mass
black holes in a dense cluster (Portegies Zwart & McMillan 2002;
Portegies Zwart et al. 2004; Devecchi & Volonteri 2009). These
seeds can then grow the required four orders of magnitude in mass
over several hundred Myr even if the radiative efficiency of accretion
is n >∼ 0.1.
The second kind of model suggests that SMBHs grow from stellar-
mass seeds (Madau & Rees 2001) via luminous accretion with a
rather low radiative efficiency. Low efficiency may be achieved if
accretion rates are hyper-Eddington; they create conditions where
the photons emitted by the accreting gas cannot escape the accretion
flow and are dragged into the black hole (Alexander & Natarajan
2014; Sądowski et al. 2015; Pacucci et al. 2015; Inayoshi et al. 2016;
Sakurai et al. 2016; Takeo et al. 2020). Even if accretion consists
"of Eddington-limited thin disc episodes, a radiative efficiency n ∼"
0.06 may be achieved if the spin of the black hole is kept low (e.g.
King et al. 2008). Since the black hole mass depends exponentially

"on (1 − n) /n , this difference is enough to allow for the growth of"
SMBHs powering even the most extreme high-redshift quasars.
The evolution of the SMBH spin during a series of accretion
episodes depends on how the disc aligns with the hole. Early calcu-
lations (e.g. Thorne 1974; Scheuer & Feiler 1996) suggested that the
"disc always aligns stably, and so the hole should be rapidly spun up to"
"almost the maximum possible spin, 0 ∼− 0.998, where 0 is the dimen-"
"sionless spin parameter, with 0 = 0 representing a Schwarzschild"
black hole and 0 = 1 representing a maximally-spinning Kerr black
"hole. However, the conclusion of stable alignment rests on the erro-"
neous implicit assumption that the disc angular momentum domi-
"nates over that of the hole; in reality, the opposite is often the case,"
and so stable counter-alignment may occur during many accretion
"episodes (King et al. 2005). In these cases, accretion reduces SMBH"
spin (King et al. 2005). A single counter-aligned accretion episode
reduces the spin much more than a single aligned episode increases
"it, leading to a tendency for the SMBH spin to decrease over time"
"(King et al. 2008), provided that accretion is chaotic, i.e. individ-"
ual accretion episodes have uncorrelated initial directions of angular
momentum. Numerical modelling of the evolution of SMBHs un-
der realistic cosmological conditions (e.g. Griffin et al. 2019) mostly
"confirms this idea, although they do not produce large enough pop-"
ulations to test for the presence of extreme high-redshift SMBHs.
"In this paper, we investigate whether a chaotic accretion scenario"
can produce extremely massive SMBHs at C < 800 Myr after the Big
Bang (corresponding to I ∼ 6.7). We show that as long as accretion
events are not strongly correlated (< 20% of all accretion events
"happen along the same axis) and assuming a duty cycle close to 100%,"
a Pōniuā’ena -like SMBH can be produced. This suggests that the
extreme quasars might be powered by accretion on to SMBHs with
"rather unique growth histories, but such SMBHs are much more likely"
"to be observed at high redshift. We suggest ways to test our model, in"
particular by searching for lower-mass and/or higher-redshift SMBHs
than the current extreme ones. We also predict that these extreme
SMBHs have rather low spins and should be significantly obscured.
The paper is structured as follows. We begin by exploring the con-
straints on SMBH seed mass and radiative efficiency provided by the
"observations of extreme quasars in Section 2. In Section 3, we briefly"
describe the chaotic accretion model and its numerical implementa-
"tion. In Section 4, we present the results of numerical calculations"
of SMBH growth. We discuss their implications in Section 5 and
summarize in Section 6.
"Throughout the paper, we use the most recent Planck cosmology"
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2020): Hubble parameter �0 = 67.4 ±
"0.5 km s−1 Mpc−1, matter density parameter Ωm = 0.315 ± 0.007"
and dark energy density parameter ΩΛ ≡ 1 −Ωm.
2 CONSTRAINTS ON SMBH ORIGIN AND GROWTH
Supermassive black holes gain most of their mass via luminous ac-
cretion (Soltan 1982; Yu & Tremaine 2002; Marconi & Hunt 2003;
Shankar et al. 2004; Hopkins et al. 2006). The mass of an SMBH
cannot grow much faster than the Eddington-limited growth rate

"the radiative efficiency of accretion, 2 is the speed of light and � is"
the gravitational constant. The factor X is the duty cycle of luminous
accretion and ;E ≡ 〈!AGN/!Edd〉 is the average Eddington factor.
"Equation (1) has five free parameters: ""seed, Cform, n , X and ;E."
"However, the last three can be combined into a single “growth ef-"
"ficiency” W = X;E (1 − n) n
−1. The seed formation time can be es-"
"timated, at least for seeds forming from gas clouds, via numerical"
simulations and observations. Numerical simulations show that star
"formation begins at I ∼ 30, corresponding to C = 100 Myr after"
"the Big Bang (Johnson et al. 2008). Observationally, the imprint of"
the UV radiation from the first stars on the cosmic microwave back-
"ground becomes evident at I ∼ 20, corresponding to C = 180 Myr"
(Bowman et al. 2018). Using this latter estimate of the formation
"timescale is rather conservative, since occasional star formation may"
"have happened significantly earlier, but it would have been too scat-"
"tered, or too obscured, to produce a detectable signal. Due to this"
"uncertainty, we take Cform = 100 Myr in the rest of this paper, unless"
noted otherwise.
"For any given SMBH observed at any particular time, there is"
"a unique relationship between ""seed and W that can be derived"
from equation (1). We show these relationships for eight extreme
I > 6 SMBHs in Figure 12. The chosen SMBHs include the
"most distant (ULASJ1342+0928, Bañados et al. 2018), most mas-"
"sive (SDSSJ0100+2802, Wu et al. 2015) and the most constraining"

"lights W ∼− 0.0604
−1 ∼− 16.5, which is the highest possible growth"
"efficiency: this value represents an extreme combination n = 0.057,"
"appropriate for a non-spinning SMBH, together with X = ;E = 1. The"
"other vertical dashed line highlights W ∼− 0.111
−1 ∼− 9, which for a"
"X = ;E = 1 case corresponds to n = 0.1, typically assumed in many"
models of SMBH growth.
It is immediately clear that the value of growth efficiency has
"an enormous effect on the constraint of ""seed. An increase from"

of uncertainty in observational constraints of n (e.g. Shankar et al.

2017; Davies et al. 2019; Shankar et al. 2019) and theoretical studies
(Tucci & Volonteri 2017).
3 CHAOTIC ACCRETION
The model we use follows the one presented in King et al. (2005);
"King & Pringle (2006, 2007); King et al. (2008). Here we only"
present the basic qualitative arguments and refer the reader to those
papers for more details.
A SMBH grows via a series of individual accretion episodes. The
maximum mass that can be accreted during a single episode is given
by the self-gravity condition (cf. Pringle 1981)
"Δ""BH,1 = (1 − n) ""disc ≤ (1 − n)
�"
"'
""BH, (3)"
where �/' is the disc aspect ratio and the factor 1 − n represents
the fraction of disc mass lost to radiation. The radiative efficiency
depends monotonously on the dimensionless spin parameter 0: for a
"disc counter-aligned with a maximally spinning black hole, 0 = −1"
"and n ∼− 0.038; for a non-spinning (Schwarzschild) black hole, 0 = 0"
and n ∼− 0.057; and for prograde alignment between the disc and a
"maximally spinning black hole, 0 = 1 and n ∼− 0.42 (cf. Bardeen"
1970; King & Pringle 2006).
Each accretion episode initially forms a disc with an angular mo-
mentum �d at some angle \ to the direction of the hole’s angular
momentum �h. King et al. (2005) showed that the disc can align sta-
"bly with the black hole in either a prograde or retrograde fashion,"
with the latter case occuring if \ satisfies a condition
"cos\ < −
�d"
"2�h
. (4)"
"Since the disc mass is always much smaller than the hole mass, as"
"long as the hole is not spinning very slowly, stable counter-alignment"
might occur in close to half of all accretion episodes.
"As the accretion disc evolves, most of its angular momentum"
is transferred to large radii and eventually escapes the system
(Shakura & Sunyaev 1973; Pringle 1981). The angular momentum
actually transferred to the SMBH is
"�acc = ±Δ""BH,1 9ISCO. (5)"
"The specific angular momentum, 9ISCO is the angular momentum of"
gas per unit mass at the innermost stable circular orbit. The sign of
�acc is positive if the disc is aligned with the SMBH and negative if
it is counter-aligned.
"Over a large number of individual accretion episodes, the SMBH"
"spin evolves in a stochastic fashion. If the episodes are uncorrelated,"
"i.e. the initial direction of ®�d is random for each episode, the trend is"
"for the spin to decrease, because a counter-rotating disc has a signif-"
"icantly greater ISCO radius ('ISCO = 9�""BH/2
2 for a maximally"
"spinning black hole) than a prograde disc ('ISCO = �""BH/2
2 for"
"a maximally spinning black hole); as a result, the accreted angular"
momentum is much greater in counter-aligned accretion events. On
"the other hand, if the accretion episodes are correlated to some ex-"
"tent, the SMBH gradually begins to spin in the same direction and"
its spin value increases.
3.1 Numerical model
"We test the evolution of black hole mass and spin, as well as the"
"final SMBH mass distributions, under various accretion alignment"
"conditions, using a numerical model. The model is initialised with a"
"seed black hole of mass ""0 = 10 M⊙ , with a random spin magnitude"
and direction. A series of accretion events are then used to grow the
SMBH. Each event is limited in mass by the self-gravity condition
(eq. 3); we also checked that imposing an additional maximum mass
"of an individual event, to simulate the possible mass limit of gas"
"clouds feeding the SMBH, has no effect on our results. The initial"
direction of the disc’s spin is chosen completely randomly in one
"model; in two others, we add an additional parameter ?aligned ="
"0.2; 0.4, and randomly select this fraction of accretion events to have"
spins aligned in the positive-z direction. The code then checks the
condition for hole-disc alignment (eq. 4) and calculates the new
direction of the hole’s angular momentum by considering the vector
sum of ®�d and ®�h. The mass and angular momentum of the black hole
are updated by adding the appropriate fractions of the disc mass (eq.
3) and angular momentum (eq. 5). The new angular momentum is
used to calculate the spin parameter and the radiative efficiency to be
used for the next accretion event. The duration of a single episode is
calculated as the time for the AGN to consume the disc mass at the
given luminosity:
"Cep =
n""disc2"
"!AGN
. (6)"
We set the luminosity to be equal to the Eddington luminosity of the
black hole. While the luminosity is likely to vary a lot during SMBH
"growth, we are mainly interested in the early Universe and in extreme"
black holes which are likely to have grown in dense gas environments
where prolonged feeding at the Eddington (or higher) rate was com-
"mon. If the black hole is fed at a mildly super-Eddington rate, the ac-"
cretion disc sheds material at radii larger than ISCO and the black hole

timescales as

"where C is actual time elapsed. We run 150 simulations in total, 50"

the initial SMBH spin magnitude and direction and the directions of
individual accretion episodes.

"at ""Pon = 1.5 × 10
9 M⊙ and the shaded region corresponds to the"
uncertainty in this estimate.
The purely chaotic accretion scenario evolves in the same way
as was shown previously by King et al. (2008). The black hole spin
"gradually decreases and oscillates in the range 0 < 0 < 0.2, while"
the mass grows exponentially and reaches the mass of Pōniuā’ena in
C ∼ 520 Myr. The different directions of individual accretion events
"manifest in the evolution of spin, while the mass growth is barely"
affected. Models with partially aligned accretion events show higher
"SMBH spins and, as a result, slower mass growth. In the model with"
"?aligned = 0.2, spin oscillates in the range 0.2 < 0 < 0.4 and the"
mass reaches that of Pōniuā’ena after C = 570−590 Myr of accretion.
"Finally, in the model with ?aligned = 0.4, spin ends up in the range"
0.5 < 0 < 0.7 and it takes ∼ 700 − 730 Myr to grow the SMBH to
1.5 × 109 M⊙ .
"Despite the difference in individual accretion episode directions,"
both the overall spin and mass evolutions show remarkably similar
"trends. However, with more alignment, the difference in SMBH mass"
between the two example models at a given time increases. In order to
"show these differences in more detail, as well as the range of SMBH"

High-z SMBHs can grow from stellar seeds 5
"masses we may expect at different times in different scenarios, we"
"plot, in Figure 3, the histograms of SMBH masses in the three models"
"at Cacc = 400, 500, 600 and 700 Myr accretion time. Each histogram is"
produced by running the model 50 times with different sets of random
numbers determining the initial disc angular momentum direction.
The vertical dotted lines show the mean value of each histogram.
The variance of final SMBH masses grows with increasing align-
"ment of accretion events. In the purely chaotic case (top panels), the"
"difference between the most- and least-massive SMBHs is a factor 2,"
"while in the most aligned case (bottom panels), it is a factor 10. This"
"happens because when the SMBH spin is higher, radiative efficiency"
"is more sensitive to spin, leading to small changes in spin value"
resulting in more significant changes in SMBH growth rate. These
"variations, are, of course, only lower limits on the actual spread of"
"SMBH masses at any given time, because we do not account for the"
different duty cycles of individual black holes.
5 DISCUSSION
Our results show that it is possible to grow a black hole from a
"stellar-mass seed to the size of Pōniuā’ena in C ∼ 520 Myr, i.e."
rapidly enough to produce the black hole assuming that the first stars
formed 180 Myr after the Big Bang (Bowman et al. 2018) or earlier.
Such a scenario rests on several implicit assumptions and produces
several predictions regarding the properties of high-redshift extreme
SMBHs and their effect on the environment. We consider them in
5.1 Masses and alignment of individual accretion discs
The time coordinate in our models is the accretion time rather than
total time of the black hole’s existence. So the fact that Cacc ∼ 520 Myr
is required for production of a Pōniuā’ena -mass SMBH means that
the duty cycle of its growth has to be almost 100%. This may be unre-
alistic combined with the necessity of having a low rate of alignment
"of accretion directions; in fact, one might expect accretion direc-"
tions to be highly correlated if accretion is essentially continuous.
"Nevertheless, there are several ways of mitigating this tension."
The masses of individual accretion episodes in our model are
limited by the self-gravity condition (Pringle 1981; King & Pringle
2007). The validity of this condition rests on two assumptions: that
"the disc is geometrically thin and optically thick, i.e. that the standard"
"thin-disc equations are applicable to describing its structure, and that"
"cooling is efficient at radii ' >∼ 10
3As, where As = 2�""BH/2"
the Schwarzschild radius of the SMBH. Thin discs are the stan-
dard solution describing an accretion flow with mass flow rate
"0.01 ¤""Edd
<
∼"
"¤"" <∼ 2
¤""Edd (Best & Heckman 2012; Sądowski et al."
2013; Inayoshi et al. 2016). The importance of self-gravity in the
outer regions of these discs has been recognised by numerous au-
"thors (e.g., Shlosman et al. 1990; Gammie 2001; Rice et al. 2005)."
"In addition, cooling is typically efficient in these regions and leads to"
star formation (Shlosman & Begelman 1989; Collin & Zahn 1999;
Goodman 2003); even if the forming stars heat the disc up and
"prevent further fragmentation, this does not shut off the growth of"
"these stars (Nayakshin 2006). The stellar rings around Sgr A∗, the"
"central SMBH of the Milky Way, provide strong evidence for the"
validity of this scenario (Paumard et al. 2006; Bonnell & Rice 2008;
Bartko et al. 2009). Cooling in primordial accretion discs is probably
"less efficient due to low metallicity, but this is unlikely to stabilize"
them significantly against self-gravity (Tanaka & Omukai 2014).
5.2 Gas reservoir mass and accretion duty cycle
"The gas reservoir surrounding the SMBH is likely to be turbulent,"
"perhaps composed of streams and orbiting clumps. In this case, the"
streams of gas approaching the SMBH may easily have different
"directions, even if the reservoir as a whole has some angular momen-"
tum. The radius of the feeding reservoir immediately available to the
"SMBH is ∼ 'infl, the radius of influence of the black hole’s gravity"
"(Dehnen & King 2013), which is much higher than the maximum ra-"
"dius of a non-self-gravitating accretion disc. As a result, even a small"
difference in the impact parameter of two streams falling toward the
SMBH will lead to significant differences in the angle of the form-
ing disc (Nayakshin et al. 2012). This suggests that even essentially
continuous accretion can be almost entirely chaotic.
Streams falling in from various directions also continuously
change the orientation of the accretion disc. This happens on ap-
"proximately the dynamical timescale of the reservoir,"

where we scale the reservoir size to 100 pc and the velocity dispersion
to 200 km s−1. This should have little effect on the initial alignment
"between the disc and the hole, because only the warped region of the"
"disc is affected by this. So long as ""BH

smaller than the self-gravity radius and the initial alignment between
the black hole and the disc is not affected by the outer regions of the
Some galaxies have disky structures surrounding their cen-
"tral SMBHs on scales of order 0.1 − 1 pc, e.g. NGC 4258"
"(Herrnstein et al. 2005), IC 2560 (Yamauchi et al. 2012) and NGC"
1068 (Imanishi et al. 2020). Although these are almost certainly
"strongly self-gravitating systems (e.g., Kumar 1999; Lodato & Bertin"
"2003; Martin 2008; Tilak et al. 2008), we can consider, for the sake"
"of argument, what happens if such systems are prevented from frag-"
"menting. Over time, the accretion disc aligns with the black hole"
"in a prograde fashion. However, this this happens on the viscous"
timescale at the radius where the disc angular momentum starts to
"dominate over that of the hole, which is (cf. King et al. 2005)"

"This ratio is much lower than unity except for the smallest black holes,"
and even then only if the feeding reservoir is as large as 100 pc. If
"the black hole is initially fed inside a cloud with radius 'cl ∼ 24 pc,"
the dynamical timescale is shorter than the alignment timescale even
"for a 10 M⊙ seed black hole. As a result, new gas streams effectively"
randomize the direction of the accretion disc much faster than the
disc can cause the SMBH to align with it.
The reservoir is depleted by accretion and small-scale momentum-
"driven feedback, but outflows are unlikely to affect dense gas outside"
of the sphere of influence for as long as the SMBH mass is lower than
"the critical ""f mass (King 2010). The depleted reservoir is contin-"
uously refilled by gas falling in from larger distances throughout the
"host halo. Assuming that the halo is gas-rich, as appropriate for high"

where we scale the gas fraction 5g to the cosmological value 0.16
and the velocity dispersion f to 200 km s−1. This rate is much higher
than the Eddington accretion rate even for a SMBH with the mass
equivalent to Pōniuā’ena . Considering that the most massive black
"holes should reside in haloes with the highest velocity dispersion,"
refilling the reservoir surrounding the black hole is even easier.
5.3 SMBH seeds
"The seed mass we chose, ""0 = 10 M⊙ , is also rather conservative. It"
is comparable to that expected for supernova remnants of present-day
"stars. Early, Population III, stars are expected to be more massive on"
average than present-day ones (Hirano et al. 2014; Susa et al. 2014;
"Stacy et al. 2016); as a result, their explosion remnants might be more"
massive as well. The final mass of the black hole at any given time
"is approximately proportional to the seed mass, so a more massive"
seed makes it slightly easier to grow an extremely massive SMBH
"quickly. Furthermore, the effective seed mass might be higher if the"
black hole forms in a cluster and merges with a few other similar
"black holes while its mass is still small. However, the constraint on"
"SMBH spin, and hence on the maximum level of alignment, hardly"
changes if we assume higher seed masses - this can be seen in Figure
Our model is insensitive to the precise redshift of the formation
"of the black hole seed. In principle, even a seed forming as late as at"
"I ∼ 18, corresponding to C = 180 Myr after the Big Bang, can give"
"rise to Pōniuā’ena , provided that it maintains a duty cycle X = 1,"
"so that Cacc = C. If the seed forms at C = 100 Myr, a duty cycle of"
520/600 ∼− 0.87 is enough.
5.4 The most distant SMBH possible
The possibilities described in sections 5.1 - 5.3 allow for some vari-
"ation of model parameters, but the observational constraints are still"
"tight. They also provide a stringent test for our model. In particular,"
the model would be falsified if an SMBH would be detected at a time
Cobs with a mass greater than
"""max ∼ 100 exp"
Cobs − 100 Myr
27.6 Myr
M⊙ . (12)
"This corresponds to "" = 109 M⊙ at C = 545 Myr after the Big Bang,"
"or, equivalently, I ∼− 9.1. The growth timescale of 27.6 Myr corre-"
"sponds to the purely chaotic SMBH growth model, and we use the"
"large seed mass ""0 = 100 M⊙ for this estimate. Quasars powered by"
such SMBHs - if they exist - should be discovered by upcoming Euclid
(Roche et al. 2012) and Athena (Nandra et al. 2013; Aird et al. 2013)
"missions. Discoveries of slightly less extreme SMBHs, including that"
"of Pōniuā’ena , provide constraints on parameter combinations en-"
"compassing the seed black hole mass, duty cycle, formation time and"
alignment fraction of accretion episodes.
5.5 SMBH space density
Current observational estimates of the space density of extreme high-
"redshift quasars with ! > 1046 erg s−1 are =QSO
<
∼ 10"
−7 Mpc−3
(Kulkarni et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2019; Shen et al. 2020). This lu-
"minosity corresponds to the Eddington limit for a 7.7 × 107 M⊙
SMBH. Quasars with bolometric luminosity ! ∼ 2 × 1047 erg s−1,"
"corresponding to the luminosity of Pōniuā’ena (Yang et al. 2020),"
"are even rarer: =Pon
<
∼ 10"
−8 Mpc−3. Given that we predict an al-
"most 100% duty cycle for these objects, the space density of SMBHs"
should be not much higher than that of quasars. These values allow
us to estimate the rarity of conditions that give rise to such extreme
black holes so quickly.
"The rate of formation of the first stars is estimated at ¤""∗ ∼−
2 − 3 × 10−5 M⊙ yr"
−1 Mpc−3 at I = 20 (Johnson et al. 2008); this
"drops down to ¤""∗ ∼− 10
−6 M⊙ yr"
−1 Mpc−3 at I = 30. These Pop-
"ulation III stars were probably more massive, on average, than stars"
"forming today, with an average mass of ∼ 10−100 M⊙ (Hirano et al."
2014; Susa et al. 2014; Stacy et al. 2016). Approximately half of
the stars may end up forming black holes at the end of their lives
(Heger & Woosley 2002; Hirano et al. 2014). This leads to the forma-
"tion rate of seed black holes of ¤#seed ∼− 5×10
−9−5×10−8 yr−1 Mpc−3"
"at I = 30 and ¤#seed ∼− 10
−7 − 1.5 × 10−6 yr−1 Mpc−3 at I = 20."
Assuming that the seeds of the most extreme quasars must have been
"produced before I = 18 (corresponding to C = 180 Myr, leaving"
"520 Myr for Pōniuā’ena to grow), this gives Cform ∼ 80 Myr for seed"
"formation. Over this period, even the most conservative estimate pro-"
"vides a seed BH density =seed ∼ 0.4 Mpc
−3, and it is possible that"
this density was at least an order of magnitude higher. These val-
ues are consistent with estimates based on numerical modelling of
Population III star formation (Madau & Rees 2001; Volonteri 2010).
"Comparing this value with the quasar space density, we see that if"
only one in 4 × 107 of initial seeds encounters favourable growth
"conditions, the population of extreme quasars observed at I ∼ 6 − 7"
is reproduced.
This result suggests an explanation for the issue of ‘stellar black
"hole starvation’, which is expected at high redshifts (e.g. Pacucci et al."
"2015, 2017; Smith et al. 2018). It happens due to two reasons:"
many nascent stellar black holes can be ejected from their parent
"star-forming halos (Whalen & Fryer 2012), and those that remain"
cannot accrete material efficiently until the fossil HII region that
surrounded the progenitor star cools down (Johnson et al. 2007).
"However, a small fraction of black holes can avoid these issues if"
they are born within a larger protogalactic halo with escape velocity
"Eesc > 100 km s
−1. A natal kick with E < Eesc allows the black hole"
to escape the fossil HII region very quickly. Small-scale feedback
can enhance gas mixing (Dehnen & King 2013) and suppress frag-
"mentation (Alvarez et al. 2009) around these black holes, promoting"
accretion at near-Eddington rates. The expected rarity of these ob-
jects can also explain why they are not reproduced in numerical and
semi-analytical simulations (Smith et al. 2018; Griffin et al. 2019).
We expect that the key parameters determining the growth rate
"of the SMBH vary smoothly over their allowed range; furthermore,"
there are no discontinuities or sharp changes in the dependence of the
"final SMBH mass on these parameters. Due to this, we predict that"
"the mass function of black holes, and of quasars, should be approxi-"
"mately continuous in mass/luminosity, consistent with available ob-"
"servational constraints. However, the slope of the mass function may"
"be very shallow, i.e. the density of less massive black holes might"
not be much higher than that of the most massive ones. The total
X-ray radiation produced by high-redshift quasars suggests that lu-
"minous accretion contributed only < 1000 M⊙ Mpc
−3 to the SMBH"
mass density by redshift I = 6 (Treister et al. 2013). The observed
"quasars already account for d ∼− 〈""BH〉=QSO ∼− 100 M⊙ Mpc
−3, i.e."
> 10% of this limit. This means that the smaller black holes cannot
"have grown very much at these early times. In addition, the lower"
duty cycle of these smaller black holes means that the quasar den-
sity is significantly lower than the SMBH density. These two factors
might explain why the smaller SMBHs at high redshift have not been
detected yet.

High-z SMBHs can grow from stellar seeds 7
5.6 SMBH properties
Our results provide two important and potentially testable predictions
regarding the properties of extreme high-redshift SMBHs: their spins
must be low and they should reside in dense gas environments.
Typical spins of black holes growing through purely chaotic ac-
"cretion settle to 0 < 0.3 in Cacc < 350 Myr. At this time, the black"
"hole mass is only "" ∼ 106 M⊙ . Similarly, if accretion is slightly"
"aligned with ?aligned = 0.2, black hole spin is 0 < 0.5 when its"
"mass is 106 M⊙ or higher. If accretion is aligned more, the black"
hole does not reach a mass of 108 M⊙ over 600 Myr of accretion.
"So the most massive black holes, those with "" > 108 M⊙ , observed"
"when the Universe was ∼ 700 Myr old or younger, should all have"
"spins lower than 0 = 0.5. Among more moderate black holes, with"
"106 M⊙ < "" < 10
8 M⊙ , the spin distribution should be wide, with"
both low and high spin values possible. Black holes with masses
""" < 106<BD= should generally spin rapidly, although low spin val-"
ues should be possible in this population as well. This contrasts with
"available observational constraints on SMBHs in the Local Universe,"
"where black holes with masses "" <∼ 3 × 10
7 M⊙ seem to have spin"
"values close to maximal, and even more massive black holes gen-"
"erally have spins 0 > 0.4 (Vasudevan et al. 2016; Reynolds 2019,"
2020).
There are a few ways of reconciling our prediction with the
"observationally-estimated spins. First of all, the observed high-"
redshift quasars represent an extreme population (see Section 5.5)
and their spins need not be representative of the high-redshift pop-
ulation as a whole. We predict that as SMBHs with more mod-
"est masses are discovered at high redshift, and as their spin esti-"
"mates are obtained, the overall population will come to resemble"
"the locally-observed one more closely, even if not exactly. Secondly,"
the global mass growth of supermassive black holes is expected to
"be dominated by mergers since I ∼ 0.5, i.e. for the past 3-4 Gyr"
(Bassini et al. 2019). Mergers tend to flatten the spin distribution
"(Berti & Volonteri 2008), so even if the extreme quasars have spins"
"representative of the early SMBH population as a whole, the lo-"
cal population will have much more broadly distributed spin values.
"There is tentative observational evidence, based on the evolution"
"AGN jet power, that the typical spins have been increasing at least"
"since I = 1 (Martínez-Sansigre & Rawlings 2011). Finally, observa-"
tional biases lead to easier identification of AGN powered by rapidly
"spinning SMBHs, and the currently observed population is consis-"
tent with a non-negligible number of slowly-spinning black holes
(Vasudevan et al. 2016). The situation should become significantly
clearer once the so-far elusive low mass SMBH population at high
"redshifts will be discovered, with upcoming observatories such as"
Lynx (Gaskin et al. 2019) and Roman (Green et al. 2012). In addi-
"tion, future missions, including Athena (Barret & Cappi 2019) and"
"AXIS (Mushotzky et al. 2019), will be able to measure SMBH spins"
"with unprecedented precision even at high redshift, providing better"
constraints on the evolution of this quantity.
"As spin determines radiative efficiency, information about quasar"
luminosity might also be used to put constraints on black hole spin.
"The average radiative efficiency over the whole growth period is 〈n〉 ∼−
0.058 in the purely chaotic models and increases to 〈n〉 ∼− 0.095 in"
the ?aligned = 0.4 models. In order to power the observed luminosity
"of Pōniuā’ena , !Pon ∼− 1.9 × 10
47 erg s−1, the SMBH should be"
"accreting material at a rate ¤""Pon ∼− 3.34/n M⊙ yr
−1. This translates"
"to 57.64 M⊙ yr
−1 and 35.2 M⊙ yr"
"−1 for the two alignment cases,"
respectively. Assuming this represents the rate of spherical infall
"of fully ionised material at the outer edge of the accretion disc,"
"Aout ∼− 0.01 pc, the expected column density is"
"#H ∼−
¤""Pon"
"4c`<p (2�""PonAout)
1/2"
"∼− 2.7 × 10
24"
"50 M⊙ yr
−1"
0.01 pc
where ` ∼− 0.5 is the mean atomic weight per particle and <p is
the proton mass. The two cases of low- and high-spin SMBH give
"expected hydrogen column density around the Compton-thick limit,"
"#H = 1.5×10
24 cm−2. Future observations might be able to measure"
the X-ray spectrum of these AGN and determine their Compton
"thickness, providing constraints on matter infall rates and, hence, the"
radiative efficiency of accretion.
Our models are consistent with the general expectation of nu-
merical simulations that the most massive SMBHs should be
found in dense environments (Overzier et al. 2009; Costa et al. 2014;
Habouzit et al. 2019). Some observational campaigns confirm this
"(e.g., Kim et al. 2009; Husband et al. 2013), while others don’t"
(Morselli et al. 2014; Mazzucchelli et al. 2017). The discrepancy in
"results may arise due to various selection effects, low-number statis-"
"tics and stochasticity (Buchner et al. 2019). In addition, the host"
galaxies of high-redshift quasars tend to have very high star for-
"mation rates (SFR; Trakhtenbrot et al. 2017; Decarli et al. 2018),"
indicating high gas content. The reason for this correlation in our
model is the requirement of a massive gas reservoir that can feed
"the SMBH while withstanding AGN feedback; in some cases, this"
feedback may be positive and induce a part of the observed high SFR.
"In contrast, other SMBH origin models require the seeds to form in"
the largest dark matter overdensities.
5.7 Other works
Some recent works have investigated the evolution of SMBH spin
"and mass from first principles, both at high redshift or during the"
whole age of the Universe.
Sesana et al. (2014) used a semi-analytical model of galaxy evo-
lution to track the mass and spin evolution of black holes from
high-redshift seeds to the present day. They use several prescriptions
linking the large-scale dynamics of the galaxy to that of the accre-
"tion flow on to the SMBH. In all of them, the flow inherits some"
"memory of the angular momentum of the whole system, leading to"
"partially aligned accretion. Predictably, then, the calculated SMBH"
"spin is generally high, especially at high redshift, when gas accretion"
is the dominant mode of mass growth. The authors did not set out
"to reproduce the observed extreme quasars, but the few examples of"
individual SMBH mass and spin evolution show very little growth
"in the first Gyr after the Big bang. At later times, spin tends to de-"
"cline somewhat, coming into agreement with available low-redshift"
observational constraints.
Griffin et al. (2019) use the Galform semi-analytical galaxy evo-
lution model to track the mass and spin evolution of black holes.
They use stellar black hole seeds and include mergers and chaotic
cold gas accretion as modes of evolution of SMBH spin. They recover
the present-day SMBH mass function and find that SMBHs should
"generally have rather low spins 0 < 0.5, but they do not reproduce"
the extreme high-redshift quasars. This is most likely because of lim-
ited sample size which only allows them to account for SMBH space
densities > 10−7 Mpc−3 at I > 6.
Zhang & Lu (2019) used a model composed of two SMBH growth
phases: an initial super-Eddington coherent phase followed by a
"number of Eddington-limited chaotic episodes. During the latter,"
"MNRAS 000, 1–9 (2019)"
"8 K. Zubovas, A. R. King"
"the SMBH spin decreases, but the equilibrium values are typically"
"higher than in our models, mainly due to the somewhat less stringent"
"constraint on maximum disc mass, which leads to more common"
alignment of the disc and the black hole at the early stages of evo-
"lution. This led the authors to conclude, in (Zhang et al. 2020), that"
a period of super-Eddington growth is necessary to produce the ob-
"served high-redshift quasars. In that paper, they added an additional"
constraint that the currently-observed Eddington ratio of the high-
redshift quasars is the maximum allowed in the chaotic accretion
"periods of SMBH growth, which further constrained the amount of"
mass obtained during chaotic accretion episodes. Given that individ-
ual episodes of SMBH growth are short compared to the total growth
time and that the AGN luminosity can vary significantly during each
"episode, we do not think such a constraint is warranted."
6 CONCLUSION
"With a simple numerical model, we have shown that extremely mas-"
"sive black holes, such as Pōniuā’ena , can grow from stellar mass"
seeds via luminous accretion. The only necessary assumptions are
that the black hole is fed almost continuously from a turbulent reser-
voir that can produce a large number of accretion episodes with initial
mass transfer rates at least equal to the Eddington rate and initially
uncorrelated directions. This chaotic accretion scenario allows the
"black hole to maintain a low spin and, hence, low radiative effi-"
"ciency n ∼− 0.06, which promotes much more rapid growth than the"
canonically-assumed n ∼ 0.1. There is not much scope for relaxation
"of these constraints; in particular, we show that the model would be"
"falsified if a 109 M⊙ SMBH were discovered at I > 9.1, correspond-"
ing to C = 545 Myr after the Big bang. By comparing the observed
space density of extreme quasars with the simulated space density
"of Pop-III star formation, we show that only a very small fraction"
"of seed black holes, ∼ 1 in 4 × 107, have to encounter favourable"
growth conditions to produce the observed SMBHs at I > 6. The
other seeds grow much less efficiently and result in a population that
is much more difficult to observe both due to lower mass and lower
duty cycle.
