ABSTRACT,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,8,8
"The Galactic black hole transient GRS 1915+105 is famous for its markedly variable X-ray and radio behaviour, and for being the
archetypal galactic source of relativistic jets. It entered an X-ray outburst in 1992 and has been active ever since. Since 2018
GRS 1915+105 has declined into an extended low-Ô¨Çux X-ray plateau, occasionally interrupted by multi-wavelength Ô¨Çares. Here
we report the radio and X-ray properties of GRS 1915+105 collected in this new phase, and compare the recent data to historic
observations. We Ô¨Ånd that while the X-ray emission remained unprecedentedly low for most of the time following the decline in
2018, the radio emission shows a clear mode change half way through the extended X-ray plateau in 2019 June: from low Ô¨Çux

entered a low-luminosity canonical hard state, and then transitioned to an unusual accretion phase, characterised by heavy X-ray
absorption/obscuration. Hence, we argue that a local absorber hides from the observer the accretion processes feeding the variable
jet responsible for the radio Ô¨Çaring. The radio‚ÄìX-ray correlation suggests that the current low X-ray Ô¨Çux state may be a signature
of a super-Eddington state akin to the X-ray binaries SS433 or V404 Cyg.",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,583,130

properties in between the hard and the soft state, and during which
short-lived, powerful relativistic radio ejections are observed (Fender
et al. 2009). Quasi-simultaneous X-ray and radio observations of BH
X-ray binaries have been fundamental to the study of the connection
between the accretion and the jet production mechanism, which led
to the establishment of a disc-jet coupling paradigm (Fender et al.

non-linear relation between the X-ray and the radio luminosity, known",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,690,71

38 times. Data were obtained at a central frequency of 1.28 GHz
across a 0.86 GHz bandwidth consisting of either 4096 channels or
32768 channels (in this second case data were binned for consistency
to 4096 channels before any further analysis). Observations covered
the period between 2018 December and 2020 November (MJD 58460

AMI-LA stopped operations, we switched to a weekly monitoring

consisted of an observation with a total duration 90 min, of which 60
min is on-source, 20 minutes is on the Ô¨Çux and band-pass calibrator,
and 3 minutes on the phase calibrator. All other observations had
a total on-source integration time of 15 minutes, and a Ô¨Çux and

by BAT (nominally 15‚Äì150 keV), a count rate to Ô¨Çux conversion
would not be accurate when using the Swift/BAT transient monitor

code developed by Segreto et al. (2010), which is dedicated to the
processing of coded mask instrument data. BatImager performs
image reconstruction via cross-correlation and, for each detected
source, generates light curves and spectra. We processed BAT survey
data from MJD 53347 to MJD 59169, and extracted one spectrum
per day using the oÔ¨Écial BAT spectral redistribution matrix and a
logarithmic binned energy grid. Then, we Ô¨Åt the spectra from 15 keV

"To better compare the current behaviour of GRS 1915+105 with its
past behaviour, as well as with other BH transients, we placed it
on the radio‚ÄìX-ray plane. We measured the radio and X-ray Ô¨Çuxes
corresponding to Plateau 1, Plateau 2, and the Soft Phase taking
the mean in the three phases. Figure 5 shows the radio‚ÄìX-ray points
(in grey) for a number of BH transients considered in Motta et al.
(2017a), plus MAXI J1820+070 from Bright et al. (2020). The error
bars account for both the scatter in the values, and the uncertainty on
the counts-to-Ô¨Çux conversion described above. GRS 1915+105 was
traditionally considered an outlier on the radio‚ÄìX-ray correlation that
the vast majority of BH transients follow, as shown by the red dots
in the Ô¨Ågure, which mark the position that GRS 1915+105 occupied
during its C state phases of its 27-years long outburst (points taken
from Rushton et al. 2010). While during Plateau 2 and during the Soft
Phase GRS 1915+105 still clearly lies away from the other sources
on the plane, during Plateau 1 GRS 1015+105 falls on the correlation,
incidentally approximately in the same position occupied by Cyg X‚Äì1.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1145,71
4 DISCUSSION,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,12,12
"We have presented the results of a comparative radio and X-ray study
of GRS 1915+105, primarily focusing on the evolution of the source
from MJD 58300 (July 2018) to MJD 59200 (November 2020). We
are motivated by the fact that in 2018 the source underwent a Ô¨Çux
decline in the X-rays that might have been interpreted as a transition to
a canonical hard state, possibly preceding a long-expected quiescence
(Truss & Done 2006). Our data show that, despite the low X-ray
Ô¨Çuxes displayed lately, GRS 1915+105 is still very active in radio,
and during the last several months has been showing marked activity",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,604,73
"that is qualitatively very similar to that observed in the past. This
provides evidence for two important facts: Ô¨Årst, that the correlation
between radio and X-ray emission that for many years characterised
GRS 1915+105 (Fender & Belloni 2004) ceased to exist sometime in
June 2019; and second, that the X-ray behaviour alone‚Äìin the absence
of such radio‚ÄìX-ray correlation‚Äìis very misleading, as it oÔ¨Äers only a
partial view of the current state of the source. GRS 1915+105 has not
entered quiescence, and might not be approaching it either (see also
Neilsen et al. 2020 and Koljonen & Hovatta 2021 for a discussion
of this topic). Rather, the accretion processes that must be at work
to feed the jets responsible for the observed radio behaviour are for
some reason not directly visible to the observer.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,804,70
"The low X-ray Ô¨Çuxes observed during Plateau 1, i.e. after the
exponential decline occurred in 2018 (see also Negoro et al. 2018)
appear as highly unusual for GRS 1915+105. Furthermore, the almost",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,195,66
"total lack of variability in the X-ray emission, as opposed to marked
radio Ô¨Çaring observed after June 2019 that characterises Plateau 2",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,136,69
(referred to as the obscured phase by Miller et al. 2020) is certainly,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,70,70
"A radio-bright, X-ray obscured GRS 1915+105",11,TeXGyreTermesX-Italic,,43,43

"unprecedented. Based on the data reported here, and on older data
published by other authors (e.g., Klein-Wolt et al. 2002) Plateau 2
is the longest, lowest Ô¨Çux, and hardest X-ray plateau ever observed
in GRS 1915+105, and the only one associated with marked radio
Ô¨Çaring. Any previous plateau was a plateau both in radio and in the
X-rays, and any Flaring Phase has occurred in both bands.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,390,67
"Since the beginning of Plateau 2, absorption is a constant charac-
teristic of the energy spectra of GRS 1915+105. Our spectral analysis
results are fully consistent with those reported by previous works
(Koljonen & Tomsick 2020; Miller et al. 2020; Neilsen et al. 2020;
Balakrishnan et al. 2020; Koljonen & Hovatta 2021): an obscuring
in-homogeneous medium is required to explain the average spectrum
we extracted from Plateau 2. This agrees with the results from the
Chandra spectra, which were taken when GRS 1915+105 was ob-
served in a deep obscuration state (Miller et al. 2020). Absorption
also impacted the occasional Ô¨Çares captured by",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,643,69

"during the
obscured state",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,25,14
8,7,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1,1
", which still reached a high luminosity, indicating
that the intrinsic X-ray luminosity of GRS 1915+105 is likely not far
from the Eddington limit (Neilsen et al. 2020). The evolution of the
X-ray emission during one particular Ô¨Çare reported by Neilsen et al.
(2020), shows that the Ô¨Çares are characterised by harder-when-brighter
spectra, and require high density and variable in-homogeneous local
absorption, properties very reminiscent of the behaviour of V404
Cyg during a vast majority of the Ô¨Çares observed in 2015 (Motta et al.
2017b). Also reminiscent of V404 Cyg are the spectral properties
of the obscured state around the occasional Ô¨Çares observed. A high
equivalent column density absorber, which was almost completely
covering the emission from the central portion of the accretion Ô¨Çow,
was responsible for the spectrally hard and low Ô¨Çux emission observed
during a number of plateaus during the 2015 outbursts of V404 Cyg
(Motta et al. 2017a; Kajava et al. 2018).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,977,70
"The behaviour and properties of GRS 1915+105 during the ob-
scured state are consistent with those observed in all the systems
displaying phases of strong, variable local absorption: all tend to
show high-amplitude Ô¨Çares. Some noteworthy examples are V4641
Sgr (Revnivtsev et al. 2002), Swift J1858‚Äì0814 (Hare et al. 2020;
Mu√±oz-Darias et al. 2020), and even some Seyfert II Galaxies (Moran
et al. 2001), but perhaps the best example remains that of V404 Cyg.
In the case of V404 Cyg, the behaviour observed both during the
low-Ô¨Çux phases and during Ô¨Çares has been ascribed to the presence
of an inÔ¨Çated accretion disc. Such a thick disc was likely sustained by
radiation pressure induced by high accretion rate episodes, and was
fragmenting out in the clumpy outÔ¨Çow responsible for the local and
variable Compton-thick absorption which aÔ¨Äected the spectra. Some-",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,863,71

et al. (2020) showed that the absorber in GRS 1915+105, besides
being in-homogeneous, requires a multi-temperature proÔ¨Åle, and it is
likely radially stratiÔ¨Åed. On the one hand, Miller et al. (2020) showed
that at least two types of media form this absorber: an inner bound
(failed) magnetic wind, and an outer, cooler component which could
be a thermally-driven outÔ¨Çow. In this scenario, the failed wind would",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,573,71

plane, we see that for the Ô¨Årst time since its discovery, during Plateau
1 the system was consistently located on the correlation traced by
the majority of known BH transients. During both Plateau 2 and the
Soft Phase the position of GRS 1915+105 in the radio‚ÄìX-ray plane
conÔ¨Årms that a large fraction of the X-ray Ô¨Çux is lost. If, for the sake
of the argument, we assume that the correlation holds during Plateau

X-ray correlation strictly holds only during the canonical hard state

the radio and X-ray emission can be directly compared. The above
estimate is intended only as an indication of the overall behaviour of
the source, the emission being so heavily modiÔ¨Åed by absorption, we
have no means to conÔ¨Årm the X-ray state of the source.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,493,71

certainly unusual for GRS 1915+105, which has never been observed
before in a low-luminosity canonical hard state (but see Gallo et al.
2003). Instead, despite the fact that Plateau 2 has been dubbed ‚Äòthe

GRS 1915+105 did not really enter the outburst phase in 1992, when",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,131,66

a number of AGN classes, but the speciÔ¨Åc multi-band behaviour of
GRS 1915+105 has clear counterparts in AGN (Miller et al. 2020). So,
how does this new observed state of GRS 1915+105‚Äìheavily absorbed

absorbers on diÔ¨Äerent scales aÔ¨Äect the X-ray spectrum: from dust

", comparable
to those measured in the X-ray spectra of GRS 1915+105 in Plateau 2,
are inferred from hard X-ray observations of local radio galaxies (see
Ursini et al. 2018, and references therein) and young radio sources
(e.g., Mrk 668, Guainazzi et al. 2004). The radio jet activity of young
radio sources is also intermittent, possibly due to the interaction with
the X-ray absorbing dense circumnuclear medium. However, most of
the X-ray absorbers found in these sources are likely found on parsec
scales and beyond. Compton-thick absorbers on accretion disc‚Äìscales
are observed in some Changing-Look AGN (e.g., Risaliti et al. 2005),
but their time scales for variability, once scaled down to stellar mass
black holes, are much shorter than what is observed in GRS 1915+105.
Thus, a phenomenon similar to the one observed in GRS 1915+105
has not been identiÔ¨Åed in AGN, yet.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,877,72
"Finally, while accreting super-massive BHs and stellar-mass black
holes are connected by the same fundamental physics (Merloni et al.
2003; Falcke et al. 2004), which governs their inner accretion Ô¨Çow,",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,201,67
"their larger-scale structure diÔ¨Äer quite appreciably. In particular,
accreting stellar mass BH have a companion star, the behaviour of
which can potentially greatly aÔ¨Äect the long-term behaviour of the
accretion disc. Neilsen et al. (2020) speculated that if a vertically
extended outer accretion disc is responsible for the obscuration in
GRS 1915+105, its formation might have been triggered by changes
in the companion star, e.g. an increase in the mass supply into
the accretion disc, which necessarily would trigger a change in the
accretion Ô¨Çow from the outside-in. The fact that an equivalent of the
obscured state seen in GRS 1915+105 has not been seen in AGN
might support this hypothesis.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,698,69
5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,25,25
"In 2018, the black hole binary GRS 1915+105, after 25 years of",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,62,62
"high-luminosity X-ray activity, decayed to a prolonged low-Ô¨Çux X-ray
state. Due to this relatively sudden change in the X-ray behaviour of",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,138,69
"GRS 1915+105, some were led to believe that its outburst, the longest",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,69,69
"ever observed from a black hole X-ray binary, was approaching its
end.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,70,65
"We analysed the simultaneous X-ray and radio data collected over
almost 3 decades with various facilities, focusing on the most recent
evolution of the system. Our data show that at the beginning of the
dim X-ray state GRS 1915+105 was also relatively faint in radio.
Since June 2019 the system has been showing marked radio activity,
characterised by the signatures of relativistic jets, and X-ray spectra
aÔ¨Äected by high and variable in-homogeneous absorption. Our results
show that more recently GRS 1915+105, while still aÔ¨Äected by heavy
absorption, transitioned to a softer state, which was accompanied by
a decrease in the radio Ô¨Çaring that resumed when GRS 1915+105
moved back to a hard(er) state.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,704,71
"We argue that GRS 1915+105 Ô¨Årst transitioned to a low-luminosity
hard state, similar to the canonical hard state shown by many other
black hole X-ray binaries, and then entered a prolonged obscured
phase. In this phase the highly variable radio jets we have been
observing for months must be fed by the same sort of accretion
processes that have been seen often in the past in GRS 1915+105,",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,390,67
and are now happening behind a complex layer of absorbing material.,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,67,67
"We therefore conclude that GRS 1915+105 is far from being in
quiescence, even though a substantial change in the accretion Ô¨Çow‚Äì
perhaps the launch of a powerful outÔ¨Çow and/or the thickening of
the outer disc‚Äìmust have occurred at some point around June 2019.
The behaviour of GRS 1915+105 in the obscured state appears to
have no counterpart in its super-massive relatives, the AGN, where
the time-scales typical of similar radio-bright obscured phases (once
they are scaled up in mass) are either much longer, or much shorter
than in GRS 1915+105.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,548,69
