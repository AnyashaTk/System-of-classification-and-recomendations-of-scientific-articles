"many studies, no consensual solution has yet emerged.
Many experimental searches are being carried out. They
are based either on direct (reviews are given in [1–3]) or
indirect (see [4–6]) detections. The production of dark
matter particles by accelerators has also been actively
considered (see,",9,CMR10,,296,58

so far. Quite a lot of “anomalies” have been registered,
for example the overabundance of positrons in cosmic
rays [9–11] and the excess of GeV gamma rays from the
Galactic Center [12]. However none are truly convincing
as conventional astrophysical processes can account for
the claimed anomalies.
Theoretically, many models are being built and there is
no point listing them here (one can,",9,CMR10,,430,56

in [16], that is the tunneling of light black holes (BHs)
into metastable white hole (WH) relics. In a sense, this
would provide a (quantum) gravitational solution to the
old dark matter mystery, without relying on modiﬁed",9,CMR10,,275,57

then point out several weaknesses ruling out the asso-

amplitude and in frequency. But the object resulting
from the “coalescence” might be detectable if it were to
emit a Planck-energy quantum. This makes sense as it
is naively expected to relax to the state of metastable
Planck-mass WH relic. If considering the Auger detector
[80], this ﬂux would be too small for a detection. For a
detector of the Euso [81] class, the rate reaches an event
per decade. When considering long run projects planning
to use Jupiter as a cosmic-ray detector [74], as mentioned
in the previous sections, the expected ﬂux becomes of the
order of a dozen events per year, which is experimentally",9,CMR10,,673,58
