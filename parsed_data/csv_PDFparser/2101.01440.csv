ABSTRACT,9,CMR10,,8,8
The enrichment of coronal loops and the slow solar wind with elements that have low First Ionisation,9,CMR10,,100,100
"Potential, known as the FIP eﬀect, has often been interpreted as the tracer of a common origin. A
current explanation for this FIP fractionation rests on the inﬂuence of ponderomotive forces and
turbulent mixing acting at the top of the chromosphere. The implied wave transport and turbulence
mechanisms are also key to wave-driven coronal heating and solar wind acceleration models. This work
makes use of a shell turbulence model run on open and closed magnetic ﬁeld lines of the solar corona
to investigate with a uniﬁed approach the inﬂuence of magnetic topology, turbulence amplitude and
dissipation on the FIP fractionation. We try in particular to assess whether there is a clear distinction
between the FIP eﬀect on closed and open ﬁeld regions.",9,CMR10,,753,105

INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"The First Ionization Potential (FIP) eﬀect is an en-
richment of heavy elements with low-FIP such as Fe,
Si and Mg compared with photospheric abundances. It
was initially measured in the solar wind and Solar En-
ergetic Particles (SEPs) and later inferred from spectro-
scopic observations of the corona (see Meyer 1985a,b;
Bochsler et al. 1986; Gloeckler & Geiss 1989; Feldman
1992, and references therein). The FIP bias, i.e. the ra-
tio of coronal to photospheric abundances, is moreover",9,CMR10,,490,57
"mass independent. This means that processes below the
transition region are strongly aﬀecting the hydrostatic
balance of the partially ionized chromosphere. Early on,
explanations of the FIP eﬀect involved diﬀusion, ﬂows
or some sort of turbulent mixing in the chromosphere to
prevent any gravitational settling (see, e.g. Marsch et al.
1995; Schwadron et al. 1999).",9,CMR10,,366,59
"Schwadron et al. (1999) favored the hypothesis of tur-
bulent wave heating in the chromosphere as a way to
both prevent a mass-dependant fractionation and to",9,CMR10,,157,54
"obtain a low-FIP bias. Later on, Laming (2004) pro-",9,CMR10,,51,51
"posed the ponderomotive acceleration, i.e. the time av-
eraged gradient of magnetic ﬂuctuations, as the origin
of the FIP eﬀect. The ponderomotive acceleration has",9,CMR10,,163,55
"this advantage that it may change sign and could ex-
plain the inverse FIP eﬀect observed in low-mass stars
(Wood & Linsky 2010; Laming 2015). Both processes
rely on Alfv´en waves propagating parallel and anti-
parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld, to trigger a turbulent cas-
cade through non-linear interactions and heating. These
wave populations naturally arise in coronal loops, where
footpoints motions excite the loop on both ends, but
they are also expected in the open solar wind where re-
ﬂection on large scale gradients (Velli et al. 1989; Zhou &",9,CMR10,,551,59

one observed in coronal loops (Geiss et al. 1995). Af-

& Chandran 2013; Shoda et al. 2018b; R´eville et al.",9,CMR10,,216,57

"600 km/s), through the ponderomotive force
(Alazraki & Couturier 1971; Belcher 1971; Jacques 1977;
Leer et al. 1982). The low-FIP bias of the slow wind is
often understood as the proof that the it originates in
coronal loops, through exchange and magnetic reconﬁg-
uration (or reconnection) in the low corona (see, e.g.,
Antiochos et al. 2012). Yet, if turbulence is both re-
sponsible for the solar wind acceleration and the FIP
eﬀect, can we rule out a scenario where FIP fractiona-
tion occurs in purely open regions?",9,CMR10,,520,55
"We investigate this question using a coupled modelling
approach. First, we extract unidimensional proﬁles of
open solar wind ﬂux tubes and coronal loops using a
multi-dimensional MHD code (R´eville et al. 2020b). We
then use the",9,CMR10,,228,54

cade and dissipation of purely transverse perturbations
of velocity and magnetic ﬁeld along these proﬁles. We
perform a parameter study where we vary the geom-
etry, the initial perturbation amplitude and the initial
injection scale, and discuss their eﬀect on the turbulence
properties in the chromosphere and transition region.
We estimate the resulting FIP biases with an analytical
fractionation model.",9,CMR10,,460,58

the key parameter of the current FIP models is the pon-
deromotive force, or the wave pressure exerted by the

thus signiﬁcant, especially at the transition region and
Alfv´en waves can have an inﬂuence on the coronal abun-
dances. For cases C, however, the ﬁrst striking feature is
the net decrease of the ponderomotive acceleration be-
low the Sun’s gravity pull. This means that although the
turbulent heating is perfectly compatible with what is
necessary to power the solar wind (compare especially
case CH1 A with CH1 C), this set of parameter will
likely not create a low-FIP bias through the pondero-
motive acceleration. In these last cases, the turbulence
injection scale is 10 times smaller, i.e. the size of large
granules. The initial amplitude is logically lower as the
injection is made later in the cascade, which can explain",9,CMR10,,804,59

slightly enhanced, because the average turbulent veloc-
ity given by equation (14) is lower than the value used

cases C start to show enrichment in low-FIP elements.
Moreover, the hierarchy between the diﬀerent magnetic
conﬁgurations is much less visible in Figure 6. CH2 cases
have for instance, properties very similar to LO1 cases.

lence is important to build FIP fractionation models.",9,CMR10,,549,57

DISCUSSION,9,CMR10,,10,10
"In this work, we have combined several models and
tools to assess the eﬃciency of the Alfv´enic turbulence
in enriching abundances of low-FIP elements in the low
corona. First, we used a global MHD model to get real-",9,CMR10,,216,56
"istic proﬁles of the Alfv´en speed and velocity gradients
in both coronal holes and coronal loops, starting from
the low chromosphere. They are indeed fundamental in
the ampliﬁcation, reﬂection and non linear interaction
of propagating Alfv´en waves. Then, we took advantage
of the",9,CMR10,,281,57
Shell-Atm,9,CMCSC10,,9,9
"code to compute the interaction be-
tween counter-propagating Alfv´en waves, the turbulent
cascade and the dissipation. Our approach certainly
lacks self-consistency, as, for instance, the heating ob-
tained with the shell model is signiﬁcantly larger in coro-
nal loops than in coronal holes (at least for cases A and
B), while the MHD simulation has a much more ho-
mogeneous heating. It is, however, the ﬁrst time that
both coronal loops and coronal holes are treated with a
shell turbulence model. This model solves the fully non-
linear incompressible Alfv´en wave equations, including
the cascading process and the frequency dependant re-
ﬂections and interactions of Alfv´en wave populations.
This is an improvement in comparison with analytical
non-WKB approach of previous works (see Laming 2004,
2009, 2012). Moreover, the dissipation is treated phys-",9,CMR10,,861,59
"ically at very high Lundquist numbers, which cannot
be achieved in direct numerical simulations (see, e.g.,
Dahlburg et al. 2016).",9,CMR10,,130,55

ible MHD to this problem are in order. Reduced MHD

"acoustic modes and fast modes, and the refraction of
the latter downwards back to the chromosphere for large
perpendicular wavenumbers. The parametric decay in-
stability (PDI), involving compressible processes, is also
excluded. The latter plays a role in the formation of
the turbulent spectrum and the balance of inward and
outward Alfv´en wave population, but is eﬀective most
in the lower beta regions higher up in the corona (see
Tenerani & Velli 2013; Shoda et al. 2018b; R´eville et al.
2018). As noted in Verdini et al. (2019); Shoda et al.
(2019), density ﬂuctuations created by the PDI increase
the inward Alfv´en waves amplitude and eventually in-
crease the turbulent heating in the open wind regions.
Wave steepening, shocks and mode conversion, which
do create a cascade in the direction parallel to the mag-
netic ﬁeld, have typical spectra",9,CMR10,,856,58

"close to the Kolmogorov and Iroshnikov-Kraichnan phe-
nomenology (see Figure 3). Alfv´en wave coupling with
magneto-acoustic modes may accelerate the perpendic-
ular cascade, but because we run the simulation until a
pseudo steady-state is reached, this is likely not a strong
limitation of our approach. Numerous other modelers
have made similar approximations to our own, as for
example the studies by van Ballegooijen et al. (2011);
Perez & Chandran (2013); van Ballegooijen & Asgari-
Targhi (2016, 2017); Chandran & Perez (2019). This
study has no intention to be exhaustive, but we do ex-
amine a signiﬁcant input parameter space in order to
extract meaningful insights on the problem.",9,CMR10,,690,59
"Our study shows that, assuming that turbulence is
the dominant factor in the coronal heating and solar
wind acceleration, a ponderomotive force can appear in
the chromosphere and the transition region, and can be
strong enough to create a low-FIP bias. This depends
however on the turbulence parameters. Injecting energy
at the scales of super granules provide the wave am-",9,CMR10,,373,54
"plitude necessary for a low-FIP bias comparable with
observations (see, e.g. Feldman 1992). The force is re-
lated to the a ampliﬁcation of the waves in the corona
and the strong gradient that appears at the transition
region. Nevertheless, if the energy is injected at the
scale of granules, the resulting ponderomotive accelera-
tion seems too weak to explain the observations. Recent
works have debated of the right injection scale parame-
ters (van Ballegooijen & Asgari-Targhi 2017; Chandran
& Perez 2019), and the amplitude of the ponderomotive",9,CMR10,,550,56

lence models.",9,CMR10,,68,54

is not exclusive to coronal loops. Interestingly, we ob-",9,CMR10,,111,56

"tain signiﬁcant low-FIP bias for open ﬁeld conﬁgurations
along the streamer (CH2). We also have usually little
FIP bias for the LO1 loop, i.e. the loop at the very edge
of the helmet streamer. This result might seem in op-
position with previous works, such as the one of Laming
(2004, 2015). Their result is indeed the consequence of
resonant Alfv´en waves in the loops, likely triggered by
reconnection, which amplify signiﬁcantly the pondero-
motive acceleration. Injecting transverse motions from
the inner boundary, we do not observe such resonances,
and further studies are needed to compare the relative
importance of diﬀerent triggers. We do show however
that resonances are not needed to obtain a low-FIP bias
in coronal loops and open slow wind regions. This study
thus questions, anyhow, the necessity of interchange re-
connection to explain the composition of the slow solar
wind.",9,CMR10,,893,57

the solar chromosphere is very simple. We assume, fol-",9,CMR10,,111,56
"lowing Laming (2004, 2009) and writing equation (12),
that proton drag, collisions and turbulent mixing, are
exactly compensating for the Sun’s gravity pull in the
chromosphere. The actual balance of all these processes
remains very hard to estimate. Shocks and compress-
ible ﬂuctuations are also believed to be signiﬁcant in
the chromosphere and even in the transition region (see
Carlsson et al. 2019, for a recent review) and are not ac-
counted for in the shell simulations. Ongoing works are
dedicated to build a compressible kinetic-ﬂuid model, in-
cluding heavy ions populations with various charge state
and their interactions with protons and waves.",9,CMR10,,659,58
