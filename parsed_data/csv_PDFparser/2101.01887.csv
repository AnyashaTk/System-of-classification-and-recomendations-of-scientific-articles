ABSTRACT,9,CMR10,,8,8
"Environmental eﬀects are crucial to the understanding of the evolution of galaxies in dense environ-
ments, such as galaxy clusters. Using the large ﬁeld-of-view of SITELLE, the unique imaging fourier
transform spectrograph at CFHT, we are able to obtain 2D spectral information for a large and com-
plete sample of cluster galaxies out to the infall region. We describe a pipeline developed to identify
emission line galaxies (ELGs) from the datacube using cross-correlation techniques. We present results
based on the spatial oﬀsets between the emission-line regions and stellar continua in ELGs from two
z
0.25 galaxy clusters, Abell 2390 and Abell 2465. We ﬁnd a preference in the oﬀsets being pointed",9,CMR10,,705,103

ies within the virial radius having the oﬀsets to be pointed away from the cluster center. Assuming
the oﬀset being a proxy for the velocity vector of a galaxy, as expected from ram pressure stripping,
this excess indicates that ram pressure stripping occurs most eﬀectively during the ﬁrst passage of an
infalling galaxy, leading to the quenching of its star formation. We also ﬁnd that, outside the virial

INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"It is an established consensus that the evolution of
galaxies is aﬀected by their environment, especially in
high density regions such as rich galaxy clusters (e.g.,
Ellingson et al. 2001, Lewis et al. 2002, Kauﬀmann et al.
2004, Boselli & Gavazzi 2006, Poggianti et al. 2006,

2012, Foltz et al. 2018, Pintos-Castro et al. 2019). In
galaxy clusters the interplay between galaxies and the",9,CMR10,,443,57

"formation in galaxies, i.e., the suppression or cessation
of star formation, aside from their internal secular evolu-
tions. Such external eﬀects shape the observed correla-
tion between the star formation rate (SFR) and the envi-
ronmental density (e.g., Balogh et al. 1998, G´omez et al.
2003, Peng et al. 2010, Kawinwanichakij et al. 2017),
which is closely related to the well-known morphology-
density relation (e.g., Dressler 1980, Goto et al. 2003,
Postman et al. 2005).",9,CMR10,,477,59
One of the breakthroughs of present-day observational,9,CMR10,,53,53
"techniques is 2D imaging spectroscopy, such as the In-
tegral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopy. Several recent, or

et al. 2018), have been transforming the ﬁeld of extra-
galactic studies.
In particular, observations with 2D
imaging spectroscopy have unveiled novel and important
insights about impacts of environments on galaxy evo-
lution in high density regions (e.g., Brough et al. 2013,

"Many possible external quenching mechanisms have
been investigated in the past two decades: gas strip-
ping, starvation, harassment, thermal evaporation, pre-
processing, etc. (see Boselli & Gavazzi 2006 for a re-
view). Among all the competing quenching mechanisms,
the dynamical interaction of the gas in the cluster galaxy
with the intracluster medium (ICM), typically in the
form of ram pressure stripping (Gunn & Gott 1972), has
been considered to be one of the most eﬃcient physi-",9,CMR10,,486,58
"cal mechanisms to quench star formation activities in
star-forming galaxies (SFGs) through the removal of
cold gas. For example, Muzzin et al. (2014) concluded
that ram pressure stripping is the most plausible mecha-
nism for satellite quenching by investigating the dynam-
ics and quenching timescales of z
1 cluster galaxies in
the GCLASS survey; Boselli et al. (2016) found rapid
quenching timescales accompanied with HI deﬁciencies

has been widely found in many other observational and
simulation works (e.g., Abadi et al. 1999, Fujita & Na-

cation of the action of ram pressure. Star formation
could subsequently occur in the disturbed gas and in-

gas in cluster galaxies is promising for shedding light
on the mechanism of ram pressure stripping and placing
constraints on numeric simulations of their evolutions
in dense environments. For example, many interesting

Fringe Reduction using Low-pass Filtering,9,CMTI10,,41,41
"The interferometric nature of SITELLE and the pres-
ence of strong sky-lines in the C4 ﬁlter induce fringes
across the ﬁeld in speciﬁc channels. The fringes are su-
perimposed on the uneven large-scale background that
has been subtracted in Section 3.1 . The level of con-
tamination from these fringes depends on the channel
wavelength, the number of mirror steps, and the posi-
tion in the ﬁeld. In general, channels around stronger
sky-lines with fewer mirror steps (i.e. lower spectral res-
olution) present brighter fringes away from the ﬁeld cen-
ter. The brightness and spatial pattern of these fringes
diﬀer from channel to channel, which makes it challeng-
ing to model them from ﬁrst principles. The brightness
of fringes vary across the ﬁeld and could be compara-
ble to/brighter than a large number of sources, aﬀecting
the source detection, ELG identiﬁcation, and potentially
their measurements. We adopt an empirical method to
reduce the inﬂuence of fringes by applying low-pass ﬁl-
tering (LPF) on each channel. Details of the LPF pro-
cedure and a ﬁgure illustrating the fringes and cleaning",9,CMR10,,1107,59

by strong outﬂow or tidal force. It may also be aﬀected
by large star-forming clumps and dust geometry in the

such an oﬀset has a connection with the host cluster, i.e.,
it is caused by environmental factors. Internal mecha-
nisms such as outﬂows are expected to be uncorrelated
with the cluster center. We note that, alternatively, one
can measure the morphological centroids of the regions

ICM on the galaxy are expected to be closely linked to
the infalling galaxy’s orbit and position in the cluster.
Because small spatial oﬀsets are prone to be aﬀected by
measurement uncertainties, we further limit our sample
to ELGs with a cutoﬀ in the measured oﬀset. We choose
a physical length of 1 kpc that is higher than the peak

move up to region II in the phase space diagram due
to the viewing angle of the orbit. As a consequence,
region III also contains galaxies in their ﬁrst passage.
Another concern is that an infalling galaxy physically",9,CMR10,,780,60

"on the phase space diagram. For an extreme case,
a galaxy following an orbit along the line of sight could
have strong emission-lines detected if there is ongoing
star formation, but it would barely move in the radial
axis. However, in this case the gas oﬀset is also pro-
jected, which makes it more likely to have a small ∆",9,CMR10,,325,57

Excess of Gas Oﬀset Vectors toward the Cluster,8,CMTI9,,46,46

"The number ratios of blue to red symbols in region
II (6:2 in A2390, and 8:1 in A2465 combining two sub-
clusters) suggest that ﬁrst-infalling galaxies have a pref-
erence for their ionized gas oﬀsets to point away from
the cluster center when they approach the orbit pericen-
ters. The probability to have such ratios by coincidence
is 11% for A2390, 4% for A2465, and 1% combining the
two, assuming an equal opportunity (i.e. a binomial
distribution with p=0.5) for the oﬀset vector to point
toward/away from the center.",9,CMR10,,522,59
"Such preference can be attributed to the impact of
the radial component of the ram pressure on the clus-
ter galaxy. The result is consistent with the other ob-
servational evidence and simulations that suggest ram
pressure stripping has substantial eﬀects when gas-rich
galaxies cross the cluster virial radius and is most eﬀec-
tive in their ﬁrst infall (e.g., Jaﬀ´e et al. 2016, 2018; Lotz
et al. 2019). Because of the eﬃcient removal of cold gas,
star formation has been mostly suppressed before the
incoming galaxies turn around and start their second",9,CMR10,,556,62

"Starvation/strangulation may also play an important
role in quenching cluster galaxies (e.g., Haines et al.
2013, Peng et al. 2015) in which a cutoﬀ of gas supply
into the galaxy leads to the long-term exhaustion of gas
and thus a drop in the SFR. Whether the eﬀect is domi-
nant for the evolution of cluster galaxies has not reached
a consensus (e.g., Boselli et al. 2014, Peng et al. 2015).
However, such process operates on a longer timescale

region II (which have fallen into the cluster",9,CMR10,,209,55

"1

ago), ram pressure stripping is the predominant quench-
ing mechanism, although it is likely that halting the gas",9,CMR10,,121,57
supply also catalyzes the process. Combining with other,9,CMR10,,55,55
"information such as the SFR, and gas fraction, and gas
kinematics, etc., future analyses using large samples of
clusters would be promising in distinguishing the con-
tributions of diﬀerent quenching mechanisms.",9,CMR10,,211,56

"Roughly equal numbers of blue (oﬀset away from the
center) and red (oﬀset toward the center) symbols are
observed in the lower-velocity regions (regions I and III).
If a galaxy showing an oﬀset toward the center has al-
ready entered and left region II and returned to region
I (Figure 12), ram pressure stripping is expected to re-
move most of the gas and lower the level of star forma-
tion. However, they may still have detectable emission
lines, which indicates the existence of ionized gas. Sev-
eral origins may explain their detected line emission and
gas oﬀsets: (1) they have low orbit inclinations, i.e., be-
ing more face-on (the light dashed trajectory in Figure
12), which leaves a larger projected gas oﬀset, and thus
have higher chances to be included in the selected sample
during the “backsplash” stage. (2) They could be low-
velocity infalling galaxies with large impact parameters.",9,CMR10,,902,59
"The lower incoming velocities cause the ram pressure
to be low near orbit pericenters. (3) They might con-
tain face-on high-velocity ﬂy-bys that spend less time
near the pericenters. For a ﬂy-by, the gas is only par-
tially stripped by ram pressure after the passage close to
the cluster core, but the disturbance could be prominent
due to its high velocity. (4) They contain contamination
from outﬂows, which presumably do not have a direc-
tional correlation with the cluster. Projection eﬀects
make it challenging to disentangle the infalling histories",9,CMR10,,556,58

ent dynamics and initial conditions mix together. But

"Finally, it is noteworthy that although the result of
A2465 is consistent with A2390, the infalling history
discussed in Section 5.2.1 may not fully apply to A2465.
This is because most interpretations on the phase space
diagram here assume a single, undisturbed, cluster,
which may not be fully applicable to merging clusters
due to the possibly more complicated ICM condition
and galaxy dynamics. In addition, a selection eﬀect ex-

ing carried out to study properties of ELGs (morphol-
ogy, kinematics, abundance, SFR, etc.) and quench-
ing mechanisms in dense environments. We have devel-
oped a pipeline using the cross-correlation technique to
detect and identify ELGs from the datacube acquired
by SITELLE. So far, we have obtained a list of ELG
samples in two galaxy clusters, Abell 2390 and Abell
2465, with 194 ELGs from three ﬁelds of A2390 and 110
ELGs from the central ﬁeld of A2465. The spatially-",9,CMR10,,513,56

role in shaping and removing the gas reservoirs of clus-

"Below we describe the low-pass ﬁltering (LPF) tech-
nique used to remove fringes on the SITELLE datacube.
A source detection with an S/N threshold of 3 is ﬁrst
run on the stack image using the python photometric
package",9,CMR10,,219,53
photutils,9,CMTT10,,9,9
"to pick out possible sources. These
sources are masked before the LPF procedure to avoid
them being over-subtracted. Next, LPF is performed on
each channel by convolving the image with an elliptical
gaussian kernel elongated in the x-axis to construct a
low-frequency components image and then subtracting
it from the original image. The method is based on the",9,CMR10,,360,55
"fact that the fringes are high-frequency components that
are relatively continuous along the x-axis but may radi-
cally change its brightness in the y-axis. In practice, we
adopt a kernel size with FWHM of 28 pix in the x-axis
and 7 pix in the y-axis. The kernel size is determined
by experimenting with diﬀerent sizes to reach a trade-oﬀ
between reducing the high-frequency fringes and avoid-
ing over-subtraction of faint candidates that are possibly
missed in the initial detection.",9,CMR10,,485,58
"After iterating through all the channels, a source de-
tection is run again on the low-pass-ﬁltered datacube,
again with all of the detected sources masked. The
convolve-subtract-detect-mask process is repeated until
the change in the number of detected sources is smaller
than 5% in order to capture as many faint sources as pos-
sible. The eﬃcacy of the LPF is clear by comparing the
upper two panels of Figure 14 showing the same cutout
of a channel that suﬀered from fringes before and af-
ter LPF, where contamination from fringes occurring in
the left panel has been mitigated as shown in the right
panel. Two sample spectra extracted in the A2390E",9,CMR10,,654,57
"ﬁeld, which are ELGs identiﬁed using procedures in Sec-
tion 3.6, are shown in Figure 15 to demonstrate the eﬀect
of the LPF on the extracted spectra. The LPF process-
ing can greatly reduce additional noise caused by fringes
in channels between 7980 ˚A and 8030 ˚A where strong
sky-lines are located, thus facilitating the detection and
identiﬁcation of faint emission-line candidates.",9,CMR10,,386,58
"Because of the ﬁnite kernel size used, in some chan-
nels there exist fringe residuals whose spatial variation
is smaller than the kernel. This can be observed in",9,CMR10,,162,57
the upper-right panel of Figure 14. To further clean,9,CMR10,,52,52
"the residuals and facilitate candidate detection, we ap-
ply a moving average processing to construct a new de-
tection datacube: the low-pass-ﬁltered datacube is con-",9,CMR10,,167,56

ing the large-scale background. The brightness of the fringes
does not follow a regular pattern. Upper right: image of the

age. Lower left: image of the same channel but each pixel is

"spectral), i.e., for a single spaxel its value is taking the
mean of contiguous pixels in 2D and in the adjacent
four channels. This takes advantage of the feature of
the fringe pattern that it moves across the ﬁeld as the
scanning/wavelength proceeds/increases. As a result,
residuals in nearby channels are expected to be more
or less cancel out. The moving average processing also
reduces the sky noise. Note this new datacube is only
used for source detection, not for centroid measurement",9,CMR10,,493,60

"uum are in general small relative to the seeing and there-

noted that the centroid of an object can be measured to
a considerably higher precision than the seeing, depend-
ing on the S/N of the object. We perform several exper-
iments with a control sample to demonstrate the robust-
ness and eﬀectiveness of the centroid measurements.",9,CMR10,,390,58
"The control sample is constructed using unsatu-
rated stars cross-matched with PAN-STARRS (Cham-
bers et al. 2016) and is matched with the ELG sample
in terms of S/N as follows: we randomly draw a star
from the crossmatch and choose a medium wide win-
dow in its spectrum with channels in it to represent the
pseudo-emission. The rest of the channels are used as
the continuum. Edges and channels in the presence of
strong sky-lines are excluded. The pseudo-emission and
continuum images are constructed from these channels
with which centroids are measured in the same approach
as Section 4.1 except that the continuum is not sub-
tracted from the emission. This process is repeated for
500 times ﬁeld by ﬁeld to build a parent sample for each
