technique has its own unique beneﬁts and challenges.
With the invention of wide ﬁeld optical telescopes, per-
forming optical surveys to ﬁnd overdensities of galaxies
is relatively cheap, although optical surveys are strongly
aﬀected by projection eﬀects. For SZ surveys, we are ca-
pable of detecting galaxy clusters up to relatively high
redshift since the SZ signature is redshift independent.
On the other hand, the SZ signature depends strongly",9,CMR10,,789,59
"on mass, restricting current-generation surveys to only
the most massive clusters (Carlstrom et al. 2002; Motl
et al. 2005). Lastly, X-ray surveys have been one of
the most popular techniques to discover galaxy clusters
since the launch of the ROSAT X-ray satellite (e.g., the
REFLEX survey (B¨ohringer et al. 2004)). Even though
X-ray surveys can only produce ﬂux-limited samples of
galaxy clusters, cosmologists can take that into account
in their selection function when they estimate cosmolog-

"6, we have started to question our understanding of
the X-ray-survey selection function. The Phoenix clus-
ter was detected in several previous X-ray surveys, but
was misidentiﬁed as a bright point source based on its
extremely bright active galactic nucleus (AGN) and cool
core in the center of the cluster. With most X-ray surveys
identifying objects as either a point-like or an extended
source, a galaxy cluster with a bright point source in the
center could be misidentiﬁed as simply a point source.
The next logical step is to ask how many of these galaxy
clusters we have missed in the previous surveys, and how
this translates to a correction for the selection function.
Another beneﬁt of ﬁnding galaxy clusters hosting
bright X-ray point sources is to study the cooling ﬂow
problem, which is the apparent disagreement between
the X-ray luminosity (cooling rate) of a cluster and the
observed star formation rate, the latter which is typi-
cally suppressed by a factor of",9,CMR10,,979,59
∼,9,CMSY10,,1,1
"100. The best candi-
date for explaining the inconsistency is AGN feedback
from the central galaxy (Bower et al. 2006; Croton et al.",9,CMR10,,132,57
"2006; Bower et al. 2008). There are two main modes of
AGN feedback: the kinetic mode, driven mostly by jets,
and the radiative mode, driven by the accretion of the
AGN (Fabian 2012; McNamara & Nulsen 2012; Harri-
son 2017; Gaspari et al. 2020). With very few known
galaxy clusters with extremely bright quasars, such as
H1821+643 (Russell et al. 2010), 3C 186 (Siemiginowska
et al. 2005, 2010), 3C 254 (Crawford & Fabian 2003;
Yang et al. 2018), IRAS09104+4109 (O’Sullivan et al.
2012), and the Phoenix cluster (McDonald et al. 2012),
a larger number of such objects are required to fully un-
derstand the role of radiative-mode feedback in the evo-
lution and formation of galaxy clusters. For example,
the Chaotic Cold Accretion (CCA) model predicts a tight
co-evolution between the central supermassive black hole
(SMBH) and the host cluster halo (via the cooling rate

In this section, we describe the data reduction pro-

from the PISCO instrument on the Magellan telescope,
we developed a complete reduction pipeline to convert
these images to photometric catalogs for all galaxies in
the ﬁeld, which are then used as an input for our cluster
ﬁnding algorithm. In contrast, SDSS and Pan-STARRS
are wide-ﬁeld surveys with available photometric cata-

"CLUSTER FINDING ALGORITHM
In this section, we describe the new cluster ﬁnding
algorithm. Because of the nature of our survey, which
looks for cluster candidates surrounding X-ray/IR/radio
sources, we already have the central
location of the
cluster, which we assume to be the location of the X-
ray/IR/radio source. This means that unlike some op-
tical cluster ﬁnding surveys, we do not use a friend-of-
friend algorithm (Huchra & Geller 1982) to search for the
center of the cluster. Instead, we look for an overdensity
of galaxies with similar redshifts at the location of the
X-ray source.",9,CMR10,,593,58
"Speciﬁcally, we search for a peak in the redshift his-",9,CMR10,,54,54
"togram of all the galaxies within the observed ﬁelds.
Members of a galaxy cluster will have similar redshifts,
meaning that ﬁnding the peak in the redshift histogram
will diﬀerentiate between cluster members and ﬁeld
galaxies. The peak location corresponds to the redshift
of the galaxy cluster.",9,CMR10,,295,56
"The algorithm is divided into three parts: photomet-
ric redshift measurement, aperture selection and back-
ground subtraction, and richness correction for high-
redshift clusters.",9,CMR10,,180,54

Each galaxy’s photometric redshift (,9,CMR10,,36,36

mined by ﬁtting the photometry in optical and Mid-
IR bands to the template spectral energy distribution
(SEDs) using the Bayesian Photometric Redshifts (BPZ)
code (Ben´ıtez 2000; Coe et al. 2006). The BPZ code
uses Bayesian inference and priors to estimate photomet-
ric redshifts using multi-wavelength broad-band data.
We used the default templates, consisting of one early-
type, two late-type and one irregular-type templates
from Coleman et al. (1980) and two starburst templates
from Kinney et al. (1996). We also added WISE ﬁlters

"X-RAY DATA REDUCTION
In addition to the optical survey, we performed X-ray
follow-up of 9 promising candidates with Chandra. Three
of them are shown in this work. Four candidates were fol-
lowed up in Chandra Cycle 16 based on an earlier version
of our selection (Somboonpanyakul et al. 2018), which
yielded the re-observation of a lesser-known cluster, two
systems that turned out to be isolated point sources,
and CHIPS1356-3421.
In Cycle 20, we followed up an
additional 5 candidates, which yielded the detection of
CHIPS1911+4455. Both of these follow-up campaigns
were based on preliminary catalogs and, thus, had an in-

central galaxy of the cluster hosts an extremely X-ray
luminous AGN with bright radio jets. High resolution
optical/X-ray images also reveal a massive cooling ﬂow

a starburst-hosting BCG. The estimated star formation

It seems that the AGN feedback, which has
been thought to be responsible for stopping the cooling
of new stars in central galaxies (Fabian 2012; McNamara

leading to an extremely high star formation rate in the
