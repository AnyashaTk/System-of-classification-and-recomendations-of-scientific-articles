generated and distributed throughout its layers. MHD waves, generated either by mode conversion of",9,CMR10,,214,115
p,9,CMMI10,,1,1
"-modes or
excited due to shaking of magnetic ﬂux tubes by turbulent convection and other motions, are thought to contribute to
shock heating in the chromospheric layers and, as such, are an important ingredient in heating of the upper atmosphere.
Alfv´en waves (Alfv´en 1947) are the least impeded of the MHD waves since they are not reﬂected by pressure gradients",9,CMR10,,364,119
"and therefore may reach the corona before dissipating (Mathioudakis et al. 2013) and may play a role in the acceleration
of the solar wind.",9,CMR10,,139,120
"It is certain that magnetic ﬂux tubes in the solar atmosphere host MHD waves because theory indicates there is
no such thing as a pure acoustic wave in a magnetized plasma (Cally 2005) and also because local helioseismology
shows that acoustic shadows exist downstream from sunspots (Braun et al. 1987; Braun & Birch 2008), meaning that
strong magnetic ﬁelds decrease the amount of acoustic wave power outgoing horizontally from the region of strong
ﬁeld compared to the acoustic wave power that was observed as incoming. This decrease in acoustic wave power is
explained by conversion of acoustic waves into upward or downward propagating MHD waves.",9,CMR10,,650,112
"In addition to observing a decrease in acoustic wave power exiting strong magnetic structures, local helioseismology
techniques record time-travel changes in waves as they pass through magnetic regions. The changes in the travel times",9,CMR10,,234,117
"and phase shifts are caused by variations of the sound speed, sub-surface ﬂows and magnetic properties of the medium",9,CMR10,,116,116

2006). The fast magnetic waves are either reﬂected downward due to the gradient in the Alfv´en speed (Khomenko

2012).",9,CMR10,,255,110
"MHD waves contain oscillations in the magnetic ﬁeld magnitude or direction, so one way to conﬁrm their presence
is to observe a time varying component of either. This is not the only way to conﬁrm an MHD wave, though, since
area oscillations (Grant et al. 2015) and spectral line width oscillationsv(Jess et al. 2009) have been used in tandem
with intensity and velocity oscillations to conﬁrm the presence of MHD waves. Conﬁdent detection of magnetic ﬁeld
oscillations is an observational challenge with reports of amplitudes being low, i.e., an upper amplitude of 4 Gauss as
observed with the Advanced Stokes Polarimeter in sunspot ﬁeld strengths for 5 minute oscillations (Lites et al. 1998),

"In addition to searching for oscillations in the magnetic ﬁeld, phase relations between diﬀerent quantities are often
used to interpret the oscillations as speciﬁc wave modes. This was outlined and observed by Ulrich (1996) for mag-
netic ﬂux and Doppler velocity at diﬀerent positions on the solar disk and further studied by Norton et al. (2001);
Norton & Ulrich (2000). The observed phases may also indicate that instrumental cross talk (Settele et al. 2002) or
opacity ﬂuctuations sampling the vertical magnetic gradient (Bellot Rubio et al. 2000; Norton & Uitenbroek 2002) are
responsible for the periodic signal instead of MHD waves, although it should be noted that opacity ﬂuctuations are
themselves a signature of waves. A more recent development of expected phases for photospheric mode identiﬁcation

upward propagating sausage modes as surface modes (Grant et al. 2015), and this work was furthered by Keys et al.
(2018), who concludes that surface waves are more prevalent than body waves in pores. Multi-height studies by Stan-
galini et al. (2018) used circular polarization and intensity oscillations at the umbra-penumbra boundary to detect
surface modes. Kanoh et al. (2016) found evidence of standing slow-mode waves in the umbra with Hinode SP data
based on phase analysis. Phase studies, both at single heights between diﬀerent observables and at multiple heights,
have been successful in identifying waves modes and characteristics.",9,CMR10,,856,119
"As the solar atmosphere is highly stratiﬁed, many waves are not capable of travelling into the outer atmosphere
as they are reﬂected by density gradients, but magnetic ﬁelds and radiative losses allow more wave power to travel
than originally thought.
In general, waves in the quiet-Sun with frequencies less than the cutoﬀ frequency of 5.2
mHz are considered trapped in or below the photosphere as resonant or standing waves. However, in the presence of",9,CMR10,,454,114

losses can be as low as 2 mHz, although recent numerical simulations (Felipe & Sangeetha 2020) show that the cutoﬀ
frequencies in thin structures do not get quite that low. The exact reduction of cutoﬀ frequencies due to radiative
losses in magnetic structures is still an open question. The vertical gradients in the transition region oﬀer another
hindrance to wave propagation further into the corona. However, observed photospheric power in frequencies higher
than the cutoﬀ frequency can be considered part of the wave ﬂux budget available to the chromosphere.",9,CMR10,,643,117
"Importantly, the work by Centeno et al. (2006, 2009), who studied diﬀerent types of solar structures (large and small
sunspots, a pore and faculae region) at photospheric and chromospheric heights, showed that ”while the atmospheric
cutoﬀ frequency and the propagation properties of diﬀerent oscillating modes depend on the magnetic feature, in all the
cases the power that reaches the high chromosphere above the atmospheric cutoﬀ comes directly from the photosphere",9,CMR10,,467,119

of p-modes using HMI and AIA Zhao et al. (2016) showed they were able to trace the waves upwards, and that the
waves were able to channel through the chromosphere, transition region, and corona. The most extensive work on
MHD waves using HMI data, in coordination with AIA data, has been carried out by Rajaguru et al. (2019, 2013),
with the important ﬁndings that small scale magnetic elements channel signiﬁcantly more acoustic wave energy into
the chromosphere than originally expected. These waves have frequencies between 2-5 mHz and the ﬁndings support
Centeno et al. (2009); Khomenko et al. (2008); Felipe & Sangeetha (2020) in the argument that radiative losses, not
magnetic inclinations, are responsible for lowering the cutoﬀ frequencies for the thin magnetic structures and enable
a large amount of wave ﬂux to move upwards.",9,CMR10,,937,117
"A search for Alfv´enic waves using HMI data was suggested by Welsch (personal communication, 2017) to measure
the Doppler velocities of the plasma in the vicinity of ﬁeld lines that are perpendicular to the observer’s line of sight,
i.e. polarity inversion lines or neutral lines. Detecting oscillations transverse to magnetic ﬁeld lines indicates the waves
have properties of Alfv´enic waves. HMI is designed with a high sensitivity to Doppler velocities whereas the line of
sight magnetic ﬁeld measurements of HMI are most likely too noisy to detect the photospheric amplitude of magnetic
ﬁeld changes associated with single mode MHD waves. We should note that the nominal vector magnetic ﬁeld data
from HMI has a cadence of 720 seconds that precludes detection of the waves in the photosphere that have periods of",9,CMR10,,816,124

it can be used for wave research, but we discuss such data options further in Section 2.",9,CMR10,,201,112
"Recently, Alfv´en waves heating chromospheric plasma in a sunspot umbra through the formation of shock fronts
was reported (Grant et al. 2018). In this work, the highly inclined (70-80 degrees) magnetic ﬁeld geometry in the
outer boundary of the umbra, alongside the tangential velocity signatures, distinguished the waves as distinct from
umbral ﬂashes. Observed local temperature enhancements of 5% in the chromosphere were reported and thought to be
evidence of dissipation of mode-converted Alfv´en waves driven by upwardly propagating magneto-acoustic oscillations.
Alfv´en shocks are predicted to form in regions with high negative Alfv´en speed gradients (Hollweg et al. 1982). In this
case of the nearly horizontal outer umbral ﬁelds, the volume expansion of the magnetic ﬁelds and the fact that the
density does not drop oﬀ steeply means a negative gradient in the Alfv´en speed can exist. The study by Grant et al.",9,CMR10,,924,121

Neutral Line Determination,9,CMTI10,,26,26
"We used a technique that measures the horizontal gradients of photospheric magnetic ﬂux (Welsch & Li 2008;
Schrijver 2007) in order to identify the polarity inversion line location. First, maps were created with values for
regions where the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld was over a certain threshold (20 G). The maps were dilated to
allow for overlap of the positive and negative bitmaps, and this overlap was taken to be the polarity inversion line.
The locations were stored in an array, the ”PIL bitmap” in which the locations of the neutral line has a value of 1
and elsewhere there was a value of 0. We used the bitmaps, which were determined for every time step, to multiply
the Doppler velocity images and other observables in order to create a neutral line data cube of each observable. An
example of the neutral line location is shown in Figure 2. It is only the long portion between x of 200-300 and y of
280-310 that we consider the stable neutral line for this region. Many of the pixels identiﬁed as PIL outside of the

"Wavelet analysis has become a standard tool for identifying periodicities within time series (Torrence & Compo
1986). The beneﬁt of using Wavelet analysis as opposed to traditional Fourier methods is that wavelets allow for
the determination of whether the oscillatory power varies over the duration of the observation. In Fourier analysis,
the basis functions are localized in the frequency domain, whereas in wavelet analysis, they are localized in both
the frequency and time domains. Information is then gathered about the amplitude of periodic signals and how this",9,CMR10,,569,116

"The spatial distribution of power, shown in Figure 4, shows the evolution of the region and the locations of enhanced
and suppressed wave power. The 2nd to bottom row shows the 0.5-1.0 mHz power depicting evolutionary changes
on the order of 20 minutes. While some features such as the sunspot umbra and polarity inversion line are fairly
stable, plenty of evolution is seen such as the dispersion of plage (not easily tracked at a constant rate), radial outﬂow
in penumbra, and general movement of small features in the surrounding area in the 0.5-1.0 mHz frequency range.
The third row from the bottom depicts the 3.0-3.5 mHz band (5-minute period) and enhaced power is seen in the
magnetogram and line width data in the active region while power is suppressed in the Doppler and intensity in the
active region. Quiet-Sun locations show enhanced 5-minute power in the velocity map. Regarding the 5.5-6.0 mHz

width data, there is 3-minute power seen in umbral, polarity inversion line and penumbral locations. The enhanced

velocities are 2-6 km/s for these bands. It is interesting to note that the line width variations (bottom row, left panel) are highest around
the location of where the Doppler velocities across the PIL terminate and become magnetic oscillations.",7,CMR8,,628,141

converted from acoustic oscillations along the right side of the PIL, then the diﬀering periods of these two oscillation signals may contain
important information on the nature of this conversion process. A relevant theoretical aspect to consider in this regard may be the resonant
conversion of acoustic to Alfv´enic waves at photospheric heights which has been discussed by Zaqarashvili & Roberts (2006); Kuridze et al.
(2005) who both report ﬁndings that a sound wave is coupled to an Alfv´en wave with double period and wavelength when the sound and
Alfv´en speeds are equal. Further investigation into the periods of magnetic and Doppler oscillations along the PIL are warranted.",7,CMR8,,956,140

relevant for the",7,CMR8,,293,141

"-mode band and the 3-minute oscillations that permeate the photosphere and chromosphere and are suspected of driving at
least some of coronal dynamics and energetics. This paper represents only a small fraction of what can be done with the data to investigate
the presence of MHD waves in the photosphere.",7,CMR8,,305,139
"In future eﬀorts, we hope to conduct an analysis similar to that in this paper for an active region near disk center, or as an active
region crosses the disk, to understand how the center-to-limb position aﬀects the results. Also, we hope to repeat this analysis using data
corrected for scattered light.",7,CMR8,,304,139
"In the vicinity surrounding AR 11158, and in the active region itself, we ﬁnd the expected 5-minute power evident in the velocity and
intensity data for quiet-Sun, see Figure 6. The same is true for plage, although the power in the intensity is not as strong and we begin
to see enhanced power in the magnetogram for plage. We also ﬁnd signiﬁcant oscillations in the 5-minute band for velocity signals from
umbral and PIL pixels. It is less evident, but power is enhanced in the 5-minute band for plage, PIL and umbral pixels in the magnetogram
data and for all features in the line-width data. The 135-second vector data conﬁrms the umbral 5-minute oscillations in magnetic ﬁeld",7,CMR8,,679,137
"and line width as the Doppler width and ﬁeld strength of the vector data show a signiﬁcant 5-minute peak, see Figure 7.",7,CMR8,,119,119
"Surprisingly, for some umbral locations, a peak is seen in the magnetogram signal at the 3-minute period, around 5.6 mHz, in both the
Fourier power (Figure 6) and wavelet power spectra (Figure 9).Observation of 3-minute Doppler power has been reported in the photosphere
in numerous studies, including IBIS observations of a pore in the Fe I 617.3 nm line showed that 3-minute wave was already present at
the photospheric height of formation of this line (Stangalini et al. 2012). The umbral 3-minute waves observed in the chromosphere were
shown to be already present in the photosphere in a study by Centeno et al. (2009). Numerical simulations (Felipe 2019) aided in the
conclusion that propagation of waves in the 3-minute band directly from the photosphere can explain the observed chromospheric 3-minute
oscillations. So it is not shocking to see the 3-minute power, the surprising part is that it appears in the magnetogram data.",7,CMR8,,936,136

time-distance data shown in Figure 11 for slices through quiet-Sun, PIL and umbral locations. The background averages are
subtracted from the data in Figure 11 order to show the small-amplitude ﬂuctuations. The inclination is included here to provide
context for the geometry of the ﬁeld in the PIL. When no magnetic ﬁeld is present, as is the case for the quiet-Sun pixels, the",8,CMR9,,485,128
inclination is near 90 degrees due to the higher noise in Q and U dominating the Stokes signals.,8,CMR9,,96,96
