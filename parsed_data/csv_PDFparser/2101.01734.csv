"The infall region is also structured diÔ¨Äerently in each resimu-
lation. The bottom-middle cluster appears to be funnelling in mate-
rial through what appears to be Ô¨Ålamentary structures in projection,
whilst most of the material in the bottom row is being brought in as
part of a large object on the top left-hand side of the panels. Despite
the diversity observed in these regions, they all display signs of
Ô¨Ålamentary structure.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,430,71
"Whereas the objects that have travelled into the cluster halo are
nearly always gas-poor, the objects in the infalling regions are not,
although there are some caveats and these exceptions are possible
pre-processing candidates. For instance, there are objects in the top
three rows that become gas-poor in the infall region, before they
entered the main cluster halo, and this gas disruption corresponds
well with them being a subhalo of some other infalling object.
Therefore, it is quite possible that these objects are being stripped
as they fall into host environments at large cluster-centric radii.
However, there are some haloes which become gas-poor in the
infall region, which may be because of some local Ô¨Ålamentary gas
environment or some secular process. The bottom cluster shows the
most obvious case of pre-processing. Many gas-poor objects on the
left-hand side of the panels are clearly orbiting some large host halo,
which is stripping their gas before reaching the main cluster halo.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1002,71

both the cluster halo and the infall region. Whereas Fig. 2 contains
a substantial amount of detail about this, we next go on to stack all
object orbital histories from each resimulation, in order to extract
robust general trends and to learn more about the extent of gaseous

use the orbital histories of the objects in the sample to record when
an object accretes onto another object in the infall region to become
a subhalo, and its initial gas mass at that time. The evolution of the
subhalo gas content is tracked from that point onwards to construct
temporal trends. Due to the fact that host haloes will accumulate

"(2018), who suggest that quenching and pre-processing of satellites
is more dominant in higher mass hosts. This result is also compatible
with the results presented in Cora et al. (2019), who showed that
quenching mechanisms are less eÔ¨Écient in galaxies accreted by
lower mass haloes, both prior and after their Ô¨Årst infall, due to the
combined eÔ¨Äect of the milder environmental disruption exerted by
low-mass host haloes, and the reduced secular quenching in low-
mass subhaloes that naturally accrete onto low-mass host haloes.
However, in contrast, when we consider where subhaloes lose 50
per cent of their gas in the Ô¨Årst radial bin, the trends only diÔ¨Äer
by less than a Gyr. This latter point is more consistent with Wetzel
et al. (2013), who suggest that host mass does not inÔ¨Çuence the
quenching time-scales of satellite galaxies, although their analysis
was constrained to the virial radius of the clusters. Both Wetzel
et al. (2013) and Cora et al. (2019) observed a delay in satellite
quenching after accretion onto a host, and it is possible that this
delay is consistent with our subhaloes in lower mass hosts retaining",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1132,69

"As in Fig. 8, but shows the fractional stellar loss of subhaloes as
a function of time spent in a host environment.",7,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,115,67
"By only examining the fractional gas-loss of subhaloes, it is
diÔ¨Écult to disentangle whether any lost gas is being stripped (exter-
nal processes), ejected (internal processes), or whether it is being
turned into stars over time. In light of this we next present Fig. 9,
which depicts the same information as in Fig. 8, but instead shows
the fractional stellar loss of subhaloes as they fall into hosts haloes.
Firstly, we identify a radial trend in the stellar mass loss of
subhaloes within low-mass hosts (blue): the stellar mass loss in-
creases as we move closer to the main cluster halo. For the other
two subhalo populations, i.e. subhaloes of group-mass (green) and
of cluster-mass (red) hosts, the stellar mass loss radial trends are
fairly similar, with the exception of the innermost radial bin (top-
left panel), in which all three subhalo populations show a light
correlation between their stellar mass loss and the time spent in
their respective host environments, regardless of the mass of their
host halo. On the other hand, subhaloes residing in low-mass and
group-mass hosts display a gain of stellar mass outside the inner-
most radial bin. In the highest radial bin (bottom-right panel), there
is a",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1217,72

"4 Gyrs inside the host environment. Nevertheless, for high-mass
hosts (red), the trends in each radial bin show no increase in stel-
lar material, and in the stacked data it seems as though the stellar
material only decreases as a function of time spent in the host envi-
ronment. These results are in partial disagreement with Wetzel et al.
(2012) and Wetzel et al. (2013), who suggest that satellites are still
allowed to form stars and grow in mass before a delayed, but rapid
quenching. In our results we do not Ô¨Ånd star formation for subhaloes
residing in cluster-mass hosts. For massive galaxies, however, Cora
et al. (2019) showed that the duration of the phase following the
delay might, in fact, be of the same order of magnitude as the delay
phase.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,758,70
"It is possible that the star-loss found in such subhaloes, as
opposed to the stellar gain observed in the other populations, is not
solely a consequence of a lack of star formation. Such subhaloes
might indeed form stars but stripping or ejection of stellar material
from environmental or secular processes might outweigh the star",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,330,69

"apparent diÔ¨Äerence between the populations. Analysing the host
mass of these subhalo populations we conÔ¨Årm that larger mass
subhaloes reside in larger mass host haloes, which as seen from
Fig. 8, are more eÔ¨Écient environments for subhaloes to lose their
gas in. For the innermost radial bin, similar to what we found Fig. 8,
they all lose their gas at similar times. In light of this result, we
now are able to better understand the radial correlation seen in the
stellar mass change in subhaloes of group and low-mass hosts and
their cluster-centric distance in Fig. 9. One possible scenario is that,
as subhaloes within more massive hosts would accrete with larger
velocities in the high density environment of their host, the ram
pressure they would experience would be greater than in comparable
subhaloes in lower mass hosts. As discussed in Cora et al. (2019),
secular processes (e.g. feedback from active galactic nuclei) play a
major role in the decline of the star formation for high-mass galaxies
both before and after their infall time, which they deÔ¨Åned as the time
at which a galaxy becomes a satellite for the Ô¨Årst time. As subhaloes
in group and low-mass hosts tend to be on the lower end of the
subhalo mass distribution, they are able to form stars even after 4
Gyrs since they entered their host halo environment.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1331,72
"These trends lend support for these subhaloes losing gas by
physical processes, rather than any artiÔ¨Åcially enhanced stripping
due to the number of particles used to describe such subhaloes, as
otherwise one would expect these artiÔ¨Åcial eÔ¨Äects to lead to en-
hanced stripping in the lower mass subhaloes (as we discussed in
Section 3.2). Presumably the host environment dominates this nu-
merical eÔ¨Äect, thus more massive subhaloes lose their gas quicker,
and lower mass subhaloes retain their gas for longer, despite hav-
ing less dark matter particles. Although these trends diminish the
numerically enhanced stripping argument, they do not allow us to
diÔ¨Äerentiate on whether subhaloes are losing their gas via stripping
or secular processes, as in larger mass subhaloes one would ex-
pect more extreme feedback schemes to be implemented in order to
control stellar production.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,880,68

massive hosts is not increasing as a function of time spent in the
host. Therefore, we may statistically infer that subhalo gas is really
being lost by either stripping or ejection in such subhaloes, while for
subhaloes residing in group and low-mass hosts, gas-loss is boosted
by the star mass gain identiÔ¨Åed in Fig. 9. In order to diÔ¨Äerentiate

"each and every gas and star particle situated in infalling subhaloes.
While we suggest that it is compelling that gas disruption
by host environments, either by sub-dominant environments or by
cluster-mass hosts, is the main cause for enhanced subhalo gas-loss
during their infall onto the main galaxy cluster, it is most likely a
mixture of actual gas disruption, secular processes and enhanced
numerical stripping of subhaloes due to inadequate resolution (van
den Bosch & Ogiya 2018; van den Bosch et al. 2018). To conclude
our analysis, we Ô¨Ånish by investigating how subhalo gas-loss is
related to number of particles in our subhaloes. In Fig. 10 we present
the fractional gas-loss of subhaloes, as in Fig. 8, but here the trends
are split by the initial mass each subhalo has when it accretes onto
the host.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,812,71

explained by the fact that massive subhaloes are in more massive
hosts, which as seen, deplete subhalo gas more eÔ¨Éciently, e.g. sub-",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,260,68
"haloes in more massive hosts would accrete with larger velocities in
the high density environment of their host, which increases the ram
pressure they experience. These results suggest that gas depletion
in our subhalo population is driven predominately by host mass
rather than artiÔ¨Åcially enhanced numerical stripping found in recent
studies (van den Bosch & Ogiya 2018; van den Bosch et al. 2018).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,400,68
"In summary, we conclude that in the infall region, infalling
objects suÔ¨Äer signiÔ¨Åcant gaseous disruption that correlates with
their time-since-infall and cluster-centric distance. Subhaloes suÔ¨Äer
more disruption further out from the main cluster halo and quicker
than the halo population, and we Ô¨Ånd that the gas-loss radial trend
is dominated by subhaloes residing in cluster-mass hosts in the
infall region. Considering only the subhaloes in group-mass and
low-mass host halo environments, we Ô¨Ånd a similar radial trend to
the halo population. We have shown that this is not solely driven
by artiÔ¨Åcially enhanced stripping due to particle number resolution.
However, as the spatial resolution of the simulation might induce an
enhanced stripping of gas particles on our objects if their intrahalo
medium is not fully resolved, we understand the characteristic radius
found in our radial gas-loss trends as an upper bound of the accretion",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,939,70
"shock radius, rather than its actual value.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,43,43
"Our results suggest that gaseous disruption in the infall region
is a combination of pre-processing and cluster quenching (for sub-
haloes within cluster-mass host haloes), and object gas depletion at
a characteristic radius that behaves as an accretion shock. However,
some questions remain and could be the subject of a future study.
For instance, a prime concern would be to investigate how environ-
mental eÔ¨Äects alone contribute to the gas-loss of infalling objects,
by examining how (particle and mass) resolution and diÔ¨Äerent sub-
grid physics aÔ¨Äect our trends. Fortunately, The Three Hundred
has been run with multiple codes, each containing diÔ¨Äerent subgrid
physics with diÔ¨Äerent calibrations. Alongside this, there are 2",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,730,68

clusters within the sample that have been re-run with eight times
better mass resolution. By using this data, a follow-up study could
relatively easily target the question of how dominant environment
is. In addition to this, by disentangling the gaseous components
in subhaloes into the cold inter stellar medium and the hot halo,
a future study could pin down what kind of host environments are
necessary in order to exclusively strip the hot component, essentially
starving the satellite within the subhalo, and which environments
are necessary in order to disturb the cold inter stellar medium.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,599,70
