ABSTRACT,9,CMR10,,8,8
"We perform consistent reductions and measurements for three ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs):
Bo¨otes I, Leo IV and Leo V. Using the public archival data from the GIRAFFE spectrograph on the
Very Large Telescope (VLT), we locate new members and provide reﬁned measurements of physical
parameters for these dwarf galaxies. We identify nine new Leo IV members and four new Leo V
members, and perform a comparative analysis of previously discovered members. Additionally, we
identify one new binary star in both Leo IV and Leo V. After removing binary stars, we recalculate
the velocity dispersions of Bo¨otes I and Leo IV to be 5.1",9,CMR10,,630,98

other UFDs will enhance our understanding of these enigmatic stellar populations and contribute to
future dark matter studies. This is the ﬁrst in a series of papers examining thirteen UDFs observed

INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"The population of known Local Group galaxies has
grown steadily in the past two decades with the dis-
covery of many new ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies
(e.g., Belokurov et al. 2006, 2007, 2008; Bechtol et al.
2015; Koposov et al. 2015a; Mau et al. 2020). Charac-
terized by an older stellar population, low metallicity,
and low surface brightness, UFDs are the most dark-
matter dominated systems known (Simon & Geha 2007;",9,CMR10,,424,56

"Gilmore et al. 2007; Simon 2019) and may play a key
role in characterizing dark matter. For instance, UFD
central densities can be used to test dark matter mod-
els (e.g., Calabrese & Spergel 2016) and the number of
Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites can be used to con-
strain the mass of warm dark matter particles (Kennedy
et al. 2014; Nadler et al. 2020). Additionally, their com-
pactness and proximity make them ideal sites for indi-
rect dark matter detection (e.g., Ahnen et al. 2018; Hoof
et al. 2020).",9,CMR10,,510,58
"The characteristics of individual stars within a UFD
can be used to understand the global properties of
the galaxy (e.g., Simon & Geha 2007). For example,
the velocities of member stars can constrain dynami-",9,CMR10,,207,52

Jenkins et al.,9,CMCSC10,,14,14
"cal mass and dark matter content. However, due to
their low luminosity, many UFDs have few known mem-
ber stars, making it diﬃcult to provide robust mea-
surements of the galaxies’ key features. To better con-
strain UFDs’ kinematic and metallicity parameters, we
uniformly reduce and analyze archived data from the
FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectrograph on the Very Large
Telescopes (VLT) for thirteen UFDs. In this study, we
present our membership selection process and results
for three UFDs: Bo¨otes I, Leo IV and Leo V. Bo¨otes I
data from VLT has been previously published (Koposov
et al. 2011) and is used here to validate our data reduc-
tion and membership selection processes. Our member-
ship analysis of the remaining ten UFDs observed with
VLT/GIRAFFE will be presented in a follow-up study.
Bo¨otes I, Leo IV and Leo V were discovered as stellar
overdensities in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data",9,CMR10,,902,57
"(Belokurov et al. 2006, 2007, 2008). Bo¨otes I is one of the
more luminous UFDs (",9,CMR10,,81,60

Photometric studies show that Bo¨otes I is dominated
by ancient metal-poor populations (Brown et al. 2014),
and spectroscopic studies have provided insight into the
stellar kinematics and chemical abundances of Bo¨otes I
(Mu˜noz et al. 2006; Martin et al. 2007; Wolf et al. 2010;
Norris et al. 2010; Koposov et al. 2011; Lai et al. 2011).
Additionally, Koposov et al. (2011) presented evidence
for a two-population kinematic model, with the higher
dispersion component concentrated closer to the center
of the dwarf galaxy. The authors suggest that this may
reﬂect the UFD’s formation, which potentially involved
the merging of several smaller populations.",9,CMR10,,680,58

(called HiTS113057+021330 by Medina et al. (2017)),
which they classify as an ab-type RR Lyrae with a
period of 0.6453 days. Additionally, we identify three
stars that Mutlu-Pakdil et al. (2019) listed as plausible
Leo V members requiring further follow-up: Leo5 1046,
Leo5 1043 and Leo5 1095 (stars 2p, 4p and 3p in Mutlu-
Pakdil et al. (2019) Table 10, respectively). Leo5 1046
was previously observed by Walker et al. (2009) but did
not pass the quality cuts used by Mutlu-Pakdil et al.
(2019). Leo5 1046’s radial velocity, proper motion, lo-
cation, metallicity and color-magnitudes are all consis-
tent with Leo V’s characteristics, and we classify it as
a member star. Leo5 1043 was identiﬁed as a plausible
member star because its proper motion and Megacam
color-magnitudes were consistent with Leo V. With our",9,CMR10,,868,57
"spectroscopic data, we conﬁrm that its radial velocity
is also consistent, making it another new member star.
We ﬁnd that the ﬁnal plausible member, Leo5 1095, is
not a member, as its radial velocity diﬀers from that of
Leo V by almost 200 km s",9,CMR10,,244,56

In contrast, Koposov et al. (2011) as-
signed a variability probability of 0.61 to Boo1 114 and
therefore did not classify it as a binary. We visually in-
spect the single-exposure spectra and conﬁrm that there
is distinct velocity variation.
It is not used in subse-
quent kinematics calculations. We do not ﬁnd evidence
of variability for two stars that Koposov et al. (2011)
identiﬁed as potential binaries: Boo1 30 and Boo1 32.

ability appears to be due to true ﬂuctuations in veloc-
ity. Additionally, Mutlu-Pakdil et al. (2019) identiﬁed
Leo5 1038 as a possible binary. Though we calculate a
p-value of 0.57 (single exposures) and 0.11 (combined ex-
posures) for this member, our results are consistent with
this claim. As seen in Figure 12, where we compare our
measurement to all previous measurements, Leo5 1038’s

combined radial velocities are shown in orange. Aside from Leo5 1038, all stars show evidence of velocity variation using the
VLT measurements alone. Leo5 1038 is a binary found in Mutlu-Pakdil et al. (2019) and our radial velocity measurements

with good radial velocity and metallicity measurements,
as no prior membership or binary information is avail-

Given the minimal diﬀerence in the subjective mem-
bership classiﬁcation and membership probability (Fig-

ilar kinematic and metallicity parameters. However,
as stated previously, we obtain diﬀerent values for the

ment of Boo1 44, and we ﬁnd that our value is only con-
sistent with the dispersion from the membership prob-

because the star is assigned a membership probability
of zero and so is not considered in the dispersion calcu-

"The new MDF and the results of our ﬁt are shown

with the median metallicity uncertainty of 0.22 dex. It
is visually apparent that the extra gas model ﬁts the
histogram the best. However, the strength of this con-
clusion relies on including all the literature data. Our
VLT/GIRAFFE data alone rule out the pristine leaky
box but cannot distinguish between the pre-enriched and
extra gas models. This is because the literature data are
overall at slightly lower metallicities than the VLT data,
increasing the size of the metal-poor tail compared to
the peak of the MDF. While we have shifted the mean
metallicity of the literature data to match our measure-
ments, it is possible a residual metallicity oﬀset remains,

A similar suggestion has been made by examination
of detailed chemical abundances (Frebel et al. 2016),
though in that case discrete merging events were respon-
sible rather than continuous gas accretion as modeled
here. Regardless, this interpretation is consistent with
Bo¨otes I having formed in a similar way to the lowest
mass classical dwarf galaxies (Kirby et al. 2011; Yan
et al. 2020), emphasizing that relatively massive UFDs
like Bo¨otes I are an extension of ordinary galaxy forma-
tion to lower stellar masses (Tolstoy et al. 2009; Simon

"EQUIVALENT WIDTHS OF Mg I LINE AT 8806.8 ˚A
As shown in Battaglia et al. (2011) and Battaglia & Starkenburg (2012), the Mg I line at 8806.8 ˚A is gravity sensitive
and can be used to discriminate foreground dwarf stars from the giant stars in the dwarf galaxies. We therefore compute
the EWs of the Mg I line for all observed stars by integrating the ﬂux over 6 ˚A around the central wavelength of the
line, as was done in Battaglia et al. (2011), and report our measurements in Table 6. Due to the weakness of the Mg
I line, it is only visible for bright stars with high S/N. For this reason, we do not use the line for general membership
classiﬁcation. However, the Mg I line is useful for stars with uncertain membership, such as stars with high metallicity
but consistent velocity and proper motion, e.g. Boo1 44 ( [Fe",9,CMR10,,822,121
