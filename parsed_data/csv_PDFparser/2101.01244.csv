"the redshift, this average viewing angle will also change. Thus the ratio between the isotropic luminosity
and observed luminosity may change systematically with redshift. Therefore, if we use quasars to
measure the luminosity distance by evaluating the isotropic absolute luminosity and measuring the
observed ﬂux, we can have a redshift-dependent bias which can propagate to cosmological parameters.
We propose a toy model for testing the eﬀect of viewing angle uncertainty on measurement of the
luminosity distance. The model is based on analytical description of the obscuring torus applied
to one-parameter observational data.
It illustrates the possible change of the torus covering factor
between the two chosen redshift ranges. We have estimated the possible error on speciﬁc cosmological

itself does not pose a problem as long as, statistically,
there is no trend in the average viewing angle with the
redshift. However, if such a trend is likely to exist, it can
be expected to aﬀect the conclusions about the redshift
dependence of the Universe expansion rate. The aim of

matter forms cold Keplerian accretion disks. Close to
the disk, the broad line region forms. This central part

"torus. Thus the viewing angle plays an important role
in how the AGN appears, and consequently,
in how
it is classiﬁed. The disk is ﬂat, so the observed disk
ﬂux decreases with an increase of the viewing angle.
In addition, the observer looking at very high viewing
angle (measured from the symmetry axis) will not be
able to see the direct disk emission, and instead will
register only a processed emission from the molecular
torus (plus, eventually, a scattered emission). At
intermediate viewing angles both the disk anisotropy
and the partial obscuration are important. Therefore,
the observed radiation from any AGN mostly depends
on two important parameters e.g. viewing angle (",9,SFRM1000,,684,54

thick. The emission from the central part of the AGN is
anisotropic because the ﬂat disk emission is anisotropic,

radiation in an angle-dependent way. Therefore, the
observed bolometric luminosity of the AGNs depends

reverberation method when the absolute luminosity of
a quasar is determined either from the time delay of the

depends mostly on the actual size of the source, and only

standard Shakura-Sunyaev disk model (Shakura &

to bright quasars, in the optical and near-UV range.
As an illustration, in Figure 9 we show such a model
ﬁtted to the recent quasar composite spectrum based
on XSHOOTER data (Selsing et al. 2016). The model
represents well the optical data, although at the longest
wavelengths traces of the host galaxy contribution start
to be seen. However, at far-UV and in the X-ray band,
the standard model does not apply, and the soft and
hard X-ray emission come from the innermost part of
the disk, from the warm and hot corona. In the IR, the
torus emission and the contribution from the host galaxy
dominate the broad band spectrum (for observational
discussion of broad band quasar spectra see Richards
et al. 2006). Modelling this broad band emission is
usually done using some parametric models, usually
aimed at speciﬁc energy band. Modelling IR emission
