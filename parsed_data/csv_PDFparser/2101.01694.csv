INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"The detailed study of young star cluster (YSC) kine-
matics is vital to understand their long-term evolution
and survivability. Only if star clusters are massive
enough they may overcome the so-called “infant mortal-
ity” (Lada & Lada 2003) surviving internal and external
processes that disturb the gravitational potential, such
as supernova explosions, which lead to abrupt, violent",9,CMR10,,384,56

tion or collision with a giant molecular cloud (GMC) in
the Galactic disk or a change in the Galactic tidal ﬁeld
(e.g., Krumholz & McKee 2020, and references therein).
The detailed kinematic analysis of such young, and still
embedded clusters and their gaseous and stellar content
down to the hydrogen burning limit (or even below) is
challenging and has only become feasible in recent years",9,CMR10,,503,56

lar outﬂow and let them identify both lobes as a blue
and a red shifted counterpart. Time domain studies
(e.g., Sabbi et al. 2020) have the capability of detect-
ing protoplanetary disks, stellar variability, and the bi-
nary fraction, which is important to the evolution of the
whole cluster system (we refer to Portegies Zwart et al.
(2010) and Krumholz & McKee (2020) for a detailed
overview).",9,CMR10,,479,59

has been observationally very expensive. Especially for",9,CMR10,,106,55

had to be obtained. For many ﬁber or slit spectrographs,
only a handful of stars can be observed simultaneously.

match the local continuum. A spectral template
is created using the line parameters of the best-
ﬁtting solution and the rest-frame wavelengths.",9,CMR10,,298,52
"3. These templates are cross-correlated with the stel-
lar spectra using the core of each line, which pro-
vides a RV measurement per absorption line. This
cross-correlation is typically repeated 10,000 times
and for each iteration the uncertainties of the spec-
trum are randomly reordered. A sigma clipping is
applied that ensures that lines with “odd” proﬁles
are removed from the ﬁnal RV ﬁt.",9,CMR10,,395,54

correlated together with a typical repetition of

whose total pm uncertainty do not exceed 50% prior
to the systemic velocity subtraction, which ensures that
a proper direction of the stars’ motion can be deter-
mined. The pm uncertainty ellipse is determined fol-
lowing eq. (9) in Lindegren et al. (2016) and eq. (B.2) in
Lindegren et al. (2018). Since we are only interested in
the the relative motion of the stars, we do not consider
any systematic oﬀsets in the DR2 pms and parallaxes
as they are described in Lindegren et al. (2018).

the length of the vector represents the velocity. The el-

stars of PMS group 1 are distributed throughout the
cluster region in a halo-like structure with a higher con-
centration toward the center of Wd2. Observations and
theoretical studies show that star and star cluster for-

through merging of smaller sub cluster (e.g., McMillan

We do not detect any preferred ejection direction (see
Fig. 8), which is in agreement that these high stellar ve-
locities are obtained through two-body interactions in
the dense cluster center. Although the favored scenario
for these “kicks” are supernovae explosions of the binary
component (e.g., Hoogerwerf et al. 2001), we concur with
Drew et al. (2018) that this scenario is very unlikely be-
cause Wd2 is too young. Especially the massive run-
away stars are important to understand the initial mass
function (IMF). While studies show that some YSCs,
including Wd2 (Zeidler et al. 2017), show a top-heavy",9,CMR10,,613,58

have had a top-heavy IMF before the early ejections of

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS,9,CMR10,,23,23
"The young age, the close proximity, and its spatial
sub-structure make Wd2 an interesting target to study
how YSCs form and evolve during their ﬁrst few mil-
lion years.
In this third paper of this series, we used
the unique capabilities of HST photometry,",9,CMR10,,256,53

"The current, already super-virial state of Wd2, the
fact that the ﬁrst supernovae are yet to happen,",9,CMR10,,100,51
"and its location in the MW disk, which make Wd2
prone to interact or even collide with other GMCs,
led to the conclusion that the cluster is not massive
enough to remain gravitationally bound.",9,CMR10,,192,53
•,9,SFRM1000,,1,1
"The cluster velocity dispersion increases with de-
creasing stellar mass, as expected from a highly
mass-segregated cluster.",9,CMR10,,124,50

"Always two velocity groups are part of each of the
two clumps (MC and NC), while the ﬁfth group
is a halo-like structure, in agreement with the for-
mation of star clusters through mergers.",9,CMR10,,189,52
