ABSTRACT,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,8,8
"X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in AGN allow us to probe and understand the nature
of accretion in highly curved space-time, yet the most robust form of detection (i.e. repeat
detections over multiple observations) has been limited to a single source to-date, with only
tentative claims of single observation detections in several others. The association of those
established AGN QPOs with a speciﬁc spectral component has motivated us to search the",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,458,93

"apply a conservative false alarm testing routine folding in the uncertainty and covariance
of the underlying broad-band noise. We also explore the impact of red-noise leak and the
assumption of various diﬀerent forms (power-law, broken power-law and lorentzians) for the
underlying broad-band noise. In this initial study, we report QPO candidates in 6 AGN (7
including one tentative detection in MRK 766) from our sample of 38, which tend to be
found at characteristic energies and, in four cases, at the same frequency across at least two
observations, indicating they are highly unlikely to be spurious in nature.",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,616,94

INTRODUCTION,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,12,12
"The accretion of gas onto black holes provides insights into the
behaviour of matter in the strong gravity regime and can therefore
test general relativity (GR) itself. As the X-rays trace the inner-
most regions (the disc and corona in black hole binaries – BHBs,
and the corona in AGN) it is the rapid variability in this band
which encodes the most valuable diagnostic information. Such stud-
ies have proven capable of disentangling the geometry of the ﬂow
(Fabian et al. 2009; Kara et al. 2019; Wilkins & Fabian 2013; Alston
et al. 2020a) whilst quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), ubiquitous",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,597,68
"in BHBs (Motta 2016) can provide information about the dynamics
of the disc and the eﬀects of external torques (e.g. the Lense-Thirring
eﬀect: Stella et al. 1999; Fragile et al. 2007; Ingram & Done 2011).
Discovering QPOs in AGN has been of importance for some
time, as they provide tests for the scalability of the accretion ﬂow
by black hole mass (e.g. McHardy et al. 2006), and a ‘slow-motion’
view of the process creating them (i.e. many more photons per QPO
phase bin relative to BHBs). QPOs detected in BHBs (with masses",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,526,71

to 0.01 - 0.1 s (the high frequency QPOs - HFQPOs, see Remillard

"To-date there have been numerous claims of X-ray QPOs in
AGN, although only a very small number have proven to be statis-
tically robust upon detailed investigation. The ﬁrst widely accepted
detection was in the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1), RE J1034+396
(Gierlinski et al. 2008) with a QPO period of approximately one
hour, thereby resembling a mass-scaled BHB HFQPO (Middleton
& Done 2010). This QPO has been speculated to originate in the
hardest energy spectral component, similar to the 67 Hz QPO of",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,504,68

detectable at around the same frequency across several observations
(Alston et al. 2014, Jin et al. 2020). The chance probability of mak-
ing a false signal appear across multiple observations at the same
frequency is extremely low, and so the repeat detection of the QPO
in RE J1034+396 lends strength to its identiﬁcation as a bona-ﬁde
signal. In addition to RE J1034+396, there has been a QPO detection
claim in a single observation MS 2254.9-3712 (Alston et al. 2015)

et al. 2017, Zhang et al. 2018; Alston et al. 2019) (as well as in
tidal disruption events, e.g. Pasham et al. 2019a). The conﬁrmation
of tentative QPO claims and the discovery of new AGN QPOs is
important; the present sample size of robust detections is extremely
small which hinders a rigorous analysis of their origin, and critiques
of their similarities or diﬀerences when compared to BHB QPOs.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,567,70

been well-studied by",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,209,67

noise ratio data and the possibility of long (up to 130 ks) unbroken
observations. In addition to this sample, we include 1H 0707-495,
MS 22549-3712, NGC 4151, PHL 1092 and data from the most re-
cent campaign of IRAS 13224-3809 (see Alston et al. 2019, 2020b
for details). The total sample consists of 22 NLS1s and 16 Type-1
Seyferts, as deﬁned by Veron-Cetty & Veron (2010). Of particu-
lar interest are the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 AGN, which include the
widely-accepted case of X-ray QPOs in RE J1034+396 (Gierlinski
et al. 2008) as well as the reported case in MS 2254.9-3712 (Alston

which they are not intrinsically the strongest. We will re-visit this
issue in a forthcoming paper and here re-iterate that there will be
some unaccounted-for distortion.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,436,69

stable (non-ﬂaring) count rate level are removed. This process can
introduce gaps into the lightcurves, which, if left unmodiﬁed, have
the potential to introduce peaks in power (making QPO detections
harder). Whist there is no standard method to correct for gaps,
previous approaches include linearly interpolating between short
missing segments of data (e.g.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,432,69
<,8,NewTXMI,,1,1
"200s), with count-rate variations
accounted for by drawing from a Poisson distribution (González-
Martín & Vaughan 2012; Alston et al. 2015). This method has the
caveat of introducing a non-red noise background component to the
light curve, which cannot replicate the component which has been
removed, and thus is best applied sparingly (e.g. the interpolation
used by Alston et al. 2015 is typically applied to < 0.5% of the
duration of the lightcurve).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,454,67
"In our analysis, we take the most conservative approach of
considering only the longest continuous segment between ﬂares
(see Figure 1). This avoids all interpolation assumptions, but has
the limitation of reducing the amount of data available for analysis.
However, we ﬁnd that many of the longest continuous segments in

background, the periodogram of which we can inspect to ensure
that any potential QPO candidate is associated with the AGN. An

AGN, in this case, in NGC 4051.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,352,68
3 PERIODOGRAM ANALYSIS AND QPO SEARCH,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,37,37
"A robust statistical framework in which to search for QPOs in broad-
band noise is vital (see Vaughan & Uttley 2005), and we base our
approach on that of Vaughan (2005). We produce periodograms for
each energy-resolved lightcurve (reduced to 2",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,243,68

integer) by applying a fast-Fourier transform (FFT) and a fractional-
rms normalisation (Vaughan et al. 2003). Using the periodogram
(rather than averaged power spectral distribution: PSD) allows us to
maximise the number of Fourier frequencies, improving our con-
straints when modelling, whilst also allowing for QPO searches
down to the lowest possible frequencies in the lightcurve.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,392,69

we ﬁt the periodogram using the maximum likelihood statistic.

rely on the assumption that each observation is independent and
the number of free trials is limited to only the frequency range
of interest, per observation. Our motivation for not treating each
observation as being a free trial stems from the observation that
certain spectral states, connected to the accretion rate, seem to be
necessary for such QPOs to appear (e.g. Alston et al. 2014).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,452,68

periodogram and the broad-band noise is re-ﬁtted (see Vaughan
2005), but the white noise cutoﬀ frequency is left",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,438,68
unchanged,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Italic,,9,9
"from
our ﬁt where the QPO candidate is included. Deﬁning this frequency",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,71,66
"is a somewhat complex issue as the periodogram is by deﬁnition
only one realisation of the underlying power spectrum (and so would
be best represented by a probability distribution) and the position
of the cutoﬀ naturally has an uncertainty, correlated with those un-
certainties on the normalisation and power-law index (such that a
diﬀerent draw from the covariant distribution – Figure 2 – pro-
duces a diﬀerent cutoﬀ). As we are required to select a single cutoﬀ
frequency (otherwise we introduce an uneven bias into our signif-

now explore the impact of this choice.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,641,69
"Re-ﬁtting the broad-band noise with the QPO candidate re-
moved tends to reduce the white noise cutoﬀ frequency. The result
is that bins at high frequency may then be outside of our range
of interest. As we also require 13 Fourier bins (which includes
the QPO candidate bin – although this frequency is ignored when
the null hypothesis is deﬁned) for ﬁtting purposes, this can have
the knock-on eﬀect of removing energy bands from our study. The",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,445,65

5.2 The eﬀect of windowing/red noise leak,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,41,41
"As we are only selecting a relatively small frequency range com-
pared to the full extent of the underlying power spectrum (see e.g.
Uttley et al. 2002, McHardy et al. 2006), we may expect some
leakage of power into our observed band (see González-Martín &
Vaughan 2012). In Fourier space this is equivalent to convolving the
Fourier transform of the window function (the Fejér kernel) with the
underlying power spectrum (van der Klis 1988). As a result, the in-
trinsic broad-band noise may not be well represented by that which
we measure in our periodogram. We explore the impact of leakage
on those periodograms in which we have signiﬁcant QPO candi-
date detections, by simulating a lightcurve based on an underlying
power-law with an index of -2 following Timmer & Koenig (1995)
but extending back to 10",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,809,68

input power-law, we ﬁrst create very long simulated lightcurves (far

trial normalisation stepping over log space. From these lightcurves
we select a random segment of the same length as our real data",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,442,68

for each QPO candidate-detected observation – we simulate 10,000
fake lightcurves, apply our window, obtain the periodogram, and
search for false outliers. We note this to be a somewhat extreme test
as it is quite likely that a break to to ﬂatter indices occurs before such
low frequencies are reached (see e.g. McHardy et al. 2007) or that
