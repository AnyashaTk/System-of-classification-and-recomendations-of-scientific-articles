Rapid and Robust Parameter Inference for Binary Mergers,11,CMBX12,,55,55

"The detection rate for compact binary mergers has grown as the sensitivity of the global network
of ground based gravitational wave detectors has improved, now reaching the stage where robust
automation of the analyses is essential. Automated low-latency algorithms have been developed
that send out alerts when candidate signals are detected. The alerts include sky maps to facilitate
electromagnetic follow up observations, along with probabilities that the system might contain a
neutron star, and hence be more likely to generate an electromagnetic counterpart. Data quality is-
sues, such as loud noise transients (glitches), can adversely aﬀect the low-latency algorithms, causing
false alarms and throwing oﬀ parameter estimation. Here a new analysis method is presented that is
robust against glitches, and capable of producing fully Bayesian parameter inference, including sky
maps and mass estimates, in a matter of minutes. Key elements of the method are wavelet-based
de-noising, penalized maximization of the likelihood during the initial search, rapid sky localization
using pre-computed inner products, and heterodyned likelihoods for full Bayesian inference.",8,CMR9,,1174,103

INTRODUCTION,8,CMBX9,,12,12
"What started with a trickle in 2015 [1] has now turned
into a veritable deluge [2, 3] of gravitational wave signals
detected by the LIGO and Virgo instruments. Keep-
ing up with the ever increasing event rate is challeng-
ing. While the searches for gravitational wave signals are
now highly automated and capable of producing near-
real time alerts [4–8], full parameter inference [9, 10] has
lagged behind. This is in part due to the large compu-
tational cost of fully Bayesian parameter inference, and
in part due to the challenge of working with data that
needs to be carefully calibrated [11, 12] and cleaned of
various noise contaminants [13–16].",9,CMR10,,653,60
"The instrument noise in the LIGO and Virgo data is,
for the most part, well described as locally stationary
and Gaussian [17]. Short duration signals, such as high
mass binary black holes, are in the sensitive band of the
detector for a second or less, and the odds of the signal
encountering a noise transient is low. However, for longer
duration signals, such as low mass black hole binaries or
systems that include a neutron star, the signals are in the
sensitive band of the detectors for tens of seconds or even
minutes, and it is likely that the signal will encounter a",9,CMR10,,575,59
"noise transient. As the low-frequency sensitivity of the
detectors improve, low mass systems are virtually guar-
anteed to encounter noise transients. The LIGO/Virgo
analyses have been fortiﬁed against noise transients using
a combination of vetoes [18], glitch robust search statis-
tics [19], gating [20] and glitch subtraction [16]. Gating
of glitches is used in the online searches, while glitch sub-
traction is performed prior to oﬀ-line parameter estima-
tion.",9,CMR10,,467,61

II. OVERVIEW OF THE,8,CMBX9,,19,19
QUICKCBC,8,CMTT9,,8,8
ALGORITHM,8,CMBX9,,9,9
The,9,CMR10,,3,3
QuickCBC,9,CMTT10,,8,8
"algorithm works with short snippets of
LIGO-Virgo data, typically 4 to 8 seconds in length when
searching for binary black holes and 16 to 32 seconds in
length when searching for binary neutron stars. The run
time scales roughly linearly with the data volume.",9,CMR10,,259,56
"The ﬁrst step is to produce estimates for the power
spectral density in each detector. On-source spectral es-
timation, where the short segment of data to be searched
is also used to estimate the power spectral density (PSD),
can be thrown oﬀ by the presence of loud signals or loud",9,CMR10,,282,58
"glitches. To avoid such biases,",9,CMR10,,31,31
QuickCBC,9,CMTT10,,8,8
"uses an itera-
tive approach that combines a running median estimate
for the spectrum with spectral line identiﬁcation and
wavelet de-noising [31]. The de-noising removes signals
and glitches, so only the spectral estimate from the ﬁrst
stage of the analysis is passes to the second stage. The
second stage performs a rapid, network coherent search
for CBC signals using a parallel tempered Markov Chain
Monte Carlo algorithm (PTMCMC) [36] with a banded
likelihood that is analytically maximized over amplitude,
phase and arrival time. Only the intrinsic parameters
of the signal - masses and spins - are explored by the
PTMCMC. The banded likelihood automatically identi-
ﬁes and rejects frequency bands that are impacted by
noise transients. The removal is done separately for each
time delay, resulting in a robust time-frequency glitch
rejection method that can detect signals in the presence
of glitches. The third stage subtracts the best-ﬁt CBC
waveform from the data, and performs a second round
of spectral estimation and wavelet de-noising. The de-
noising produces a glitch model that is subtracted from
the original data, while preserving any gravitational wave",9,CMR10,,1173,58
"signals. The cleaned data and updated spectral estimates
are used in the subsequent stages of the analysis. The
fourth stage reﬁnes the estimates of the intrinsic param-
eters using a standard non-maximized and non-banded
likelihood function. Consequently, the amplitude, phase
and arrival time at each detector also have to be explored
by the PTMCMC. The reﬁned estimates for the intrinsic
parameters are then passed to the ﬁfth stage of the anal-
ysis, which uses a PTMCMC algorithm with an algebraic
likelihood function to map out the extrinsic parameters
of the source - sky location, luminosity distance, inclina-",9,CMR10,,618,59
tion and polarization angles while holding the intrinsic,9,CMR10,,56,56
"parameters ﬁxed. Since the extrinsic parameters only im-
pact the projection of the waveform onto the detectors,
the inner products in the likelihood can be pre-computed,
resulting in an algebraic likelihood function that can be
evaluated in a fraction of a microsecond [37]. With the",9,CMR10,,284,57

"ﬁrst ﬁve stages complete the algorithm will have pro-
duced a full three-dimensional sky map (RA, DEC and
luminosity distance), along with estimates for the com-
ponent masses and spins. All in about the time is took
you to read this paragraph. The precise run time will
depend on the duration and bandwidth of the signal and
the speed and number of computations cores. For binary
black hole systems at current LIGO/Virgo sensitivity it is
usually suﬃcient to use 4 seconds of data sampled at 2048
Hz. For neutron star - black hole systems it is enough
to use 8 to 16 seconds of data sampled at 2048 Hz, while
for binary neutron star systems we need 16 to 32 seconds
of data sampled at 4096 Hz. For a binary black hole
system, running on a 2016 MacBook Pro laptop with
a 2.9 GHz quad-core processor, it takes",9,CMR10,,808,58

for the PSD estimation and intrinsic parameter search,
and an additional",9,CMR10,,83,54

sic parameter search and produce sky maps. The cost
of the intrinsic parameter search scales linearly with the",9,CMR10,,145,58
"data duration, while the cost of the extrinsic parameter
search scales linearly with the sample rate. Thus, the in-
trinsic parameter search for neutron-star black hole bina-
ries takes either two to four times longer than for binary
black holes, but time to produce a sky map is the same.
Sky maps can be produced in very low latency by skip-
ping the intrinsic search and instead using the intrinsic
parameters provided by the search pipelines (as is done
by",9,CMR10,,460,58

"The ﬁnal stage of the algorithm reﬁnes the initial pa-

fast, heterodyned likelihood function [32, 33]. The het-
erodyned likelihood oﬀers signiﬁcant speed advantages,
especially for long duration signals such as binary neu-
tron star inspirals. The run-time for the ﬁnal PTMCMC
stage scales linearly with the sample rate and is indepen-
dent of the observation time. On the same laptop com-
puter described earlier, the PTMCMC stage takes four
minutes for black hole binaries and neutron star - black
hole binaries, and eight minutes for neutron star bina-",9,CMR10,,605,58

The,9,CMR10,,3,3
QuickCBC,9,CMTT10,,8,8
"analysis pipeline is an end-to-end, open-
source tool for gravitational wave data analysis. Its key
features are speed and robustness against noise tran-
sients. The main limitation of the pipeline is that it
currently only works with the IMRPhenomD waveform
model. A near-term development goal
is to expand
the range of waveform models, starting with the IM-
RPhenomHM model [45], which includes contributions
from higher modes, and the IMRPhenomD NRTidal
model [46] which includes tidal eﬀects for binanry neu-
tron star mergers. A longer term goal is to add precessing
spin models.",9,CMR10,,584,58
Possible uses for the,9,CMR10,,21,21
QuickCBC,9,CMTT10,,8,8
"pipeline for researchers
outside the LIGO/Virgo collaboration are as a platform
to develop novel analyses that can be applied to the pub-
licly released data. Within the LIGO/Virgo collabora-
tion the pipeline could be used to generate low latency
sky maps, and to provide estimates for how likely it is
that the system will result in the disruption of a neu-
tron star, and thus a good candidate for producing an
electromagnetic counterpart.",9,CMR10,,442,57
