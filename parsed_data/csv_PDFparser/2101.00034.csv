stability necessary to observe these angular scales from the ground is achieved through the use of
a variable-delay polarization modulator (VPM) as the ﬁrst optical element in each of the CLASS

the CLASS data and apply this method to selected data from the ﬁrst two years of observations by

INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"Observations of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) have revolutionized our understanding of the
universe and established ΛCDM as the standard model
of cosmology (Bennett et al. 2003; Spergel et al. 2003;
Bennett et al. 2013). Much of the cosmological infor-
mation in the CMB is encoded in its angular power
spectrum, which describes the amplitude of the CMB
anisotropy as a function of angular scale or multi-
pole moment,",9,CMR10,,426,55

The amplitude of the E-modes on largest scales (",9,CMR10,,156,56

τ,9,CMMI10,,1,1
"(Page
et al. 2007; Planck Collaboration VI 2019). The shape
of the largest scale E-modes depends on the speciﬁc
reionization history, such that the free electron frac-
tion over cosmic time can be constrained using high
signal-to-noise large-scale E-mode measurements (Hu &
Holder 2003; Heinrich & Hu 2018; Watts et al. 2020).
Additionally, constraining speciﬁc inﬂationary models
using large-scale B-mode measurements requires excel-
lent knowledge of the reionization history (Obied et al.
2018). Observing the large scale E-modes requires mea-
suring angular correlations on large fractions of sky to

presence of super-horizon gravitational waves predicted
to have been produced during an inﬂationary expansion

linearly polarizing wire grid positioned in front of and
parallel to a movable mirror. The distance between the
grid and the mirror creates a phase delay between po-
larization states parallel and perpendicular to the wires.
Moving the mirror position with respect to the wire grid
changes this phase delay and modulates one linear po-

modulation is rapid, with the mirror moving at 10 Hz.

DATA SELECTION AND PROCESSING,9,CMR10,,29,29
"A study was undertaken to constrain the long time
scale noise properties of the CLASS data before and af-
ter demodulation by examining 2 hour long segments of
data collected throughout Era 1 for the 40 GHz CLASS
telescope. These segments were chosen during times
where the Sun was at least 10",9,CMR10,,293,55

"below the horizon. This
limited the impact of azimuth-synchronous signals and",9,CMR10,,77,53
"isolated time periods where Sun avoidance was unneces-
sary and, thus, the scan frequency was constant. They
are also limited to when the precipitable water vapor

a data glitch or jump repair from biasing the result,
data segments were only used if less than 1% of the
timestreams were ﬂagged by glitch and jump detection
routines.",9,CMR10,,214,53

"these criteria and are used in this analysis. This is sig-
niﬁcantly less than the total data acquired during the
ﬁrst era of 40 GHz observations. These selection crite-
ria were chosen to enable a study of the intrinsic stability
achieved by the VPM during this observational period,
making it possible to quantify the beneﬁts and limita-
tions of the front-end VPM polarization modulator with-
out confusion from other confounding systematics. The
scientiﬁc analysis for this ﬁrst era of 40 GHz observa-
tions will not be subject to the restriction of 2 hour
sections of uninterrupted observing or the sun elevation
limit, meaning the analyzed data set will be larger and
a wider selection of potential systematic eﬀects will be
considered.",9,CMR10,,742,60
"In addition to the aforementioned survey data, we also
analyze a small set of stare data, taken when the tele-
scope mount was stationary, from six 2-hour time peri-
ods during the ﬁrst half of 2019. The stare data contains",9,CMR10,,223,57
the 1,9,CMR10,,5,5
/f,9,CMMI10,,2,2
"noise associated with the VPM and the atmo-
sphere, along a single line of sight, while avoiding any
additional eﬀects from mount motion or scan pattern.
Many parts of the telescope structure were upgraded
between Era 1 and the 2019 stare data, primarily due to
the installation of the 90 GHz telescope. A second set
of mirrors and receiver were installed on the mount, and
the front-end forebaﬄe was expanded to serve both tele-
scopes. In addition, the wire grid on the 40 GHz VPM
was replaced with one with an improved copper ﬁnish
on the wires (Harrington et al. 2018), although this re-
placement does not appear to have signiﬁcantly inﬂu-
enced the demodulated data compared to Era 1 data.
Using data from the diﬀerent observational conﬁgura-
tion is necessary because no equivalent data are avail-
able from Era 1, where stare observations were shorter
than 2 hours or during sub-par weather.",9,CMR10,,899,56
"The processing for these segments is similar to that
implemented for other CLASS analyses. Glitches and
jumps in the data due to transient detector eﬀects are
repaired by ﬁtting a quadratic function to each side of
the discontinuity, aligning the two functions, and inter-
polating in the cut region. For this study, a model for",9,CMR10,,328,57

to smoothly join the two regions and enable FFT-based
periodogram estimation of the power spectral density of
the timestream. Next, the Butterworth ﬁlter applied to
the data by the warm readout electronics is deconvolved.
As ﬁrst described in Appel et al. (2019), the unique
oscillatory nature of the VPM enables one to utilize the
VSS to measure the time constants associated with the
detector response. For computational speed and robust-
ness, each segment is split into 10-minute sections. A
single-pole ﬁlter model that optimally removes hystere-",9,CMR10,,608,56

characteristics of the telescope and site during that time,
such as the PWV, air temperature, wind speed, bore-
sight angle, and mirror temperatures. Here we discuss
the observational characteristics that have the largest
eﬀect on the knee frequencies of the demodulated data.

splits with the largest impact is the position in the fo-
cal plane. Figure 7 shows the median knee frequency
for each pixel in the 40 GHz focal plane during the ﬁrst
observation era. The eight “edge pixels,” those clos-
est to the orange circle in the ﬁgure, have beams that
are closest to the forebaﬄe at the entrance to the tele-
scope and have a median knee frequency about three
times larger than all the other “central pixels.” Xu

ter absorptive blackening was applied to the forebaﬄe.
It is clear there are residual boresight dependent,
VPM synchronous vibrations that are aﬀecting the long-
term stability of the demodulated data during the ﬁrst
observing era for the CLASS 40 GHz telescope. During
this observing time, there was only one telescope on the
telescope mount that was designed to hold two. Coun-
terweights were installed on the opposite side, to par-
tially replicate the weight of the uninstalled telescope.
It is possible an uneven mass distribution contributed
to these boresight dependent vibrations. Since the ﬁrst
observing era, the second telescope has been installed on
that mount, and a third telescope was installed on a sec-
ond mount. Preliminary analysis of Era 2 data does not
show the same discontinuity with boresight, suggesting
the evening out of the weight distribution or one of the
other upgrades remidied this discontinuity.
The oﬀset at positive boresights is subtracted,
in
quadrature, from the red noise amplitudes of every ﬁt.
The reduced red noise amplitudes are then scaled back
to a knee frequency using the white noise level of the
timestream. Adjusting for the positive boresight vibra-
tional oﬀset reduces the knee frequency of the central
pixels from 11.65
0.2 mHz, corresponding
0.1 to 10.4
to a 15% reduction in the red noise amplitude.

5.4. Comparison with Stare Data
A similar 1/f noise analysis was performed on the
six stare observations during the second observing era
for the 40 GHz telescope. These data, taken while the
mount was not scanning, were used to get an estimate of
the baseline level of 1/f possible with a front-end VPM.
The data are processed identically as the scanning data
and the ﬁts to the PSDs are also listed at the bottom of
Table 2. The spectral indexes of these data are steeper
than those of the scanning data, possibly indicating the
1/f noise for stare data is dominated by a source diﬀer-
ent than what dominates the scanning data.
±
The median knee frequency for stare data from the
central detectors with PWV < 1 mm is 4.24
0.92 mHz.
This level of 1/f noise includes any variation in demod-
ulated data due to the stability of the VPM alone and
would also detect any ﬂuctuations due to instabilities in
the readout system if they were a dominating factor of
the residual 1/f . The estimated knee frequency of the
scanning data-set when both the eﬀects of PWV and
boresight are removed is 7.5
2.0 mHz; about 2σ higher
than the stare 1/f knee frequency.
±
Since intrinsic variability of the VPM does not account
for the residual 1/f noise, once the boresight oﬀset and
PWV variation are removed, we are left to conclude the
residual 1/f noise is due to something associated with
scanning.
6. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have examined the long time-scale
stability of the data from the 40 GHz CLASS telescope
using a front-end variable-delay polarization modulator
and found a substantial decrease in temperature to po-
larization leakage and knee frequencies between the pair-
diﬀerenced and demodulated timestreams. This will en-
able CLASS to observe the largest-angular scales of the
CMB polarization from the ground.
We have presented a demodulation scheme that ac-
counts for the covariance between the modulated linear
and circular polarizations through a continuous least-
squares ﬁtting approach and outputs timestreams of the
linear and circular polarization incident on the VPM as
well as their associated covariances.

for wind speeds above 4.25 m/s. The more central pixels

status of the data with no post-processing beyond the

scope scan strategy, brings the projected knee in mul-

noise levels observed in preliminary maps of the 40 GHz
CLASS data. This would not be possible without the
substantial reduction of 1/f noise due to the VPM. In
future work, we will be expanding this analysis to in-
clude simultaneous multi-frequency observations to fur-
ther constrain the sources of 1/f noise in the CLASS
data.

APPENDIX
A. SOURCES OF INTENSITY 1/f NOISE
The single detector data and PSDs contain the atmo-
spheric temperature information and any other intensity
related signals. The atmosphere is normally the largest
temperature source continuously observed by a ground-
P leakage will con-
based CMB telescope. Any T
vert atmospheric temperature into polarization, and the
single detector data are one mechanism of calibrating
the level of atmospheric signal observed by the CLASS
40 GHz telescope. This calibration is necessary because
the CLASS 40 GHz beam, bandpass, and scan strategy
are unique among operating Atacama telescopes.
→
The observed atmospheric signal is comprised of a
bulk airmass with a temperature that varies smoothly
with a direction and time as well as small-scale turbu-
lence modes. Atmospheric turbulence and the theoret-
ical models describing it have been well characterized
from the CLASS Atacama site (Church 1995; Lay &
Halverson 2000; D¨unner et al. 2013; Errard et al. 2015).
One of the signatures of atmospheric turbulence is the
spectral index of the f α power law in the data PSD. For
Kolmogorov turbulence, this index ranges from
8/3
to
11/3 depending on the size scale of the turbulence
modes (Lay & Halverson 2000). This power law index
and its variation with precipitable water vapor (PWV)
have been observed from the Atacama by ACT (D¨unner
−
−
200
et al. 2013) and from the South Pole by ACBAR (Buss-
mann et al. 2005). From Table 1, the median spectral
index observed at 40 GHz by the CLASS telescope is
much shallower than the values predicted from turbu-
lent motion in the atmosphere.
Errard et al. (2015) used Polarbear data to cal-
ibrate a model of turbulence for the Atacama and
found the injection scale of the turbulent modes to be
500 m in size. Depending on the height where
∼
the turbulent modes are injected, this injection scale cor-

responds to an angular scale of 14◦
turbulent features. The 40 GHz CLASS beams have a
full-width half max (FWHM) of
1.6◦ (Xu et al. 2020),
meaning the 1/f power law observed by larger-aperture
telescopes in the Atacama should not be expected for
the CLASS 40 GHz telescope because the beams smooth
over the majority of the turbulent modes in the atmo-
sphere.

this plot represents one of the detectors. The gray-scale half circles are shaded by the median single detector spectral index
value. The shaded outer regions label the readout column assigned to each detector in the time-division multiplexing scheme.
If atmospheric turbulence was the dominant source of 1/f noise we would expect the spectral index to be consistent across the
focal plane. Larger scale atmospheric ﬂuctuations would depend on airmass and elevation on the sky, meaning detectors with
the same elevation oﬀset in the focal plane would have the same spectral index. Although boresight rotations move the elevation
oﬀset to diﬀerent elevations on the sky and this plot shows the median for all boresights, the observed pattern persists when
the data are split by boresight. Instead, detectors with the same elevation oﬀset but diﬀerent readout column placement show
diﬀerent 1/f spectral indexes. This points to readout eﬀects being a larger contributor to 1/f than the atmosphere for single
detector data on the 2-hour timescales examined here. The stability of pair-diﬀerenced and pair-diﬀerenced demodulated data
does not show a similar dependence on readout column.
timescale ﬂuctuations was atmospheric, we would ex-
pect detectors next to each other to see the same at-
mosphere as the telescope scans at a constant elevation.
The signiﬁcant diﬀerence in spectral index between some
nearest-neighbor pixels points to a source diﬀerent than
the atmosphere.
A possible alternative source for the single-detector
data long-timescale 1/f noise is the electronics in the
focal plane and multiplexing readout system. Volt-
age ﬂuctuations across the detector bias lines were ob-
served to create correlated noise between detectors in
the same readout column in dark detector testing for
the 40 GHz CLASS focal plane. These voltage ﬂuc-
tuations would be expected to occur on all timescales.
The nearest-neighbor pixel pairs with the most diﬀer-
ent spectral indexes are on multiplexing column bound-
aries and in-focal-plane-wiring, while the spectral in-
dexes within columns are generally uniform. Since the
atmospheric turbulent spectrum is expected to plateau
at larger angular scales, and thus lower temporal fre-
quencies, it appears the single detector 1/f is dominated
by the ﬂuctuations in the readout system.
The column correlated noise is most easily removed
from the data by pair-diﬀerencing, since every detec-
tor is on the same column as its pixel pair. For this
reason, 40 GHz CLASS analysis, including the demodu-
lated data in this paper, is done with pair-diﬀerenced
data. However, the dominance of readout noise at
long timescales will aﬀect any measurements of intensity
that requires pair-adding data. In particular, compar-
ing the knee frequencies of single detector data to pair-
diﬀerenced and/or demodulated data does not produce
a reliable estimate of temperature to polarization leak-
age. A similar search of readout-induced 1/f was done
for the demodulated data and no column-correlated ef-
fects could be found. This indicates that readout may
be a dominant source of 1/f noise for single-detector
data but not for pair-diﬀerenced demodulated data.

It is clear there are residual boresight dependent,
VPM synchronous vibrations that are aﬀecting the long-
term stability of the demodulated data during the ﬁrst
observing era for the CLASS 40 GHz telescope. During
this observing time, there was only one telescope on the
telescope mount that was designed to hold two. Coun-
terweights were installed on the opposite side, to par-
tially replicate the weight of the uninstalled telescope.
It is possible an uneven mass distribution contributed
to these boresight dependent vibrations. Since the ﬁrst
observing era, the second telescope has been installed on
that mount, and a third telescope was installed on a sec-
ond mount. Preliminary analysis of Era 2 data does not
show the same discontinuity with boresight, suggesting
