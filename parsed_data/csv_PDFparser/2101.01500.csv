ABSTRACT,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,8,8
The natural night sky brightness is a relevant input for monitoring the light pollution,9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,87,87
"evolution at observatory sites, by subtracting it from the overall sky brightness determined
by direct measurements. It is also instrumental for assessing the expected darkness of the
pristine night skies. The natural brightness of the night sky is determined by the sum of
the spectral radiances coming from astrophysical sources, including zodiacal light, and the
atmospheric airglow. The resulting radiance is modiﬁed by absorption and scattering before it
reaches the observer. Therefore, the natural night sky brightness is a function of the location,
time and atmospheric conditions. We present in this work GAMBONS (GAia Map of the
Brightness Of the Natural Sky), a model to map the natural night brightness of the sky in
cloudless and moonless nights. Unlike previous maps, GAMBONS is based on the extra-
atmospheric star radiance obtained from the",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,856,96

INTRODUCTION,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,12,12
"The natural brightness of the night sky in diﬀerent photometric
passbands is a relevant parameter for site characterization and light
pollution research, since it allows establishing a baseline against
which to evaluate the light pollution levels experienced in urban,
periurban, rural and pristine dark sites.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,310,69
"Brightness, in this context, is a shortcut name for the spectral
radiance of the sky, weighted by the sensitivity function of the
photometric band, spectrally integrated over all wavelengths, and
angularly integrated within the ﬁeld-of-view of the detector.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,257,65

"In the visual wavelength range, the integrated starlight (ISL) is one
of the most important contributors to the natural sky brightness.
In some circumstances, as for lines of sight towards the Galactic
Centre far from the Sun and for low solar activity, ISL can be
the brightest component. Early works on the night sky brightness
used simple models of the Galaxy to determine the ISL. Bahcall

of an exponential disk and a power-law, spheroidal bulge, that was
widely used in the last years of the last century.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,574,69

"The diﬀuse galactic light (DGL) is the diﬀuse background radiation
produced by the scattering of the starlight in the dust grains present
in the interstellar space. It contributes typically between 20 and 30
per cent of the total integrated light from the Milky Way (Leinert
et al. 1998).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,288,70
"DGL is very diﬃcult to map because it is masked by the light
coming from the unresolved stars and, for ground based observa-
tions, airglow and zodiacal light. Despite all this, several works to
characterize and even model the DGL in the optical range have been
done. A simple estimation of the DGL can be done using the rela-
tion between the ISL and DGL intensities in a given line of sight.
It is supported by the fact that DGL is mainly originated from the
forward scattering on interstellar grains, tracking in this way the
starlight in a given sky direction. Leinert et al. (1998) give the ratios
DGL to ISL for diﬀerent galactic latitudes based on Toller (1981).
A second and more accurate approach is to use the data from Pio-
neer probes (Arai et al. 2015). The Imaging Photopolarimeter (IPP)
instruments on Pioneer 10/11 collected data in blue (395 nm – 495
nm) and red (590 nm – 690 nm) bands. The measured radiances at
heliocentric distances greater than 3 AU are assumed as not aﬀected
by the zodiacal light. After removing the contribution of the ISL
using stellar counts or synthetic models, it is possible to get the DGL
plus the Extragalactic Background Light (the integrated radiation",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1202,73
"from all light sources outside the Galaxy). A summary of the use
and limitations of this methodology can be found in Toller (1990).
In this work, we have adopted a diﬀerent approach. From the
early work of Laureĳs et al. (1987), several authors have pointed out
the relation between the diﬀuse emission of the dust at 100",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,321,69

its emission at visible wavelength. The relation can be written, using

"Aiglow is a faint light emission originated in the upper atmosphere.
It is caused by chemiluminescence, i.e. the emission of light (lu-
minescence) from the decay of excited states of the products of a
chemical reaction. In the case of the airglow, the chemiluminescence
is triggered by the high-energy solar radiation. Airglow is emitted
from several high altitude atmosphere layers, starting around 90 km
(mesopause), where the bright OI and OH emissions, together with
fainter O",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,481,68

green line at 558 nm (see Hart (2019a)), the OI red lines at 630
nm and 636 nm (both produced in the layer between 200 km and
300) and the FeO pseudo-continuum around 590 nm (Saran et al.

analyzed by Hart (2019a,b). For some of the main components it
can reach 100 per cent (maximum minus minimum divided by the
median). Also, airglow depends on the solar activity cycle (Patat
2008). Finally, the airglow emission could change with the geo-
graphic latitude, specially for lines originating in the mesopause

geomagnetic latitude, in particular for ionospheric lines such as the
OI lines at 630 and 636 nm. This makes the prediction of the actual
value of the airglow emission diﬃcult to model, and it could be
considered as a free parameter if comparisons with real measure-

"In the previous sections we have described the contributions of the
astrophysical sources to the night sky brightness. Although slightly
diﬀerent models could be adopted for the background light or the
zodiacal light, it is expected that the actual radiance outside the
Earth’s atmosphere does not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the values
given in this work. We have also discussed the contribution of the
airglow, a highly variable source that should be considered as a free
parameter of the model.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,493,69
"However, in order to obtain the local map of the night sky
brightness, we need to deal with the eﬀects of the Earth atmosphere
on the outside radiance. In particular, the eﬀect of the atmospheric
attenuation and the scattering must to be added to the radiance com-
ing from the astrophysical sources. Both eﬀects are highly variable
in time, since they strongly depend on the particular atmospheric
conditions at the place and time of the observation. For the numer-
ical examples presented in Section 8 of this work we adopted some
standard values for the main atmospheric parameters. Diﬀerent at-
mospheric states will give rise to diﬀerent results.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,651,68

by means of two interrelated processes. On the one hand, the radi-

"ation or sporadic lower airglow radiances, not necessarily being
indicative of less polluted (’darker’) skies. The darkest value of the
zenith natural night sky depends on the observer latitude and the
time of observation, as well as on the atmospheric conditions, al-
titude of the observer above sea level, and airglow intensity. Due
to attenuation, less stars are expected to be perceived from sites at
lower altitudes above sea level, as well as at higher zenith angles,
as recently analyzed in Cinzano & Falchi (2020). For a given lati-
tude, using our model (with the particular airglow and atmospheric
conditions assumed in this section), we are able to determine the
minimum value of the night sky brightness (i.e. the darkest sky at
a given latitude). It is shown in Fig. 13. The darkest skies (aver-
aged over 10 degrees around the zenith) are found at mid-latitudes
in both hemispheres. The presence of the ecliptic plane near the
zenith for observers near the Equator prevents them to reach the
darkest values. This eﬀect almost disappears if we considered the
full sky dome, but it is well visible even for a wide ﬁeld of view

"We present GAMBONS (the GAia Map of the Brightness Of the
Natural Sky) model of the natural night sky brightness. The model
considers each of the contributors to the sky brightness (i.e. the in-
tegrated star light, the diﬀuse galactic light, the extragalactic back-
ground light, the zodiacal light and the airglow), plus the atmo-
spheric attenuation and scattering into the ﬁeld-of-view. The main
novelty with respect to previous models is the use of the",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,457,71

"In particular, although it amounts less than the 3 per cent of the
sky brightness, we have put an eﬀort to evaluate the contribution of
the astrophysical diﬀuse light (diﬀuse galactic light plus extragalac-
tic background light), by using the relation between the emission at

Sky Model, through the ESO SkyCalc tool.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,162,61
Two highly variable inputs to the model are the absolute zenith,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,63,63

of observation. They vary from place to place and in diﬀerent time
scales. Information on aerosol properties at a large network of mon-
itoring sites worldwide can be obtained from AERONET.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,258,68
"GAMBONS is expected to enable multiple applications in the
study and characterization of the natural night sky brightness. We
have pointed out several of them. In particular we have shown
the variation of the sky darkness as function of the latitude of
the observer and time, as well as the variation of the contribution
of the diﬀerent sources of natural light with these two variables.
Furthermore, GAMBONS could help, if reliable determinations
of airglow intensity and atmospheric conditions are available, to
establish a reference value of the sky darkness, for any given location
in a moonless and cloudless night, against which to evaluate the
measurements reported by the observers. In a forthcoming paper
we will deal with the use of GAMBONS to remove the natural night
sky brightness from the raw all-sky images in order to quantitatively
estimate the levels of light pollution, and to put to the test the
predictions obtained from models of atmospheric propagation of
artiﬁcial light at night.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1004,71
