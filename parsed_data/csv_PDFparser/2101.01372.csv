sources have improved, the tension between these has increased to be well

"threshold. Given this, the need for an explanation of such
a tension has grown. In this paper, we explore a set of 7 assumptions,
and show that, in order to alleviate the Hubble tension, a model needs to
break at least one of these 7, providing a quick and easy to apply check
for new model proposals. We also use this framework to make a rough
categorisation of current proposed models, and show the existence of at
least one under-explored avenue of alleviating the Hubble tension.",8,CMR9,,483,73

". There
have since been further late-time measurements reported in [9, 10], but other
than strengthening error bounds, these do not signiﬁcantly change this picture.
This tension is large enough that it has created a need for an explanation.
As such, there have been a myriad of models proposed that alleviate (part of)
this tension, overviews of which are given in [11, 12].",9,CMR10,,375,79
"Currently, there are few general results placing formal conditions on what",9,CMR10,,74,74
a model alleviating the Hubble tension should look like. The authors are only,9,CMR10,,77,77
1,9,CMR10,,1,1
"aware of [13], providing a general result showing that a viable model needs to
modify more than just the size of the sound horizon.",9,CMR10,,131,78
1,6,CMR7,,1,1
"The goal of this paper
is to provide a new general (model independent) result setting conditions on
models alleviating the Hubble tension.",9,CMR10,,138,76
"We do this by taking a higher level view of possible alleviating models. In
section 2, we provide a set of 7 assumptions based on CMB observations and
direct measurements of",9,CMR10,,173,75
H,9,CMMI10,,1,1
0,6,CMR7,,1,1
"which combine to create a space of options in which
the cosmological standard model ΛCDM is an extremum. This then allows us
to show that our 7 assumptions exclude any model that has the potential to
alleviate the Hubble tension, implying that any such model should break at
least 1 of our 7 assumptions.",9,CMR10,,304,74
We then demonstrate one application of this result in section 3 by making,9,CMR10,,73,73
a categorisation of the space of existing proposals by means of the assumptions,9,CMR10,,79,79
"they break. This provides us with two things: A somewhat reasonable categori-
sation of existing proposals, and an under-explored avenue for new solutions.",9,CMR10,,155,77

"We can now reconsider existing models for alleviating the Hubble tension within
the framework of our assumptions. This gives insight into how existing models
achieve their alleviation of the Hubble tension, and provides insight into avenues
of reducing the early-late time tension that are not yet as well explored.",9,CMR10,,315,82
"In doing this, we will consider a variety of models from the literature in the
coming pages. However, our focus here will be primarily on providing clarity in
illustrating the various ways our assumptions can be broken, and as such, this
will not be an exhaustive overview of theories alleviating the Hubble tension.
The interested reader can ﬁnd good starting points for further theories in [11].
Furthermore, in choosing these examples, we have not focused on whether
such models are, or have the potential to be, consistent with further observa-",9,CMR10,,548,80

"and measurements of the CMB. This choice was made speciﬁcally to provide a
more complete illustration of the approaches already considered.",9,CMR10,,139,74
"Finally, some of the examples given here could be classiﬁed under multiple
of these assumptions, either because they break multiple conditions, or because
one can reasonably disagree which of the conditions is actually broken. The
classiﬁcation here represents the opinions of the authors as to which condition(s)
best reﬂect the way in which a model alleviates Hubble tension. Although others
might classify these models diﬀerently, we believe that the resulting conclusions
drawn from this classiﬁcation are robust under these diﬀering opinions.",9,CMR10,,547,82

physics. For late-time measurements of",9,CMR10,,278,79

observations ([3, 4, 5, 6, 7], since augmented with [9, 10]) also leads the authors
of [8] to consider this to be an unlikely option.",9,CMR10,,167,83
"However, there exist several eﬀects that act similarly to late-time systematics
within our framework of assumptions. This could be from eﬀects such as photon
brightening (section IV.2 in [11], originating from ideas in [14] and [15]), it",9,CMR10,,237,79
"could be the result of a local matter void [16], or originate from screened ﬁfth

tions by Planck, [1] indicates no direction for poorly or uncontrolled sources of

achieve a change of the sound horizon by changing the evolution just after
matter-radiation equality, giving similar net eﬀects from the perspective of our
reasoning. This changed sound horizon, which typically becomes smaller, in
turn decreases the angular diameter distance, resulting in higher values of",9,CMR10,,546,81

3.3 Subverting the spatially ﬂat FRW framework,11,CMBX12,,46,46
"A second approach to alleviating the Hubble tension is found in subverting
the assumptions leading to the framework of ﬂat FRW spacetimes and their
evolution equations.",9,CMR10,,168,74
"One option for this is modifying gravity to the point where the eﬀects of
such modiﬁcations inﬂuence cosmological evolution, breaking Assumption 1.
This approach has been studied for various modiﬁed gravity theories in [24, 25,
26, 27].",9,CMR10,,236,79
"A second way this can happen is when the evolution of the universe gains
signiﬁcant eﬀects from deviations from perfect spatial ﬂatness or isotropy. This
would then break either or both of Assumptions 2 and 3. Such an approach
is studied for an ”eﬀective” curvature type contribution arising from matter
clumping in [28]. Approaches based on more explicit breaking of isotropy can
be found in [29].",9,CMR10,,398,80

relation between angular diameter distance and (some of the ingredients of)",9,CMR10,,148,75

ever, the authors are not aware of attempts to resolve the hubble tension this",9,CMR10,,155,78

decay to some slower-diluting component, or having components in the universe
whose density grows with redshift (both part of Assumption 7).",9,CMR10,,295,79

solutions are very active areas of research. Because of this, we will not try to",9,CMR10,,156,80

4 Conclusion,14,CMBX12,,12,12
"We have shown that, for any theory to be able to solve the Hubble tension, it
needs to break at least one of the Assumptions 1 through 7 deﬁned above. This
provides us with two main beneﬁts. First of all, these conditions can be used
as a tool to quickly determine whether a new proposed model has any hope of
relieving the Hubble tension, and as a check on results for those models that
break these conditions only in certain parts of their parameter space.",9,CMR10,,458,77
"Furthermore, it allowed us to categorise the models already proposed. This
showed us that breaking the standard relationship between redshift and scale
factor can potentially solve the Hubble tension, but has so far not been ex-
plored in models. Exploration of mechanisms which can achieve such a changed
link between redshift and scale factor could be an interesting avenue of further
research.",9,CMR10,,396,80
"One limitation of our work is that it constrains the theory space only from
two very speciﬁc observations, the direct measurement of",9,CMR10,,132,75
H,9,CMMI10,,1,1
0,6,CMR7,,1,1
"through distance
ladders, and the interpretation of the CMB. Further research into general con-
ditions on models resulting from other observations could provide useful tools
for further exploring the space of models alleviating the Hubble tension.",9,CMR10,,248,78
