1 INTRODUCTION,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,14,14
"In the standard disc-corona paradigm the hard X-ray emission of
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is produced in a hot and compact
region, the so called corona (e.g. Haardt & Maraschi 1991; Haardt
et al. 1994), through the inverse Compton scattering of the seed
photons from the accretion disk. This process could produce the
observed power law continuum with a high-energy cutoﬀ. Such a
cutoﬀ has been detected in a number of AGNs (Zdziarski et al.
2000; Molina et al. 2013), particularly with the high-quality hard
X-ray spectra of NuSTAR (e.g., Matt et al. 2015; Tortosa et al. 2018;
Molina et al. 2019; Kang et al. 2020), providing key constraints on
the yet unclear coronal physics (e.g. Fabian et al. 2015).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,709,69

"The common “softer-when-brighter” trend in Seyfert galaxies
was generally attributed to presumbly cooler corona during brighter
phases due to more eﬀective cooling by more seed photons. How-
ever, such scenario clearly contradicts the discovery of “hotter-when-
brighter” pattern detected in AGNs (e.g. Keek & Ballantyne 2016;
Zhang et al. 2018). Geometry changes of the corona are required to
reproduce the “softer-when-brighter” trend (e.g. Keek & Ballantyne
2016; Zhang et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2020). Speciﬁcally, the corona
could be heated to a higher temperature and simultaneously driven
to inﬂate during X-ray brighter phases (Wu et al. 2020), leading to
a smaller opacity and thus softer spectra, and reproducing the ob-
served “hotter-when-softer/brighter” pattern (the rising part of the",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,796,70

evidences that suggest the corona is vertically outﬂowing (e.g. Liu
