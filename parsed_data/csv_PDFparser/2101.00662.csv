have less aﬀect in larger galaxies. The recent [O iii] measurements,
combined with stellar mass estimates, start to study whether these

"m detections and their
future promise, we developed a ﬁrst-principles analytic model for
[O iii] emission in Yang & Lidz (2020), (hereafter Yang2020). We
leave the more complex modeling required for studying [C ii] emis-
sion (e.g. Ferrara et al. 2019; Katz et al. 2019) to future work. The
Yang2020 model determines the [O iii] luminosity from galaxies
with a given SFR, metallicity, gas density, and ionizing spectral
shape. Brieﬂy, in these calculations we ﬁrst compute the total vol-
ume in HII regions across each galaxy and the [O iii] fraction within
these regions. We then determine the level populations in the dif-
ferent ﬁne-structure states and the resulting line luminosities. We
cross-checked these calculations against CLOUDY (Ferland et al.
2017) simulations and ﬁnd that they agree to better than 15% ac-
curacy across a broad range of model parameters. We then applied
the model to derive bounds on the gas phase metallicity and den-
sity in the HII regions from the current ALMA sample of 88",8,TeXGyreTermes-Regular,,1010,69

ties and their ratio hence depends on the importance of collisional
de-excitations. As the energy splitting between these ﬁne-structure
states is small compared to the temperature of the HII region gas,
the line ratio is insensitive to the temperature of the gas. Further, the
lines arise from the same ion and so the ratio does not depend on
the ionization state of the gas, nor appreciably on its metal content.

of the total [O iii] luminosity summed over all of the HII regions in
the galaxy. We adopt a Starburst99 population synthesis stellar
spectrum (Leitherer et al. 1999) with a continuous SFR, a Salpeter
IMF (Salpeter 1955), and an age of 10 Myr throughout, in which
case the doubly-ionized oxygen fraction is close to unity through-
out the HII region for the SFRs considered here. As discussed in
