"lation between the distributions of matter and galaxies
in large-scale structure [18, 19]. Since physical processes
inherent in formation and evolution of galaxies are still
diﬃcult to accurately model from the ﬁrst principles, we
need both observational and theoretical approaches to

In particular, galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, obtained by
cross-correlating positions of foreground (lens) galaxies
with shapes of background galaxies, can be used to in-
fer the average mass distribution around lens galaxies.
A combination of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing with auto-

lens galaxies can be used to observationally disentangle",9,CMR10,,558,58
"the galaxy bias and the correlation function of the under-
lying matter distribution from the measured clustering
signal of galaxies.",9,CMR10,,133,58
"On theory side, there are mainly two empirical ap-
proaches to tackle the galaxy bias uncertainty. First
one is a model based on perturbation theory (PT) of
large-scale structure [27, 28]. As long as only the large-
scale information of clustering observables in the linear or
quasi-nonlinear regime is used and nuisance parameters
to model galaxy bias are introduced, such a PT-based
method is expected to serve as an “accurate” theoreti-
cal template of galaxy clustering [26, 29–31]. Accuracy
here refers to the fact that a PT model can reproduce
the observed clustering correlation of galaxies by varying
the bias parameters, down to a certain scale still in the
quasi-nonlinear regime, where PT is valid. An advantage
of this method is that the model can be used for any type
of galaxies, because PT is formulated based on properties
of gravity and primordial ﬂuctuations [32] and the free
bias parameters absorb large-scale clustering properties
of galaxies irrespective of galaxy types. A price to pay is
that the method breaks down at scales below a certain",9,CMR10,,1065,60
"nonlinear scale, and cannot be used to extract cosmolog-
ical information from the small-scale clustering signals,
which generally carry higher signal-to-noise ratios than
in the large scales.",9,CMR10,,192,57
"An alternative theoretical method is the halo model
approach [33–36]. Halos are places where galaxies likely
form, and clustering properties of halos are relatively
well understood, on both analytical approach and",9,CMR10,,213,56

can be used to connect halos to galaxies. An advan-",9,CMR10,,163,54
"tage of this method is that it would allow one to use the
small-scale information in cosmology inference, thereby
yielding tighter constraints on cosmological parameters.

to recover the cosmological parameters, we will start to
introduce more parameters. However, if the cosmological
constraints turn to be sensitive to such details of a treat-
ment of galaxies inside the halo, this is a sign of the failure
or limitation of the halo model based method, because
such a small-scale distribution of galaxies is very diﬃ-

"In this section, to assess the performance of the halo
model method against uncertainties in the halo-galaxy
connection, we perform the parameter inference against
various mock catalogs (Table VI). Note that we here
employ the ﬁducial HOD model (5 parameters model),",9,CMR10,,266,54

model can recover the true cosmological parameters to
