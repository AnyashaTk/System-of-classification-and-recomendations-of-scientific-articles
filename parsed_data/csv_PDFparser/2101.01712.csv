be independent of the local environment. In Paper I we presented an improved, local density-dependent model for the sub-grid
gas clumping. Here we extend this using an",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,190,124
empirical stochastic model,9,TeXGyreTermesX-Italic,,26,26
"based on the results from high-resolution numerical
simulations which fully resolve all relevant Ô¨Çuctuations. Our model reproduces well both the mean density-clumping relation
and its scatter. We applied our stochastic model, along with the mean clumping one and the Paper I deterministic model, to
create a large-volume realisations of the clumping Ô¨Åeld, and used these in radiative transfer simulations of cosmic reionization.
Our results show that the simplistic mean clumping model delays reionization compared to local density-dependent models,
despite producing fewer recombinations overall. This is due to the very diÔ¨Äerent spatial distribution of clumping, resulting in
much higher photoionization rates in the latter cases. The mean clumping model produces smaller H II regions throughout most
of reionization, but those percolate faster at late times. It also causes signiÔ¨Åcant delay in the 21-cm Ô¨Çuctuations peak and yields
lower non-Gaussianity and many fewer bright pixels in the PDF distribution. The stochastic density-dependent model shows
relatively minor diÔ¨Äerences from the deterministic one, mostly concentrated around overlap, where it signiÔ¨Åcantly suppresses
the 21-cm Ô¨Çuctuations, and at the bright tail of the 21-cm PDFs, where it produces noticeably more bright pixels.",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1294,131

1 INTRODUCTION,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,14,14
"The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is an important period in the his-
tory of the Universe, which encompasses the creation of the Ô¨Årst stars
and galaxies that subsequently inÔ¨Çuenced the formation and evolu-
tion of latter-day structures. These luminous objects have produced
enough UV-radiation to both alter their host galaxy composition and
to propagate into the intergalactic medium (IGM), ultimately ioniz-
ing it for a second time (Furlanetto et al. 2006; Zaroubi 2012; Ferrara
& PandolÔ¨Å 2014).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,496,71
"The key goal of reionization simulations is to provide numerical
framework for constraining EoR observables, for example the detec-
tion of the 21cm hyperÔ¨Åne transition of neutral hydrogen Ô¨Çuctuations

tions require large volumes, of several hundreds cMpc size in order
to correctly derive the cosmic reionization history, to account for
abundance and clustering of expected sources and to sample vast
regions of the universe for detection of the redshifted 21cm hyper-

Ô¨Çuctuations in the density distribution down to the Jeans mass of the
cold gas, which is in sub-kpc scale, so as to correctly model recombi-

"First, as noted in ¬ß 2.3, the large volumes generally sample much
wider range of environments than smaller ones used to produce the
model, thus inevitably the large-volume realisation should extrapo-
late to over-densities outside the range sampled by the direct N-body
data, for both larger and smaller over-densities. Second, again as dis-
cussed above, for statistical reasons we Ô¨Åxed the bin sizes so that they
contain same number of data points, which inevitably results in quite
uneven bin widths. These are very narrow near the peak density of
points and are quite wide for extreme values of the over-density. The
combination of these factors yields the ‚ÄôÔ¨Çairing‚Äô of the realisaion
(green) points at both large and small values of the over-density, and
thus possible minor discrepancies with what we Ô¨Ånd in simulations.
However, only small fraction of the points are in these regions, as
demonstrated by the density of points, and therefore it is unlikely this
will aÔ¨Äect the results in any signiÔ¨Åcant way. Obviously, the IC model
is potentially aÔ¨Äected in a similar way, since the quadratic Ô¨Åt is used
beyond the range of the original data points.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1155,72

ionize their surrounding gas, forming small regions of a few Mpc
size. The presence of sub-grid gas clumping slows down the propa-
gation of the I-fronts and yields somewhat smaller, more fragmented
H II regions. Throughout reionization, these HII bubbles grow and
eventually overlap, at which point the ionization process accelerates

"Studies of the large scale reionization morphology and its imprint
on the observable signatures requires large simulated volumes of a
several hundred cMpc per side. Due to computational limitations
which limit the dynamic range, uniformly high resolution cannot be
achieved in such a volume. Therefore no general model of the local
recombinations on scale below the resolution of large numerical
simulation exists. Typically a constant value of clumping factor is
used, but recently we presented a more general model (Paper I),
that depends on the local density, and we demonstrated how an over-
simplistic treatment of the clumping factor can have a strong eÔ¨Äect on
the simulated reionization timescale, topology and size distributions
of the ionized region.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,759,70
"In the current work we extend and improve this method by includ-
ing an empirical stochastic subgrid gas clumping (SC) model (see
¬ß2.3) based on the results from high-resolution N-body simulation,
where the full range of relevant Ô¨Çuctuations is fully resolved. Our
approach considers a novel parametrization of the correlation be-
tween local IGM overdensity and clumping factor, which take into
accounts the scatter due to e.g. tidal forces. We employ a high res-
olution N-body simulation SB, of spatial resolution 260 pc per side,
that resolve the Jeans length of the cold IGM and structure evolu-
tion on scale much smaller then the resolution of EoR simulations.
The density-binned scatter is then modelled with a log-normal dis-
tribution. Those distributions are then randomly sampled to create
a realization of the scatter. We then apply our method to the den-
sity Ô¨Åelds of larger volumes LB-1 (714 cMpc per side) and LB-2
(349 Mpc) to infer its sub-grid clumping factor (see ¬ß2.4). Subse-

an over-simplistic treatment of the clumping factor can have strong

the ionized IGM recombines, and therefore have a strong inÔ¨Çuence
on the timescale of reionization, morphology of the ionized region
and the intensity of the expected 21-cm signal. We demonstrated that
density dependent model takes better account the cumulative eÔ¨Äect of
the clumping factor on the gas recombination rate. On the other hand,
we have also shown that accounting for the scatter around the aver-
age, deterministic local density-clumping relation has only modest

updated version 2 of that code, that reduces the error of the near-
grid point interpolation by extending the particle-particle (PP) force
calculation for a particle out to arbitrary number of cells. With the
latest version, the user can therefore choose how far outside the
hosting cell the PP-force is active. A detailed discussion of this
