"Transient non-Gaussian noise in gravitational wave detectors, commonly referred to as glitches,
pose challenges for detection and inference of the astrophysical properties of detected signals when
the two are coincident in time. Current analyses aim toward modeling and subtracting the glitches
from the data using a ﬂexible, morphology-independent model in terms of sine-Gaussian wavelets
before the signal source properties are inferred using templates for the compact binary signal. We
present a new analysis of gravitational wave data that contain both a signal and glitches by simul-
taneously modeling the compact binary signal in terms of templates and the instrumental glitches
using sine-Gaussian wavelets. The model for the glitches is generic and can thus be applied to a
wide range of glitch morphologies without any special tuning. The simultaneous modeling of the
astrophysical signal with templates allows us to eﬃciently separate the signal from the glitches, as
we demonstrate using simulated signals injected around real O2 glitches in the two LIGO detectors.",8,CMR9,,1077,100

INTRODUCTION,8,CMBX9,,12,12
"During the ﬁrst half of their third observing run (O3a),
the advanced ground based gravitational wave (GW) de-
tectors LIGO [1] and Virgo [2] observed an astrophysi-
cal transient signal about every 5 days of data [3]. The
large detection rate increases the chance of observing an
event while one of the detectors experiences transient non
Gaussian noise, also known as instrumental glitches. In-
deed, this scenario has come to pass for one event from
the second observing run (O2) [4] and 8 events from the
ﬁrst half of the third observing run [3].",9,CMR10,,550,58
"Such coincidences are expected to become even more
frequent in the coming years. Planned improvements in
the detectors’ sensitivity will be directly reﬂected by an
even larger rate of astrophysical discoveries [5]. More-",9,CMR10,,220,58
"over, O3a was characterized by an increase in the rate
of glitch occurrence in the two LIGO detectors, a trend
that might persist during the fourth observing run (O4)
as the decreased average detector noise might help reveal
weaker sources of transient noise. For example the rate of
glitches in the LIGO Livingston detector increased from
0.2 per minute in O2 to 0.8 per minute in O3a [3].",9,CMR10,,390,58
"The presence of a non Gaussian noise feature in the
data, a glitch, poses challenges for nearly all inference
analyses. GW inference is based on a model for the de-
tector noise, expressed through the likelihood function.",9,CMR10,,221,57
"In the absence of glitches, detector noise is colored and
Gaussian to a very good approximation [6], with a spec-
trum that is described through the noise power spectral
density (PSD). The above considerations give rise to a
Gaussian likelihood function whose variance is the noise
PSD, a choice that is almost ubiquitous [7, 8]. Diﬀerent",9,CMR10,,338,57
"choices for estimating the PSD or treating its uncertainty
can result in diﬀerent functional forms for the likelihood,
but they are all based on the assumption of colored Gaus-
sian noise [9, 10].",9,CMR10,,196,59
"Since instrumental glitches violate the basic assump-
tions of GW inference, they need to be eﬀectively miti-
gated before the data are analyzed. One option is to re-
move the oﬀending data all together [4, 11–13], which can
be done quickly, allowing for low latency estimation of
source parameters that enable followup observations [4].
The downside of this approach is that part of the astro-
physical signal is lost making it prohibitive for binary
black hole (BBH) signals whose duration is comparable
to the glitch duration. In order to avoid signal, and thus
information loss, another option is to model the glitch
and regress it from the data, leaving behind not only the
astrophysical signal but also the Gaussian noise. This",9,CMR10,,733,58

and removed from the data, a procedure documented and
released in [26]. Despite the glitch overlapping with the
actual astrophysical signal, the subtraction process was
robust against inadvertently removing the signal together
with the glitch. The reason is that the speciﬁc glitch was
short in duration (less than a second) and extended in
frequency, unlike the signal that lasted for about 2 min-
utes in the detector sensitive band. As such, the sine-
Gaussian wavelets that would ﬁt the glitch and the signal
are distinct in terms of their time-frequency features; the
wavelets that model the glitch are short and hence do
not model the long-lasting BNS signal. This procedure
was further shown to not introduce biases in the astro-
physical parameter inference of the underlying signal by
analyzing simulated signals injected on instances of the
same glitch type in LIGO Livingston data [27].",9,CMR10,,927,59

Both signals and glitches are modeled with a sum of sine-
Gaussian wavelets, the only diﬀerence being that the sig-
nal is coherent across the detectors in the network, while
the glitch is not. The analysis eﬀectively uses data from
all detectors available to determine which part of the non
Gaussian data are coherent (and would thus correspond
to an astrophysical signal), and which part is incoherent
(and would thus correspond to an instrumental glitch).",9,CMR10,,545,58

vectors of the Fisher information matrix, scaled by the
reciprocal of the square root of the corresponding eigen-
value; diﬀerential evolution using a rolling history array
at each temperature, updated every 10 iterations and
holding 1000 past samples; and small, Gaussian jumps
along each parameter direction. Each chain carries its
own Fisher information matrix, which is updated peri-

Since this assumption is violated by the presence of the
blip glitch, the resulting posteriors are expected to be
biased compared to the true parameters and the orange
contours in Figs. 3 and 4 quantify this bias. We ﬁnd that
the extrinsic parameters that are primarily determined
by the signal amplitude are more biased than the intrin-
sic ones that are measured through the GW phase, as
also discussed in [37].",9,CMR10,,967,57
"The separation of the CBC signal from the glitch
demonstrated in Fig. 2 can be used to produce ready-to-
use deglitched data for downstream inference analyses, as
was done in [3]. An estimate of the glitch reconstruction
(the median or a fair draw from the glitch model poste-
rior) is subtracted from the data to produce strain data
that contain only the CBC signal and Gaussian noise.
The result of the glitch subtraction is shown in the spec-
trograms of Fig. 5 that show the LIGO Hanford data

"expected from the glitch spectrogram, the glitch is char-
acterized by a series of short high frequency bursts, each

recovered parameters are consistent with their injected

not incur biases on the inferred source properties if the
two are modeled simultaneously. As before, we also plot
results from a CBC+noise run that neglects the glitch
in the data in orange and again ﬁnd small biases by the
presence of the glitch in the source intrinsic parameters.
The glitch subtraction process is detailed in Fig. 11

taining both the glitch and the signal (left), data after a
fair draw glitch model has been subtracted (middle), and
data after both the glitch and the fair draw CBC model

right panel shows data where a model for both the glitch

jority of the glitch power is absent (compare the left and
right panels), some small non Gaussian power might be
left behind. The reason for this is that the blue mountain
glitch is manifested as individual short bursts of glitch
power, which our ﬂexible analysis attempts to model",9,CMR10,,1242,59
"completely independently. Indeed, the glitch model for
this run uses
(70) wavelets. Each of these wavelets,
needs to model suﬃcient non-Gaussian power in the data
in order to overcome the parsimony penalty incurred by
adding more parameters to the model. As such, we ex-
pect that some of the weaker “bursts” of the glitch will

before we plot the CBC and glitch reconstructions of the

Fig. 14 is consistent with previous results [43]. The glitch

ples had exactly zero glitch wavelets in LIGO Hanford

"We construct and validate an analysis of GW data
that simultaneously models astrophysical CBC signals
and instrumental glitches. We test the analysis against
real instances of glitches in the two LIGO detectors from
O2 data and simulated CBC signals injected at diﬀerent
times with respect to the glitch. We ﬁnd that our analy-
sis can separate the two, and provide both estimates for",9,CMR10,,384,57
"the CBC source parameters and glitch-subtracted data
for subsequent analyses. The glitch model we employ is
a sum of sine-Gaussian wavelets that is not tuned to any
speciﬁc glitch type and morphology; it can thus handle
even novel glitch types that might ﬁrst appear during
O4. Even though this ﬂexibility is desirable given the
unpredictable and evolving nature of glitches, the eﬃ-
cacy of glitch subtraction can be improved by employing
targeted priors for diﬀerent glitch types. One such exam-
ple would be a prior that anticipates arches at frequency
multiples in the case of scattered light glitches. We leave",9,CMR10,,615,59
