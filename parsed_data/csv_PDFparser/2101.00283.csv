ABSTRACT,11,CMR12,,8,8
"Using a combination of ground-based and HST imaging, we have constructed a
catalog of 179 supernova remnants (SNRs) and SNR candidates in the nearby spiral
galaxy M51. Follow-up spectroscopy of 66 of the candidates conﬁrms 61 of these as
SNRs, and suggests that the vast majority of the unobserved objects are SNRs as
well. A total of 55 of the candidates are coincident with (mostly soft) X-ray sources
identiﬁed in deep Chandra observations of M51; searching the positions of other soft
X-ray sources resulted in several additional possible optical candidates. There are
16 objects in the catalog coincident with known radio sources. None of the sources
with spectra shows the high velocities (",11,CMR12,,696,85

INTRODUCTION,11,CMR12,,12,12
"Following the violent death of a star as a supernova, material rich in heavy elements
is ejected and drives shock waves into the surrounding circumstellar and/or interstellar
material to form a supernova remnant (SNR). Supernovae (SNe) are a key part of
the cycle that gradually enriches the cosmos; they can trigger new episodes of star
formation, and collectively they may inﬂuence the evolution of the galaxies in which
they take place. For understanding these processes, it is most eﬃcacious to study
SNR samples in nearby galaxies, especially spirals that are oriented nearly face-on.
Here we typically ﬁnd large numbers of SNRs, all at eﬀectively the same distance,
and in most cases with minimal foreground absorption. All this contrasts with our
own Galaxy, where most of the hundreds of identiﬁed SNRs are at poorly determined
distances and suﬀer from signiﬁcant extinction—in many cases so much so that they
have not even been detected optically.",11,CMR12,,956,88
"Relatively nearby, face-on, and with well-deﬁned spiral arms with active star for-
mation, M51 presents an ideal venue for this study of SNRs. M51 (NGC 5194/5)
has the distinction of being the ﬁrst galaxy classiﬁed as a spiral (Rosse 1850) and is
one of the most well known interacting systems, comprising the grand-design spiral
M51A = NGC 5194 and smaller companion M51B = NGC 5195. M51A is classiﬁed
as a late-type grand-design Sbc, while its early-type northern companion M51b is
classiﬁed as a barred S0. At a distance of 8.58",11,CMR12,,531,86

ACS and WFC3, we used the AstroDrizzle package (Fruchter 2010; Gonzaga & et al.
2012) to produce aligned mosaics on a common grid that allow direct comparison.
The procedure closely followed that described in Blair et al. (2014, see Sec. 2 and
the Appendix of that paper) for M83 and will not be repeated here. Astrometric
alignments relied on centroids of isolated stars in the overlap regions between ﬁelds
of the mosaic to align all of the frames to a single grid, and then used stars from

individual 2-D spectra from each slitlet. We examined each of these individually to
determine the optimum background sky subtraction region. Many of the objects are
located in regions with bright surrounding galactic background (both continuum and
emission lines) from M51, so the ability to subtract a representative local background
in the vicinity of each object is important for obtaining accurate spectra. In most cases
this limited the precision of our eventual line ﬂux measurements. Finally, we summed

"The main diﬃculty with such elevated ratios is that these singly-ionized species are
normally formed in about the same temperature zone behind the shock; hence, driving
the ratios to widely variable values is diﬃcult. It could be that thermal instabilities
in combination with magnetic ﬁeld or other shock parameters are at play, favoring
regions where hydrogen is ionized even as N and S are able to recombine, and thus
driving up the observed ratios. However, for these distant SNRs, we are obtaining
what are eﬀectively global spectra of their radiative ﬁlaments, not localized ﬁlaments
that might be expected to show such eﬀects more clearly if they were present. It also
would not explain why there is such dramatic variation between diﬀerent objects.
Hence, at present we are left with a conundrum.",11,CMR12,,804,87

"6731 line ratio is a well-known density diagnostic (e.g., Osterbrock
& Ferland 2006). In SNR spectra, this density refers to the density in the post-shock
recombination zone, but it is related to pre-shock density (depending on the details of
the model assumptions one uses), which in turn is an indication of the ISM conditions
surrounding each SNR. In Fig. 10, left, we show this ratio, and there is a trend toward
lower values of the ratio (higher densities) for smaller diameter (generally younger)
objects, but there is signiﬁcant variation from object to object. This is a pattern
we have seen in other galaxies as well, and is consistent with an interpretation that
varying conditions in the ISM is a signiﬁcant driver of the evolution of the SNR

−,7,CMSY8,,1,1
1,7,CMR8,,1,1
") radiative shocks propelled by the primary shock into dense
cloudlets in the ISM. Because the surface area of the primary shock increases with
time, we generally expect the optical luminosity to increase with time as well, until
the primary shock velocity drops to the point where it can no longer drive secondary
shocks into these cloudlets. We then expect the SNR (now in the so-called radiative
phase) to fade.",11,CMR12,,414,85
"The maximum luminosity a SNR reaches—and importantly the radius at which it
reaches maximum—depends on a variety of factors, including the average density
of the ISM, the number of cloudlets, and the energy of the SNR explosion. SNRs
expanding into dense media brighten, and eventually fade, at smaller radii than those
expanding into less dense material. At some level, the samples of SNRs that we have",11,CMR12,,403,85
"observed in all of these galaxies is luminosity-limited at small diameters, and surface-",11,CMR12,,88,88
"brightness-limited at large diameters. At the small-diameter end of the distribution,
we are unable to measure diameters of unresolved objects, which eﬀectively sets a
lower limit at the point-spread function (PSF) of the detector used. Furthermore,
SNRs with sizes on the order of the PSF are hard to pick out against stars (because
it is diﬃcult to remove stars completely from narrow-band images). These two eﬀects
limit the low end of the distribution, and probably explain why the limits for M51
and NGC 6946 are about twice that for the similar galaxy M83—since the former two
galaxies are at almost twice M83’s distance.",11,CMR12,,627,85
"The number of SNRs in a galaxy should be proportional to the star formation rate
(SFR), since about 75% of the SNe observed in external galaxies arise from the core-
collapse explosion of massive stars whose main sequence lifetimes are short (Li et al.
2011a), and since the ages of stellar populations that produce Type I SNe are also
typically less than a Gyr (Maoz et al. 2010). The SFRs of the galaxies shown in
Fig. 17 vary. According to Jarrett et al. (2013), the SFRs for M83, NGC6946, and

spiral arms of M51. Nearly a third (55 of 179) of the SNRs/candidates are coincident
with X-ray sources identiﬁed with Chandra (Kuntz et al. 2016), and most of these X-
ray sources have the soft spectra normally seen in SNRs. A search at the positions of
other soft X-ray sources turned up another handful of possibly interesting candidates.
