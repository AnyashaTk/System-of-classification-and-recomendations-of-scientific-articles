"classiﬁes SDSS galaxies in two broad Hubble types, spirals and ellipticals.",8,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,75,75
Results.,8,NimbusSanL-Regu-Slant_167,,8,8
"We ﬁnd that the fraction of type-1 Seyfert nuclei (Sy1) hosted in elliptical galaxies is signiﬁcantly larger than the corre-
sponding fraction of any other AGN type, while there is a gradient of increasing Spiral-hosts from Sy1 to Liner, type-2 Seyferts (Sy2)
and Composite nuclei. These ﬁndings cannot be interpreted within the standard Uniﬁcation Paradigm, but possibly by a co-evolution
scheme for supermassive black holes (SMBH) and galactic bulges.
Furthermore, for the case of spiral host galaxies we ﬁnd the Sy1 population to be strongly skewed towards face-on conﬁgurations,
while the corresponding Sy2 population range in all host-galaxy orientation conﬁgurations, having a similar, but not identical, orien-
tation distribution with star-forming galaxies (SF). These results also cannot be interpreted by the standard Uniﬁcation Paradigm, but
point towards a signiﬁcant contribution of the galactic disk to the obscuration of the nuclear region. This is also consistent with the
observed preference of Sy1 nuclei to be hosted by ellipticals, ie., the dusty disk of spiral hosts contributes to the obscuration of the
broad line region (BLR) and thus relatively more ellipticals are expected to appear hosting Sy1 nuclei.",8,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,1229,136
