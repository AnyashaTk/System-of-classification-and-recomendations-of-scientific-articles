"ABSTRACT
Observations suggest that protoplanetary disks have moderate accretion rates onto the central young
star, especially at early stages (e.g. HL Tau), indicating moderate disk turbulence. However, recent
ALMA observations suggest that dust is highly settled, implying weak turbulence. Motivated by such
tension, we carry out 3D stratiﬁed local simulations of self-gravitating disks, focusing on settling of dust
particles in actively accreting disks. We ﬁnd that gravitationally unstable disks can have moderately",9,CMR10,,519,108
"high accretion rates while maintaining a relatively thin dust disk for two reasons. First, accretion stress
from the self-gravitating spirals (self-gravity stress) can be stronger than the stress from turbulence
(Reynolds stress) by a factor of 5-20. Second, the strong gravity from the gas to the dust decreases
the dust scale height by another factor of",9,CMR10,,355,107

producing a larger Reynolds stress than the vertical dust diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Thus, gravitoturbulent
disks have unusually high vertical Schmidt numbers (",9,CMR10,,209,100

particles become more relevant for the concentration of intermediate dust sizes, forming dense clouds
of dust. After comparing with HL Tau observations, our results suggest that self-gravity and gravity
among diﬀerent disk components could be crucial for solving the conﬂict between the protoplanetary
disk accretion and dust settling, at least at the early stages.",9,CMR10,,398,101

and dust diﬀusion in Section 2. Section 3 describes our
numerical setup. In section 4, we measure the particle
scale heights and gas turbulent properties to determine
the level of vertical dust settling and vertical diﬀusion.

Additional Considerations,9,CMTI10,,25,25
"We want to note that another explanation for well-
settled dust disks comes from the launching of winds
from the disk surface. A disk wind could remove angu-
lar momentum and provide moderate accretion without
adding any turbulence to the midplane, allowing dust
to settle (Bai & Stone 2013). In tandem with a layered
accretion, where disk surfaces are MRI active and the
midplane is a dead zone due to non-ideal MHD eﬀects
(Gammie 1996), disk winds could work together to ex-
plain the high accretion and settling (Hasegawa et al.
2017). On the other hand, even if this is the case and
the disk is gravitationally stable, the studied gravita-
tionally eﬀect to reduce dust scale height (e.g. Eq. 15)
should still operate in such massive disks.",9,CMR10,,744,56
"While the box size does not appear to be a decisive
factor in the results of our simulations, medium boxes
are slightly more consistent with analytic predictions of
overall turbulent stress",9,CMR10,,189,57
α,9,CMMI10,,1,1
". This is likely due to the better
resolution, although the resolution of both domain sizes
is within the converged ranges of similar studies. How-
ever, the gas density proﬁle is slightly broader in these
larger domains, and the lack of resolution in the vertical
direction may have a two-fold eﬀect. Slightly stronger
Reynolds stresses would broaden the gas density proﬁle
and as a result weaken the vertical self-gravity. This",9,CMR10,,429,58

"Using 3D vertically stratiﬁed local hydrodynamic sim-
ulations, we investigate the vertical settling of diﬀerent
sized dusts in gravitationally unstable disks. We sys-
tematically explore how diﬀerent cooling times, diﬀer-
ent box sizes, and treatments of gas/dust gravity aﬀect
the particle settling. We summarize our results in the
following points:",9,CMR10,,351,58

"Turbulent strength in our simulations is consis-
tent with the analytical expectation. The gravita-
tional stress is comparable to the Reynolds stress
near the midplane, but as the latter falls oﬀ with

ative velocities and could continue to collapse to
form planetesimals at a very early stage in the disk
lifetime.",9,CMR10,,165,52
"Ultimately, self-gravity of the dense gas midplane has
a signiﬁcant aﬀect on the vertical settling of dust in grav-
itoturbulent disks. Despite the strong turbulence and
high radial diﬀusion typical of gravitoturbulent disks,
the gravitational acceleration of the dense gas midplane
causes signiﬁcant settling of intermediate dust sizes.
This could help to explain recent ALMA observations
and also promote planetesimal formation.",9,CMR10,,430,60
