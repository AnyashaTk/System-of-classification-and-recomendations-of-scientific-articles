ABSTRACT,9,CMR10,,8,8
"We study star formation in the Center Ridge 1 (CR1) clump in the Vela C giant molecular cloud,
selected as a high column density region that shows the lowest level of dust continuum polarization
angle dispersion, likely indicating that the magnetic ﬁeld is relatively strong. We observe the source
with the ALMA 7m-array at 1.05 mm and 1.3 mm wavelengths, which enable measurements of dust
temperature, core mass and astrochemical deuteration. A relatively modest number of eleven dense
cores are identiﬁed via their dust continuum emission, with masses spanning from 0.17 to 6.7",9,CMR10,,579,102

Overall CR1 has a relatively low compact dense gas fraction compared with other typical clouds with
similar column densities, which may be a result of the strong magnetic ﬁeld and/or the very early
evolutionary stage of this region. The deuteration ratios,",9,CMR10,,258,99

"(3-2) lines, span from 0.011 to 0.85, with the latter being one of the highest values yet
detected. The level of deuteration appears to decrease with evolution from prestellar to protostellar
phase. A linear ﬁlament, running approximately parallel with the large scale magnetic ﬁeld orientation,
is seen connecting the two most massive cores, each having CO bipolar outﬂows aligned orthogonally
to the ﬁlament. The ﬁlament contains the most deuterated core, likely to be prestellar and located
midway between the protostars. The observations permit measurement of the full deuteration structure
of the ﬁlament along its length, which we present. We also discuss the kinematics and dynamics of
this structure, as well as of the dense core population.",9,CMR10,,749,103

INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"Star formation is a complicated process with many
open questions, including what sets its rate, overall eﬃ-
ciency, and resulting mass distribution of stars, i.e., the
stellar initial mass function (IMF). To help answer these
questions, detailed studies of star-forming regions that
can resolve individual self-gravitating cores are needed
and these regions should span as wide a range of en-
vironmental conditions as possible in order to explore
potential eﬀects of these conditions. With this goal in",9,CMR10,,503,59

cates that it has relatively strong magnetic ﬁelds.",9,CMR10,,214,55
"The Vela molecular cloud complex is one of the near-
est giant molecular cloud complexes in the Galactic disk
(Murphy & May 1991). It is composed of four molecu-
lar clouds, of which Vela C is the most massive and the
host of the youngest stellar population (Yamaguchi et al.",9,CMR10,,275,57

"ﬁve distinct sub regions (North, Centre-Ridge, Centre-
Nest, South-Ridge, and South-Nest), each with distinct
morphological characteristics (Hill et al. 2011). In the
Centre-Ridge sub region there is a compact HII region,
RCW36, which is adjacent to a very prominent dust
ridge that hosts the majority of dense cores in the cloud
(Hill et al. 2011). Owing to its proximity, i.e., at a dis-
tance of 933",9,CMR10,,402,59

"94 pc (Fissel et al. 2019), Vela C has been
an important target for magnetic ﬁeld mapping stud-
ies through sub-mm polarimetry and near-infrared stel-
lar polarimetry (Fissel et al. 2016; Kusune et al. 2016;
Santos et al. 2017).
In particular, the relative orien-
tation between gas column density ﬁlamentary struc-
tures and the magnetic ﬁeld changes progressively with
increasing gas column density, from mostly parallel or
having no preferred orientation at low column densities
to mostly perpendicular at the highest column densities",9,CMR10,,537,56
"(Soler et al. 2017; Fissel et al. 2019). This suggests that
the magnetic ﬁeld is strong enough to have inﬂuenced
the formation of the dense gas structures within Vela C.
The ongoing star formation in Vela C has been inves-
tigated in several studies via far-infrared (FIR) to mm
continuum imaging (e.g., Netterﬁeld et al. 2009; Gian-
nini et al. 2012; Massi et al. 2019). Giannini et al. (2012)

potentially introduce some bias, since cores can vary in
the number and type of chemical species that have de-

parison, the virial parameters of the cores appear to be

that most cores have a virial parameter that is consistent
with a value expected in virial equilibrium. Note that
the derivation of virial ratios relies on the assumption
of temperature, which strongly aﬀects the mass estima-
tion. Here an uniform temperature of 15 K has been
assumed.

median virial parameter rises to 2.58.",9,CMR10,,548,58

"The Vela C cloud is one of the few regions with mag-
netic ﬁeld mapped through both sub-mm emission po-
larimetry and near-infrared stellar absorption polarime-
try, and hence an ideal laboratory to study how the
magnetic ﬁeld strength aﬀects star formation process.
To investigate how star formation proceeds in a strong
magnetic ﬁeld environment, we have observed the Cen-
ter Ridge 1 (CR1) clump in the Vela C with ALMA
in Band 6 and Band 7. This clump is a high column
density region that shows the lowest level of dust con-
tinuum polarization angle dispersion in the BLASTPol
survey (Fissel et al. 2016), indicating the presence of
a strong magnetic ﬁeld. We identiﬁed 11 dense cores",9,CMR10,,689,56

". Interestingly, CR1 exhibits
a relatively low compact dense gas fraction compared
with other typical clouds with similar column densities,
which may be a result of the strong magnetic ﬁeld in
this region and/or that it is in a very early evolutionary

CR1c1, CR1c2, CR1c4, CR1c6 and CR1c9, are clearly seen in all infrared wavelengths and are thus expected to be of
the latest protostellar evolutionary stages among the sample.",9,CMR10,,296,118
"For infrared bands that show a counterpart, we also attempt aperture photometry, with the aperture radius ﬁxed to
be the equivalent radius of the size measured from 1.3 mm continuum. If the aperture radius is greater than half of the
beam FWHM at the corresponding infrared band, then a ﬂux measurement and associated uncertainty are reported.",9,CMR10,,343,119
With this criterion only for CR1c1 are we able to measure the ﬂuxes in all wavelengths. The aperture photometry,9,CMR10,,111,111
"is done following the method of Liu et al. (2020), i.e., we carry out a background subtraction using the median ﬂux
density in an annular region extending from one to two aperture radii, to remove general background and foreground
contamination. The error bars are set to be the larger of either 10% of the background-subtracted ﬂux density or the
value of the estimated background ﬂux density.",9,CMR10,,394,116
