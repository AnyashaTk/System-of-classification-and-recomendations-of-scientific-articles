ABSTRACT,9,CMR10,,8,8
"The MGRO J2019+37 region is one of the brightest sources in the sky at TeV energies. It was de-
tected in the 2 year HAWC catalog as 2HWC J2019+367 and here we present a detailed study of this re-
gion using data from HAWC. This analysis resolves the region into two sources: HAWC J2019+368 and
HAWC J2016+371. We associate HAWC J2016+371 with the evolved supernova remnant CTB 87, al-
though its low signiﬁcance in this analysis prevents a detailed study at this time. An investigation of the
morphology (including possible energy dependent morphology) and spectrum for HAWC J2019+368
is the focus of this work. We associate HAWC J2019+368 with PSR J2021+3651 and its X-ray pulsar
wind nebula, the Dragonﬂy nebula. Modeling the spectrum measured by HAWC and",9,CMR10,,758,107

INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"The brightest source in the Cygnus region observed by
the Milagro observatory was MGRO J2019+37 (Abdo
et al. 2007a). Milagro measured its ﬂux to be about 80%
of the Crab Nebula ﬂux at 20 TeV and showed an extent
of",9,CMR10,,214,55

"(Abdo et al. 2012). The MGRO J2019+37
region was later observed by MAGIC and VERITAS
for short durations, collecting 15 and 10 hours of data,
respectively, which led to upper limits consistent with
Milagro (Bartko et al. 2008; Kieda 2008). Soon after,
the Tibet Air Shower array conﬁrmed the Very-High-
Energy (VHE) extended source detection (Amenomori
et al. 2008). However, ARGO-YBJ later reported a non-
detection of MGRO J2019+37 and reported upper limits
for that location. This was attributed to either insuﬃ-
cient exposure to the source or variability of the emission
over time (Bartoli et al. 2012).",9,CMR10,,608,59
"Deep observations of the MGRO J2019+37 region by
VERITAS resolved it into two sources: VER J2019+368",9,CMR10,,100,51
"and VER J2016+371 (Aliu et al. 2014). VER J2019+368
is a brighter extended source, which accounts for
the bulk of the emission from MGRO J2019+37,
though the origin of the emission remained unknown.
VER J2016+371 is the other source, which is a point-
like source to VERITAS. It was suggested that the most
likely counterpart of VER J2016+371 is a Pulsar Wind
Nebula (PWN) in the SuperNova Remnant (SNR) CTB

diﬀerent from HAWC, where the morphology and spec-

a predictable systematic oﬀset in the reported ﬂux be-

the measured morphology by VERITAS is larger than
the extraction region, and the morphologies measured

Hence, the advection velocity or diﬀusion coeﬃcient is
constrained by the morphology of the TeV emission re-

CONCLUSIONS,9,CMR10,,11,11
"In this work, we have performed the ﬁrst detailed
spectral and morphological study using HAWC data
of
re-
the region surrounding MGRO J2019+37,
solving it into the sources HAWC J2019+368 and
HAWC J2016+371. The morphology and spectrum
in this work agrees well with the VERITAS measure-
ments from Aliu et al. (2014) and Abeysekara et al.
(2018), consisting of an elliptical Gaussian source (for",9,CMR10,,394,56
"HAWC J2019+368 and VER J2019+368) and point
source (for HAWC J2016+371 and VER J2016+371).
The agreement between HAWC and VERITAS for the
spectrum and morphology in this region is an impor-
tant milestone in comparisons between IACTs and
ground array detectors like HAWC. Previously, diﬀer-
ences between measured spectra and morphology were
attributed to not well understood systematic diﬀerences
(Abeysekara et al. 2017a). These diﬀerences may now
be explainable and quantiﬁable (in some cases) as the
diﬀerence between the extraction region used to produce
the spectrum, and the morphology measured.",9,CMR10,,602,55
"The detection of HAWC J2016+371 conﬁrms the
source VER J2016+371. Given its very recent con-
ﬁrmation as a PWN via X-ray measurements, as the
HAWC exposure to this source grows, it may be useful
to examine the emission from this source in detail to
see if its TeV emission is similar to other PWNe, or if
the supernova remnant hosting the nebula may be ac-
celerating protons to TeV energies (Guest et al. 2020).",9,CMR10,,412,55

"We ﬁnd that the emission from HAWC J2019+368
together with the X-ray data is well described via emis-
sion from a young PWN system powered by a",9,CMR10,,143,56

"old pulsar. This allows us to estimate the PWN proper-
ties of the system such as the magnetic ﬁeld, the pulsar
spin-down energy to electron conversion eﬃciency, and
the maximum electron energy. Follow-up studies at X-
ray energies may ﬁnd a spatially extended emission re-
gion that might agree with the morphology measured by
HAWC and VERITAS, a ﬁnding which would support
the two zone model of electrons described in this work.
The energy-dependent morphology study does not
show conclusive evidence in favor of shrinking size with
increasing energy due to large uncertainties in the mea-
surements. Nevertheless, it enables us to constrain the
particle transport in a PWN system. This may be im-
proved upon with more data in the future. The recent
upgrade of HAWC with an outrigger array will play a
crucial role by increasing HAWC’s sensitivity to showers
at the highest energies as it increases the instrumented",9,CMR10,,918,56
