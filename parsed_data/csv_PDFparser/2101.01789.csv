"Both the spatial distribution and the spectral shape of the SO emission band vary considerably 
across Io and over time. In some cases the SO emissions either in the core or the wings of the emission 
band can be identified with volcanoes, but the largest areas of SO emissions usually do not coincide with 
known volcanoes. We suggest that the emissions are caused by a large number of stealth plumes, produced 
through the interaction of silicate melts with superheated SO",11,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,474,106

when the satellite was observed while in eclipse

the  NIRSPEC

al.,  2002).  The  emission  was  attributed  to  SO

"state at a rotational 
temperature of 1000 K, ejected from the vent at a 
thermodynamic quenching temperature of ~1500 
K. At the time Loki Patera was suggested as its 
source,  a  volcano  that  was  exceptionally  active 
during that period. In subsequent years the disk-
integrated  SO  emission  was  observed  to  vary 
in  a  manner  not 
time, 
substantially  over 
inconsistent with Loki Patera’s activity (Laver et 
al., 2007). With a total of eight datasets, de Kleer 
et  al.  (2019a)  showed  that  the  SO  total  band 
strength  across  all  eight  dates  is  not  correlated 
with incident sunlight, Io’s orbital phase, the time 
since Io was last in sunlight, Jupiter’s System III 
longitude, or thermal hot spot activity.",11,Times-Roman,,738,57
"In November 2002 Io was observed with Keck’s 
NIRSPEC spectrometer coupled to the Adaptive 
Optics (AO) system (de Pater et al., 2007). The 
authors observed Io moving through the slit to get 
a  map  of  the  SO  distribution.  They  identified  a 
latitudinal variation in SO: most emission came 
from the equator and the south, and practically no 
emission  was  detected  in  the  north,  despite  the 
presence of several thermally-bright volcanic hot 
spots in the north.",11,Times-Roman,,477,56
Hence the presence of this emission band remains,11,Times-Roman,,48,48
"rather  mysterious.  Rotational  temperatures  vary 
from ~400 K up to ~1000 K, but in all datasets to 
date the wings and shoulders of the emission band 
could  not  be  matched  by  equilibrium  models  at 
any temperature.",11,Times-Roman,,225,53

emission, we observed Io in eclipse with the near-
infrared  integral  field  spectrograph  OSIRIS,",11,Times-Roman,,151,51

"After the individual frames of each data-cube (32

pixels  removed  by  replacing  them  with  the 
median  of  the  8  surrounding  pixels,  the  image 
data-cubes needed to be aligned since each data-
cube  was  located  at  a  slightly  different  position

brightest  thermal  source,  Loki  Patera,  visible  in

The data-cubes were then averaged on each day 
to provide a final spectral image data-cube of Io-

the background by fitting polynomials (2-degree) 
to  each  row  on  each  image  plane  (e.g.,  each 
wavelength)  of  the  data-cube,  after  “blocking 
to  fit

polynomials

"remove the continuum emission in the HN4 filter. 
We used a 1-pixel spectrum of Loki Patera at its 
peak intensity (Fig. 5; note that the SO emission 
band  is  essentially  absent  in  a  1-pixel  spectrum 
since  it  is  hidden  in  the  noise  of  Loki  Patera’s 
thermal  flux  density)  to  determine  a  blackbody 
curve that matches this spectrum; these curves are 
superposed  on  the  spectra  in  Figure  5  for  both 
2010  and  2015.  A  good  match  to  the  data  is 
provided by a blackbody curve of 675 K in both 
years,  just  like  for  the  disk-integrated  spectra 
(Fig. 3). This is not surprising, since Io’s thermal 
flux  density  is  dominated  by  Loki  Patera.  The 
same blackbody spectrum also matches the slope 
of  a  1-pixel  spectrum  of  Janus  Patera  in 
December 2015, as shown in Figure 5. After Loki 
Patera,  the  brightest  source  in  July  2010  was 
Kanehekili  Fluctus.  Although  a  lower  (~550  K) 
temperature  provides  a  better  fit  to  this  much 
fainter  volcano,  scaling  the  background  with  a 
slope  in wavelength  given by the 675 K  profile 
will  eliminate  most  of  Kanehekili’s  thermal 
emission.  We  note 
the  brightness 
temperature 
for  Janus  Patera  and 
Kanehekili  Fluctus  agree  well  with  previous 
measurements  (de  Pater  et  al.,  2014b).  Other 
volcanoes are too faint to determine a blackbody 
temperature.   

We thus scaled the background image data-cube 
for each year with the slope of these Loki  Patera 
spectra,  and  subtracted  the  scaled  background 
image  data-cube  from  the  spectral  data-cubes. 
Figure  6  shows  the  results  after  combining 
(integrating)  the  image  data  planes  within  the 
narrow core of the SO emission band (panels b,

background emission; as shown, the latter images 
look very similar to those in Figure 4. Clearly, the 
SO emission is only a very small fraction of the 
total emission, and shows no obvious correlation 
with the bright hot spots. We further notice that,",11,Times-Roman,,281,53

".  Note  that  both  the 
background  flux  (top  row)  and  line  strength 
(middle row) was a factor of 2-3 higher in 2015 
than  in  2010,  after  the  data  were  scaled  to  an 
Earth-Io  distance  of  4.08  AU.  Hence  these 
differences are intrinsic to Io, or in other words 
the SO emission was much stronger in 2015 than 
in 2010. 

Figure 4 shows images of Io-in-eclipse, averaged 
over  the  entire  HN4  filter;  clearly,  the  total 
emission is dominated by thermal emission from

using  a  combination  of    arc-lamps  (Ar,  Kr,  Xe,

further processed using custom IDL scripts.  

Figure 7a shows the central part of one of the A-
B images obtained from the REDSPEC pipeline, 
with  a  positive  and  a  negative  spectrum  of  Io. 
After  separating  the  two  spectra  in  each  image, 
and  inverting  the  negative  spectra,  they  were 
aligned,  median  averaged,  and  corrected  for 
telluric  lines  by  dividing  the  spectrum  by  a 
normalized spectrum of HIP 85755 (also known 
as c Oph), a 4.8 mag Be star. The final image over 
the same frequency range as in panel a for echelle 
setting 1, order 45, is shown in Figure 7b.

provided  four  partially  overlapping  spectra, 
which  were  aligned  in  intensity  with  order  45, 
echelle  setting  1.  The  geocentric  velocity  of  Io 
was ~ -19 km/s during the eclipse (i.e., moving 
towards  the  Earth),  implying  a  Doppler  shift 
correction  of  0.11  nm.  However,  since  the 
observed  spectra  were  already  perfectly  aligned

cover the large patches of SO emissions we see in
