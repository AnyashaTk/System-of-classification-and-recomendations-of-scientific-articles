1 INTRODUCTION,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,14,14
"Opacities are key ingredients in any domain where radiative trans-
fer is important. More speciÔ¨Åcally, Rosseland mean opacities play
an essential role in stellar modelling. They characterize the inter-
action between the photons produced in the centre of stars and
the surrounding plasma up to the surface of the stars. Two of
the main historical providers of such quantities for stellar model-
ing are Forrest Rogers and Carlos Iglesias at the Lawrence Liv-
ermore National Laboratory (LLNL) (project referred to as OPAL
Rogers and Iglesias (1992)) and the Opacity Project (OP, (Seaton
1987)). Despite the fact that these two independent projects are
based on largely diÔ¨Äerent physical frameworks, the agreement be-
tween the OPAL (Rogers and Iglesias 1992) and the upgraded OP
opacities ((Badnell et al. 2005), hereafter OP2005) remains satis-
factory for solar interior conditions and they both originally ac-
curately reproduced the helioseismic measurements. Those two
datasets are widely used and they are references in stellar as-
trophysics (OPAL: https://opalopacity.llnl.gov/, OP: http://opacity-",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1106,68
"cs.obspm.fr/opacity/index.html, Delahaye et al. (2016)) . The good
agreement between OPAL and OP is corroborated by more re-
cent eÔ¨Äorts such as OPAS from the CEA ((Blancard et al. 2012);
(Mondet et al. 2015)) and LEDCOP (now ATOMIC) from the Los",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,246,66

4 OPACITIES,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,11,11
"The calculation of opacities requires several steps. It is necessary i)
to determine the ionic state of the absorbing medium as well as the
population of the atomic levels of its constituents, ii) to calculate
the absorbing coeÔ¨Écients for diÔ¨Äerent processes (photo-excitation,
photoionization), and iii) to include plasma eÔ¨Äects (the ions cannot
be considered as isolated). Such calculations, despite the computer
power available today, still require approximations and compromises.
Accuracy versus completeness is still at play nowadays as it was 30
years ago: the atomic systems considered may be much larger, but
they cannot be inÔ¨Ånite. Several groups (LLNL-OPAL, CEA-OPAS,
LANL-ATOMIC, The Opacity Project) are involved in such calcula-
tions, using their own methods and recipes at each step. Nonetheless,
the various modern Rosseland mean opacities for a solar mixture at
the conditions found in the Sun agree to within 4%. However, when
we compare the monochromatic opacities for individual elements,
the diÔ¨Äerences are much larger. The mixture and the averaging over
the frequencies introduce some cancellation eÔ¨Äects. Detailed com-
parisons are thus required for a single element at diÔ¨Äerent conditions",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1211,71
"in order to disentangle the diÔ¨Äerent eÔ¨Äects from the diÔ¨Äerent ingre-
dients, and more importantly to characterize the signature of each
approximation on the Ô¨Ånal results. While comparisons with the few
available experiments appear necessary, a word of caution is rele-
vant here: in such comparisons, experimental uncertainties must be
clearly stated.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,351,68

opacity calculation and try to identify the uncertainties and their

"Historically, The Opacity Project has favored the",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,49,49
ùëÖ,8,NewTXMI,,1,1
"-matrix approach
for the calculation of the atomic data used in the opacity calculation
since OP focuses on the quality of the atomic data. Of course such
a choice implied some assumed approximations in the treatment of
plasma eÔ¨Äects. In contrast, all other groups favoured the description
of the plasma itself at the cost of approximations in the atomic data
calculations. In the opacity calculations it is always necessary to build
up a compromise between accuracy and completeness of the atomic
data sets and of the plasma eÔ¨Äects. In 2005, an Opacity Project team
have extended the validity of the OP opacities with the inclusion of
inner-shell transitions Badnell et al. (2005) using the DW approxi-
mation. Hence, we combined both methods in order to improve our
results for stellar applications. The less complex DW method allows
for larger conÔ¨Åguration sets. Another important diÔ¨Äerence between
the DW and the",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,916,73

"-matrix approaches is the treatment of photoion-
ization. There are two paths to photoionize an atom/ion. One is a
direct path with a photon with enough energy to detach directly an
electron and send it into the continuum. The second way consists in
photo-exciting the atom/ion into an autoionizing state which decays
after, sending an electron into the continuum. This corresponds to
the photo-excitation of an electron into a quasi-bound state followed
by a decay which makes another electron free via the Auger eÔ¨Äect.

the plot by Nahar and Pradhan (2016a) using the freeware g3data
(http://github.com/pn2200/g3data). We can see in Figure 13 the ef-
fect of the broadening used by Nahar and Pradhan (2016b) which
uses the data from their Figure 5. When shown on the same graph
we see it appears to show a somewhat unusual behaviour in the
monochromatic cross sections. Indeed, around 70 Ryd, while there is
a dip in their cross sections as in ours and no signiÔ¨Åcant resonances,
the broadened ones are enhanced by one order of magnitude. This
cannot come from the two strong lines seen after (at 75 Ryd) since
they are bound-bound transitions and hence already broadened in
our treatment. In the high-energy region, the broadened opacities",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,912,70
"give rise to a continuum below the non-broadened ones. These fea-
tures show that some artefacts are due to the algorithm used for their

increase does not solve the diÔ¨Äerences with the experimental data,
as already pointed out by Blancard et al. (2016). Moreover, while
Bailey et al. (2015) presented the diÔ¨Äerences in the Rosseland mean

"broadening and suggest that a distinction between the treatment re-
served for the resonance and the bound-bound transitions would be
welcome. For the Rosseland mean opacities the present results show
the signature of the limitation of the exercise since new calculations
for all other ions will aÔ¨Äect the results more drastically than for just a
single ion. However, it is interesting to see the strong signature of the
presence of the autoionizing starting levels, indeed, we reach a 15%
increase in the present DW results compared to the OP2005. But they
are still much lower compared to the two other theoretical results.
Of course we cannot anticipate the Ô¨Ånal results on Fe when all data
for the other ions will be included since many compensation and
cancellation eÔ¨Äects will occur. However, we expect some increase in
the total Fe Rosseland mean opacities and maybe a decrease in the
Planck opacities, pending veriÔ¨Åcation as intuition does not replace
computations in cases as complex as the ones studied here. Indeed a
new fully DW calculation will imply a complete broadening of the

larger value. It has to be mentioned that this discrepancy has been
reduced by half since the revision of the analysis of the experimental
data in Nagayama et al. (2019). Another aspect of the discrepancy
comes from the ‚Äôwindows‚Äô Ô¨Ålled in the experimental data but not in
theoretical calculations. It is important to note that the addition of
the 2- to 3-holes autoionizing levels in the DW Fe XVII models is
clearly producing a contribution within the energy range considered
in the experiment. In Figure 14 we have plotted the monochromatic
opacities for a pure Fe XVII plasma alongside the experimental data.
The opacities present a clear increase in the 80 Ryd. and 90 Ryd (2 of
the 3 so called ‚Äôwindows‚Äô) when the 2- to 3-holes autoionizing levels
are taken into account. Of course one has to be cautious. The eÔ¨Äect

factor in the accuracy of the results presented here. While SNAKP
have reported broadened",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,280,68
ùëÖ,8,NewTXMI,,1,1
"-matrix results, they give no details of
their methodology and we have seen (section 4.3.2) that it appears to
give rise to some unusual behaviour in the monochromatic opacities.
In contrast, the DW method allows us to treat each resonance as a
bound-bound line which can be broadened at will.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,293,69
"In the DW approach, we were able to extend the calculations
further, including the contribution from initial autoionizing levels
with two L-shell holes (which is not yet possible computationally
in the",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,201,68
ùëÖ,8,NewTXMI,,1,1
"-matrix approach). The two-to-three L-shell hole transitions
clearly make a signiÔ¨Åcant contribution to the Rosseland and Planck
mean opacities that cannot be neglected. The autoionizing levels as a
whole contribute for more than 50% to the Rosseland mean opacities
of Fe XVII with a 10% increase coming from the two-to-three L-shell
hole transitions.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,350,69

data, while missing resonance broadening and autoionizing initial
levels, produce Rosseland mean opacities 10% below the results
from OP2005. The comparison with the data from other groups
(OPAS-CEA, SCRAM-SANDIA) shows the importance of the new
treatment of the atomic data in the results from The Opacity Project.
When considering the Planck mean opacities the new results sit
just in between the other theoretical ones. This clearly indicates the
diÔ¨Äerent sensitivities to diÔ¨Äerent aspects of the calculations of the
two diÔ¨Äerent means. It is important to determine clear constraints for
each mean in order to deÔ¨Åne the proper global treatment to calculate
opacities. While the present Rosseland mean opacity results are still
very low in comparison to other theoretical results, the present data",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,815,70
"indicate that our new calculations and those underway for the other
relevant Fe ions may signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce the diÔ¨Äerence. (The focus
in this paper has been on the physics describing the atomic processes
rather than trying to converge the means.)",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,247,69
"As far as the comparison with the experiment is concerned, it
clearly shows that nothing in the continuum at high energy has been",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,129,67

the utmost importance. The presence of the autoionizing levels in the",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,136,69

it remains to be established.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,231,68
Both computational methods employed here (DW and,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,48,48

"-matrix and DW calculations for other Fe ions (Fe XVIII, Fe XIX,

of the global eÔ¨Äect on the Fe opacity under the conditions at the base
of the solar convection zone. The interplay between all the diÔ¨Äerent
eÔ¨Äects does not allow us a reliable intuitive prediction of the results
that will be obtained from these new larger calculations. For example,
one of the strong eÔ¨Äects turns out to be the change in the ionic fraction
introduced by the change of the structure in each particular ion.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,552,73

be followed by a large revision of the stellar Fe opacities, a global re-
vision would become necessary. Its consequences would aÔ¨Äect more

generation of stellar OP opacities and astrophysical opacities. The
