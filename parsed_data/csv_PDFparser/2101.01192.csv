ideal for probing the spatial distribution of the gas surround-

ELANs can be a very good probe of the dark matter po-
tential of the halos hosting the galaxies and the interface
regions between CGM and IGM. However, ELANs are rare,
and only 1% of quasars seem to posses them. Based on their
radial surface brightness proﬁles, it has been proposed that
ELANs trace regions of higher volume density and/or have
additional sources of ionizing radiation embedded in their
