projectors, designed to illuminate the full focal plane or speciﬁc regions of the focal plane with a series of light
illumination patterns: the crosstalk projector, the ﬂat illuminator projector, and the spot grid projector. In
addition to measurements of crosstalk, linearity and full well, the ability to project realistically-sized sources,

"The LSST Camera focal plane has a diameter of approximately 64 cm and is made up of a mosaic of 205
charge-coupled devices (CCDs) arranged into 21 science raft tower modules (RTMs) and 4 specialized Corner
Raft Tower Modules (CRTMs) for wavefront sensing and guiding. An individual RTM contains all the required
thermal, mechanical, and electronic connections needed to operate the CCDs and can itself be considered a
self-contained camera. In addition to the science RTMs, there are four specialized corner raft tower modules
(CRTMs) used for telescope guiding and to provide wavefront sensing capabilities for the telescope’s active optics
system. The custom-designed 16 megapixel LSST Camera CCDs, supplied by Imaging Technology Laboratories
(ITL) and Teledyne e2v, are fully depleted high-resistivity bulk silicon sensors that are segmented into 16
separate sections, each with their own output ampliﬁer electronics. In order for the Rubin Observatory project
to achieve its stated science goals to the desired precision and accuracy, each CCD must meet a set of stringent
electro-optical requirements (Table 1), determined by a number of past studies.",9,CMR10,,1156,114

acceptance testing was performed in three steps prior to the assembly of the RTMs: acceptance testing by the
CCD vendors, reprocessing of the vendor data at SLAC, and acceptance testing at the Brookhaven National

"Focal plane testing refers to the testing of the CCDs after integration of the RTMs into the LSST Camera
cryostat. This ongoing state of testing began with a period of operation of the focal plane subsystems with
only a subset of RTMs installed, referred to as the partial focal plane testing period. During the data taking
discussed here there were nine science-grade RTMs (4 consisting of ITL CCDs and 5 consisting of Teledyne e2v",9,CMR10,,432,110
"CCDs) and the four CRTMs installed. The partial focal plane testing period was important for veriﬁcation of the
operation of the RTMs within the focal plane, the refrigeration systems, the cryostat vacuum performance, the
data acquisition software, and networking capabilities. An additional goal of this period was to identify electro-
optical characteristics of the installed CCDs that would warrant further study for optimization or mitigation. The
installation of the RTMs and electro-optical testing during the partial focal plane testing period was performed
using a specialized test stand, referred to as the Bench for Optical Testing (BOT), in conjunction with a set of
custom-built optical projectors designed to illuminate the focal plane with various light illumination patterns;
this equipment will also be used for future testing of the full focal plane.",9,CMR10,,867,114

", shown
positioned on the ﬂoor of the BOT dark box in Figure 3. The ﬂat illuminator projector uses a near-IR enhanced
Zeiss 25mm f/2.8 wide-angle lens to re-image the 1.5” exit port of an integrating sphere in order to smoothly and
fairly uniformly illuminate the entire focal plane. This optical design results in images that are suﬃciently ﬂat
(less than 5% signal variation across each CCD segment) to be used for measurements of the CCD non-linearity,",9,CMR10,,455,113
"full well, and gain from photon transfer curves. The light source for the ﬂat illuminator projector is a Newport
Fiber Optic Illuminator, containing a 150 W Quartz-Tungsten-Halogen lamp, that is delivered to the integrating
sphere within the projector using a Newport single-branch glass ﬁber optic bundle connected to a Thorlabs 1”
single-blade optical beam shutter. Two Thorlabs motorized ﬁlter wheels, connected in series between the shutter
and the integrating sphere entrance port, are used to remotely control the light spectral bandpass and intensity.
A set of Sloan Digital Sky Survey color ﬁlters (u, g, r, i, z, and Y) manufactured by Astrodon and a set of 6
narrow-band ﬁlters (10 nm full width at half maximum) centered at 480 nm, 650 nm, 750 nm, 870 nm, 950 nm,
and 970 nm are installed in the ﬁrst ﬁlter wheel. The second ﬁlter wheel holds a set of 6 masks with apertures
of varying size that act as neutral density ﬁlters. A light baﬄe (not pictured in Figure 3) is attached in front of
the ﬂat illuminator projector lens to limit the angular extent of the projected beam to eliminate reﬂected light
from the inner side of the cryostat ﬂange, which extends beyond the surface of the focal plane.",9,CMR10,,1210,115
Electronic crosstalk measurements are made using a custom optical projector named the,9,CMR10,,85,85
crosstalk projector,9,CMTI10,,19,19
"(Figure 4), that is designed to illuminate a single CCD with a pattern of large bright spots (80 pixels in radius)
using collimated light. The decision to use an optical design that produced collimated light was made to reduce",9,CMR10,,226,114
"Figure 3. The ﬂat illuminator projector positioned inside of the BOT, underneath the LSST Camera cryostat.",8,CMR9,,106,106
"the impact of reﬂections of any projected bright spots that occur at the front and back side of the cryostat
window, the surface of the CCD, and the back surfaces of the projector optics. Because collimated light will
be perpendicular to these surfaces, the reﬂections of the bright spots will fall at the original location of the
bright spot, rather than at diﬀerent locations across the focal plane, which can interfere with the measurement
of crosstalk. The light from the 1” exit port of an integrating sphere is passed through a pinhole, then through
an aspheric lens, and ﬁnally through a metal mask to produce the desired pattern of bright spots. The mask
used in the crosstalk projector was manufactured using precision wire electrical discharge machining and is
painted matte black, to reduce its reﬂectivity. The light source is a QPhotonics 3 mW ﬁber-coupled 450 nm light
emitting diode, connected by a single-mode ﬁber to a Thorlabs 1” single bladed optical beam shutter installed
at the entrance port of the integrating sphere. When in use in the BOT, the crosstalk projector is mounted on a
ﬁxed stand on the XY-motorplatform, which is used to translate the projector in order to illuminate individual",9,CMR10,,1215,112
CCDs within the focal plane.,9,CMR10,,28,28
"The ability to project realistically-sized sources onto the focal plane prior to on-sky operation is provided by
a custom optical projector named the",9,CMR10,,149,112
spot grid projector,9,CMTI10,,19,19
". The spot grid projector uses a Nikon 105mm f/2.8 Al-s
Micro-Nikkor lens to re-image the 1” exit port of an integrating sphere that has been masked with the desired
optical pattern using an HTA Photomask photo-lithographic mask. A six-position Thorlabs motorized ﬁlter
wheel is used to remotely select from a set of masks with various patterns and position the desired mask in front
of the integrating sphere exit port. During the partial focal plane testing period the optical patterns included
in the spot grid projector ﬁlter wheel were: a single spot, a grid of 24x24 spots, a grid of 49x49 spots, a thin
slit to simulate satellite streaks, and two absorptive neutral density ﬁlter wheels, which can be used to mimic a
low-level sky background. The spot grid projector shares the same 450 nm light emitting diode light source as
the crosstalk projector and is also equipped with a Thorlabs 1” single-blade optical beam shutter. An additional",9,CMR10,,946,113
"feature of the spot projector is the ability to expose the focal plane to multiple illuminated mask patterns during
a single exposure; this is accomplished by closing the shutter and rotating the ﬁlter wheel from one mask to
another via remote command, before opening the shutter again, while continuing the CCD integration phase",9,CMR10,,329,115

manual adjustable z-stage. By adjusting the z-stage the spot grid projector can be positioned at the appropriate
optical working distance to achieve good focus of the projected spots.",9,CMR10,,289,112
"The optical projectors described above were designed to be modular to support rapid replacement and in-
stallation in the BOT during testing and are all controlled remotely using the same Camera Control System
(CCS) software used to monitor and operate the other focal plane subsystems. In addition to the ﬂat illuminator
projector, the crosstalk projector, and the spot grid projector there exists an additional set of optical projectors
that will not be discussed in depth but remain important for electro-optical testing. The Camera Calibration
Optical Bench (CCOB) Wide-Beam projector, designed and built by collaborators at the Laboratory of Sub-
atomic Physics & Cosmology (LPSC) in Grenoble, France, is used to construct “synthetic ﬂat ﬁeld images” from",9,CMR10,,760,116
"a number of co-added images that can be used to make quantum eﬃciency and pixel response non-uniformity
measurements.",9,CMR10,,117,103

the ﬁnal overscan pixels that was identiﬁed during earlier testing of individual LSST Camera CCDs. Electronic
bias correction, using a superbias image constructed from a median stack of bias images, is necessary to remove",9,CMR10,,334,112

clocking during readout. Dark current correction is done by subtracting an electronic oﬀset and electronic bias-
corrected superdark image, constructed from the median stack of multiple dark images, which is then scaled to
match the exposure time of the image to be calibrated. For the analyses presented here, 10 bias images and
10 dark images were used when constructing the superbias and superdark images for calibration. Gain values

". A single exposure
taken using the crosstalk projector, shown in Figure 6, results in an image with four bright spots illuminating
four separate CCD segments. The four spots are positioned such that the victim regions for each spot do not
coincide with other victim regions or aggressor spots allowing for the simultaneous measurement of the crosstalk
caused by four aggressor segments, corresponding to four rows in the crosstalk matrix. Using the BOT XY-
motorplatform, the crosstalk projector is dithered to allow for the measurement of the crosstalk coeﬃcients for
all 16 CCD segments, using a minimum of four images. In order to make measurements of crosstalk values with
magnitudes on the order of 10",9,CMR10,,707,112

"set by the diﬀraction that occurs at the photomask holes and increases as a function of the distance between
the projector and the CCD surface. Diﬀraction at the photomask holes also results in diﬀraction spikes that
contribute to background scattered light in the crosstalk images. During the partial focal plane testing period,
the mean signal within a 80 pixel radius of the center of each spot was approximately 100,000 electrons; there is
some evidence that the electronic crosstalk is dependent on the aggressor signal level, or non-linear behavior,",9,CMR10,,555,113

"The method presented in the previous section was used to measure centroid shifts and shape distortions caused by
sensor eﬀects on two CCDs installed in the LSST Camera focal plane: Teledyne e2v CCD R22/S11 and ITL CCD
R02/S02. The error terms for the spot centroid and second-moment measurements were ﬁrst estimated from the
standard deviation of the distributions of these measurements taken for 1000 images of the spot grid positioned
at the exact same XY-motorplatform position. The approximate value of these errors are also summarized in
Table 3. The centroid and second-moment error terms for spots near the center of the spot grid are lower than
for spots near the edge of the spot grid. There also is a slight asymmetry between measurements in the",9,CMR10,,755,112

many experiencing centroid shifts of several pixels, from the ideal grid position. Because of the precision of the

visually similar to the central patterns of the optical centroid shifts (Figure 12), although the mean centroid
residual of each spot, meant to remove the optical distortion component has been subtracted. This may indicate
that it is necessary to calculate the per spot mean centroid residual from images of the grid that have been
dithered over a larger portion of the CCD, in order to remove the eﬀect of larger scale structure in the optical
distortion mapping. One possibility of a physical cause could be small pixel-area variations caused by strain on",9,CMR10,,785,115

that have been performed using a series of custom-built optical projectors during the partial focal plane testing
period of the LSST Camera. The results of these studies will be important for informing improvements and
expansions to the planned testing and analyses to be performed during the upcoming full focal plane testing
period.",9,CMR10,,447,113

"level. The results presented in
this study have shown that there is no detectable crosstalk between CCD segments located on diﬀerent CCDs,
either on the same RTM (intra-raft) or on diﬀerent RTMs (inter-raft). The largest intra-CCD crosstalk is
between immediately adjacent CCD segments located on the same side of the mid-line break and the amplitude
of this crosstalk lies below the allowed maximum value of 0.002. Although there are several diﬀerences in the
intra-CCD crosstalk behavior between ITL and Teledyne e2v CCDs, there is consistent behavior of the crosstalk
within each type of CCD. During the upcoming full focal plane testing of the LSST Camera intra-CCD crosstalk
measurements will be made for each of the 189 science CCDs and each of the CCDs within the CRTMs. Future
crosstalk characterization will also include measurements of intra-CCD crosstalk made for a subset of CCDs at",9,CMR10,,894,109

"This will allow for a greater understanding of any non-linear crosstalk behavior, that will be important for the
development and testing of improved algorithms for crosstalk correction.",9,CMR10,,185,112
"The use of the custom-built spot grid projector has demonstrated the ability to study centroid shifts and
shape distortions of sources caused by sensor eﬀects prior to on-sky operation of the LSST Camera. This will
allow for identiﬁcation and characterization of sensor eﬀects that may impact the measurement of source shapes
and ﬂuxes needed for weak lensing science. The results of the preliminary measurements presented in this study
have shown the ability to measure the eﬀect of tree-ring patterns and the mid-line break on source centroids
and shapes. A number of features such as the dipole in Teledyne e2v CCD centroid shift measurements, the
discontinuities between segments in ITL CCD second-moment measurements, and the horizontal streaks close
to segment boundaries in Teledyne e2v CCD second-moment measurements have also been revealed that will
require follow-up study to determine if these are physical features of the sensors.",9,CMR10,,942,110
