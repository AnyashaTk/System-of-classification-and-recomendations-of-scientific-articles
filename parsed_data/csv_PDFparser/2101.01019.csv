"ABSTRACT
In the quest to solve the long-standing coronal heating problem, it has been sug-
gested half a century ago that coronal loops could be heated by waves. Despite the
accumulating observational evidence of the possible importance of coronal waves, still
no 3D MHD simulations exist that show signiﬁcant heating by MHD waves. Here we
report on the ﬁrst 3D coronal loop model heating the plasma against radiative cooling.
The coronal loop is driven at the footpoint by transverse oscillations and subsequently
the induced Kelvin-Helmholtz instability deforms the loop cross-section and generates
small-scale structures. Wave energy is transfered to smaller scales where it is dissipated,
overcoming the internal energy losses by radiation. These results open up a new avenue
to address the coronal heating problem.",11,CMR12,,819,91

INTRODUCTION,11,CMR12,,12,12
The mechanisms to heat the corona to its multi-million Kelvin temperature have been divided,11,CMR12,,91,91
"between DC heating mechanisms and AC heating mechanisms. The DC heating mechanisms are
models generating currents and magnetic reconnection. Given that previous detection of coronal
waves were sporadic events (Aschwanden et al. 1999; Nakariakov et al. 1999), modelling eﬀorts have
mainly gone into 3D DC heating models (Gudiksen & Nordlund 2005; Chen et al. 2014; Carlsson et al.
2016). However, the recent observational evidence for the ubiquitous presence of transverse coronal
waves (Tomczyk et al. 2007; McIntosh et al. 2011; Anﬁnogentov et al. 2015), motivates a revisiting of
the AC heating mechanisms. Wave heating has been successfully achieved in 1D (Suzuki & Inutsuka
2005) and reduced 3D MHD (van Ballegooijen et al. 2011, 2014) models. Recently, Matsumoto (2018)
extended the 1D wave heating models to 3D, but the model lacked any transverse structuring and",11,CMR12,,869,101

"thus the waves heat a ﬂux tube without a density-enhanced coronal loop. Recent 3D models with
density-enhanced coronal loops have not been able to sustain the corona (Pagano et al. 2018; Pagano
& De Moortel 2019). This is because the wave heating is insuﬃcient to compete against the strong
radiative cooling of the coronal loops. Since the optically thin radiative cooling directly decreases
the internal energy, it is the key quantity to overcome in coronal heating models.",11,CMR12,,475,101
"The observed transverse waves that show little to no decay (Tian et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012)
are called decayless kink waves (Nistic`o et al. 2013). Even though it is still unconﬁrmed whether
these transverse waves have enough energy for heating the corona (Tomczyk et al. 2007; McIntosh
et al. 2011; Van Doorsselaere et al. 2014), the observed energy ﬂux of transverse oscillations is usually
underestimated because some “dark” energy is hidden in the non-thermal broadening of spectral lines
(McIntosh & De Pontieu 2012; De Moortel & Pascoe 2012; Pant et al. 2019). The decayless waves
are interpreted as being driven at the footpoints by photospheric motions, but the wave energy is
transfered and dissipated in the corona, either through resonant absorption (Hollweg & Yang 1988;
Goossens & Poedts 1992), mode coupling (Pascoe et al. 2012), phase mixing (Pagano & De Moortel
2017), or Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (Browning & Priest 1984; Terradas et al. 2008; Antolin et al.
2015). The latter mechanism cascades the driving energy from large scales to small scales, where it is
dissipated at low Reynolds numbers (Karampelas et al. 2017; Guo et al. 2019b; Afanasyev et al. 2019;
Karampelas et al. 2019a). The resulting loops have a fully turbulent cross-section (Karampelas &
Van Doorsselaere 2018; Antolin & Van Doorsselaere 2019) and show decayless oscillations resembling
observed events (Karampelas et al. 2019b).",11,CMR12,,1425,105
"In this paper, we study the heating eﬀects of transverse oscillations on coronal loops via three
dimensional MHD simulations. Our work is diﬀerent from the previous ones in the following three
aspects: 1. We explicitly include the radiative cooling in simulations. 2. Our results show that the
dissipation of transverse oscillations is promising to balance the radiative cooling of the coronal loops.
3. As far as we know, we propose a new method estimating numerical viscosity and resistivity in
MHD simulations. The numerical model is presented in Section 2. Section 3 provides the numerical
results, and Section 4 is the discussion and conclusion.",11,CMR12,,650,106

related movies we see the formation of a standing kink mode as the result of the footpoint driver.
The loop is distorted ﬁrst at the boundary due to the velocity shear, and then in the whole loop cross
section as KHI develops. Heating is initiated at the loop boundary and more profound at the loop
boundary than the loop interior, due to strong velocity shear at the boundary and strong radiative
loss at the loop interior. Heating occurs ﬁrst at the footpoint and only after at the loop apex, making

temperature peaks in the snapshot are also due to the adiabatic eﬀects (Karampelas et al. 2017).

the density, and thus has most eﬀect on the high density loop interior. However, despite the strong
radiative cooling, also the radiative simulation maintains a temperature above the initial temperature
of 1 MK. For the background corona, the gradual increase of the temperature around the apex is
due to the ponderomotive force (Terradas & Ofman 2004), which is also found in previous numerical
simulations (Magyar & Van Doorsselaere 2016; Karampelas et al. 2019a; Guo et al. 2019a).",11,CMR12,,681,102

t,11,CMMI12,,1,1
"= 600 s, the kinetic energy
is not obviously inﬂuenced, while the magnetic and internal energies are changed compared to the
adiabatic ones. As the gas pressure of the loop is decreased by radiative cooling, the inward Poynting
ﬂux at the side boundaries of the simulation increases the magnetic energy of the loop. Due to
the cooling, the internal energy stops increasing and stabilises around a ﬁxed value. Indeed, in this
stage of our conﬁguration, the driver energy input from the footpoint is approximately balancing
the radiative energy losses. To better gauge the heating in the simulation, we examine the volume
averaged temperature in the subdomain, which is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 4. In the
adiabatic case, the temperature increases continuously due to persistent viscous and resistive heating
at the small scales. It also follows the two stage process that we discussed before, with ﬁrst a steady
increase until the KHI saturates. In the latter stage, the temperature increase in the adiabatic case is
nearly constant. For the radiative simulation, when radiative cooling is switched on, the temperature
remains almost constant in the second, radiatively cooling stage of the simulations. This result
demonstrates that the energy dissipation of small-scale structures can balance the radiative cooling
and maintain a high temperature loop. It also indicates that transverse oscillation dissipation is a
promising mechanism for heating coronal loops.",11,CMR12,,1473,104

and radiative cases. This result shows that the heating eﬀects are promising to balance the radiative
cooling of the denser coronal loop. However, the internal energy density decreases obviously, even in

the temperature near the footpoint is probably due to the ponderomotive force that can transport
mass from the footpoint to the apex and thus inﬂuence the temperature proﬁles (Terradas & Ofman
2004).",11,CMR12,,316,97
"Thus, we have proven with our simulations that AC heating mechanisms can be used in 3D MHD
models of coronal loops to heat the coronal plasma compensating for the massive radiative losses.
This was done by comparing an adiabatic simulation with a simulation in which radiative cooling
was switched on. In the latter simulation, the temperature was kept at coronal values, because of the
balance between the dissipation of the input driver ﬂux, the background heating, and the radiative
cooling.",11,CMR12,,494,101
"This model constitutes a proof-of-principle for the AC heating mechanisms which have been pro-
posed half a century ago. Our model opens the door for further exploration of these heating mech-
anisms. This includes models incorporating a chromosphere and transition region who will induce
ﬁeld-aligned mass ﬂows in response to the turbulent heating and thermal conduction. Moreover, we
can look forward to models encompassing a whole active region heated with MHD waves. More im-
portantly, the models that will build upon our model can be contrasted to earlier DC heating models
for the solar corona. This comparison could in principle indicate which observable eﬀects that can
distinguish the two heating classes in observations.",11,CMR12,,731,99
"Before closing, some remarks are necessary for future studies. Firstly, our current simulations
have energy outﬂows near the boundary, which could be improved in the future, and secondly, a
parametric study where the wave period is changed spanning and bridging the DC AC transition
would be helpful in determining which heating mechanism is more eﬃcient at least in this model.",11,CMR12,,378,95
