1. Introduction,16,Calibri-Light,,15,15
"Geochronology, or the determination of absolute ages for geologic events, underpins many inquiries into the 
formation and evolution of planetary bodies and our Solar System. Bombardment chronology inferred from lunar 
samples has played a significant role in the development of models of early Solar System and extrasolar planetary 
dynamics, as well as the timing of volatile, organic, and siderophile element delivery. Improvements and expansion 
of known absolute ages would yield new insights into many scientific questions. For example, absolute ages of 
ancient and recent magmatic products provide strong constraints on the dynamics of magma oceans and crustal 
formation, as well as the longevity and evolution of interior heat engines and distinct mantle/crustal source regions. 
Absolute dating also relates habitability markers to the timescale of evolution of life on Earth. In addition, terrestrial 
laboratory radiometric and cosmic ray exposure dating of lunar samples, paired with crater size-frequency 
distributions (CSFDs) of the geologic units associated with the samples, have enabled the calibration of lunar",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,1131,123
"cratering chronology functions. These functions allow the determination of model ages for unsampled geological 
units across the Moon and have been adapted for application on other terrestrial planetary bodies for which no 
samples of known provenance currently exist. Major advances in planetary science can thus be driven by 
geochronology in the next decade, calibrating body-specific chronologies and creating a framework for 
understanding Solar System formation, the effects of impact bombardment on life, and the evolution of planetary 
surface environments and interiors.",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,579,112

"(2013) advocates efforts to “Determine the 
chronology of basin-forming impacts and constrain the period of late heavy bombardment in the inner Solar System 
and thus address fundamental questions of inner solar system impact processes and chronology.” However, given 
the limitations of then-existing technologies, only sample return was considered a viable method for geochronology 
and was therefore used as a driver for recommending and implementing sample return missions such as OSIRIS-
REx and Mars Sample Return.",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,520,115

"(2013) also recommended a New Frontiers-class mission to 
return samples from the Moon’s South Pole-Aitken Basin to address the bombardment history of the inner Solar 
System. Such a mission was proposed multiple times by several groups (Duke 2003; Jolliff et al. 2012; Jolliff et al. 
2017), and selected twice for Phase A study, but no mission concepts have yet been selected for implementation. 
Though there are many factors in play when making mission selections, sample return within the New Frontiers 
program seems to be accomplishable from small bodies (e.g., OSIRIS-REx). There may be additional costs and 
technical risks in realizing a robotic sample return mission to bodies with significant gravitational wells or those 
requiring supplemental mission elements (such as a communications satellite to enable lunar farside 
communication). Further challenging the sample return model, the number of chronologically significant geologic 
terrains across the inner Solar System far exceeds our financial capacity and projected technological ability to 
collect, cache, and return samples from all of them, much less do the same across the outer Solar System.",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,1168,117

2. Geochronology Mission Science Goals and Objectives,16,Calibri-Light,,53,53
Characterizing the timing and relationships between geological processes across the Solar System is a major,10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,107,107
"goal of planetary science. Our existing understanding of inner Solar System chronology is rooted in defining 
geologic epochs on each body, and then assigning absolute ages to those epochs by scaling the lunar production and 
chronology functions to different planetary conditions (Strom & Neukum 1988; Hartmann & Neukum 2001; 
Neukum et al. 2001; Schmedemann et al. 2014; Hiesinger et al. 2016a). Unfortunately, the lunar cratering record 
itself is unconstrained prior to the apparent bombardment of 3.9 Gyr ago (basin-forming epoch) and suffers from a 
roughly billion-year uncertainty between 1 and 3 Ga (“middle ages”; Hartmann et al. 2000; Ryder et al. 2000; 
Stöffler et al. 2006; Chapman et al. 2007; Fassett & Minton 2013; Robbins 2014; Bottke & Norman 2017). Geologic",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,777,115
"epochs on different planetary bodies have been defined by events that have little apparent relation to each other (Fig. 
1). Therefore, refining the lunar crater chronology curve and calibrating body-specific chronologies is critically 
important for comparing planetary histories, contextualizing Solar System dynamics, and developing an 
interplanetary perspective on the evolution of planetary surfaces, interiors, and habitable environments. We chose 
three overarching Science Goals to investigate in this study:",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,517,120
Goal A:,10,TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,,7,7
Determine the chronology of basin-forming impacts to constrain the time period of heavy,10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,87,87
"bombardment in the inner Solar System, and thus address fundamental questions related to inner Solar System 
impact processes and chronology. Ascertaining the early flux of impactors on all planetary bodies across the inner 
and outer Solar System is necessary to understand the Solar System’s dynamical evolution and processes occurring 
on nascent planetary bodies.",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,367,115
Goal B:,10,TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,,7,7
Reduce the uncertainty for inner Solar System chronology in the “middle ages” (1-3 Ga) to improve,10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,97,97
"models for planetary evolution, including volcanism, volatile evolution, and habitability. Lunar cratering 
chronologies are not well-calibrated in the period between 1 and 3 Ga, because there are no returned samples of 
known provenance with these ages. This deficit propagates into uncertainties in the chronology systems for the 
Moon and other bodies, resulting in large uncertainties in the history and duration of volcanic activity.",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,438,112
Goal C:,10,TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,,7,7
Establish the history of habitability across the Solar System. Absolute ages of potentially habitable,10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,101,101
"terrains would help resolve when localized environments within the inner Solar System could have supported 
biological activity.",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,128,107

these goals by",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,123,108

of ±1% for 4.5 Ga rocks (or about ±50 Myr, 2",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,72,44

where this level of uncertainty would resolve Science Objectives specific to the Moon, Mars, and Vesta, tracing to 
LEAG, MEPAG, and SBAG goals documents (Table 1).",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,233,115
"Objective 1: Establish the chronology of basin-forming impacts by measuring the radiometric age of 
samples directly sourced from the impact melt sheet of a pre-Imbrian lunar basin.",10,TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,,181,99
"The leading model for lunar 
impact history, which is still under debate (Bottke & Norman 2017; Hartmann 2019), includes a pronounced 
increase in large impact events around 3.9 Ga (Tera et al. 1974; Ryder 1990). The factors that led to this “terminal 
lunar cataclysm” would likely have also led to large impacts throughout the inner Solar System as a “late heavy 
bombardment,” influencing the habitability potential of Earth and other bodies. Recent work on lunar samples has 
identified the possibility that lunar sample collections may be biased by repeated (albeit unintentional) sampling of 
Imbrium basin ejecta at the various Apollo landing sites (Schaeffer & Schaeffer 1977; Haskin et al. 1998; Cohen et",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,713,118
"al. 2000; Norman et al. 2010). Few rocks older than 3.9 Ga exist on the Earth, so samples from the basin-forming 
epoch are scarce, but this bombardment would have occurred on an early Earth with an atmosphere, oceans, and 
continents, and may have influenced the course of biologic evolution (Maher & Stevenson 1988; Mojzsis &",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,327,113

(e.g., Mars or even Venus), early in their history.",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,164,112
Dynamical models that support an early bombardment of the Moon assume lunar bombardment is strongly,10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,99,99
"linked to the broader processes describing the endgame of planet formation (Morbidelli et al. 2018). A successful 
model must not only explain what is found on the Moon, but also constrain early bombardment on Mercury, Earth, 
Mars, the asteroids, and potentially bodies in the outer Solar System as well. These models, which extend from the 
gas-dust dynamics of forming disks to giant planet migration, are invoked to understand our Solar System as well as 
systems of exoplanets around other stars. As we seek to better link what we know about these other systems, we are 
left with a fundamental question: Is our Solar System typical or anomalous? One of the best ways to address this 
question is to determine what processes occurred and their timing and duration in the early Solar System, and then 
compare these findings to what is observed in planetary systems that are currently forming around other stars. A key 
test of these dynamical models is whether the terrestrial planets and asteroid belt experienced a relative “lull” in 
impacts between formation and later bombardment.",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,1090,117

subsequent impact resurfacing (Wilhelms 1987; Spudis 1993; Frey 2011; Featherstone et al. 2013; Neumann et al. 
2015). Cross-cutting relationships of ejecta and crater densities allow reconstruction of a relative time-sequence of

"cratered terrains has allowed fitting of basin deposits with absolute model ages (Orgel et al., 2018). However, the 
precision of these fits is unknown due to a paucity of calibration points in this part of the lunar cratering chronology 
(e.g., van der Bogert and Hiesinger, 2020). Wilhelms 1987; Fassett et al. 2012). In large part, this reflects our 
inability to link individual lunar samples with specific basins or craters with a high degree of confidence, even when 
carefully collected by astronauts. Stöffler and Ryder (2001) provide a comprehensive summary of the radiometric 
dates of lunar samples available at that time and their interpretation of the ages of key nearside basins such as 
Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, and Nectaris. However, more recent work has called into question the geologic 
interpretation of samples from Serenitatis, Crisium, and Nectaris, pulling the pin on the only constraints on a lunar 
cataclysm (Norman, 2009; Norman et al. 2010; Spudis et al. 2011; Zellner 2017).",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,1010,121

the geologic sample, radiometric dating system, and interpretation – ranging from 3.86±0.09 Ga to 3.91±0.09 Ga to 
3.934 ± 0.03 Ga (Deutsch & Stöffler 1987; Stöffler & Ryder 2001; Norman et al. 2010; Merle et al. 2014). These

Even in a case where results might be in between the two extremes (for example, 4.0 ± 0.2 Ga), we can use that 
interval to infer a moderately strong form of the cataclysm. In addition to measurement precision, careful site 
selection and sample characterization are keys to remote identification of impact-melt samples derived from a pre-

age is a combination of the measurement uncertainties and deviation among samples. For the science questions

"geochronology missions to the Moon, Mars, and Vesta, measuring multiple aliquots of key 
samples increases the likelihood of obtaining robust age constraints and may overcome complications from 
overprinting impact events and other factors. Increasing the number of samples decreases the mean residual error 
and calculated standard deviation, potentially enabling the age of the geologic event to be interpreted with better 
precision than any individual measurement (e.g., terrestrial detrital mineral studies such as Coutts et al. 2019). 
Analyzing multiple aliquots would also ensure mitigation of secondary events that might be recognized in 
geochronology data, such as thermal or aqueous alteration. If results disagree among three aliquots of a lithology, 
the analysis shows that they were not all reset by the same event, or that there is some other complicating factor 
involved. The exact number of samples required to obtain robust statistical results depends on the exact question 
being asked. For this study, we adopted 10 samples as the requirement to achieve robust counting statistics that 
could improve the precision on the interpreted age by a factor of three if all samples yielded the same measured age.

martian surface has been dominated by aeolian scouring and transport during the Amazonian, constantly exposing 
bedrock in some places and covering other areas with sediment. Previous mission landing sites have shown that in 
areas of active or recent deflation (e.g., the plains of Gusev crater, the lower flanks of Mt. Sharp in Gale crater), 
surfaces are covered by a scattered to continuous lag of coarse rock fragments too large to be transported by the 
wind. In many instances, fragment size distributions are as expected by impact fragmentation, with fragment 
composition consistent with derivation from local bedrock/materials (Grant et al. 2006). Because the plains often 
display a lag of fragments too large for aeolian transport, access to fragments of suitable size (>0.5 cm) for delivery 
to geochronology instruments would be straightforward and likely involve minimal processing.",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,1014,120
"However, the Spirit and InSight landing sites have a large number of small, sediment-filled craters (dubbed 
“hollows”) dominated by accumulation of finer materials capable of aeolian transport. Material within the hollows is 
derived via mostly local impacts of varying size that create and eject an inventory of fines that can be transported by 
the wind into the source or other nearby craters where it can be sequestered. The majority of infilling occurs 
relatively soon after a crater forms (Golombek et al. 2014; Sweeney et al. 2018) and is related to transport of 
sediment produced by the impact, though prevailing winds dictate that some is transported in directions that will not 
contribute to infilling of the parent crater. Infilling continues over time as nearby impacts create additional 
inventories of fines, some of which can be transported downwind and trapped in other craters. Because wind is the",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,918,120

than 1 cm, which are less suitable for delivery to geochronology instruments. Nevertheless, there is also a lesser 
component of coarser fragments (mostly cm-scale) that contributes to fill and is the result of direct emplacement of 
ejecta fragments during formation of nearby craters (mostly tens to hundreds of meters away). At the InSight 
landing site, the concentration of coarser fragments on the west side of Homestead Hollow and referred to as Rocky

from the surface that likely concentrated these coarser fragments to some degree. For comparison, the fragment size

some important trades is presented in Table 6. All versions of the Geochronology mission in this study closed using

the surface of each destination. Destination-specific factors in the spacecraft bus designs include the thermal 
solution, engines and propellant volume, and entry, descent, and landing (EDL) details. The Deep Space Network 
would be used as the primary means for all communications during the flight operations, checkout, commissioning, 
and surface operations phases. Each lander would use direct-to-Earth communication links to forward commands to 
and receive science and housekeeping data. After landing, a several-day lander checkout would be performed, 
followed by instrument commissioning and initial data collection. Normal surface operations would occur during the 
daylight portion of the lunar or martian day, when the lander would perform sample analysis and site imaging while 
recharging the lander batteries and communicating with Earth. Then it would enter a low-power state for the night.

analyzed, prioritized, and sequentially introduced to each instrument (Fig. 22). The reference sequence would be 
repeated for each sample until the required number of samples were completed at each site. The sequence may be 
paused at multiple points for additional data analysis, troubleshooting, or to manage payload power. PlanetVac 
would pneumatically gather surface samples, transfer, and sieve them to the 0.5-2 cm diameter required for analysis. 
The sieved samples would be gravity-fed into the triage station for identification and prioritization using data from 
the spectrometer and Microimager. The operational time required for characterization and prioritization would 
depend on the process used. It should be possible to develop onboard algorithms to characterize at least some 
samples using preselected characteristics known from laboratory analysis, but some scientific ground-in-the-loop 
characterization may also be required. After analysis of the initial triage data, prioritized samples would be selected 
for further analysis. The SMA would move samples from the triage station to the other instruments. CDEX requires 
that the rock sample present a flat, polished surface for analysis, so the SMA would first present a sample to a 
grinding station. At the grinding station, the rock would be ground to millimeters of depth and polished to a 10-
micron finish using a heritage design Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT), previously flown on the",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,1683,120

and then to the CDEX aperture, where CDEX would perform its analysis by rastering the flat, finished surface of the 
sample over the instrument entrance aperture. Typically, CDEX would measure 100-300 locations on a sample in a 
raster pattern, ablating 5-μm diameter laser spots, thus sampling a range of different minerals for Rb-Sr isotope ratio 
measurements. The ionization lasers could be turned off to map elemental chemistry.",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,517,120
"Upon completion of CDEX analysis, the SMA would drop the sample into the KArLE/ICP-MS carousel inlet.",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,101,101
"In this study, KArLE and ICP-MS would share a laser ablation unit, a mass spectrometer, and an internal sample-
handling carousel, which is based on the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) sample carousel on the Mars Science 
Laboratory (MSL) mission. Neither KArLE nor ICP-MS require samples to have a flat, polished surface, but can 
accept either a natural sample or a polished sample. Therefore, if the grinding or imaging station fail, KArLE and 
ICP-MS could still analyze the sample. However, samples could not be retrieved from the KArLE carousel after 
analysis, so this step occurs last in the operations. The sample would be dropped into an individual cup in the 
carousel; the carousel would rotate the sample cup to the analysis station and elevate the cup to form a seal. The 
sample would be laser ablated to measure elemental chemistry (including parent K) using LIBS. Material liberated 
by laser ablation would be let into a mass spectrometer either by static expansion and electron impact ionization 
(neutral species including Ar for KArLE analysis) or via a plasma torch (ionized species including trace elements for 
ICP-MS).",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,1141,118

Geochronology payload. The growth areas needed include total payload mass capability, broader landing site 
capability, higher reliability, lower risk, and the addition of packages that provide power and thermal solutions (such 
as the extended operations package capability of the Lunar Environment Monitoring Station; Benna et al.,. 2020) for 
the lunar night. Continuing the CLPS program into the next decade would increase the likelihood that lower-cost 
communications relays would become available. If the goals and promises of the CLPS program also result in lower 
payload delivery cost, multiple lunar Geochronology sites could be investigated on the Moon, potentially at lower 
cost.",10,TimesNewRomanPSMT,,808,120
