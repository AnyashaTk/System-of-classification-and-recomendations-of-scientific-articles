of state (EOS) deduced from a core-envelope model of superdense stars. Such superdense
stars have been studied by solving the Einstein’s equation based on pseudo-spheroidal
and spherically symmetric space-time geometry. The computed star properties are com-

categories: (i) highly compact self -bound stars that represents exotic matter composi-

of highly compact neutron like stars having exotic matter compositions.",7,CMR8,,592,90

The mass-radius diagram in Fig. 5 clearly classify the nature of compact stars in
three categories :(i) highly compact self-bound stars represented by the TRV Model
and SQM1 model with exotic matter compositions (ii) the normal neutron stars
with nuclear matter EOS and (iii) the ultra soft compact stars represented by the
SNJR geometrical model. At the end, we are able to identify a correspondence
between the geometric description with the structure of the matter distribution in",9,CMR10,,491,82

neutron like compact stars in three distinct types each one having diﬀerent internal

for the study of superdense self-bound stars having exotic matter compositions.",9,CMR10,,326,84
