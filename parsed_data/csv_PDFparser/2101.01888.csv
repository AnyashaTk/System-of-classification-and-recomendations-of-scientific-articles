"ABSTRACT
Spiral arms are distinctive features of many circumstellar disks, observed in scattered light, which
traces the disk surface, millimeter dust emission, which probes the disk midplane, as well as molecular
emission. The two leading explanations for spirals are wakes generated by a massive planet and the
density waves excited by disk self-gravity. We use stratiﬁed 3D hydrodynamic shearing-box simulations
including dust particles and disk self-gravity to investigate how gas and dust spirals in a self-gravitating",9,CMR10,,523,108

"), and not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the size
of the computational domain, the cooling time, or the particle size. In simulations with the biggest
domain, the spirals in the gaseous disk become slightly more open with a higher cooling eﬃciency. Small
dust follows the gaseous spirals very well, while intermediate-sized dust with dimensionless stopping
time (St) close to 1 concentrates to the spirals more and shows stronger spirals. However, large dust

is due to the gravity from the gas to the dust component. We show that when St",9,CMR10,,172,93

", the gravitational
force from the gaseous spirals to the dust particles becomes stronger than the particles’ aerodynamic
drag force, so that the gas signiﬁcantly aﬀects these large particles through gravitational interaction.
This has important implications for both spiral observations and planetesimal formation/dynamics.",9,CMR10,,324,104

INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"Protoplanetary disks are observed with a number of
features and substructures, from the common rings of
recent surveys (Andrews et al. 2018; Long et al. 2018)
to the less common but equally intriguing spirals (Grady
et al. 2013; P´erez et al. 2016; Huang et al. 2018a; John-
ston et al. 2020), vortices (van der Marel et al. 2013,
2016) and potential warps (Benisty et al. 2015). Spirals
in the gas can be caused by two distinctive mechanisms,",9,CMR10,,443,58
"either by the wakes produced by the superposition of
higher order modes induced by a point source (i.e. a
planet) (Zhu et al. 2015; Dong et al. 2015; Bae & Zhu
2018a,b) or by non-axisymmetric modes of gravitational
instabilities (Lin & Shu 1964; Dong et al. 2016; Lee et al.
2019). Distinguishing between these two sometimes re-
lies on the pitch angle of the spiral arms (Pohl et al.
2015; Hall et al. 2018), the number of arms (Bae & Zhu
2018a,b) or their amplitude (Juh´asz et al. 2015). We
focus on the pitch angle for the ease in comparing and",9,CMR10,,548,59
"Corresponding author: Hans Baehr
hans-paul.baehr@unlv.edu",7,CMR8,,57,32
"constraining this parameter with observations. While
the number of arms is easier to constrain observation-
ally, most disks only show two which is in line with theo-
retical expectations for either cause (Bae & Zhu 2018a).
Due in part to observational constraints, determining
which causes the spirals in images, however, has proven
to be a challenge (Forgan et al. 2018b,a; Ren et al. 2018).
Observations come in three regimes, those which are
observed in light scattered oﬀ the optically thick gas",9,CMR10,,500,59
"surface of the disk (Muto et al. 2012; Grady et al. 2013;
Garuﬁ et al. 2013; Stolker et al. 2016; Benisty et al. 2015;
Dong et al. 2018b, etc.), those which are observed as spi-
rals in the dust emission (P´erez et al. 2016; Huang et al.
2018a; Reynolds et al. 2020) with ALMA and molecu-
lar line emission (Boehler et al. 2018; Booth et al. 2019;
Huang et al. 2020). By only observing the surface of the
disk, spirals in scattered light images may not indicate
the presence of a feature throughout down to the disk
midplane. In TW Hydrae for example, there exists an
apparent discrepancy between the spirals in gas observa-",9,CMR10,,624,60
"tions (Teague et al. 2019) and the rings seen in the dust
continuum (Andrews et al. 2016). On the other hand,
although spirals in the dust may probe the midplane of",9,CMR10,,164,57

Baehr & Zhu,9,CMCSC10,,11,11
"the disk, they may not reﬂect the spirals in the gaseous
disk (P´erez et al. 2016).",9,CMR10,,83,56
"Gravitationally unstable disks are commonly charac-
terized through the presence of spiral arms due to the
sheared self-gravitating waves generated by the massive
disk (Lin & Shu 1964; Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965).
These are typically represented by the dominant",9,CMR10,,263,55

spiral mode, but higher order spirals are common in sim-
ulations depending on disk mass and disk aspect ratio
(Cossins et al. 2009; Kratter & Lodato 2016). Compar-
atively, a spiral formed by a planet will feature a dom-
inant",9,CMR10,,231,56
m,9,CMMI10,,1,1
"= 1 exterior mode, with higher order interior
modes, depending on the mass of the perturber (Bae &
Zhu 2018a). Thus a planet that induces multiple spirals
are almost always considered to be located further out
than the observed spirals.",9,CMR10,,236,55
"However, recent images of potentially self-gravitating
disks reveal either no signatures of spirals (Andrews",9,CMR10,,108,54
"et al. 2018) or only faint spirals (P´erez et al. 2016)
and disks with spirals are not conclusively in the
regime where self-gravitational eﬀects should be relevant
(Huang et al. 2018b). Similarly, most disks which show
spiral features also do not have obvious planet candi-
dates (Boehler et al. 2018; Dong et al. 2018a), although
this may be due to detection limitations of low luminos-
ity planets (Ren et al. 2018).",9,CMR10,,419,57
"Thus, in the absence of more robust indicators, the
characterization of the pitch angle perhaps makes it pos-
sible to disentangle the cause of spiral features. In the
case of an embedded planet, the angle of the spiral is in-
ﬂuenced by the mass of the planet as well as the viscosity
and local temperature (Raﬁkov 2006; Muto et al. 2012).
Overall, the pitch angle is greater close-in to the planet
and decreases further away from the planet. For studies
which delve into the properties of the spirals generated
by embedded planets we refer to Zhu et al. (2015); Meru
et al. (2017); Hall et al. (2018); Dong et al. (2018b,b);
Bae & Zhu (2018b).",9,CMR10,,645,58
"The spiral structure of self-gravitating disks are of-
ten studied for their gas dynamics (Cossins et al. 2009;
Michael et al. 2012), but the eﬀect of self-gravity with re-
spect to solid material is an often neglected part of mesh-",9,CMR10,,232,60
"based simulations, due in part to the computational ex-
pense and because of the minor eﬀect in low-mass disks.
Without considering the self-gravity eﬀects from the gas
onto the dust and between the dust particles themselves,
larger dust species will remain decoupled from the gas
and form axisymmetric structures, and this may be the
expected outcome in many cases (Cadman et al. 2020).
However, as we will show, when the eﬀects of the gas
self-gravity is included on the dust, even large species
will form non-axisymmetric structure similar to the gas.",9,CMR10,,554,56

"Figure 1 shows the vertically integrated particle count
for each of the particle species included in two of our sim-
ulations after gravitoturbulence has been established.
All species trace the gas to some extent, matching the
same features of the gas with particularly narrow struc-
tures in the case of St = 1. Since particles of this size",9,CMR10,,341,60
"should drift most eﬃciently towards pressure maxima,",9,CMR10,,52,52
"this is expected. This also compares well with simi-
lar simulations in Gibbons et al. (2012), particularly for
particle sizes St = 1 and smaller (see their Figure 2). In
Gibbons et al. (2012) however, particles of size St = 10",9,CMR10,,227,58
"and 100 show some axisymmetric structure, but do not
correspond to the gas features, suggesting more iner-
tial behavior. Discrepancies at these larger sizes can
be attributed to two diﬀerences between how particles
are treated. In our primary simulations, we include the
eﬀects of self-gravity of and on the particles, which facil-
itates dust concentration, and the 3D implementation of
these simulations which considers sedimentation eﬀects
which proceed faster for moderate Stokes number par-

"Shearing boxes are a useful approximation for their
high resolution of predominantly local phenomena, but
become unreliable when the simulation domain is too
small to resolve all or even some unstable wavenumbers
(Booth & Clarke 2019) or when the domain is so large
that the local linear approximation no longer remains
tenable. The former is largely problem dependant and
what may be too small for gravitational instabilities is
still suitable for simulating magnetorotational instabili-
ties. While the large and medium simulations used here",9,CMR10,,543,58

smaller does not develop suﬃcient gravitoturbulence to

for various domain sizes and concluded that their small-

"Planets have been proposed as progenitors of spirals
in many disks, including the frequently studied disks
SAO 206462 (Muto et al. 2012; Grady et al. 2013; Dong
et al. 2015), MWC 758 (Dong et al. 2015, 2018b; Boehler
et al. 2018), and HD 100453 (Benisty et al. 2017; Wagner
et al. 2018). The spirals in these disks are unlikely to
be caused by gravitational instability in large part due
to their older ages and lower disk masses, none being
in the ranges normally associated with a self-gravitating
disk. Even so, the absence of a detected companion
keeps open the possibility of gravitational instabilities
as a cause.",9,CMR10,,620,57

CONCLUSION,9,CMR10,,10,10
"We investigated the spiral arms in self-gravitating
disks and analyzed a number of factors which could af-
fect what form they take and how they are observed.
Using local 3D shearing box simulations of gravitotur-
bulent disks we focused on the inﬂuence of the gas cool-
ing rate and simulation domain and how diﬀerent sized
particles presented in each case. Self-gravitating disks
are a possible cause of spiral features which have been",9,CMR10,,437,56
observed in both gas and dust disks.,9,CMR10,,36,36
"In our simulations, We characterize their features in
not only gas properties, but in the dust as well, which
allows for a better comparison with observations. We
summarize our results in the following points:",9,CMR10,,209,55

fected by the size of the computational domain.

the gas spirals become slightly more open with in-,9,CMR10,,50,50
creased cooling eﬃciency.,9,CMR10,,25,25
•,9,SFRM1000,,1,1
"Particles of diﬀerent sizes have similar responses to
the gas structure as measured by the pitch angle
when gas self-gravity acts on the dust. While it is
expected that smaller particles are more coupled
and have pitch angles that are more similar to the
gas, we ﬁnd that this is also true for the larger
particles which are less aﬀected by aerodynamic
drag but more aﬀected by the gas gravity.",9,CMR10,,394,53
•,9,SFRM1000,,1,1
"The above point suggests drag and self-gravity
may be comparable inﬂuences on the shape spi-
rals take. When particles do not feel the potential
of the gas at all, the ability of large particles to
form features corresponding to the gas is drasti-
cally diminished. This suggests that self-gravity
plays a role in shaping the structure spirals in grav-
itoturbulent disks, particularly for larger particles.
Even very low mass particles behave very similar",9,CMR10,,456,54

into small dense clouds unless particle-particle self-
gravity is included.",9,CMR10,,124,54

axisymmetric features, they become more reﬁned
with decreased cooling eﬃciency (increasing",9,CMR10,,140,49

This occurs even for a vertically unsettled distri-
bution of particles which are still undergoing over-
damped oscillations about the midplane.",9,CMR10,,147,52

independent on the simulation domain size. This pitch
angle is roughly consistent with current protoplanetary
disk observations. We observed some weak trends re-
garding particle sizes and cooling time. On the other
hand, considering the global nature of GI, it is desired
to investigate both gas and dust spirals in global simu-
