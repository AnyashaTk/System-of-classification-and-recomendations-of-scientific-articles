"In the local Universe, there exist tight correlations between the mass
of a supermassive black hole and the properties of its host galaxy,",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,138,70
"such as its bulge mass, luminosity, total stellar mass, and stellar
velocity dispersion (e.g. Magorrian et al. 1998; Ferrarese & Merritt
2000; Gebhardt et al. 2000; Merritt & Ferrarese 2001; Tremaine et al.
2002; Marconi & Hunt 2003; Häring & Rix 2004; Bentz et al. 2009;
Kormendy & Ho 2013; Reines & Volonteri 2015; see the review by
Heckman & Best 2014). These relations may be caused by the black
hole interacting with the host galaxy, with feedback from the active
galactic nucleus (AGN) heating the surrounding gas, regulating star
formation and also the future growth of the black hole (e.g. Silk &
Rees 1998; Di Matteo et al. 2005b; Bower et al. 2006; Ciotti et al.
2010). They may be also a result of the eﬃciency at which the galaxy
can fuel the black hole with gas (e.g. Hopkins & Quataert 2010;
Cen 2015; Anglés-Alcázar et al. 2017). This relation may instead
be coincidental, with both black hole and galaxy growth triggered
by the same processes, such as galaxy mergers (e.g. Haehnelt &",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,999,69

"Kauﬀmann 2000; Croton 2006; Gaskell 2011). Alternatively, some
studies suggest that the black hole and galaxy growth is uncorrelated,
with the relations a result of a central-limit-like theory caused by",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,202,70
"galaxy mergers across cosmic history (e.g. Peng 2007; Jahnke &
Macciò 2011).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,76,62
"To determine why these black hole–host relations exist, a key strat-
egy is to study how they evolve throughout cosmic time (e.g. Peng
et al. 2006; Croton 2006; Willott et al. 2017). However, measuring
these relations at high redshift is signiﬁcantly challenging observa-
tionally. Black hole mass measurements become less certain at higher
redshifts (see e.g. Shen 2013; Peterson 2013). In addition only black
holes that are highly accreting, shining as luminous quasars, are de-
tectable, whereas local studies generally measure these relations for
inactive galaxies (see e.g. Kormendy & Ho 2013).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,599,69

main wavelength regimes used for detecting these galaxies. The most
successful method is to use sub-mm instruments such as the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to study the rest-
frame far-infrared (FIR) emission from the host galaxies, produced",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,290,67

"Riechers et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2010, 2011; Venemans et al. 2019).
The emission from the quasar is minimal at these wavelengths, and
so this provides an unobstructed view of the host galaxy itself. These
observations can measure detailed properties of the distributions
of gas and dust within these galaxies on even sub-kpc scales (e.g.
Venemans et al. 2019). However, the local black hole–host scaling
relations are generally linked to the stellar properties of the galaxy
(e.g. Magorrian et al. 1998; Merritt & Ferrarese 2001), and so these
observations are not ideal for examining how these relations evolve
with redshift. Regardless, these observations can make estimates for
the mass of the galaxy, for example, using the measured dynamical,
dust and gas masses (see e.g. Wang et al. 2013; Valiante et al. 2014).
This provides the best measurements of the high-redshift black hole–
host mass relation possible with current instruments (e.g. Willott et al.
2017; Pensabene et al. 2020).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,992,73

at high redshift, the host galaxies become diﬃcult to resolve with

Earth, the PSF is diﬃcult to characterise even with the most careful

reduced with the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST;

by taking an image of a nearby star with similar properties to the

match the observed quasar PSF than the model, for the remainder of

ﬁlter performing the worst.,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,27,27
"In Figure 5 we also show the median ratio of AGN to host lumi-
nosity for the bright quasars, in each ﬁlter. This ratio is largest in the
F115W ﬁlter, due to the large Lyman-alpha emission from the AGN
falling in this wavelength range. This may explain the low success
rate for F115W images, as the hosts are more signiﬁcantly outshined
by the AGN and thus harder to detect. The AGN–host luminosity ra-
tio increases from F150W to F277W, reﬂecting the increasing AGN
luminosity with wavelength and roughly constant galaxy luminosity.
This ratio then drops in the F356W ﬁlter, due to the Balmer-break
causing a signiﬁcant increase in the galaxy ﬂux in this ﬁlter, before
again rising at larger wavelengths due to the AGN and host contin-
nuum slopes. The AGN–host luminosity ratio is low for the F356W
and F444W ﬁlters, which have the highest success rates, however
similar ratios are seen for the F150W and F200W ﬁlters which have
lower success rates, suggesting that this ratio does not entirely deter-
mine the success of the method.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1035,74

improved performance with the worst underestimation 97.7%. As
seen in Figure 7, for example, the long-wavelength residual images
show smoother features than the short-wavelength images, due to the
decreased resolution in these ﬁlters. This smoothness may result in
the AGN being easier to extract.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,433,67

by a mismatch in the PSF shapes due to the shot noise, as seen in
the HST images of Marshall et al. (2020b). A more substantial un-
derestimation would result in residual ﬂux in the PSF wings, which
is not seen. This AGN underestimation may, however, signiﬁcantly
aﬀect the measured ﬂux of the host galaxy. Figure 4 shows the PSF-

the quasar is centered (see Figure 4 and Marshall et al. 2020b). With
the improved resolution of JWST, this corruption should be limited to
a smaller region in the centre, if the PSF can be accurately calibrated.
Hence, it will always be safest to have a circular central exclusion
area within which one will not, or cannot, determine the host galaxy
ﬂux. The host ﬂux in this region may simply have to be interpolated
from the host galaxy surface brightness distribution outside this cor-
rupted area (see Figure 4). The true level of contamination will need
to be considered in detail when analysing the real JWST data.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,658,72

cess by simply measuring the total ﬂuxes outside this inner corrupted

actual surface-brightness distribution outside this corrupted region.

"We now investigate the kinds of quasars and host galaxies that are
most likely to result in successful detections using this technique.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,135,68
"First we investigate the bright quasars. We consider a host which is
successfully detected in at least 5 of the 6 NIRCam wide-band ﬁlters
in 10 ks exposures as ‘detectable’, while those that are successfully
detected in 4 or fewer of the 6 ﬁlters are ‘undetectable’. This results in
a sample of 15 ‘detectable’ hosts, and 7 ‘undetectable’ host galaxies,
from the 22 total bright quasars. The residual images and true host
mock images of these host galaxies in the F200W ﬁlter, showing
which are ‘detectable,’ are presented in Appendix A.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,537,74

the large number of faint quasars in all ﬁlters. With this technique,
19/22 of the bright quasars and 167/175 of the faint quasars are

and thus performing photometry on the PSF-subtracted images will
overestimate the brightness of the host galaxies. This is likely due to
residual ﬂux from the quasar itself, with some central ﬂux remain-
ing after the psfMC ﬁt, as discussed in Section 3.3. We note that
the Sérsic magnitudes do not systematically overestimate the host
brightness, as the central core of this remnant ﬂux is not necessarily
attributed to the host galaxy in the Sérsic ﬁt (see Section 3.3).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,474,71
"To account for this residual ﬂux, we mask the central contaminated
region of the images before performing the photometry. Based on the
PSF-subtracted images (see e.g. Figures 3 and 6, and Appendix A),
we choose to mask the central circle with a radius of 5 pixels, which
encompasses the core of the contamination, setting their original ﬂux
values to NaNs. For a lower limit on the host brightness, we simply
assume that the ﬂux for each pixel within this region is equal to the",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,478,69
"minimum ﬂux in a ring of one pixel in radius around this central
region. For our best estimate of the host brightness, we replace the
NaNs by interpolating from the neighbouring data points outside the
masked region with a 2D Gaussian kernel with standard deviation
equal to the FWHM, using the AstroPy (Astropy Collaboration et al.
2013) convolution and ﬁltering functions. For both of these masking
choices, we perform aperture photometry in an identical procedure

"In Figure 13 we show the Sérsic radius found from psfMC ﬁts to 10
ks images in each NIRCam ﬁlter, compared with the half-mass radius
determined from the true particle distribution from BlueTides. We
see no clear correlation between the half-mass radius and ﬁt Sérsic
radius for the majority of the ﬁlters, with no statistically signiﬁcant
Spearman rank-order correlations found. Thus, the Sérsic radius pro-
vides no prediction for the intrinsic half-mass radius of the galaxy,
as measured by BlueTides. It is important to note, however, that the
BlueTides half-mass radius is calculated from the stellar particle dis-
tribution, and does not consider the dust distribution. In addition, the
mass-to-light ratio may not be constant. Thus, the half-mass radius is
unlikely to trace the dust-attenuated half-light radius. Hence, while",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,832,72
"the Sérsic ﬁt cannot provide an estimate for the simulated half-mass
radius, this may not represent a failure of this technique speciﬁcally,
but a diﬀerence in observational and theoretical derivations of galaxy
properties.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,223,71
"To evaluate the success of the psfMC technique in recovering
galaxy sizes, we also consider the non-parametric eﬀective radius, as
measured from the true and PSF-subtracted images. We ﬁrst deﬁne
the eﬀective area of each galaxy as the minimum area encompassing
50% of the total light of galaxy, even if the contributing pixels are
non-contiguous. Then, we calculate the eﬀective radius as the radius
of a circle which contains this total area. This is a more robust way
to measure the light distributions of clumpy, high-redshift galaxies
(e.g. Ma et al. 2018).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,561,69

by allowing larger radii the model would not converge on a feasi-

subtracted host galaxy images are that: 1) these host galaxies can be
extremely asymmetric (see e.g. Appendix A); 2) they have very low
signal-to-noise ratios, rendering the traditional quantitative morpho-
logical classiﬁcation algorithms less reliable (see e.g. Taylor-Mager

subtraction process (see above) may not allow certain morphological
parameters to be determined reliably or at all, such as the compact-
ness parameter, because it is heavily weighted towards the central
galaxy ﬂux which may be corrupted by PSF imperfections. There-
fore, for true JWST data, one may need to modify these morphology
codes such that the central circular area is excluded. We presented a
simpliﬁed version of this process to determine the total magnitudes
in Section 5.1. However, because the high-redshift quasar host galaxy
signal-to-noise ratio will always be low, the CAS and Gini/M20 mea-

for simplicity.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,216,67
"It is important to note that high-redshift galaxies are unlikely
to be well-described by a Sérsic proﬁle. As seen in the true host
images (e.g. Figure A1), the host galaxies are often asymmetric and
clumpy, and appear not to follow a smooth Sérsic-like distribution.
Indeed, as seen in Figure 4 which shows both the Sérsic model
and the true host proﬁle for two quasars, the Sérsic model does not
perfectly describe the host emission. The suitability of the Sérsic
model for describing the magnitudes and radii of the host galaxies
was discussed in Sections 5.1 and 5.2.1.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,572,67

inﬂuence any measurements taken of the galaxy light concentration
or clumpiness, and so must be carefully considered when exploring
such properties. In some true host images, the centre of the galaxy
often contains less ﬂux than the outer regions; this is due to the
large amount of dust present in the cores of these galaxies, which
signiﬁcantly attenuates the ﬂux in these rest-frame UV wavelengths
(see e.g. Marshall et al. 2020a). The contaminated core makes these

"The Bayesian Information Criterion provides a statistical way to
compare the quasar model to a model with both the quasar and Sérsic
host galaxy. This accounts for the extra parameters involved with the
more complex host model, ensuring that the additional component
is not over-ﬁtting the data. This criterion can be used to determine
whether a statistically signiﬁcant detection of the host galaxy has
been made. However, we note that this criterion does not consider
the pixel smoothing that results in the host galaxies appearing clearer
in the mock images. The majority of the mock images shown here
have been smoothed with a",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,630,71

makes the noisy host image clearer, and results in more extended
features being easier to distinguish against the background noise (see
Appendix B). For visualization, in Figure B1 we show Figure 4 with
no smoothing applied.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,255,70
"Image smoothing has a consequence on human classiﬁcation,",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,57,57
"based on observing extended structures of positive ﬂux (yellow re-
gions) beyond the central contaminated core (red region). In 10 ks
images with the F200W ﬁlter, in non-smoothed images 19/22 of the
bright quasar hosts are visually classiﬁed as successfully detected.
For the smoothed images this increases to 21/22, with marginal
ﬂux observed from two additional very compact host galaxies. The
Bayesian Information Criterion results in 19/22 successful detec-
tions, the same fraction as with human classiﬁcation using only the
raw (non-smoothed) images. However, note that the detected galaxies
are not the all the same, with two BIC-detected galaxies not detected
visually and vice versa; this occurs for very compact marginally-
detected hosts. As this smoothing has an eﬀect on human classiﬁca-
tion, using a diﬀerent or modiﬁed statistical method which includes
smoothing could result in a larger number of successful detections.
When using psfMC to analyse quasar observations, it is a reason-
able assumption to model the galaxies as Sérsic proﬁles and then use
the Bayesian Information Criterion to support the hypothesis that the
host detection is true and not likely to be noise or residual quasar ﬂux
from the PSF-subtraction. However, alternative statistical measures
or galaxy proﬁles may result in a larger number of detections, and
may be more accurate at measuring the true galaxy properties.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1410,72
6.3 Recommendations for JWST Images,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,35,35
"The methods used here are guided by the large number of simulated
images, and our overall aims of understanding the successes and
failures of psfMC for detecting the hosts of quasars with JWST—we
create a generic, standard pipeline for this analysis. Initially there will
be very few images of high-z quasars taken with JWST, which will all
have signiﬁcant science outcomes that warrant detailed investigation.
Hence for the best outcomes with real JWST images we suggest a

"We investigate the accuracy of this method for recovering the true
host galaxy magnitudes. We ﬁnd that the host Sérsic magnitudes ex-
tracted from psfMC are not representative of the input theoretical
magnitudes from BlueTides, however this is likely due to obser-
vational eﬀects such as surface brightnesses and not a failure of
the psfMC method. We compare the Sérsic magnitudes to photo-
metric magnitudes measured from the true host images, ﬁnding fair
agreement but with large scatter, suggesting that Sérsic proﬁles are
reasonable but do not ideally model the host distributions. Photo-
metric host magnitudes measured from the PSF-subtracted images
generally overestimate the host brightness due to the residual quasar
ﬂux in the central regions. Masking this contaminated region prior
to performing the photometry results in the most accurate and pre-
cise estimates of the true host magnitudes. Careful masking of these
central regions will therefore be required to accurately measure the
host magnitudes.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1015,69
"We also study how well the PSF-subtraction can recover the phys-
ical properties of the galaxy. We ﬁnd that the Sérsic radius provides
no prediction for the intrinsic half-mass radius of the galaxy from
BlueTides, although this reﬂects a diﬀerence in observational and
theoretical derivations of galaxy properties and does not indicate
that the ﬁts perform poorly. We compare the Sérsic radii from the
psfMC ﬁts to the eﬀective radii as measured from the true host im-
ages, and ﬁnd that while these show reasonable agreement in the
long-wavelength NIRCam ﬁlters, the Sérsic radii are not an accurate
representation of the true host extent in the short-wavelength ﬁlters.
Measuring the eﬀective radii from the PSF-subtracted images, we
ﬁnd that the psfMC technique is able to recover the eﬀective radii
of the host galaxies well in the long-wavelength ﬁlters, and in the
short-wavelength ﬁlters only after masking of the central quasar-
contaminated regions. Finally, we consider the morphologies of the
host galaxies. We ﬁnd no correlation between Sérsic index",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1061,70
𝑛,8,NewTXMI,,1,1
"and
the BlueTides bulge-to-total mass ratio. The PSF-subtraction ac-
curately recovers the distribution of more extended host emission,
while the cores of the hosts are contaminated. Signiﬁcant care is
needed when interpreting the magnitudes and physical properties of
PSF-subtracted quasar host galaxies.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,305,66
"In this work we predict that JWST will be able to detect the rest-
frame UV/optical emission from high-redshift quasar host galaxies
for the ﬁrst time. This ground-breaking instrument will lead to huge
advancements in our understanding of the growth of the ﬁrst super-
massive black holes in the Universe, and the interplay between black

F160W ﬁlter, while the lower panels show the galaxy in the JWST NIRCam F150W ﬁlter. All images have an exposure time of 4800s, equivalent to 2 HST
orbits. We show the original quasar and host image in the left-most panels, and the residual image after PSF subtraction in the second panels. The third panels
show the best Sérsic model for the galaxy from psfMC convolved with the telescope PSF. The fourth panels show the residual image after full model subtraction,
i.e. of both the quasar PSF and host Sérsic proﬁles. The ﬁfth panels show the true mock image of the host galaxy, simulated by assuming no quasar emission.
The right-most panels show the diﬀerence between the PSF-subtracted image (second panel) and the true host image (ﬁfth panel), with green circles depicting
the PSF FWHM. Green ticks show the statistically signiﬁcant detections, while red crosses show the ﬁts which are not signiﬁcant detections. We assume a
