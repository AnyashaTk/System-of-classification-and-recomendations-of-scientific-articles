Abstract.,9,CMBX10,,9,9
"Telescope Array (TA) experiment has recorded [1, 2] several short time
bursts of air shower like events. These bursts are very distinct from conventional single
showers, and are found to be strongly correlated with lightnings.
In our previous
work [3] we proposed that these bursts represent the direct manifestation of the dark
matter annihilation events within the so-called axion quark nugget (AQN) model.
In the present work we suggest to test this proposal to search for the radio signals
in frequency band",9,CMR10,,511,89

1. Introduction,11,CMBX12,,15,15
"This work is tightly linked to our recent proposal [3] interpreting the mysterious bursts
observed by Telescope Array (TA) experiment [1, 2] in terms of the AQN annihilation
events under the thunderstorm. These events are very unusual and cannot be interpreted
In the present work we
in terms of conventional single showers as reviewed below.
shall argue that the proposed mechanism [3] in terms of the AQN annihilation events
inevitably predict the radio wave pulses which must be synchronized with TA bursts.
Based on this prediction we suggest to test our proposal by searching for the radio
signals in frequency band",11,CMR12,,620,89

"200) MHz which must be synchronized with the
TA bursts.",11,CMR12,,55,44
"Such test would unambiguously support or refute the proposal because the
main arguments of the present work based on synchronization which represents pure
geometrical property of the system. This is because the radio pulse and the TA burst are
originated from the same location, emitted at the same instant, and propagate with the
speed of light. This feature of synchronization is not sensitive to many assumptions and
uncertainties which were inevitably present in estimates [3] interpreting the TA bursts
as the AQN annihilation events. Furthermore, we also argue that the conventional
lightning-induced radio emission is qualitatively diﬀerent from the AQN -induced radio
pulses discussed in this work. Therefore, these two diﬀerent radio signals can be easily
distinguished from each other.",11,CMR12,,795,88
"Finally, before we proceed one should emphasize from the start that AQN events
are generically random events as they are related to dark matter particles. However, as
mentioned in [3] the AQN hitting the thunderstorm area may serve as a trigger which
sparks the lightning. In other words, the AQNs play the same role of the CRs which are
normally assumed to initiate the lightning processes. This represents a key element why
mysterious bursts which are associated with lightning events can be indeed originated
from the AQNs which happen to appear in the area under the thunderclouds. The event
rate estimated in [3] is based on this assumption.
Our presentation is organized as follows.",11,CMR12,,688,87
"In next section 2 we overview the TA
bursts observations [1, 2] and the basic ideas of the proposal [3] with the resolution of
these puzzling bursts in terms of the AQN annihilation events. In sections 3 and 4 we
argue that the emission of the radio pulse is inevitable consequence of the proposed
mechanism, and we estimate its numerical characteristics.
In sections 5 and 6 we
estimate the radio pulse due to the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. In section 7 we explain how
the conventional radio signals induced by the lightnings could be easily discriminated",11,CMR12,,552,89
"from the AQN-induced radio pulses. Finally, section 8 is our conclusion where we suggest
to search for a synchronized radio pulse with TA burst.",11,CMR12,,144,88

2. TA bursts as the AQN annihilation events under thunderclouds,11,CMBX12,,63,63
"The main goal of this section is to overview the basic idea of the proposal [3]. We
organize this section as follows: ﬁrst, in subsection 2.1 we overview the TA bursts
observations [1,2] emphasizing on the very distinct features of the events. In subsection
2.3 we explain the resolution of these puzzling bursts in terms of the AQN annihilation
events. In subsection 2.2 we highlight the very few key elements of the AQN construction
relevant for this work by referring to original paper [3] for all less important elements
of the proposal.
in the subsection 2.2 we shall only mention the
crucial ingredients related to the physics of emission of the radio pulses, which represent
the topic of the present work. Such organization of this work helps us to avoid an
unavoidable repetition of the background material which can be found in [3].",11,CMR12,,841,91
"In other words,",11,CMR12,,15,15
"2.1. Mysterious bursts observed by [1, 2]",11,CMTI12,,41,41
"The unusual features of the bursts recorded by [1,2] can be brieﬂy formulated as follows:",11,CMR12,,89,89
1,11,CMBX12,,1,1
". All reconstructed air shower fronts for the burst events are much more curved
than usual cosmic ray (CR) air showers. This feature is expressed in terms of the time-
spreading versus spatial-spreading of the particles in the bursts. The corresponding
“curvature” is much more pronounced for the bursts in comparison with conventional
CR air showers, see see ﬁgure 3 and ﬁgure 4 in [1]. Furthermore, the bursts events do
not have sharp edges in waveforms in comparison with conventional CR events;",11,CMR12,,498,87
2,11,CMBX12,,1,1
". The events are temporally clustered within 1 ms, which would be a highly
unlikely occurrence for three consecutive conventional CR hits in the same area within
a radius of approximately 1 km. The total 10 burst events have been observed during
5 years of observations. The authors of ref. [1] estimate the expectation of chance
coincidence is less than 10",11,CMR12,,357,86

from individual events within the bursts is ﬁve to six orders of magnitude higher than
the energy estimated by event rate.",11,CMR12,,223,86
3,11,CMBX12,,1,1
". Most of the observed bursts are “synchronized” (diﬀerence between burst and
lightning is less than 1 ms) or “related” (diﬀerence between burst and lightning is less
than 200 ms) with the lightning events. Some of them bursts are not related to any
lightnings. However, all 10 recorded bursts occur under thunderstorm.",11,CMR12,,319,88
"It is very hard to understand all these features in terms of conventional CR physics
as the bursts cannot be reconciled with conventional CR physics. At the same time
all unusual features (including the energetics, the ﬂux estimates, the time and spatial
spreading of each events within the bursts) as listed in items",11,CMR12,,317,87

naturally explained within the AQN framework. Before we proceed with corresponding
explanation we have to brieﬂy overview the basic features of the AQN model to explain

similar to the Witten’s quark nuggets, see [6–8], and review [9]. This type of DM is
“cosmologically dark” not because of the weakness of the AQN interactions, but due to
their small cross-section-to-mass ratio, which scales down many observable consequences
of an otherwise strongly-interacting DM candidate.",11,CMR12,,424,87
"There are two additional elements in the AQN model compared to the original
models [6–9]. First new element is the presence of the axion domain walls which are
copiously produced during the QCD transition",11,CMR12,,204,83

According to item,11,CMR12,,17,17
3,11,CMBX12,,1,1
"most of the observed bursts are
“synchronized” or “related” to the lightning events. However, some of the bursts are not
related to any lightnings. However, all 10 recorded bursts occur under thunderstorm.
This is very puzzling property of the bursts if interpreted in terms of the conventional CR
air showers because it is very hard to understand how the thunderstorms may produce
the observed features of TA events.",11,CMR12,,417,91
"At the same time the “synchronization” puzzle is perfectly consistent with AQN
based proposal [3] because the thunderstorm with its pre-existing electric ﬁeld (1) plays a
crucial role in the mechanism as the electric ﬁeld instantaneously liberates the positrons
and also accelerates them up to 10 MeV energies. The mean free path of such energetic
positrons is suﬃciently long such that these positrons can easily reach the Telescope
Array Surface Detectors (TASD) and can produce the signals consistent with the bursts.
In addition, an AQN can serve as a trigger of runaway breakdown avalanche as
discussed in [3]",11,CMR12,,614,91
3,7,CMR8,,1,1
". This explains the strong correlation between bursts and lightning
events within AQN interpretation. The AQN-induced burst may or may not initiate
lightnings depending on presence of other required ingredients for runaway breakdown
avalanche to start.
It explains the synchronization puzzle as well as it answers the
question of why most but not all bursts are correlated with lightnings.",11,CMR12,,389,84

and the basic normalization factors) suﬀer inevitable uncertainties due to very complex
dynamical properties of the system (the AQN propagation under thunderstorm with
large Mach number). However, there are some features of the system such as given by

particles which play the role of a trigger to an avalanche. The proposal [3] suggests that AQNs may",9,CMR10,,308,105

presented in previous section 2. We shall argue below that the emission of the radio
pulse is inevitable consequence of the proposed mechanism. Furthermore, the radio
pulse must be synchronized with TA burst irrespective of whether the bursts are related
or unrelated to the lightning events. This synchronization must be within 10",11,CMR12,,503,88

obviously ﬂuctuates in time and space. This will obviously modify the spectral features
(23). However, we expect that a typical frequency of the emission as given by (24) will

"Our goal here is to present some numerical results using parameters which had been
used in our previous estimations [3] related to puzzling TASD bursts as reviewed in
section 2.3. One should emphasize from the very beginning that the corresponding
estimates suﬀer from huge uncertainties, and should be considered as the order of
magnitude estimates, at the very best. Our main arguments of the present work are
not based on these highly model dependent estimates. Rather, our main arguments are
based on essentially model-independent features of the radio emission such as typical
frequency band (25) and strong synchronization between TASD burst events and the
radio emission. Nevertheless, we think that an order of magnitude estimates for the
amplitude of the electric ﬁeld as presented below could be useful as they demonstrate
the consistency of the proposal. The same estimates also demonstrate the principle
feasibility to detect such radio signals.",11,CMR12,,957,85

"The question we address in this section can be formulated as follows. It has been known
for quite sometime that the thunderstorm lightnings are always accompanied by the
radio emissions, see e.g. reviews [31, 32]. Can these lightning-induced radio pulses be
responsible for the eﬀects studied in this work? Before we answer this question we ﬁrst
recall [3] the basic features of the TA bursts interpreted as the AQN events, see item
1. Then, in item 2 we overview the main features of the radio emission which always
accompanies the thunderstorm lightning events. After that in item 3 we explain the
dramatic qualitative diﬀerences between the radio pulses associated with thunderstorm
lightnings and the radio pulses studied in this work.",11,CMR12,,739,87
1.,11,CMBX12,,2,2
"As we previously mentioned, lightnings are correlated with AQN events when
an AQN hits the region of the thunderclouds and potentially may initiate lightnings

that are considered to be one of the dominant triggers of lightnings, see footnote 3

interpreted as random AQN events are nevertheless associated with the lightnings.",11,CMR12,,492,84

direction of the lightning current are not correlated. This is because the AQN event
may serve as a trigger for the lightning strike. The trigger should not be confused with
the initial stepped lightning leader which determines the direction of the current of the
lightning being developed. In diﬀerent words, the direction of the observed current of
a lightning does not determine the sign of the ﬂuctuating electric ﬁeld",11,CMR12,,476,89

it emits the very energetic positrons, and it also triggers the lightning, similar to
conventional CR, see footnote 3 with relevant references. The former phenomenon
is recorded as a TASD burst, while the latter one explains the observed correlation
between the bursts and lightnings.",11,CMR12,,368,85

moment of the lightning ﬂashes or even earlier than lightning. Some bursts are not
related to the lightning ﬂashes at all (but occur under the thunderclouds). In original",11,CMR12,,253,87

triggers of lightning ﬂashes, which may or may not initiate the lightnings. The particles

"that these dramatic diﬀerences are related to very diﬀerent structures of the showers.
In case of conventional CR the radio emission is based on the picture when a CR air
shower is characterized by the “pancake” of particles and its central axis. The density of
the particles strongly depend on the distance to the central axis such that the spectral
density of the radio pulse is highly sensitive to the width of the “pancake”, which
becomes much thicker further away from the axis. It is very diﬀerent from the AQN-",11,CMR12,,517,90

electric ﬁeld in thundercloud, and in fact it is nowadays an eﬃcient probe to study
the electric ﬁeld in thunderstorms by analysing the radio emission [45]",11,CMR12,,235,83

to CRs are dramatically diﬀerent from the AQN-induced emission. Therefore, there
should be no technical diﬃculty to distinguish an AQN-induced radio pulse from a
conventional CR under the thunderstorm. The corresponding studies could support or
refute our proposal.",11,CMR12,,329,82
"There are many other distinct features between the AQN and conventional CR air
showers.
In particular, the AQNs mostly emit photons in X ray bands, such that a
signal cannot be observed by a ﬂuorescence detector which is designed to detect the
visible and UV light",11,CMR12,,264,83

"Next, we note that gamma rays can be produced by an avalanche of relativistic
runaway electrons during initiation of lightning [48]. Bursts of gamma rays initiated in
the Earth’s atmosphere, commonly referred to as terrestrial gamma ray ﬂashes, can be
generated in a lightning leader system [49, 50]. The terrestrial gamma ray ﬂashes can
trigger atmospheric photonuclear reactions that produce neutrons and positrons [51].
Evidently these gamma rays and their byproducts do not interfere with our proposed
radio detection, as they are excessively more energetic and only appear at frequency
band above EHz. Another important point here is that this powerful emission occurs
in a latter stage of a lightning, while an AQN-induced event appears before or at the
initial stage as it serves as a potential trigger of a lightning strike.",11,CMR12,,832,88
"Based on these dramatic diﬀerences in frequencies and timings of the radio emissions
we conclude that the signals due to the thunderstorm lightning events and conventional
CR air showers can be easily discriminated from the AQN-induced radio pulses studied

or refute our proposal to interpret the TA bursts as the AQN-induced events.",11,CMR12,,420,86

As we argued at the very end of previous Section 6 the,11,CMR12,,54,54

dominant role in radio emission. The corresponding results have been summarized
at the very end of Section 4 where it has been argued that the radio pulse can be
recorded if proper instruments are designed and built at the TASD site. The pulse
must be synchronized with TASD bursts. Such a signal cannot be confused with
any other spurious and noise signals as a result of this synchronization. Therefore,
observing (not observing) such synchronized signals can conﬁrm, substantiate or refute
our proposal. We further argued in section 7 that the AQN-induced radio signals can
be easily discriminated from the pulses generated by the thunderstorm lightning events.

as a result of the thunderstorm lightning events as argued in 7.",11,CMR12,,447,89

density. It is very nontrivial consistency check that the computed luminosity from the
corona nicely matches with observed EUV radiation. The same events of annihilation
are also manifested themselves as the radio impulsive events [55] in quiet solar corona.
