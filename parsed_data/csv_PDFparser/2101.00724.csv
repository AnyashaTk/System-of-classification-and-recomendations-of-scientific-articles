ference in physical scale between the SMBH and the galaxy
spheroid (nine orders of magnitude; Hickox et al. 2011), there
has been evidence of a causal connection between the growth of
the SMBH and the host galaxy evolution. These pieces of evi-
dence come from both observational (e.g. Magorrian et al. 1998;
Ferrarese & Merritt 2000) and theoretical studies (e.g. Hopkins
& Hernquist 2006; Hopkins et al. 2008; Di Matteo et al. 2008).

hampered by low number statistics (e.g Lutz et al. 2010; Page

Speciﬁcally, AGNs may be expected to vary on a wide range of
timescales (hours to Myr) that are extremely short compared to
the typical timescale for star formation (100 Myr) (Hickox et al.
2014). Recently, Grimmett et al. (2020) presented a novel tech-
nique that removes the need for binning, by applying a hierarchi-
cal Bayesian model. Their results conﬁrmed those of Bernhard
et al. (2019), that higher luminosity AGN have a tighter physical

"tion of SMBHs. The main reasons of obscuration are, both, the
fuelling of the SMBH (inﬂows of gas) and the AGN feedback
(for a review see Hickox & Alexander 2018). In terms of the dif-
ferent obscuring material, X-ray energies are obscured by gas,
whereas ultraviolet (UV) and optical wavelengths are extincted
by dust.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,319,64
"According to the simple uniﬁcation model, (e.g. Antonucci
1993; Urry & Padovani 1995; Netzer 2015), optical and UV
emission is produced by the accretion disc around the SMBH.
The X-ray emission is produced by the hot corona and is associ-
ated with the accretion disk, having a tight relation with the UV
and optical emission (Lusso & Risaliti 2016). To account for the
strong infrared (IR) emission (Sanders et al. 1989; Elvis et al.
1994), the model includes a torus of gas and dust that forms
around the central engine (SMBH and accretion disc). Speciﬁ-
cally, the dust grains (see Draine 2003) of the toroidal structure
are heated by the radiation from the central engine, which is then
re-emitted at larger wavelengths (IR emission; Barvainis 1987).
The orientation of the dusty torus determines the amount of ob-
scuring material along the observer’s line of sight to the central
regions. Thus, type 1 refers to the face-on (unobscured) and type
2 to the edge-on (obscured) AGNs. As a result, one of the main
predictions of the simple uniﬁcation model is that type 1 and
type 2 AGNs should live in similar environments and thus have
similar host galaxy properties.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,1170,66

ferent levels of obscuration correspond to di",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,106,60

growth of the SMBH (Ciotti & Ostriker 1997, 2001; Di Matteo

2007; Somerville et al. 2008; Treister et al. 2009; Fanidakis et al.
2011). The main idea is that the AGN growth coincides with
host galaxy activity which is likely to obscure the AGN (type 2",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,340,68

rounding star forming material (""blowout""). As a result further
star formation is halted (""quenching"") revealing the unobscured
AGN (type 1",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,197,63
−,9,txsy,,1,1
"phase). In the context of this model the same
galaxy material (dust and gas), that obscures the AGN, may also
produce the star formation. It has been claimed that obscuration
can occur not only in the regime around the accretion disk, but
also in galaxy scale (e.g. Maiolino & Rieke 1995; Malkan et al.
1998; Matt 2000; Netzer 2015; Circosta et al. 2019; Malizia et al.
