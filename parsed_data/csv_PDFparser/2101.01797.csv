"We calculate the response of a lead-based detector, such as the Helium and Lead Observatory
(HALO) or its planned upgrade HALO-1kt to a galactic core-collapse supernova. We pay particular
attention to the time dependence of the reaction rates. All reaction rates decrease as the neutrino
luminosity exponentially drops during the cooling period but the ratio of one-neutron (1n) to two-
neutron (2n) event rates in HALO is independent of this overall decrease. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that
this ratio still changes with time due to the changing character of neutrino ﬂavor transformations
with the evolving conditions in the supernova. In the case of inverted hierarchy, this is caused by the
fact that the spectral splits become less and less sharp with the decreasing luminosity. In the case
of normal hierarchy, it is caused by the passage of the shock wave through the Mikheyev-Smirnov-
Wolfenstein resonance region. However, in both cases, we ﬁnd that the change in the ratio of 1n to
2n event rates is limited to a few percent.",8,CMR9,,1030,103

"3 supernova explosions should happen
in our galaxy per century [1, 2]. The latest supernova
exploded about 120 years ago [3] but it was not optically
detected because it was buried in dust near the galactic
center. However, with today’s neutrino detection capabil-
ities, the next galactic core-collapse supernova will leave
thousands of events in the neutrino detectors [4, 5] even
if it explodes near the center of the galaxy. The question
of what we can learn about the core-collapse supernovae
and about neutrinos themselves from such a signal is a
prevailing one. A recent review can be found in Ref. [6].

To be able to scan the large parameter space, the authors
adopted an approach which is based on modifying the
neutrino energy spectra manually to mimic the dynamical

in Ref. [25] which was concerned with determining the
neutrino mass hierarchy by combining the electron neu-
trino signal from a lead or iron detector and the electron
antineutrino signal from a water-Cherenkov detector. A
complementary study was carried out more recently in Ref.
[26], in which the authors used time dependent neutrino
luminosities and initial energy distributions taken from
a proto-neutron star simulation [34]. Since this simula-
tion produced very similar ﬂuxes for diﬀerent ﬂavors, and

tially decreasing reaction rates in all detectors. However,
there is a more subtle eﬀect: with decreasing neutrino
luminosity, collective neutrino oscillations change their
character, especially in the case of inverted hierarchy (IH).
Our calculations for IH indicate that initially, when the
neutrino luminosity is large, the spectral swaps are sharp.
In other words, completely adiabatic or diabatic transi-
tions occur across the whole spectrum, depending on the
energy. As the neutrino luminosity drops, we see partially
adiabatic transitions in the part of the spectrum above",9,CMR10,,619,61
"35 MeV. This is the part of the spectrum to which a lead-
based detector is most sensitive, i.e., most of the neutrons
produced in the detector will originate from neutrinos in
this energy region [26]. Therefore, it is reasonable to ask
whether this eﬀect can lead to a time dependence beyond
the exponential drop in reaction rates in the case of IH. In
the case of normal hierarchy (NH), collective oscillations
aﬀect only the very low energy part of the spectrum. For
this reason, one does not expect to see a similar eﬀect for
NH.",9,CMR10,,533,60
The second source of time dependence in the HALO,9,CMR10,,48,48
signal is the propagating shock wave. This eﬀect can,9,CMR10,,52,52
"be expected to appear when the shock wave reaches the
MSW resonance region. There are two MSW resonances:
The low resonance occurs in the outermost layers of the
mantle and is experienced by neutrinos in both NH and
IH. However, one does not expect to see its eﬀect in",9,CMR10,,268,55
2,9,CMR10,,1,1
"reaction rates because the shock wave reaches there at
very late times when the neutrino luminosity drops to
a few percent of its initial value. The high resonance
occurs at relatively higher densities and is experienced by
neutrinos only in the case of NH. The shock wave reaches
this region relatively earlier, while there is still a sizable
neutrino luminosity. Therefore, in principle, it is possible
to see the eﬀects of the shock wave in reaction rates in
the case of NH.",9,CMR10,,477,62
"The impact of the supernova shock waves on neutrino
ﬂavor evolution has been examined in several works over
the years [37–44]. The combined eﬀect of the collective
neutrino oscillations and the shock wave modiﬁcation
of MSW resonances was ﬁrst considered in Ref.
[43].
In this work, an interesting interplay between the two
features was pointed out for electron antineutrinos which
feel both eﬀects in the case of IH. This has observational
consequences for water-Cherenkov and liquid scintillator
experiments. However, no such interplay is to be expected",9,CMR10,,555,58
in the HALO signal: HALO is sensitive to the ﬂavor,9,CMR10,,50,50
"evolution of electron neutrinos only, and they are aﬀected
either by collective oscillations in the case of IH, or by the
shock wave modiﬁcation of MSW resonances in the case
of NH. This separation of eﬀects is one of the motivations
of the present study.",9,CMR10,,255,62
"Another motivation is the fact that HALO has an
adequate timing mechanism to look for dynamical eﬀects
in a supernova. It has a time resolution of about 200",9,CMR10,,156,54

"Our treatment covers neither the dynamical aspects of
neutrino ﬂavor evolution nor the time dependent features
of the supernova neutrino signal fully. As for the dynami-
cal ﬂavor evolution, we leave out the multiangle nature
of the collective neutrino oscillations: we treat the depen-
dence of the neutrino-neutrino interactions on the angle
between the neutrinos [47] in an eﬀective way using the
so-called",9,CMR10,,409,60

[27]. The multiangle eﬀects,9,CMR10,,27,27
"are expected to delay the onset of collective oscillations
but leave its general features intact for the type of initial
spectra that we consider [48]. We also do not take the
time evolution of the proto-neutron star itself into account
as is done, for example, in Ref. [26]. In reality, the radius
of the proto-neutron star, and the energy distributions of
the emitted neutrinos slightly change during the cooling
period. See, for example, Refs.
[35, 36]. Our purpose
in leaving out this important feature is to isolate and
examine the other time dependent features mentioned

"In this paper, we calculated the event rates in a lead-
based detector due to a galactic core-collapse supernova.
We paid particular attention to the time dependence of
the reaction rates due to the ﬂavor evolution of neutri-
nos through time dependent conditions in the supernova.
In particular, we focused on the changing character of
collective neutrino oscillations due to the decreasing neu-
trino luminosity, and the propagation of the shock wave
through the MSW region.",9,CMR10,,476,59
"For this purpose, we formed a one-dimensional super-
nova model by superimposing a parametric shock wave on
a progenitor density distribution which models SN1987A.
We considered four diﬀerent models in this setting. These
models have the same neutrino luminosities (which is
consistent with SN1987A) but the initial neutrino energy
distributions are diﬀerent. In models I-III, we kept the",9,CMR10,,388,57

"average energies for all ﬂavors, which are far-fetched but
not completely ruled out [53, 66].",9,CMR10,,93,58
"For all models, we ﬁnd that the sharpness of spectral
splits decrease with time in the IH case. Since neutrinos
do not go through high MSW resonance, this is the only
source of time dependence in IH. However, we ﬁnd that
the resulting eﬀect on reaction rates is limited because loss
of sharpness becomes noticeable only when the neutrino
luminosity drops considerably.",9,CMR10,,368,61
"In the case of NH, neutrinos are not aﬀected by collec-
tive oscillations but go though the high MSW resonance.
In this case, the passage of the shock wave through the
high MSW region is the only source of time dependence.
Initially neutrinos experience only one high resonance
but after the shock wave passes through this region, they
start going through three high resonances. We ﬁnd that
the eﬀects of the ﬁrst two resonances mostly cancel each
other, and the adiabaticity is only temporarily lost. For
this reason, the resulting eﬀect on the reaction rates is
also limited.",9,CMR10,,577,57
"All reaction rates decrease roughly exponentially as
the neutrino luminosity drops. The ratio of 1n to 2n",9,CMR10,,105,52
"event rates is the best parameter to work with because
it is independent of this overall decrease. We ﬁnd that
this ratio changes slightly with time due to the above-
mentioned eﬀects. In the case of IH, it slightly decreases
with time. In the case of NH, it is initially constant, but
later it changes as the shock wave passes through the high
MSW resonance region. This eﬀect is similar to the one
observed in Ref. [43] for the electron antineutrino signal
in water-Cherenkov detectors in the case of IH. However,
in all the models that we looked at, the change is limited",9,CMR10,,574,59
"to a few percent. Therefore, it is likely to be lost within",9,CMR10,,59,59

that we intentionally left out in this paper. Our purpose
was to isolate the time dependence resulting from the",9,CMR10,,164,57
"dynamical ﬂavor evolution of neutrinos outside the proto-
neutron star. We also left out the multiangle nature of
the collective neutrino oscillations. The multiangle eﬀects
delay the appearance of collective eﬀects. They may also
introduce angular decoherence and cause spectral splits
to be less sharp, or even wash them out completely. For
