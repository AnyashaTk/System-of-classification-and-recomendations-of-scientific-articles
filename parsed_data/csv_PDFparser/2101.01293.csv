INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"Resolved stellar photometry has the potential to con-
strain fundamental processes in astrophysics, including",9,CMR10,,109,55
"star formation, stellar evolution, feedback into the in-
terstellar medium, galaxy formation and evolution, and
chemical enrichment. The stars themselves are the fos-
sil record of these processes, which leave signatures in
the properties of individual stars, their mass distribu-",9,CMR10,,280,56
"tion, their distribution of colors and magnitudes, and
their spatial distribution with respect to other galactic
tracers.",9,CMR10,,121,57
While Gaia is transforming our understanding of the,9,CMR10,,51,51
"stars and structure of the Milky Way disk (Gaia Collab-
oration et al. 2018), we still need comparably detailed
population studies of other disks to put our Galaxy and
its stellar populations in context. The best targets for",9,CMR10,,224,56
2,9,CMR10,,1,1
"such studies are the galaxies in the Local Group, which
contains two spirals other than the Milky Way — M31,
a “green valley” Sb galaxy, and M33, a blue sequence,
star-forming dwarf spiral. Along with the Milky Way,
these two galaxies form our best anchors for baryonic
processes in spiral galaxies. This set of three galaxies
spans a large dynamic range, giving ample opportunities
for contrasting how astrophysical processes are shaped
by other parameters. For example, both M31 and the
Galaxy are of similar mass and metallicity (Watkins
et al. 2010; Gregersen et al. 2015), but M31 seems to
have a much more dramatic recent merger history (e.g.,
Hammer et al. 2018; D’Souza & Bell 2018; Kruijssen
et al. 2019).",9,CMR10,,714,56
"In contrast to both of these more massive partners,
M33 is of lower mass and metallicity, and appears to
have a relatively quiescent merger history, as suggested",9,CMR10,,161,56
"by its inside-out growth (Magrini et al. 2007; Williams
et al. 2009; Beasley et al. 2015; Mostoghiu et al. 2018)
and lack of a signiﬁcant extended stellar halo (Mc-
Connachie et al. 2010; McMonigal et al. 2016) or promi-
nent thick disk (Wyse 2002; van der Kruit & Freeman
2011). Thus, M33 probes a diﬀerent set of physical
and chemical evolution properties than the other Lo-
cal Group disk galaxies, and we can constrain these
in exquisite detail through measurements of M33’s con-
stituent stars.",9,CMR10,,499,56
"Along with M31, previously surveyed with HST as
part of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury
(PHAT, Dalcanton et al. 2012), M33 is one of the richest
galaxies in the Local Group for obtaining photometric
measurements of resolved stars in a spiral galaxy. It is
close enough that we can resolve stars all the way down
to the ancient main sequence (Williams et al. 2009) over
much of the disk. All of its stars are at the same distance
and foreground extinction, alleviating issues related to
the wide range of distances and extinctions of stars in",9,CMR10,,552,59
"the Galaxy. Furthermore, M33 has no well-established
signiﬁcant bulge component beyond its nuclear cluster
(McLean & Liu 1996; Kormendy & McClure 1993), and
at most a weak pseudobulge or bar (Regan & Vogel 1994;
Minniti et al. 1993; Stephens & Frogel 2002; Corbelli &
Walterbos 2007), meaning that there is little confusion
between disk and bulge populations.",9,CMR10,,359,55
"The metallicity gradient in M33 is well known, and
has been measured many times with planetary nebulae
and HII regions (e.g., Cioni et al. 2008; Rosolowsky &
Simon 2008; Magrini et al. 2009, 2010; Bresolin et al.",9,CMR10,,212,54

estimates of star formation rate and constraints on the
evolution of massive stars (e.g., Madore et al. 1974;
Humphreys & Sandage 1980; Massey et al. 1996, and
many others). The bright stars that can be resolved
from the ground were ﬁnally fully cataloged by Massey
et al. (2006), and its extended halo was probed by the
Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS; Mc-
Connachie et al. 2010). More recent ground-based work
focuses on the variability of these massive stars to fur-
ther constrain their complex evolutionary stages (e.g.,
Gordon et al. 2016; Humphreys et al. 2017; Smith et al.

"25. These culling parameters were found
to have the best balance of removing a high fraction
of sources outside of color-magnitude diagram (CMD)
features while keeping a very high fraction of total mea-
surements. Thus, they lean towards inclusive to avoid
over-culling the data, at the expense of allowing a larger
fraction of less certain measurements and contaminants.
We show the results of the above cuts on the CMD
in Figure 8, where the stars that pass the metric
make a CMD with well-deﬁned, well-populated features,
whereas the rejected stars form a relatively featureless
cloud of points. However, there is always some risk in
excluding important individual detections that did not",9,CMR10,,691,58
"produce high-quality PSF ﬁts, such as bright stars in
clusters. Thus, we include in our catalog all measure-
ments, but we add a ﬂag column to each band indicating
whether it passes. This method allows the user to search
the full catalog for speciﬁc source, but also allows one to
easily look at populations without being distracted by
artefacts. For science cases that require a very clean

"In general, the highest impact of any metric on the
culling of the data is the signal-to-noise ratio, which
culls 100% of the the measurements fainter than the
detection limit in each band. However, in the IR, the
quality metrics greatly reduce the amount of scatter in
the CMD features at the faint end, as demonstrated by
the low fraction of passing measurements up to 2 mag-
nitudes brighter than the detection limit in F160W in
the crowded central regions. This diﬀerence is mainly
attributable to the lower spatial resolution in the IR,
which increases the impact of crowding, making more
unreliable measurements that fall outside of the main
features of the CMD.",9,CMR10,,668,55

In con-
trast, the PHAT and PHATTER observations in the UV

UV observations reach F275W

pected for photon-limited images, whereas for the opti-
cal, the depth changes by

the inner to outer disk, reﬂecting the role that stellar
crowding plays in setting the detection limit. In addi-
tion, the variation in completeness with magnitude (Fig-
ure 17) is qualitatively diﬀerent in the photon-limited",9,CMR10,,897,60

magnitude (",9,CMR10,,108,53

by crowding several magnitudes before the magnitude at
which they disappear from the catalog. The slow roll-oﬀ
in completeness is the result (in part) of increasing odds
that a star will fail the quality cuts with the increasing
likelihood of it blending with a star of comparable ﬂux.
As with completeness, photometric uncertainties re-
ﬂect impacts from both photon-counting uncertainties
and crowding. There are multiple contributors to pho-
tometric uncertainty and bias in crowded-ﬁeld photom-
etry beyond the well-known impact of photon-counting
statistics for the source and sky. These eﬀects include
uncertainties and biases from deblending of neighbors
and sky estimation, as well as brightward biases from
blending with undetected sources (which also increases
the chance of detection). These eﬀects are captured well",9,CMR10,,868,58
"by artiﬁcial star tests, though other systematic eﬀects
due to CTE or imperfect PSF models will remain. These
various drivers of uncertainty and bias — crowding, ex-
posure time, and background — all vary among ﬁlters
and cameras, and thus will have diﬀerent behavior in
each.",9,CMR10,,276,55

tometric uncertainties (typically by a factor of 2-4) at
all but the very faintest limits, where very few sources",9,CMR10,,324,56
would be recovered at all. At a ﬁxed magnitude in the,9,CMR10,,53,53
"optical or NIR bands, the biases and uncertainties are
larger in regions with higher source densities, due to
the higher crowding.
In the optical and NIR bands,
as sources become intrinsically fainter, their measured
ﬂuxes tend to be biased towards brighter magnitudes,
due to unresolved, overlapping sources boosting the in-
serted artiﬁcial star above the detection limit. These ef-
fects are somewhat more pronounced in the NIR, most
likely due to the camera’s larger pixels and longer wave-
lengths producing lower resolution images (see Figure 6)
and thus larger impacts due to crowding. No corrections
for these biases have been made to the catalog.",9,CMR10,,655,58
"In the UV, the trend of increasing bias and uncer-
tainty for fainter sources is similar to what is seen in the
optical and the NIR. However, the variations with UV
magnitude are largely independent of local source den-
sity, reﬂecting the lack of signiﬁcant crowding except at
the very highest density in F336W. Another notable dif-
ference is in the sign of the bias. Well before complete-",9,CMR10,,391,60
"ness begins to decline signiﬁcantly, the bias begins to
become substantial, but has the opposite sign as seen in
the optical and NIR, such that measurements seem to be
biased signiﬁcantly faint. The eﬀect appears most con-
sistent with a slightly high background measurement,
since the bias induced from high sky subtraction would
be very small for bright sources, and increase for fainter
source, as we see in the NUV photometry. A similar
trend was seen in the W14 PHAT photometry study,
and the speculation was that perhaps charge transfer
eﬃciency (CTE) eﬀects were causing the sky brightness",9,CMR10,,596,58
"to be overestimated. However, in this work we have
used pre-ﬂashed, CTE-corrected UVIS images, which
should have reduced CTE eﬀects on the sky brightness.
Nonetheless, it is clear that our technique is likely at-",9,CMR10,,212,57

RESULTS,9,CMR10,,7,7
"Tables 5 and 6 provide samples of the photometry
catalog and AST results from the survey. The cata-
log included here contains the positions, magnitudes,
signal-to-noise ratio, and data quality ﬂag for each de-
tected star. While this table contains all of the stars
detected and measured by DOLPHOT, not all of those
measurements are likely to be stars in M33 with reli-
able photometry. To simplify the use of this version of
the catalog, we have supplied a ﬂag column (GST) for
each band, which is set to “T” for sources that pass our",9,CMR10,,537,56
"quality checks detailed in Section 2.2.4, and to “F” for
sources that do not. If a source has a T in any band,
it is likely to be a real star in M33. However, it still
may have “F” ﬂags in other bands, which indicates that
the star was not reliably measured in that band. Only
sources with “F” values in all bands are unlikely to be
stars in M33.",9,CMR10,,346,56
"Many of the stars in our catalog, as for a large fraction
of stars, are likely to be binary systems (e.g., Niu et al.
2020). At the distance of M33, we are not able to resolve
binary stars, so that our photometry contains the light
of both members. However, the impact of binary stars
varies by phase of stellar evolution. Many of the stars
in our catalog are red giants, which is a short-lived and
very bright phase of stellar evolution in the life of a rela-
tively low-mass star. The binary companions of almost
all of these stars are not in their red giant phase and
are faint low mass stars contributing insigniﬁcantly to
the measured ﬂux. In contrast, the more massive stars
that make up the bright main-sequence are more likely
to have bright companions of similar mass (e.g., Kobul-
nicky & Fryer 2007). The companions of these stars will",9,CMR10,,846,61
