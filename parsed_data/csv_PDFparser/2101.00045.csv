model has to assume, rather than predict, the mass loss
rate and temperature of the outﬂow. Moreover, 1D mod-
els are unable to capture the full orbital dynamics and
cannot produce a comet-like tail. The alternative model
is the EVaporating Exoplanets code (EVE; see Bourrier

"Our numerical simulation suite was described in de-
tail in Paper I. For a brief re-cap, our simulation is car-
ried in 3D with gravity of both the host star and the
planet, and the eﬀects of orbital motion including cen-
trifugal and Coriolis forces. Our code computes ray-
tracing radiative transfer and non-equilibrium thermo-
chemistry simultaneously with hydrodynamics. For sim-
plicity, we assume circular orbit and that the planet
is tidally locked, adopting a co-rotating planet-centric
frame. We focus on the upper layer of the atmosphere,
including a quasi-isothermal layer assumed to have equi-
librium temperature, and an outﬂowing region irradi-
ated by high-energy photons. The boundary conditions
are set so that the observed mass and transit radius of
the planet can be reproduced. We describe the high-
energy spectral energy distribution (SED) of the host
star with 6 characteristic energy bins: (1) 2 eV for the",9,CMR10,,930,59

For stellar winds, although realistic patterns of stellar

approach here. The stellar wind is injected as a hydro-

centered at the host star, and (2) a headwind due to

set to be equivalent to the orbital velocity of the planet.",9,CMR10,,273,59
"The regions of interactions between the stellar wind
and the planet outﬂow are illustrated by Figure 1. De-
pending on whether the velocity already becomes su-
personic before being decelerated and deﬂected by the
impinging stellar wind, a ﬂuid element in the planet out-
ﬂow should go through the sonic critical surface twice
