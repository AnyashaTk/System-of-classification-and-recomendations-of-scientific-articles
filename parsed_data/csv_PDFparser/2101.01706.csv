INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"Over the last few years, we have made signiﬁcant
progress towards developing a comprehensive and self-
consistent model for the formation of galaxies. At each",9,CMR10,,158,55
"step, however, the model is compounded by non-linear
eﬀects regarding the feedback processes involved and the
parameters deriving them. Gas accretion from the inter-
galactic medium (IGM) supplies cold gas for a galaxy to",9,CMR10,,221,56

Chartab et al.,9,CMCSC10,,14,14
"build up its stellar population through the gravitational
collapse of molecular clouds. As the stars form, heavy
elements are produced in their hot cores, resulting in
the chemically enriched material which will be expelled
to the interstellar medium (ISM) through feedback pro-
cesses such as stellar winds (Garnett 2002; Brooks et al.
2007) and/or supernovae explosions (e.g., Steidel et al.
2010; Martin et al. 2012; Chisholm et al. 2018). Fur-
thermore, feedback processes can remove part of the en-
riched material from galaxies into the IGM (e.g., Heck-
man et al. 1990; Tremonti et al. 2004; Chisholm et al.
2018). Thus, gas-phase metallicity is expected to be con-
nected with most of the galaxy evolutionary processes
(e.g., gas inﬂow/outﬂow and star formation) and can
be considered as one of the fundamental characteristics
of galaxies that encodes information regarding galaxy
evolution over cosmic time.",9,CMR10,,916,57
"A tight correlation has been observed between the gas-
phase metallicity and stellar mass of galaxies (Mass-
Metallicity Relation, hereafter MZR) out to",9,CMR10,,152,54

such that galaxies with lower stellar masses have lower
metallicities (e.g., Tremonti et al. 2004; Erb et al. 2006;
Mannucci et al. 2009; Finkelstein et al. 2011; Steidel
et al. 2014; Sanders et al. 2015, 2020). Moreover, it has
been found that the MZR evolves with redshift so that
galaxies at a given stellar mass have lower metallicity
at high redshifts (e.g., Steidel et al. 2014; Maiolino &
Mannucci 2019; Sanders et al. 2020).",9,CMR10,,435,59
∼,9,CMSY10,,1,1
"Although a tight correlation has been found between
stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity spanning a wide
range of stellar masses, other physical properties of
galaxies could also play a role in contributing to the ob-
served scatter in this relation. For example, the star for-
mation rate (SFR) in galaxies controls their metallicity.
At a given stellar mass, galaxies with lower SFR have
higher metallicities (e.g., Mannucci et al. 2010; Sanders
et al. 2018). Gas accretion from the IGM adds chemi-",9,CMR10,,502,59
"cally poor gas into the ISM of galaxies, which lowers the
galaxy’s gas-phase metallicity. On the other hand, cold
gas infall that provides additional fuel for star formation
increases the SFR. Therefore, cold gas accretion changes
the metallicity content of the ISM in a complicated way.
Lilly et al. (2013) introduced a gas regulator model that
expresses the gas-phase metallicity of a galaxy in terms
of the properties of the accreted gas (metallicity and
rate of infalling gas) and SFR. Their model explains
the observationally-conﬁrmed dependence of the MZR
on SFR.",9,CMR10,,569,59
"However, the evolution of the ISM and its metal con-
tent does, to a large extent, depend on the properties
of the infalling gas which, in turn, is aﬀected by the en-
vironment where the galaxy resides (Peng & Maiolino",9,CMR10,,218,58

accretion, massive galaxies exhaust their remaining gas
reservoirs in shorter timescales compared to low mass

the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their En-

"distributions can result in diﬀerent average metallicities.
This diﬀerence can be misinterpreted as an environmen-
tal imprint on the MZR. Therefore, before proceeding
to a discussion of our results, in the next section, we
ﬁrst perform an analysis on a mass-controlled sample of
galaxies where we carefully match the stellar mass dis-
tribution of galaxies in diﬀerent environments and ﬁnd
the composite spectra for the mass-controlled sample.
This allows us to properly disentangle the eﬀect of stellar
mass from the local environment, providing an unbiased

In the studies regarding the environmental depen-
