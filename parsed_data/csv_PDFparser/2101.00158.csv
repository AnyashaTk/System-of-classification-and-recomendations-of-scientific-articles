issue in astronomy, because the Sun is deeply embedded in the
Galactic plane, resulting in the superposition of multiple struc-
tures along the observed line-of-sight. The copious dust extinc-
tion makes the situation even worse. In the 1950s, substantial
progress in regards to tracing the spiral arm segments in the so-
lar neighborhood was ﬁrst made by Morgan et al. (1952, 1953)
with optically selected high-mass stars (OB stars). Later on, the
early H",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,461,65

decipher the morphology of the Galaxy spiral arms (e.g., see Xu",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,161,63
"et al. 2018a; Shen & Zheng 2020, for reviews). There is a general
consensus that a global spiral pattern exists in the Galactic disk

of arms are still debated.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,89,62
"Measuring the distances as accurately as possible for many
spiral tracers would be the key to settle the disputes. Through
measuring the trigonometric parallax of masers in high-mass star
formation regions, the VLBI has achieved a revolutionary break-
through in the spiral structure of the Milky Way (Xu et al. 2006).
The VLBI can now obtain parallax accuracies down to a few",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,376,66

for about 200 high-mass star formation regions have been mea-

spiral structure that has recently been proposed by Reid et al.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,320,65

to spiral arms, a rather large portion of the B2-type stars born
in spiral arms would already have migrated far from the birth
sites. In comparison, the lifetimes of B0-type stars are less than
about ten million years, only some of them could leave the spiral
arms where they were born. As shown in the right panel of Fig.1,
