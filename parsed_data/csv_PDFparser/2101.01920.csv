"Table 3 describes the different sources of noise as ob-

major offender to the sensitivity is the high sky level,
mostly due to the moon-scattered light, as discussed
in Section 4.1. Because of the very short turnover
wind period, launch opportunities are scarce and can
occur very close to the full moon, as it happened in
2018. A launch far from full moon phase will always
be preferable, but stray light mitigation has to be suf-
