caping ionizing radiation from high redshift galaxies may only be
visible in a very small wavelength range and this behaviour will
be diﬃcult to capture and interpret from photometric observations,
but will be seen clearly in spectroscopy. As a caveat, however, we
note that, without ancillary, high spatial resolution, space-based
photometric data, it can be diﬃcult to rule out the possibility of
low redshift contamination from ground-based spectroscopic LyC
detections (Vanzella et al. 2010, 2012).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,542,66

the potential for detecting large samples of LyC emitting galaxies

when compared to spectroscopy is that photometry is signiﬁcantly
more sensitive (i.e. deeper) for the same exposure time. Further-
more, in the case of space-based LyC detections, ancillary data is
not necessary to rule out the possibility of low redshift contamina-
tion. Photometric LyC surveys must be performed in well studied
ﬁelds in which targeted galaxies already have accurate photometric
redshift estimates (e.g. ZFOURGE ﬁelds Straatman et al. 2016) or,
ideally, secure spectroscopic redshifts (e.g. 3DHST, DEIMOS10K,",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,744,68
