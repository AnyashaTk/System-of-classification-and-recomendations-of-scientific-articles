ABSTRACT,9,CMR10,,8,8
"Using a 3D global solver of the linearized Euler equations, we model acoustic oscillations over back-
ground velocity ﬂow ﬁelds of single-cell meridional circulation with deep and shallow return ﬂows as
well as a double-cell meridional circulation proﬁle. The velocities are generated using a mean-ﬁeld
hydrodynamic and dynamo model – moving through the regimes with minimal parameter changes;
counter-rotation near the base of the tachocline is induced by sign inversion of the non-diﬀusive action
of turbulent Reynolds stresses (Λ-eﬀect) due to the radial inhomogeneity of the Coriolis number. By
mimicking the stochastic excitation of resonant modes in the convective interior, we simulate real-
ization noise present in solar observations. Using deep-focusing to analyze diﬀerences in travel-time
signatures between the three regimes, as well as comparing to solar observations, we show that current
helioseismology techniques may oﬀer important insights about the location of the return ﬂow, how-
ever, that it may not be possible to deﬁnitively distinguish between proﬁles of single-cell or double-cell
meridional circulation.",9,CMR10,,1132,106

INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"Meridional mass ﬂows are characterized by large circulation structures, redistributing angular momentum and mag-
netic ﬂux (Hathaway et al. 2003) throughout the convective interior of the Sun. Doppler measurements have been used
to study the surface expressions of these circulation cells in detail (Duvall 1979; Hathaway 1996; Ulrich 2010), showing",9,CMR10,,349,120

of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) (Domingo et al. 1995), its successor – the Helioseismic Magnetic
Imager (HMI) (Scherrer et al. 2012) aboard the Solar Data Observatory (SDO) spacecraft (Pesnell et al. 2012), as well
as the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) (Harvey et al. 1996) have been instrumental in providing the long
term observational data needed to analyze these structures.",9,CMR10,,484,117
"Applying techniques in local helioseismology to these observations allows us to probe below the solar surface

(2007); Hathaway (2012) respectively). The nature of the single-cell model has also been put into question with a
helioseismic analysis of HMI data (Zhao et al. 2013; Chen 2019) inferring a two-cell structure – a result whose viability
has been validated by numerical, convectively driven, MHD/HD simulations (Brun & Toomre 2002; Miesch et al. 2006;
Guerrero et al. 2013; Matilsky et al. 2019). Recent analysis of MDI and GONG data, however, continues to insist
on the single-cell model (Gizon et al. 2020) – typically employed by mean-ﬁeld simulations of the Sun (Rempel 2005;
Hotta & Yokoyama 2011; K¨uker et al. 2011; Kitchatinov 2013) and other late-type stars (Kitchatinov & Olemskoy
2012).",9,CMR10,,725,121
"The transition between single- and double-cell circulation structures has been explored in conjunction with anti-Solar
and Solar proﬁles of diﬀerential rotation in the convectively driven hydrodynamic models of Guerrero et al. (2013);
Gastine et al. (2014); K¨apyl¨a et al. (2014); Featherstone & Miesch (2015). These simulations highlight the impact
of angular momentum transport by non-diﬀusive turbulent Reynolds stresses via gyroscopic pumping (the Λ-eﬀect,
Ruediger (1989); Kichatinov & Rudiger (1993)). Mean-ﬁeld modeling has shown that altering this parameter (Λ)

"& Kosovichev (2018) demonstrating that radial variations of the Coriolis number near the tachocline can be a potential
physical basis for inducing a sign inversion in Λ.",9,CMR10,,169,118
"In this paper, we employ the GALE (Global Acoustic Linearized Euler) code (Stejko et al. 2021), simulating the
propagation of acoustic waves through shallow and deep single-cell, as well as double-cell regimes of meridional back-
ground ﬂows – generated by the mean-ﬁeld non-linear hydrodynamic and dynamo models of Pipin & Kosovichev (2018,
2019). These models allow us to examine the helioseismic signatures generated by each regime, as well as oﬀering a
baseline for the low-end of variance in travel-time measurements that characterize shallow single-cell and double-cell
meridional circulation – generated by minimal parameter changes near the base of the tachocline. Previous conclu-
sions on the nature of meridional circulation circulation structure have been inferred with the aid of ad-hoc models
(Zhao et al. 2013; Chen 2019; Hartlep et al. 2013; Gizon et al. 2020); we hope that a forward-modeling approach to
examining velocity proﬁles generated by mean-ﬁeld models will lend important insights into observations made with
current helioseismology techniques.",9,CMR10,,1071,118

"The question on the nature of meridional circulation remains an outstanding one. Large variations in inferences
have been made using similar local helioseismology techniques – from a double-cell meridional circulation proﬁle seen
in HMI observations (Zhao et al. 2013; Chen 2019) to recent re-assertions of a single cell proﬁle from MDI/GONG
data (Gizon et al. 2020). The feasibility of the two regimes has been explored in recent years, with convectively driven
MHD and HD models reproducing the necessary environment for both.",9,CMR10,,528,120
"The actual diﬀerences may lie somewhere in between the large variations inferred in the two models. To that end
we test the feasibly of discerning between deep and shallow single-cell as well as double-cell proﬁles of meridional
circulation, generated by the same mean-ﬁeld model, operating with minimal parameter changes (K1 in Pipin &
Kosovichev (2018) – referred to as M2 in their paper; M1 & M2 in Pipin & Kosovichev (2019)). Using the GALE code
(Stejko et al. 2021) to simulate the stochastic excitation of acoustic modes throughout the convective interior, we apply
the deep focusing method to measure the resulting travel-time diﬀerences. Analyzing the proﬁles of realization noise
generated by the model shows that the maximal diﬀerences between a shallow single-cell and double-cell regime fall well
within one standard deviation of error for both phase-speed ﬁltered and unﬁltered deep-focusing measurements. The
deep single-cell proﬁle (K1), however, shows enough diﬀerences to be distinguishable from the two other models (M1
& M2). Comparing the resulting proﬁles to a decade of solar observations shows that while any deﬁnitive statements
on the prevalence of either a single- or double-cell regime should be taken with a grain of salt, meaningful conclusions",9,CMR10,,1273,121
on the nature of the return ﬂow are within the reach of current techniques in helioseismology.,9,CMR10,,94,94
