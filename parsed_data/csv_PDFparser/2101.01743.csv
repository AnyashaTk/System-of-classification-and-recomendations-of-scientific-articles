INTRODUCTION,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,12,12
"Blazars are a sub-class of radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
with a relativistic jet pointing close to our line of sight. These
objects have a highly variable spectrum and Ô¨Çaring states, periods
of enhanced activity on time scales that can go from hours to months.
This variability makes it extremely diÔ¨Écult to model the broad-band",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,338,69
spectral energy distribution (SED) of these sources.,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,52,52
"Leptonic models have been used for many years to Ô¨Åt the SEDs
from blazars (see, for example, Bloom & Marscher (1996); Tavec-
chio et al. (1998); Sahayanathan & Godambe (2012); Aleksiƒá et al.
(2015b)). These models consider a population of relativistic elec-
trons to be responsible for the characteristic two peaked SED of a
blazar. In this approach, the Ô¨Årst peak (covering radio to X-rays)
can be explained by synchrotron emission; meanwhile, the second
peak (X-rays and gamma rays) may be composed of diÔ¨Äerent con-
tributions coming from inverse Compton interactions between the
electrons and a photon Ô¨Åeld. One option is synchrotron-self Comp-
ton contributions (SSC) coming from the emission region inside the
jet (Maraschi et al. 1992; Dermer & Schlickeiser 1993; Sikora et al.
1994; Bloom & Marscher 1996; Tavecchio et al. 1998); another op-

contribution are obtained in the last 4 days of the Ô¨Çare. In a more
complex hadronic scenario, besides the photo-pion production,
there is gamma-ray radiation emitted by proton-synchrotron cooling
and the synchrotron radiation of the secondary charged particles.
These hadronically induced gamma rays are usually in competi-
tion with synchrotron and inverse Compton photons radiated by
primary electrons considered in the usual leptonic model (Rachen
& M√©sz√°ros 1998). On some days the hadronic component could
be dominant at VHE and then followed by a dominant SSC lep-
tonic component. If the proton injection occurs randomly, there is
no preferred time for this to happened during the Ô¨Çare. The in-",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,766,67
