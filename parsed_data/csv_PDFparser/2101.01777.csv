INTRODUCTION,8,CMB10,,12,12
"Neutral hydrogen existing in the intergalactic medium
(IGM) prior to the completion of the process of reionization
produces radio signal at the intrinsic wavelength of 21 cm.
The intensity of this signal depends on the radiative outputs
of the ﬁrst stars and galaxies as well as on the cosmological
parameters (e.g., Madau et al. 1997; Barkana 2018; Mesinger
2019). Owing to these dependencies, observations of the red-
shifted 21 cm signal with interferometers such as the Square
