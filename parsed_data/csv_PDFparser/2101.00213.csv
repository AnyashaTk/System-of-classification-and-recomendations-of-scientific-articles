1 INTRODUCTION,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,14,14
"Rigorous three-dimensional (3D) simulations of neutrino-driven
core-collapse supernovae have become highly successful in recent
years (e.g., Melson et al. 2015; Lentz et al. 2015; Takiwaki et al.
2014; Burrows et al. 2019), and have made clear headway in explain-
ing the properties of supernova explosions and the compact objects
born in these events (Müller et al. 2017; Müller et al. 2019; Burrows
et al. 2020; Powell & Müller 2020; Bollig et al. 2020; Müller 2020).

"A number of ingredients have contributed, or have the potential
to contribute, to make modern neutrino-driven explosion models
more robust. Various microphysical eﬀects such as reduced neutrino
scattering opacities due to nucleon strangeness (Melson et al. 2015)
and nucleon correlations at high densities (Horowitz et al. 2017;
Bollig et al. 2017; Burrows et al. 2018), muonisation (Bollig et al.
2017), and large eﬀective nucleon masses (Yasin et al. 2020) can be
conducive to neutrino-driven shock revival.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,509,68

"The discovery of perturbation-aided explosions has greatly en-
hanced interest in multi-dimensional models of late convective burn-
ing stages in massive stars. Several studies have by now followed the
immediate pre-collapse phase of silicon and/or oxygen shell burning

long-standing strand of research since the 1990s (e.g., Bazan & Ar-
nett 1994; Bazán & Arnett 1997; Meakin & Arnett 2006, 2007b,a;

namics and ﬁnal nucleosynthesis yields of the subsequent supernova
explosion.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,283,71
"Three-dimensional simulations of convection during advanced
burning stages have so far largely disregarded two important aspects
of real stars – rotation and magnetic ﬁelds. The eﬀects of rotation
have been touched upon by the seminal work of Kuhlen et al. (2003),
but more recent studies (Arnett & Meakin 2010; Chatzopoulos et al.
2016) have been limited to axisymmetry (2D). Magnetohydrody-
namic (MHD) simulations of convection, while common and mature
in the context of the Sun (for a review see, e.g., Charbonneau 2014)
have yet to be performed for advanced burning stages of massive
stars.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,595,68
"Simulations of magnetoconvection during the late burning stages,
both in rotating and non-rotating stars, are a big desideratum for sev-
eral reasons. Even in slowly rotating massive stars, magnetic ﬁelds

nova core (Endeve et al. 2012; Müller & Varma 2020), it stands to
reason that memory of the initial ﬁelds may not be lost entirely, es-

better understanding of the interplay between convection, rotation,
and magnetic ﬁelds in supernova progenitors is even more critical
for the magnetorotational explosion scenario (e.g., Burrows et al.

initial ﬁeld strengths and geometry could have a signiﬁcant impact
on the development of magnetorotational explosions after collapse
(Bugli et al. 2020; Aloy & Obergaulinger 2020). Furthermore, our

sions (Woosley & Heger 2006; Yoon & Langer 2005; Yoon et al.

"Beyond the impact of magnetic ﬁelds on the pre-supernova evo-
lution and the supernova itself, the interplay of convection, rotation,
and magnetic ﬁelds is obviously relevant to the origin of neutron
star magnetic ﬁelds as well. It still remains to be explained what

burial (Viganò et al. 2013; Torres-Forné et al. 2016) and the long-
time evolution of magnetic ﬁelds (Aguilera et al. 2008; De Grandis
et al. 2020). Signiﬁcant obstacles need to be overcome until one can
construct a pipeline from 3D progenitor models to 3D supernova sim-
ulations and beyond. However, 3D MHD simulations of convective
burning can already address meaningful questions despite the com-
plexity of the overall problem. As in the purely hydrodynamic case,
the ﬁrst step must be to understand the principles governing mag-
netohydrodynamic convection during the late burning stages based
on somewhat idealised simulations that are broadly representative of
the conditions in convective cores and shells of massive stars.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,870,70
"In this study, we present a ﬁrst simulation of magnetoconvection
during the ﬁnal phase of oxygen shell burning using the ideal MHD
approximation. In the tradition of semi-idealised models of late-stage
convection, we use a setup that falls within the typical range of con-
ditions in the interiors of massive stars in terms of convective Mach
number and shell geometry (for an overview see Collins et al. 2018)
and is not designed as a fully self-consistent model of any one partic-
ular star. This simulation constitutes a ﬁrst step beyond eﬀective 1D
prescriptions in stellar evolution models to predict the magnetic ﬁeld
strength and geometry encountered in the inner shells of massive stars
at the pre-supernova stage. We also compare to a corresponding non-
magnetic model of oxygen shell convection to gauge the feedback
of magnetic ﬁelds on the convective ﬂow with a particular view to
two important issues. First, the eﬃciency of the “perturbation-aided”
neutrino-driven mechanism depends critically on the magnitude of
the convective velocities during shell burning, and it is important
to determine whether magnetic ﬁelds can signiﬁcantly slow down
convective motions as suggested by some recent simulations of solar
convection (Hotta et al. 2015). Second, magnetic ﬁelds could quanti-
tatively or qualitatively aﬀect shell growth by turbulent entrainment,
which has been consistently seen in all recent 3D hydrodynamics
simulations of late-stage convection in massive stars.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1485,71
"Our paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe the
numerical methods, progenitor model, and initial conditions used in
our study and discuss the potential role of non-ideal eﬀects . The
results of the simulations are presented in Section 3. We ﬁrst focus
on the strength and geometry of the emerging magnetic ﬁeld and then
analyse the impact of magnetic ﬁelds on the ﬂow, and in particular
on entrainment at shell boundaries. We summarize our results and
discuss their implications in Section 4.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,510,68

ILES approach that places the simulation into a “universal”, strongly
magnetised regime (Beresnyak 2019) thus appears plausible. More-

"For an attempt to quantify the numerical diﬀusivities, see, e.g., Rembi-
asz et al. (2017). One should emphasise, however, that that the concepts of
numerical and physical viscosity/resistivity must be carefully distinguished.
For one thing, the numerical viscosity and resistivity are problem-dependent
as stressed by Rembiasz et al. (2017). In the case of higher-order recon-
struction schemes, they are also scale-dependent (and hence more akin to
higher-order hyperdiﬀusivities), and they are aﬀected by discrete switches in
the reconstruction scheme and Riemann solver. Because of these subtleties,
the determination of the eﬀective (magnetic) Reynolds number of a simulation
is non-trivial (see Section 2.1.2 of Müller 2020).",7,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,731,77

self-limiting as a result of the stabilising impact of magnetic ﬁelds on

"by the inhibiting eﬀect of non-radial magnetic ﬁelds on shear insta-
bilities at shell boundaries, which appear to be the primary driver of
ﬁeld ampliﬁcation.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,158,70
"We ﬁnd that magnetic ﬁelds do not have an appreciable eﬀect
on the interior ﬂow inside the oxygen shell, but observe a moderate
reduction of turbulent entrainment at the oxygen-neon shell bound-
ary in the presence of magnetic ﬁelds. Magnetic ﬁelds appear to
suppress stronger episodic entrainment events, although they do not
quench entrainment completely. Through the reduced entrainment
rate, magnetic ﬁelds also indirectly aﬀect the dynamics inside the
convective region slightly because they reduce the energy release
through the dissociation of ingested neon, which results in slightly
smaller convective velocities in the MHD model.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,639,68
"Our ﬁndings have important implications for core-collapse su-
pernova modelling. We predict initial ﬁelds in the oxygen shell of
non-rotating progenitors that are signiﬁcantly stronger than assumed
in our recent simulation of a neutrino-driven explosion aided by
dynamo-generated magnetic ﬁelds (Müller & Varma 2020). With rel-
atively strong seed-ﬁelds, there is likely less of a delay until magnetic",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,401,73
ﬁelds can contribute the additional “boost” to neutrino heating and,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,67,67
"purely hydrodynamic instabilities seen in Müller & Varma (2020).
This should further contribute to the robustness of the neutrino-
driven mechanism for non-rotating and slowly-rotating massive stars.
Our simulations also suggest that the perturbation-aided mechanism
(Couch & Ott 2013; Müller & Janka 2015) will not be substantially
aﬀected by the inclusion of magnetic ﬁelds. Since magnetic ﬁelds do
not become strong enough to substantially alter the bulk ﬂow inside
the convective region, the convective velocities and eddy scales as
the key parameters for perturbation-aided explosions remain largely
unchanged.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,615,68
"The implications of our results for neutron star magnetic ﬁelds
are more diﬃcult to evaluate since the observable ﬁelds will, to a
large degree, be set by processes during and after the supernova and
cannot be simply extrapolated from the progenitor stage by magnetic
ﬂux conservation. That said, dipole ﬁelds of order 10",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,321,68

"G, it may prove diﬃ-
cult to produce neutron stars without strong small-scale ﬁelds at the
surface. There is a clear need for an integrated approach towards the
evolution of magnetic ﬁelds from the progenitor phase through the
supernova and into the compact remnant phase in order to fully grasp",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,295,69
the implications of the current simulations.,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,44,44
"Evidently, further follow-up studies are also needed on the ﬁnal
evolutionary phases of supernova progenitors. Longer simulations
and resolution studies will be required to better address issues like
the saturation ﬁeld strength, the saturation mechanism, and the impact
of magnetic ﬁelds on turbulent entrainment. Full models that include
the core and self-consistently follow the evolution of the star to
collapse will be required to generate accurate 3D initial conditions
for supernova simulations. The critical issue of non-ideal eﬀects and
the behaviour of turbulent magnetoconvection for magnetic Prandtl
numbers slightly smaller than one at very high Reynolds numbers
deserves particular consideration. Some ﬁndings of our “optimistic”
approach based on the ideal MHD approximation should, however,
prove robust, such as the modest eﬀect of magnetic ﬁelds on the
convective bulk ﬂow and hence the reliability of purely hydrodynamic
models (Couch et al. 2015; Müller et al. 2016; Yadav et al. 2020;
Müller 2020; Fields & Couch 2020) and even 1D mixing-length",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1065,70

dissociation of the entrained neon is delayed and spread out in time
as the entrained material is diluted and eventually mixed down to
regions of suﬃciently high temperature.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,300,68
"The overall eﬀect of magnetic ﬁelds on the bulk ﬂow is rather
modest. We do not see a similarly strong quenching of the convective
ﬂow by magnetic ﬁelds as in recent MHD simulations of the solar
convection zone (Hotta et al. 2015), who reported a reduction of
convective velocities by up to 50% at the base of the convection zone.
Such an eﬀect is not expected as long as the magnetic ﬁelds stay well
below kinetic equipartition in the interior of convective shells as in
our MHD simulation. Longer simulations will be required to conﬁrm
that magnetic ﬁelds during late shell burning stages indeed remain
“weak” by comparison and do not appreciably inﬂuence the bulk
dynamics of convection.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,690,70
