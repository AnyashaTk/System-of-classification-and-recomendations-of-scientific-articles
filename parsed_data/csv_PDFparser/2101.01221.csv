ABSTRACT,8,CMB10,,8,8
"Whether tidal disruption events (TDEs) circularise or accrete directly as a highly
eccentric disc is the subject of current research and appears to depend sensitively on
the disc thermodynamics. In a previous paper we applied the theory of eccentric discs",9,CMR10,,255,86

"prescription for the disc stress, which leads to solutions that",9,CMR10,,63,63
"exhibit extreme, potentially unphysical, behaviour. In this paper we further explore the
dynamical vertical structure of highly eccentric discs using alternative stress models
that are better motivated by the behaviour of magnetic ﬁelds in eccentric discs. We ﬁnd
that the presence of a coherent magnetic ﬁeld has a stabilising eﬀect on the dynamics
and can signiﬁcantly alter the behaviour of highly eccentric radiation dominated discs.
We conclude that magnetic ﬁelds are important for the evolution of TDE discs.",9,CMR10,,515,88

INTRODUCTION,8,CMB10,,12,12
"Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are transient phenomena
where an object on a nearly parabolic orbit passes within
the tidal radius and is disrupted by the tidal forces, typ-
ically a star being disrupted by a supermassive black hole
(SMBH). Bound material from the disruption forms a highly
eccentric disc, which in the classic TDE model of Rees (1988)
are rapidly circularised as the material returns to pericentre.
It has, however, been proposed that circularisation in TDEs
may be ineﬃcient resulting in the disc remaining highly ec-
centric (Guillochon et al. 2014; Piran et al. 2015; Krolik",8,CMR9,,594,63
"et al. 2016; Svirski et al. 2017). In Lynch & Ogilvie (2020)
(henceforth Paper I) we presented a hydrodynamical model
of these highly eccentric discs applied to TDEs where circu-
larisation is ineﬃcient.",8,CMR9,,203,60
"Two issues were highlighted in Paper I. One was con-
ﬁrming that radiation pressure dominated discs are ther-
mally unstable when the viscous stress scales with total pres-
sure in highly eccentric discs, a result that has long been
known for circular discs (Shakura & Sunyaev 1976; Pringle
1976; Piran 1978). Circular radiation pressure dominated
discs can be stabilised by assuming stress scales with gas
pressure (Meier 1979; Sakimoto & Coroniti 1981). For highly",8,CMR9,,466,62
"eccentric discs it appears that the thermal instability is still
present when stress scales with gas pressure; however there
exists a stable radiation pressure dominated branch which",8,CMR9,,182,64

"is the outcome of the thermal instability. For typical TDE
parameters, this branch is very hot and often violates the
thin-disc assumptions.",8,CMR9,,140,58
"The second issue was the extreme behaviour that can
occur during pericentre passage. For the radiation pressure
dominated disc where stress scales with gas pressure the so-
lution is nearly adiabatic and undergoes extreme compres-
sion near pericentre. In models where the viscous stresses
contribute to the dynamics we typically found that the ver-
tical viscous stress is comparable to or exceeds the (total)
pressure, which is possibly problematic for the",8,CMR9,,458,60

an order of magnitude, strongly violating the assumptions
of the",8,CMR9,,187,61

"In this paper we focus on the second of the two issues
by considering alternative turbulent stress models which are
better motivated by the physics of the underlying magnetic
ﬁeld to see if this resolves some of the extreme behaviour
seen in the",8,CMR9,,245,60

models are more thermally stable than the",8,CMR9,,89,47

model, may be important for regulating the extreme be-
haviour at pericentre. One is the ﬁnite response time of the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) (see for instance the
viscoelastic model of Ogilvie (2001) and discussion therein)",8,CMR9,,236,60
which means the viscous stress cannot respond instantly to,8,CMR9,,58,58

E. M. Lynch and G. I. Ogilvie,11,CMTI12,,29,29
"the rapid increase in pressure and velocity gradients dur-
ing pericentre passage, potentially weakening the viscous
stresses so they no longer exceed the pressure. Another is
the relative incompressibility of the magnetic ﬁeld, com-
pared with the radiation or the gas, with the magnetic pres-
sure providing additional support during pericentre passage
which could prevent the extreme compression seen in some
models.",8,CMR9,,419,60

"It was shown in Ogilvie & Proctor (2003) that for incom-
pressible ﬂuids there is an exact asymptotic correspondence
between MHD in the limit of large magnetic Reynolds num-
ber and viscoelastic ﬂuids (speciﬁcally an Oldroyd-B ﬂuid)
in the limit of large relaxation time. Ogilvie (2002) improved
upon the compressible viscoelastic model of Ogilvie (2000,",8,CMR9,,354,62
"2001) by including an isotropic part to the stress to model
the eﬀects of magnetic pressure and correcting the heating
rate so that total energy is conserved. Ogilvie (2003) pro-
posed solving for both the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses
and suggested a nonlinear closure model based on requiring
the turbulent stresses to exhibit certain properties (such as
positive deﬁniteness, and relaxation towards equipartition
and isotropy) known from simulations and experiments.",8,CMR9,,469,61
"Simulations of MRI in circular discs typically ﬁnd that
the magnetic pressure tends to saturate at about 10% of the
gas pressure. However in the local linear stability analysis
of Pessah & Psaltis (2005) the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld only
stabilises the MRI when it is highly suprathermal (speciﬁ-
cally when the Alfv´en speed is greater than the geometric
mean of the sound speed and the Keplerian speed). Das
et al. (2018) conﬁrmed this result persists in a global linear
eigenmode calculation. In light of this, Begelman & Pringle
(2007) have suggested that, for a strongly magnetised disc,
the viscous stress may scale with the magnetic pressure and
showed that such a disc would be thermally stable even when
radiation pressure dominates over gas pressure. Such a disc
was simulated by S",8,CMR9,,789,62

lapse be reversed without encountering unphysically strong
viscous stresses? An obvious possibility is the presence of a
large scale horizontal magnetic ﬁeld within the disc which
will resist vertical compression. Such a ﬁeld could be weak
for the majority of the orbit but, owing to the relative in-
compressibility of magnetic ﬁelds, become dynamically im-
portant during the maximum compression at pericentre. In

"Bonnerot et al. (2017). In these papers it was found that
the stretching of the ﬁelds during the disruption causes an
increase in the magnetic pressure from the ﬁeld aligned with
the orbital direction. Meanwhile the gas pressure and mag-
netic pressure from the ﬁeld perpendicular to the orbit drop.
Guillochon & McCourt (2017) found that this tends to re-
sult in the magnetic pressure from the parallel ﬁeld becoming
comparable to the gas pressure. Similar results were found
in Bonnerot et al. (2017), although with a dependence on
the initial ﬁeld direction. This supports our adopted ﬁeld
conﬁguration, with the vertical ﬁeld set to zero. As the ver-
tical ﬁeld does not contribute to the dynamics of the vertical
oscillator we can do so without loss of generality.",8,CMR9,,770,62

MAGNETIC FIELD,8,CMB10,,14,14
"The model considered in Section 4 has a number of draw-
backs. The ﬁrst is that the viscous stress and the coherent
magnetic ﬁeld are treated as separate physical eﬀects when
they are in fact intrinsically linked (although subsection 4.3
partially addresses this issue). Secondly, the turbulent mag-
netic ﬁeld, responsible for the eﬀective viscosity, cannot store
energy. Lastly the model neglects resistive eﬀects and, while
nonideal MHD eﬀects would be weak if the ﬂow were strictly
laminar, the turbulent cascade should always move magnetic
energy to scales on which nonideal eﬀects become important.
Thus the coherent magnetic ﬁeld should be aﬀected by some",8,CMR9,,662,64

so the possibility that the thermal instability is delayed in
the nonlinear-constitutive MRI model needs to be explored
using an alternative method.",8,CMR9,,395,62
"The possibility that the thermal instability stalls or is
delayed has some support from simulations looking at the
thermal stability of MRI active discs (Jiang et al. 2013;
Ross et al. 2017). In both these papers it was found that
the disc was quasi-stable, with thermal instability occur-
ring when a particularly large turbulent ﬂuctuation caused
a strong enough perturbation away from the equilibrium.
The (modiﬁed) Maxwell stress considered here is equal to
the expectation value of a modiﬁed Maxwell stress which is
stochastically forced by ﬂuctuation with amplitude propor-
tional to",8,CMR9,,589,58

"(see Equation E5 of Appendix E and discussion

thermal quasi-stability seen in Jiang et al. (2013) and Ross
et al. (2017) in some averaged sense. The possibility that the",8,CMR9,,232,62
"thermal instability is delayed or slowed is particularly rele-

if the timescale for thermal runaway is made long enough

6.1 Stability of the solutions,8,CMB10,,30,30
"As discussed in Paper I, one advantage of our solution
method is that the solutions it ﬁnds are typically nonlin-
ear attractors (or at least long lived transients) and so are
stable against (nonlinear) perturbations to the solution vari-
ables (",8,CMR9,,246,62

such perturbations to damp on the thermal time or faster.

"For the ideal induction equation model, our method
cannot tell us about the stability of the solution to pertur-
bations to the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld. Showing this would
require a separate linear stability analysis. Perturbations to
the vertical ﬁeld typically have no inﬂuence on the dynamics",8,CMR9,,296,62
of the disc vertical structure.,8,CMR9,,31,31
"However, for the constitutive model, perturbations to
the magnetic ﬁeld are encapsulated in perturbations to",8,CMR9,,108,54
M,8,CMMI9,,1,1

"so these solutions are stable against (large scale) pertur-
bations to the magnetic ﬁeld. This is most likely because,
unlike the ideal induction equation, dissipation acts on the
magnetic ﬁeld.",8,CMR9,,194,60
"Our solution method doesn’t tell us about the stability
of our solutions to short wavelength (comparable or less than
the scale height) perturbations to our system. So our disc
structure could be unstable to such perturbations. Like the
hydrodynamic solutions in Paper I, it is likely our discs are",8,CMR9,,298,61
"unstable to the parametric instability (Papaloizou 2005a,b;
Wienkers & Ogilvie 2018; Barker & Ogilvie 2014; Pierens

"Lastly reconnection sites can accelerate charged parti-
cles. We would therefore expect that TDEs in which there is
a line of sight to the pericentre should include a ﬂux of high-
energy particles. From most look angles the line of sight to
the pericentre “bright point” will be blocked (see also Zanazzi
& Ogilvie (2020)). This will both block the X-ray ﬂux from
the disc and any particles accelerated by reconnection in the
nozzle. Hence these high energy particles should only be seen
in X-ray bright TDEs.",8,CMR9,,509,63

"1) The coherent magnetic ﬁeld in both models has a sta-

collapse at pericentre without the presumably unphysically
strong viscous stresses seen in some of the hydrodynamic
models.",8,CMR9,,471,60
"3) For the radiation pressure dominated ideal induction
equation model with a moderate magnetic ﬁeld the dynamics
of the scale height is set by the magnetic ﬁeld (along with
gravity and vertical motion) and doesn’t feel the eﬀects of
gas or radiation pressure. This is because magnetic pressure
dominates during pericentre passage which is the only part
of the orbit where pressure is important.",8,CMR9,,395,60
