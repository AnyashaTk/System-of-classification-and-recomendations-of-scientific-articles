ABSTRACT,9,CMR10,,8,8
"Much of the information about the magnetic ﬁeld in the Milky Way and other galaxies comes from
measurements which are path integrals, such as Faraday rotation and the polarization of synchrotron
radiation of cosmic ray electrons. The measurement made at the radio telescope results from the
contributions of volume elements along a long line of sight. The inferred magnetic ﬁeld is therefore
some sort of average over a long line segment. A magnetic ﬁeld measurement at a given spatial location
is of much more physical signiﬁcance. In this paper, we point out that HII regions fortuitously oﬀer
such a “point” measurement, albeit of one component of the magnetic ﬁeld, and averaged over the",9,CMR10,,691,102
"sightline through the HII region. However, the line of sight (LOS) through an HII region is much",9,CMR10,,96,96
"smaller (e.g. 30 - 50 pc) than one through the entire Galactic disk, and thus constitutes a “pseudo-
local” measurement. We use published HII region Faraday rotation measurements to provide a new
constraint on the magnitude of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the Galaxy, as well as
to raise intriguing speculations about the modiﬁcation of the Galactic ﬁeld during the star formation
process.",9,CMR10,,400,101

1. INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,15,15
"It has been known for decades that the interstellar medium is threaded by a magnetic ﬁeld. This is not surprising,
since almost all phases of the interstellar medium (ISM) have suﬃcient level of ionization to satisfy the conditions
1 (number of particles per DeBye sphere large, Nicholson 1983), and thus constitute

"plasmas. Currents ﬂowing in these plasmas generate a magnetic ﬁeld. Measurements that provide information on the
magnitude and functional form of the Galactic ﬁeld include Faraday rotation of radio sources, both in the Galaxy
and beyond, Zeeman splitting of magnetically-sensitive transitions of the hydrogen atom and the hydroxyl, methanol
and water molecules, polarization of the Galactic nonthermal synchrotron radiation, and polarization of visible and
infrared light due to the alignment of interstellar grains in the Galactic magnetic ﬁeld. Recent reviews on the Galactic
ﬁeld include Ferri`ere (2011) and Han (2017).",9,CMR10,,623,120

"Studies extending back over several decades indicate that the Galactic ﬁeld consists, in part, of a Galaxy-wide,",9,CMR10,,112,112
"large scale ﬁeld that can be described, at least empirically, by analytic functions of galactocentric coordinates, and a
superposed, spatially-random component that is plausibly interpreted as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence,
presumably similar to that which exists in the solar wind. An example of a study that prescribes the form of the large
scale, “deterministic” component of the ﬁeld is van Eck et al. (2011). Reviews which consider the state of knowledge
of both the large scale and turbulent components are given in Ferri`ere (2011) and Han (2017). A very recent review
which summarizes what we know and can speculate about the turbulent component is Ferri`ere (2020).",9,CMR10,,681,120
"It is probably safe to say that all observational investigations have concluded that the turbulent component is
comparable in magnitude to the large scale component. The exact value of the magnitude of the turbulent component
depends on what is assumed for the outer scale of the turbulence. Values for the ratio",9,CMR10,,312,113

two independent investigations. Interestingly, Beck (2016), in a review of what is known about magnetic ﬁelds in
external galaxies similar to the Milky Way, argues that the turbulent component is substantially larger than the large
scale, deterministic component. In Section 6 of his review, Beck examines the state of knowledge of the Galactic ﬁeld
in the context of results for external galaxies. He concludes that the amplitude of isotropic magnetic ﬂuctuations is

µG,9,CMMI10,,2,2
". It
should be emphasized that these estimates are dependent on assumptions on the outer scale of the turbulence, i.e. the
scale which distinguishes a Galactic-scale “deterministic” component from a turbulent component. Nonetheless, these
reviews make clear that there is substantial observational evidence for a turbulent component to the Galactic magnetic
ﬁeld that is comparable in magnitude, or even larger than an ordered, large scale ﬁeld. In this paper, we will consider
the dimensionless turbulent amplitude",9,CMR10,,515,119

"to be a free parameter, subject to the observational constraints cited above.
Knowledge of the magnitude and spectrum of the Galactic MHD turbulence is important to Galactic astrophysics, and
astrophysics in general, since this turbulence contributes to processes such as heating of the ISM through dissipation of
turbulence, conﬁnement and propagation of the cosmic rays, turbulent transport of heavy elements, and modiﬁcation
or regulation of the star formation process.",9,CMR10,,472,121
"One of the diﬃculties in determining the relative roles of a large scale and a turbulent component of the Galactic ﬁeld
is the fact that some of the main diagnostic techniques such as Faraday rotation, polarization of Galactic synchrotron",9,CMR10,,238,119
"radiation, and dust polarization consist of path integrals over long lines of sight through the Galaxy. What this means",9,CMR10,,119,119
"is that we get some sort of average of the Galactic ﬁeld over a long line of sight (LOS) through the Galaxy, rather than
the value at a set of points along that line of sight. Zeeman splitting of OH and methanol maser transitions are not
subject to this limitation, since the region of emission is very localized (Crutcher and Kemball 2019). However, as
discussed in Crutcher and Kemball (2019) regions of maser emission have very high densities compared to the general
ISM, and are products of the star formation process. We will return to this point in Section 4.",9,CMR10,,565,120
"In this paper, we discuss a type of observation which utilizes the Faraday rotation technique to obtain an estimate of
the Galactic ﬁeld (strictly speaking one component of the ﬁeld) in a localized region, rather than an entire line of sight
through the Galaxy. The localized region is comprised of the volume of an HII region. In this sense, the technique
provides a “local” measurement. In what follows, we ﬁrst summarize the basis of the technique of Faraday rotation,
then discuss recent observational results which allow it to be used in a “local” measurement of the Galactic ﬁeld.",9,CMR10,,586,122
"Faraday rotation is a fundamental plasma process which consists of rotation in the plane of polarization of radio
waves due to the presence of a magnetized plasma (Nicholson 1983). It is used as a diagnostic technique in laboratory
plasmas as well as in radio astronomy. In the present context, it is applied to radio waves emitted by extragalactic
radio sources and which propagate through the plasma of the interstellar medium (ISM). The change in the position
angle relative to what would be measured in the absence of the plasma, ∆",9,CMR10,,535,117

Galactic ﬁeld, a reasonable a-priori expectation would be that the magnetic ﬁeld at a point in the Galactic plane, and
averaged over a volume of radius 20 - 25 parsecs, would have poor correlation with the ordered, large scale Galactic
ﬁeld. The observations of the Rosette Nebula and W4 do not bear out this expectation. In this paper, we explore the
consequences of this result for our inference about the Galactic magnetic ﬁeld.",9,CMR10,,549,118

4. CONCLUSIONS FROM ZEEMAN EFFECT MEASUREMENTS OF STAR FORMATION REGION MASERS,9,CMR10,,78,78
"The analysis in Section 3 assumes that HII regions occur in the presence of an unmodiﬁed Galactic magnetic ﬁeld. In
the simpliﬁed stellar bubble models presented in Savage et al. (2013); Costa et al. (2016); Costa and Spangler (2018)
the expanding bubble modiﬁes the Galactic ﬁeld, but the RM enhancement due to the bubble is proportional to the
Galactic ﬁeld (mean ﬁeld plus turbulent contribution at the location of the HII region) in the absence of the HII region.
In the model considered by Harvey-Smith et al. (2011) the HII region consists of an ionization of the interstellar gas
with no modiﬁcation of the Galactic ﬁeld. Harvey-Smith et al. (2011) describe this as the HII region “lighting up” the
Galactic ﬁeld that exists at the location of the HII region.",9,CMR10,,766,121
"These viewpoints may be physically naive. HII regions are produced by hot, massive stars that are products of
the star formation process. Star formation regions, in turn, result from contraction of gas from the general ISM, its
conversion to molecular form, and an associated increase in gas density. It therefore seems likely that the process of
forming dense clumps in molecular clouds from which stars form results in major modiﬁcation of the Galactic ﬁeld,
perhaps to the extent of totally randomizing the vector ﬁeld from its value in the absence of the star formation region.
In this light, the observational results presented in Section 2 are even more remarkable; the preservation of the polarity
of the large scale ﬁeld occurs in spite of both the presence of natural turbulence in the Galactic ﬁeld, as well as the
possibly major variations to the ﬁeld induced by the star formation process.",9,CMR10,,901,122
The HII region results presented in Section 2 are not the only “local” measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld in the ISM.,9,CMR10,,116,116
"Hydroxyl, methanol, and water masers in star formation regions display the Zeeman eﬀect, permitting measurements
of the magnitude and sign of the LOS component of the magnetic ﬁeld in the maser region (Crutcher and Kemball
2019). These masers occur in regions of very high density compared to the ISM far from star formation regions, and
thus probe gas that has been substantially modiﬁed in density, and presumably magnetic ﬁeld, by the star formation
process (Crutcher and Kemball 2019).",9,CMR10,,489,114
"In spite of this, observations of the polarity of the magnetic ﬁeld in maser regions show results similar to those
presented in Section 2. Fish et al.
(2003) examined Zeeman eﬀect measurements for more than 50 massive star
formation regions. Although they did not ﬁnd a general Galactic-wide magnetic ﬁeld direction, they did ﬁnd that “
. . . in the solar neighborhood the magnetic ﬁeld outside the solar circle is oriented clockwise as viewed from the north",9,CMR10,,458,121
"Galactic pole . . . ”. This is the same sense as shown in Figure 1 on the basis of the HII region results. A subsequent
study by Green et al. (2012) yielded similar results. Green et al. (2012) reported measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld
(sign and magnitude of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic ﬁeld) for 14 Zeeman pairs in 6 high mass star
formation regions in the Carina-Sagittarius arm (4th Galactic quadrant). Their results show a dominant magnetic

5. SPECULATIONS FROM THE STUDY OF HYDRODYNAMICAL TURBULENCE,9,CMR10,,59,59
"The results for the HII regions presented above, and illustrated in Figure 1 indicate, at the very least, potentially
signiﬁcant limits on the magnitude of turbulent magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations in the Galactic ﬁeld. The results on star
formation region OH masers from Fish et al.
(2012) indicate, and the HII regions results
(2003) and Green et al.
may indicate, a far stronger and mysterious physical process: a memory of the large scale polarity of the Galactic ﬁeld
as it is modiﬁed during the contraction and increase in density associated with star formation.",9,CMR10,,562,119
"The obvious question which then arises is the meaning of “the persistence of memory” in the large scale, Galactic
magnetic ﬁeld. The problem arises because of the assumed isotropic nature of turbulent ﬂuctuations on scales much
smaller than the outer scale of the turbulence. Such ﬂuctuations, deep in the inertial subrange or close to the dissipation
range, should have no tendency to respect large scale asymmetries in the Galactic plasma. It is worthwhile to look for
insight from the study of hydrodynamical turbulence. There are obvious physical diﬀerences between the turbulence
in the diﬀuse plasmas of the interstellar medium and the turbulence in gases and liquids in laboratory and industrial",9,CMR10,,702,123
"settings. However, there are important similarities, too, and both the quality of the diagnostics and the shear amount",9,CMR10,,118,118
"of eﬀort expended in the study of hydrodynamic turbulence exceeds that which is possible for astrophysical turbulence.
A review of our understanding of “passive scalars” in hydrodynamic turbulence is presented in Warhaft (2000).
Passive scalars are quantities which are convected by ﬂuid turbulence, without aﬀecting the ﬂow ﬁeld. Warhaft (2000)
considered as a prime example temperature ﬂuctuations in hydrodynamic turbulence. An astrophysical example of a
passive scalar could be the plasma density ﬂuctuations responsible for interstellar radio scintillations. Warhaft (2000)
presents an illuminating discussion of the diﬀerences between the engineering and physics views of turbulence, and
oﬀers an admonition that is certainly relevant for Galactic astronomers as well: “ The physicists, with their quest for
universality, have concentrated on inertial and dissipation scales, the hope being, if the Reynolds (Re) and Peclet (Pe)
numbers are high enough, that the small-scale behavior will be independent of the large scales. We address both the
large and small scales in this review and argue that this division is artiﬁcial and dangerous”. Warhaft (2000) then
goes to present laboratory and theoretical evidence that small scale passive scalar ﬂuctuations (primarily temperature
ﬂuctuations) are anisotropic with an anisotropy that reﬂects large scale asymmetry. In the cases discussed by Warhaft
(2000) this large scale asymmetry was most typically a transverse temperature gradient imposed on a turbulent shear
ﬂow. Warhaft (2000) also shows that the small scale passive scalar ﬂuctuations possess a skewness and kurtosis that
exceeds that present in the fundamental turbulent velocity ﬁeld.",9,CMR10,,1700,120
"It is not clear to me if the clear and insightful presentation of Warhaft (2000) holds a key to understanding the
mysterious observation described in this paper, or if any such comparison would be a hallucinogenic extrapolation of
laboratory results far outside their range of applicability. While Warhaft’s review does describe a documented persis-
tence of large scale anisotropy on small turbulent scales, as appears to be indicated in our Galactic ISM observations,
it must be emphasized that the discussion of Warhaft (2000) is concerned with passive scalars in the turbulence.
In the Galactic ISM context, that would be plasma density, temperature, ionization fraction, and metallicity. The",9,CMR10,,696,119
"magnetic ﬁeld, on the other hand, should share status with ﬂuid velocity as a “primary excitation” of the turbulence,
if the ISM turbulence is Alfv´enic. Nonetheless, it would be worthwhile to consider further if the extensive, laboratory
based studies of turbulence from an engineering perspective can illuminate the nature of plasma turbulence in the
interstellar medium.",9,CMR10,,373,120
6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS,9,CMR10,,26,26
"1. In the case of the Galactic-anticenter-direction HII regions Rosette Nebula and W4, the mean magnetic ﬁeld in
the HII region has the same polarity as the general Galactic ﬁeld in that part of space, despite the presence of
strong MHD turbulence which would be expected to randomize the polarity. An additional 4 HII regions studied
by Harvey-Smith et al (2011) share this property.",9,CMR10,,384,112
"2. We derive formulas for the probability of the “point” magnetic ﬁeld having the same polarity as the general ﬁeld,
which depends on properties of the turbulent magnetic ﬂuctuations as well as the details of the line of sight. For
reasonable estimates, this probability could be non-negligible, being as high as 25 % for plausible characteristics.",9,CMR10,,348,116
11,9,CMR10,,2,2
"As a result, the observation of 6 anticenter-direction HII regions, all having the same magnetic polarity of the
general ﬁeld, becomes mildly curious.",9,CMR10,,150,112
"3. The results on HII regions support similar results on the polarity of star formation OH masers presented by
Fish et al. (2003) and Green et al. (2012). In those studies, the polarity of the magnetic ﬁeld in maser regions
is correlated among star formation regions that are spatially separated, and the polarity is apparently determined
by that of the large scale Galactic ﬁeld. The maser region results not only limit the properties of turbulent
ﬂuctuations in the Galactic ﬁeld, but also restrict the ﬁeld randomization that presumably occurs in the assembly
of star formation cores during the process of star formation.",9,CMR10,,624,114
"4. We point out that studies of turbulence in laboratory settings also show a persistence of large scale asymmetries
in small and inertial scale ﬂuctuations, which could be termed “the persistence of memory” in the Galactic
magnetic ﬁeld. These results are discussed in Warhaft (2000), and refer to passive scalars in hydrodynamic
turbulence. Although it is unclear if the results discussed in Warhaft (2000) are applicable to Galactic MHD
turbulence, it would appear to be a worthwhile path to investigate.",9,CMR10,,507,116
