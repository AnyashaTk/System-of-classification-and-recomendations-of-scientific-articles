Abstract,0.0
The mean of 430 visual magnitudes of VisorSats adjusted to a distance of 550-km (the operational,0.0
altitude) is 5.92 +/-0.04. This is the characteristic brightness of these satellites when observed at zenith.,0.0
"VisorSats average 1.29 magnitudes fainter than the original-design Starlink satellites and, thus, they are",0.0
