"The idea that, after their evaporation, Planck-mass black holes might tunnel into metastable
white holes has recently been intensively studied. Those relics have been considered as a dark
matter candidate. We show that the model is severely constrained and underline some possible
detection paths. We also investigate, in a more general setting, the way the initial black hole mass
spectrum would be distorted by both the bouncing effect and the Hawking evaporation."
INTRODUCTION
"Although dark matter is a very old problem triggering
many studies, no consensual solution has yet emerged.
Many experimental searches are being carried out. They
are based either on direct (reviews are given in [1–3]) or
indirect (see [4–6]) detections. The production of dark
matter particles by accelerators has also been actively
considered (see, e.g., [7, 8] for reviews), without success
so far. Quite a lot of “anomalies” have been registered,
for example the overabundance of positrons in cosmic
rays [9–11] and the excess of GeV gamma rays from the
Galactic Center [12]. However none are truly convincing
as conventional astrophysical processes can account for
the claimed anomalies.
Theoretically, many models are being built and there is
no point listing them here (one can, e.g., see [13] for a
brief review). From axions [14] to supersymmetry [15]
most of them imply new particles."
"In this article, we focus on the hypothesis proposed
in [16], that is the tunneling of light black holes (BHs)
into metastable white hole (WH) relics. In a sense, this
would provide a (quantum) gravitational solution to the
old dark matter mystery, without relying on modified
gravity. We first recall the basics of the model. We
then point out several weaknesses ruling out the asso-
ciated dark matter scenario in conventional cosmological
settings. We also underline alternative approaches and
investigate the way the initial mass spectrum would be
distorted. Finally we consider a possible and potential
detection path."
THE FRAMEWORK
The bouncing model
"The idea that black holes could tunnel into white
holes due to nonperturbative quantum gravitational"
"effects was suggested in [17–20]. The associated phe-
nomenology was developed in [21–26]. On a dimensional
ground, together with general arguments related with
the information paradox, the lifetime of a BH with mass
M was assumed to be of the order M2. Throughout
this work we use Planck units unless otherwise stated.
However, as pointed out in [27], this is not supported,
at this stage, by actual calculations in full quantum
gravity."
"The initial model was refined in [16]. The idea is the
following. The usual semiclassical probability for a black
hole to tunnel into a white hole is small for a macroscopic
object as it should be of the order of"
"P ∼ e−M
2"
"The squared mass term comes from the Euclidean
action associated with the considered process. When M
approaches unity, the tunneling probability becomes of
order 1. In this scenario, before tunneling into a white
hole, a black hole first evaporates. From a practical
viewpoint this requires its initial mass to be smaller
than ∼ 1025g (approximately the mass of the Moon),
otherwise its Hawking temperature is smaller than the
one of the surrounding radiation and the evaporation
never occurs. When the black hole reaches the Planck
mass, it then tunnels into a white hole. The key point
is that the formed white hole has a long lifetime and
a large interior. Remnants in the form of “geometric
structures” with a small throat and a long tail were,
e.g., considered in [28, 29]."
"In this model, the usual black hole information para-
dox is naturally solved as the standard event horizon is
replaced by an apparent horizon: information is released
after the transition to a white hole. To purify the Hawk-
ing evaporation [30], the remnant has to store informa-
tion with entropy"
"S ∼ M2i , (2)"
http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01949v2
"where Mi is the initial mass of the black hole (before
evaporation) and not the remnant mass [31]. However,
due to its small mass, the white hole relic releases infor-
mation slowly, making it long-lived with a decay time of
the order"
τ ∼ M4i . (3)
"In [16], it was shown that an effective metric describing
standard black hole radiation followed by a sudden
transition to a Planck-mass white hole can be built
under natural hypotheses."
"This scenario is consistent with the fact that old black
holes have a large interior volume [32, 33]. The geom-
etry outside the black-to-white hole tunneling object is
given by a single asymptotically flat spacetime. The Ein-
stein field equations are violated only in two regions: the
Planck-curvature one, for which an effective metric that
smoothes out the singularity was calculated, and the tun-
neling one, whose characteristics are known [34]. A de-
tailed construction defining the black-to-white hole tran-
sition amplitude has recently been given in [35]."
Stable relics
"The Hawking temperature TH = 1/(8πM) is extremely
small for massive black holes (TH/1K = 6×10"
"−8M⊙ /M)
but becomes large for very light ones. The mass loss
rate scales as M−2, making the whole process explosive.
The evaporation mechanism is well described from many
different viewpoints and can be considered as consensual
(see, e.g., [36] for an introduction). There are even
indications that it might have been observed in analog
systems [37]."
"The status of the end point of the evaporation process
is, however, much less clear: the standard semiclassical
approach breaks down in the Planck region and a
nonphysical naked singularity emerges if the usual
description is considered without modification. This is
why, long before the model considered here emerged,
arguments were given favoring of the existence of stable
relics (see [28, 38–50] to mention only some references).
There are many different ideas in quantum gravity,
modified gravity, and string gravity supporting the idea
of remnants. A quite generic statement based on known
physics was given in [51]: energy conservation, locality,
and causality suggest the existence of a huge timescale
for the final decay of a black hole."
"Although no clear consensus exists on the status of
BHs at the end of the evaporation process, it is fair to
suggest that the existence of relics is somehow expected."
"A recent review on the pros and cons of stable remnants
is given in [52]. It is concluded that if relics contain a
large interior geometry – which is the case [32, 33] –,
they lead to a nice solution to the information paradox
and firewall controversy."
"The possibility that cold dark matter could be made
of such relics was first mentioned in [53]. Recently, the
possibility that black holes whose remnants which could
be dark matter might be formed by the collision of
trans-Planckian particles was studied in [54], following
[55] and [56, 57]. All this is worth recalling to underline
that the long but finite lifetime of white hole relics
considered in this work makes the situation actually
more complicated – to account for dark matter – than
the other scenarios mentioned above where remnants are
assumed to be eternal."
PRODUCTION IN AN INFLATIONARY
UNIVERSE
"We first consider the white hole dark matter scenario
in the inflationary framework, which we consider to be
the current cosmological paradigm. As we shall see, an
inflationary stage imposes drastic constraints on the
current density of remnants."
"The most straightforward setting consists of assuming
that black holes were formed just at the end inflation, say
at (or around) the reheating time [58]. For the associated
relics to be still present in the contemporary Universe,
their lifetime should to be larger than the Hubble time
tH :"
M4i > tH . (4)
"In addition, as they have to be formed by evaporated
black holes, one requires"
"M3i < tH , (5)"
"where M3i is the Hawking evaporation time. In a naive
deterministic vision, assuming tH ∼ 13.8 billion years
[59], this leads to"
"1010 g < Mi < 10
15 g. (6)"
"It is argued in [60] that this corresponds to typical Hub-
ble masses at reheating, making the scenario convincing.
The amount of entropy released by the evaporation is,
however, severely constrained by nucleosynthesis and
this imposes a stringent bound on the number of black
holes formed in this mass range. This was studied in
details in [61–63]. Those constraints must be taken into
account so as to check whether they are compatible"
"with the expected density of remnants. As usually done
in this framework, we assume that all black holes were
formed at the same time and with the same mass Mi.
Although the resulting constraints could be slightly
relaxed by considering a wider mass distribution, the
orders of magnitude remain correct."
"Following [61], let us call β′ the ratio between the den-
sity of black holes and the total density of the Universe
at the formation time. Let us call NR the number of e-
folds between the reheating and the contemporary epoch.
The energy density in the form of black holes scales as
a−3 whereas the energy density of radiation behaves as
a−4. As the Universe is radiation dominated between the
reheating and the equilibrium time, a small initial frac-
tion of black holes is enough to account for current dark
matter density. However, it should be taken into account
that black holes contribute only through the mass of the
relics – of the order of the Planck mass – which makes
the situation worse than if they were stable, adding a fac-
tor 1/Mi. At the reheating, the mass fraction therefore
reads:"
"β′ = Mie
−NR"
"ΩWH
Ωr"
"where the normalized densities of white hole remnants
and radiation, ΩWH and Ωr, are considered today. As
shown in [61], the observational limit is around β′ <
10−24 for 1010 g < Mi < 10"
"15 g. This immediately implies
that the current density of white hole remnants must be
totally negligible. Assuming ΩBH ∼ ΩDM would indeed
translate in"
NR > 63 + ln (Mi). (8)
"Even with the highest possible reheating temperature,
increasing the number of e-folds, this is not compatible
with the standard cosmological model. The white hole
remnants hypothesis cannot account for any substantial
contribution to dark matter in this setting."
"An alternative cosmological scenario that could be
compatible with the formation of a large quantity
of black holes is provided by loop quantum gravity
(LQG). A pedagogical introductory review can be found
in [64]. Although the idea of quasistable white hole
relics, studied here, is not rigorously grounded in LQG,
there is a natural connection between both frameworks.
Indeed, spin foam amplitude for the black-to-white hole
transition can, in principle, be explicitly calculated
in nonperturbative background-independent quantum
gravity [34]. When restricted to cosmological sym-
metries, LQG leads to the so-called LQC paradigm
[65, 66]. The most important result is that the big
bang singularity is replaced by a regular big bounce
[67]. This opens the exciting possibility that black"
"holes were formed before the bounce. Although the
detailed mechanism is of course highly speculative, it
can at least be underlined that the contraction of the
Universe makes the growth of inhomogeneities, and
therefore the possible BH formation by fluctuations,
easier [68]. In principle, this helps evading the previous
constraint, Eq. (8), as the BHs can now have completed
their evaporation before it conflicts with nucleosynthesis."
"The hypothesis that dark matter could be made
of relics of black holes formed before the bounce was
mentioned in [69]. Calling NT the total number of
e-folds between the bounce and the contemporary
Universe, the density of relics at the bounce should be
e3Nt times higher than in the contemporary Universe.
Assuming that the relics contribute substantially to
dark matter – that is ρWH ∼ 0.3ρc, where ρc is the
critical density – and choosing a reasonable lower
bound NT ∼ 130, one immediately concludes that the
energy density at the bounce should have been at least
ρWHe"
"390 ≈ 1047 in Planck units. This value is not only
obviously unphysical, but also inconsistent with the very
idea of a relic whose density should be of the Planck scale."
"This somehow closes the window on the hypothe-
sis of white hole relics within the standard inflationary
paradigm."
PRODUCTION IN A MATTER-BOUNCE
UNIVERSE
"An interesting alternative to inflation is the matter-
bounce scenario which occurs in the matter dominated
Universe (see, e.g. [70] and [71]). Quite remarkably for
the consistency of the model studied here, this might also
happen in loop quantum cosmology [72]. For a pressure-
less collapsing universe, the predicted power spectrum
of the scalar perturbations after the bounce is scale in-
variant and the tensor to scalar ratio is negligibly small.
A slight red tilt can even be accounted for through an
appropriate equation of state."
"Let us now assume that black holes were formed at
the same mass Mi and the same time ti < 0 before the
bounce (the latter corresponding to t = 0), and are now
present as Planck-mass white hole remnants. Could this
model, which is a priori consistant, be observationally
tested?"
"To address this question meaningfully, the lifetime of
WHs should be considered stochastic, as a radioactive
decay, rather than deterministic [25]. When we consid-
ered the formation of BHs at the reheating, stochastic
lifetimes were not relevant. Indeed, this effect would,
in principle, allow BHs with a mass below 1010g to be"
"considered, but the initial density should then be sub-
stantially increased and the constraints on their number
would prevent WH relics from describing dark matter
anyway."
"We first consider the hypothesis that a white hole dies
by emitting a single quantum at the Planck energy with
a period τ . The Universe being essentially transparent at
the Planck energy, the flux received by a detector of sur-
face σ and of acceptance Ωacc reads (neglecting evolution
to fix the order of magnitude):"
Φmes ∼
"pγ nem σ
Ωacc
4π"
"dr, (9)"
"where nem is the emitted flux of the considered source per
unit volume and pγ is the relative probability of emitting
a photon. Since the process can be assumed democratic,
as in the case of the Hawking evaporation, pγ is simply
given by 2/nSM , where nSM is the number of degrees
of freedom of the standard model. Obviously, one could
imagine that new degrees of freedom exist at higher en-
ergies, but this does not dramatically change the picture."
"Calling dNev the number of events in a volume dV
during a time dt, one has:"
dNev = pγ (ρN dV )
"τ
exp (−(t− ti)/τ) dt"
", (10)"
"where ti is the formation time and ρN is the number
density of relics. Gathering the different elements of the
straightforward calculation, now along a null geodesics,
one is led to"
Φmes = Φ0
"a(u)
exp"
"−
tH
τ"
"with u = t/tH , tH the Hubble time and Φ0 a number
which does depend on the parameters ti and Mi."
"The situation can be summarized as follows. In the
scenario considered here, black holes have evaporated
and turned into white hole remnants before the bounce.
However, in itself, this does not put any restriction on
the initial mass Mi and formation time ti < 0 (other
than the trivial requirement that the absolute value
of formation time is larger than Hawking time for the
corresponding mass, Mi < (−ti)"
"1/3). By construction,
the current density of white hole relics is indeed assumed
to be the one of dark matter. As the decay process is
stochastic (the remaining density of relics never reaches
exactly zero), it is always possible to normalize the initial
density so as to fulfill the requirement ΩWH = ΩDM ,
regardless of the initial mass and formation time. This
makes the hypothesis naturally self-consistent, except in
the specific case where the initial mass is very small and
the formation time very close to the bounce, reviving"
the problem of a trans-Planckian density at the bounce.
"An interesting point consists of comparing the ex-
pected flux with the available measurements. The nu-
merical prefactor Φ0 reads"
"Φ0 ∼ 2 · 10
15 1"
. (12)
"The Auger observatory [73], with a very large active sur-
face of the order of 3000 km2, has not yet detected any
“Planck-energy” event. When gathering all the numbers
and performing the integration, this can be translated
into a bound"
"Mi > 10
12 g, (13)"
"which reduces the initial parameter space. It is worth
wondering if this limit could be improved in the future.
The most extreme idea to search for cosmic rays with
considerable energies is probably the use of Jupiter as
a huge calorimeter to detect particle showers [74]. The
effective surface becomes 4 orders of magnitude higher
that the one of the Auger observatory. As the mass
appears in the flux with a power 1/4 this would only rise
the limit to Mi > 10"
"Obviously, the way in which a metastable WH remnant
decays is unknown. We shall now consider a toy model as
different as possible from the one previously studied. In-
stead of assuming that the white hole disappears by the
emission of a single Planck-energy quantum, we consider
a continuous emission of low-energy radiation during its
entire lifetime. It is meaningful to consider an E−2 dif-
ferential spectrum. First, because it is quite usual and
nearly generic in astrophysical processes (although it is
fair to underline that no “Fermi-like” process is expected
in this model). Second, because it has the strong heuris-
tic advantage of being normalized by the logarithm of the
ratio of the maximum to minimum energies, E1 and E2,
thus avoiding the requirement to fix them precisely."
"Requesting that the WH relics are the main component
of dark matter leads to an emission density at energy E:"
"nem = ρDM
1"
τWH ln (E2/E1)
"E2
. (14)"
"In this case, the relics emit a continuous signal dur-
ing their entire lifetime until the full disappearance. By
construction, the model is here somehow deterministic
and the requirement that the white hole relics explain
the dark matter reads tH − ti < τ + τBH ≃ τ where τBH
is the Hawking time. In the previous case, the stochastic
nature of the emission makes it always possible to find a
normalization such that the current density approaches
the dark matter density. This is not true here and this
is the reason why both Mi and ti are now relevant."
"The idea, in this case, consists of comparing the flux
emitted by the population of relics with the diffuse astro-
physical background. This translates into a lower limit
on τ – otherwise too much radiation would be emitted
– which itself leads to Mi > 10"
"11 g, a result remarkably
similar to the constraint obtained in the previous and
radically different scenario. The additional constraint on
the formation time reads |ti| < τWH − tH that is, to
a good approximation, |ti| < M"
"4
i . This is of the order"
"of 1022 s for the lowest authorized Mi value, which is
5 orders of magnitude larger than the Hubble time. It
means that the time interval allowed for black holes to
be produced in the contracting branch of the Universe,
possibly contributing now to dark matter through white
hole relics, is huge (although finite) for any allowed initial
mass."
A FEW REMARKS ON THE MASS SPECTRUM
OF PRIMORDIAL BLACK HOLES
"We now switch to the bouncing model, mentioned in
the Introduction, where the bouncing time is τ = kM2"
"[17–20] with the aim of clarifying how it affects the BH
mass spectrum."
"The shape of the initial mass spectrum of primordial
black holes highly depends on the production mechanism
and is therefore not known. When assuming that BHs are
directly formed by density fluctuations, the initial mass
spectrum is given by"
"dMi
= αM"
"−1− 1+3w
1+w"
"i , (15)"
"where w = p/ρ is the equation of state of the Universe at
the formation epoch [58]. Focusing on other formation
scenarios, in particular, phase transitions [75, 76], can
lead to very different spectra. The question we want
to address here is the one of the distortion of the mass
spectrum induced by both the effect of the Hawking
evaporation and that of the hypothetical bounce."
"It is well known and easy to show that the evapora-
tion will make the contemporary spectrum roughly pro-
portional to M2 up to M∗ [77], the mass corresponding
to an evaporation time equal to the time difference ∆t
between the formation and detection times (that is the
Hubble time if one considers BHs formed in the primor-
dial Universe). Let us go beyond this crude estimate and
clarify the situation."
"Let fi(M) be the initial spectrum, just at the end of in-
flation in typical models, such that dn = fi(M) dM. The
only required hypothesis is that fi(M) is smooth. Black
holes with initial masses below M∗ do not contribute to
the contemporary spectrum. On the other hand, black"
"holes with masses well above M∗ have not yet signifi-
cantly evaporated and their mass spectrum is the same
as the initial one. The full relevant part of the contem-
porary spectrum, that is, M ≤ M∗, is determined by
the behavior of black holes with initial masses slightly
above M∗. The mass loss rate is obtained by integrat-
ing Eφ(E), where φ(E) is the instantaneous differential
Hawking spectrum,"
"φ(E) = Γs
["
"exp (8πME)− (−1)2s
]−1"
", (16)"
"per state of angular momentum and spin s. The ab-
sorption coefficient Γs is the probability that the particle
would be absorbed if it were incident in this state on
the black hole and E is the energy of the emitted quan-
tum. This leads to dM/dt ∝ −M−2 and, therefore, a
BH of initial mass Mi reaches, after a time t, a mass"
"Mf = Mi
("
"1− (M∗/Mi)
3t/∆t"
")1/3
. Let us consider Mi ="
"M∗(1 + ǫ) so that Mf = M∗(3ǫ)
1/3. A straightforward"
"calculation shows that, denoting f(M) = fi(Mi)

", the
contemporary spectrum,"
f(M) =
"fi(M∗) +M∗ǫ

"(M∗) +O(ǫ

"which gives, after a first-order expansion in ǫ, and using
3ǫ = (M/M∗)"
f(M) = fi(M∗)
"dfi
dMi"
+O(M6).
"(18)
This shows that the low-mass spectrum is indeed
proportional to M2 and this clarifies the higher-order
corrections."
"Let us now add the bouncing effect. It should be
treated stochastically otherwise the result is trivial :
the spectrum would be unchanged for M > MB, where
MB is the mass corresponding to a bouncing time equal
to ∆t, and vanishing for M < MB. Focusing on the
relevant dynamics, the result is qualitatively as follows.
Black holes with current masses below M∗ all had nearly
the same initial mass of the order of M∗. Their number
density due to the bouncing effets is therefore reduced by
the same factor e−∆t/τ(M∗). This translates to a simple
damping of the spectrum amplitude. The situation is
different above M∗. In this case, the damping factor
depends on the mass and the spectrum is multiplied by
a factor e−∆t/τ(M) = e−∆t/(kM"
"To summarize, the resulting contemporary spectrum,
taking into account both the Hawking evaporation and
the stochastic bouncing effect, is proportional to M2"
"when M < M∗, but instead of reaching (nearly) the
initial mass spectrum at M∗, it is now damped by a
factor e−∆t/(kM"
"2
∗
). When M > M∗ the correction to the"
"initial spectrum becomes mass dependent and converges
to unity for M → ∞."
"Let us be a little more specific on the details by fo-
cusing on the interesting region with BHs of masses
close to M∗. Defining β = ∆t/k (1/M∗)"
"2
, such that"
"α ≈ β (1− 2ǫ+O(ǫ2)), where α = ∆t/τ , it can be shown"

"This establishes the shape of the mass spectrum when
taking into account both the ”perturbative” Hawking
evaporation – seen here as a kind of dissipative process –
and the “nonperturbative” quantum bounce."
BINARY SYSTEMS
"It is finally worth considering the interaction of relics.
Whatever the detailed cosmological setting considered,
compatible with the idea that WH remnants constitute
most of the dark matter, binary systems could form. Al-
though nothing can enter a WH, its neat “gravitational
force” exerted on a distant object remains attractive.
In principle, forming binary systems of white holes
is possible [54]. It should, however, be kept in mind
that the current number density of Planck-mass relics
necessary to describe dark matter is extraordinary small,
of the order of one per billion cubic kilometers."
"Following [78] and [79], we estimate the probability of
coalescence in the interval (t, t+ dt) to be"
"dP =
3"
"170
α4"
"T 3
170"
")3/37]
dt"
ρrel(zeq)
"assuming that the mass of the relic is equal to the Planck
mass and calling ρrel(zeq) the relative density of WH rem-
nants at the equilibrium time. Under the assumption
that most relics were already formed at this epoch, the
coalescence rate is of the order of 10−45m−3s−1."
"This should of course be taken with extreme care. To
the best of our knowledge, the details of the merging
of two WHs is not known. It is even probable that,
because of the structure of WHs, a merging in the
usual sense does not happen. However, it is clear that
binary systems emitting gravitational waves are possible
and even expected when WHs are in the appropriate
kinematical conditions."
"Those gravitational waves are undetectable, both in
amplitude and in frequency. But the object resulting
from the “coalescence” might be detectable if it were to
emit a Planck-energy quantum. This makes sense as it
is naively expected to relax to the state of metastable
Planck-mass WH relic. If considering the Auger detector
[80], this flux would be too small for a detection. For a
detector of the Euso [81] class, the rate reaches an event
per decade. When considering long run projects planning
to use Jupiter as a cosmic-ray detector [74], as mentioned
in the previous sections, the expected flux becomes of the
order of a dozen events per year, which is experimentally
meaningful."
CONCLUSION
"The idea that white hole relics could be the main com-
ponent of dark matter is an appealing one, which is
grounded in quite convincing quantum gravity inspired
arguments. Unquestionably, the fact that black holes
might turn white, either before they undergo most of the
Hawking evaporation – with a bouncing time of the order
M2i – or at the end of the evaporation – with a surviving
time M4i – is worth considering and could be a major
prediction for models beyond general relativity. A possi-
ble connection with dark matter is a natural hypothesis."
"However, we have shown that the model is severely con-
strained if ΩWH is to be of the order of ΩDM :"
"• The production of enough black holes at the end
of inflation is ruled out, mostly to avoid too much
entropy being released and conflicting with nucle-
osynthesis."
"• The production of enough black holes before infla-
tion is ruled out due to the unphysical associated
energy density at the formation time."
"• The production of black holes in the contracting
branch of the Universe in bouncing cosmological
models without inflation – which are already chal-
lenging to build – is possible, but in a restricted
parameter space. Considering two very different
scenarios for the details of the decaying process, we
have shown that the initial mass should be higher
anyway that the naive lower bound."
"We have also clarified the shape of the mass spectrum
of black holes when taking into account both the Hawk-
ing evaporation and the bouncing hypothesis. Finally,
a long run prospect for detecting WH dark matter has
been suggested."
