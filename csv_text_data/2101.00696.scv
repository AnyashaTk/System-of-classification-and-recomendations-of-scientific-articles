Abstract. The Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) aboard the AstroSat satellite is the first Indian X-ray telescope in
"space. It is a modest size X-ray telescope with a charge coupled device (CCD) camera in the focal plane, which"
provides X-ray images in the ∼ 0.3−8.0 keV band. A forte of SXT is in providing undistorted spectra of relatively
"bright X-ray sources, in which it excels some current large CCD-based X-ray telescopes. Here, we highlight some"
of the published spectral and timing results obtained using the SXT data to demonstrate the capabilities and overall
performance of this telescope.

1. Introduction
The AstroSat observatory is the first dedicated Indian
"astronomy satellite (Agrawal, 2006; Singh et al., 2014;
Seetha & Megala, 2017; Singh & Bhattacharya, 2017),"
"with the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT1), which is the first"
"Indian X-ray telescope in space, on board (Singh et al.,"
"2016, 2017a).
Cosmic X-rays are reflected by two sets of co-axial"
nested mirrors in SXT. The first set has conically ap-
proximated paraboloid surfaces and the second set has
conically approximated hyperboloid surfaces. This is
"an approximate Wolter I geometry (Wolter, 1952), with
a cooled charge coupled device (CCD) camera at the fo-"
cal plane. Multiple instruments/telescopes of AstroSat
can simultaneously observe a source in a wide energy
"range from optical to hard X-rays (up to ∼ 100 keV;
Seetha & Megala, 2017), and SXT covers the crucial"
"soft X-ray band (∼ 0.3 − 8.0 keV; Singh et al., 2017b)"
in this range. This telescope has the following modest
1https://www.tifr.res.in/∼astrosat sxt/index.html
"capabilities (Singh & Bhattacharya, 2017; Singh et al.,"
"2017a,b): (1) the maximum effective area of ∼ 90 cm2"
at ∼ 1.5 keV; (2) an energy resolution of 80−150 eV in
"the 0.3 − 8.0 keV range; (3) time resolutions of 2.37 s
in the Photon Counting (PC) mode and of 0.278 s in the"
Fast Window (FW) mode; (4) the field of view of 40 ar-
cmin square; and (5) the Point Spread Function (PSF)
"having a Full Width Half Maximum of ∼ 100 arcsec
and the half encircled energy radius of ∼ 5.5 arcmin."
"However, SXT has a much smaller pile-up compared to"
"current large soft X-ray imaging telescopes, and hence"
is ideal to observe bright X-ray point sources.
"These make SXT capable, as an independent tele-
scope, to study continuum spectra, broad and somewhat"
narrow spectral lines and variations with timescales of
seconds and above of various types of cosmic sources.
"Furthermore, this telescope, jointly with the Large
Area X-ray Proportional Counters (LAXPC) and the"
Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride Imager (CZTI) aboard As-
"troSat, or jointly with any other hard X-ray instru-"
"ment or telescope, such as NuSTAR, can observe the"
"broadband X-ray spectrum of cosmic sources, and can
uniquely contribute to the estimation of the hydrogen"

"column density, and the characterization of the soft"
X-ray spectra. Its good energy resolution and signal-
to-noise ratio can be particularly useful for broadband
"spectral modeling.
In this paper, we give an overview of some notable"
scientific results which required a significant role of
"SXT. In sections 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7. and 8., we mention"
"results on black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), neutron
star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), neutron star"
"high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), ultra-luminous X-"
"ray pulsars (ULPs), cataclysmic variables (CVs), active"
"galactic nuclei (AGNs) and stars, respectively. In sec-"
"tion 9., we make concluding remarks."
2. Black hole X-ray binaries
Astronomical black holes are characterized by two pa-
"rameters, mass and spin, and hence the measurement"
of these parameters is essential to probe the fundamen-
"tal physics of these objects (e.g., Middleton, 2016). A"
"black hole X-ray binary, i.e., a stellar-mass black hole
accreting matter from a companion star, is particularly"
"useful for this purpose, as well as to test a theory of"
gravitation and to probe the inflow and outflow of mat-
"ter and its emission in an extremely strong gravitational
field."
AstroSat SXT can be very useful to study soft X-
"ray continuum spectra and spectral lines from BHXBs,"
to measure their temporal variations and to track their
"evolution through various states. This telescope is par-
ticularly capable to characterize the accretion disk and"
"reflection spectra, which can be used to estimate black"
"hole parameter values. Here, we will give a few exam-"
"ples.
A transient BHXB 4U 1630–47 was observed with"
AstroSat during its 2016 outburst. The source was
found in a very soft state with an accretion disk con-
tribution of ∼ 97% to the total flux. Such a source state
"is ideal to measure the black hole spin from the disk
inner edge radius estimated from the disk spectral com-"
ponent. SXT was particularly useful to characterize the
"disk spectrum, having covered its peak and both sides"
"better than other instruments (see Fig. 1). Using the
XSPEC2 kerrbb model for the relativistic disk black-"
body to fit AstroSat SXT+LAXPC and contemporane-
"ous Chandra High Energy Grating (HEG) spectra, the"
dimensionless black hole spin parameter was measured
"to be 0.92 ± 0.04 with 99.7% confidence (Pahari et al.,
2018a). Similarly, a characterization of the thermal disk"
spectrum of the persistent BHXB LMC X–1 with SXT
2https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/
led to a measurement of the black hole spin parameter
"of ∼ 0.93 (Mudambi et al., 2020a)."
The ability of SXT to characterize both the disk
"blackbody spectral component and the relativistic Fe
Kα emission line of the reflection spectral compo-"
nent was crucial to measure mass and spin param-
eters of the transient BHXB MAXI J1535–571 (see
"Fig. 2; Sridhar et al., 2019). More recently, AstroSat
(SXT+LAXPC+CZTI) and contemporaneous NuSTAR"
data were used to characterize another transient BHXB
MAXI J1820+070. The black hole mass was estimated
"to be 6.7−13.9 M⊙, and SXT, being the only instrument"
"in this work providing < 3 keV data and hence being
able to reliably fit the disk spectral component, was cru-"
"cial for this estimation (Chakraborty et al., 2020). Note"
that this mass range derived from the spectral fitting
"is consistent with the results obtained from dynamical
measurements (Torres et al., 2019, 2020)."
"In addition to the above examples, several other"
publications have reported the characterization of
BHXB spectral and timing properties with AstroSat sci-
"ence instruments, including SXT (e.g., Maqbool et al.,
2019; Bhargava et al., 2019; Sreehari et al., 2019,"
"2020; Mudambi et al., 2020b; Baby et al., 2020). SXT"
was also useful to probe the formation of a giant radio
"jet base and to measure the orbital period parameters of
the X-ray binary Cygnus X–3, for which the nature of"
"the compact object is not yet confirmed (Pahari et al.,"
"2018b; Bhargava et al., 2017)."
3. Neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries
A neutron star LMXB is a binary system in which the
"neutron star accretes matter from a low-mass star. In
such a system, the magnetic field of the neutron star"
"is typically low (∼ 107−9 G), and hence the accre-"
tion disk can extend almost up to the stellar surface.
"Consequently, a number of features, such as thermonu-"
"clear X-ray bursts, high-frequency quasi-periodic os-
cillations, accretion-powered millisecond period pulsa-"
"tions, etc., are sometimes observed from these sources,"
which can be useful to probe the strong gravity regime
"and the superdense degenerate core matter of neutron
stars (Bhattacharyya, 2010)."
"AstroSat science instruments, including SXT, are"
ideal to study various spectral and timing properties of
"neutron star LMXBs, and their evolution. For example,"
"the combined spectra from AstroSat (SXT+LAXPC)
and XMM-Newton (EPIC-PN) observations of the neu-"
tron star LMXB SAX J1748.9–2021 suggested the
"presence of reflection features (Sharma et al., 2020)."
"Fig. 3 shows that the spectra measured with SXT and
XMM-Newton EPIC-PN match well with each other."

"Figure 1. Joint fitting of X-ray spectra of the BHXB 4U 1630–47 from AstroSat SXT, two LAXPC detectors (LAXPC10"
"and LAXPC20) and Chandra High Energy Grating (HEG). An absorbed, relativistic, disk blackbody model with Gaussian"
absorption features and convolved with a Comptonization model is used for fitting. The source was in a soft state with a disk
"flux fraction of ∼ 0.97. It can be seen that SXT covers the spectrum and its peak better than other instruments, which was"
"particularly useful to measure the black hole spin (see section 2.; figure courtesy: Mayukh Pahari; Pahari et al., 2018a)."
"Another work on the neutron star LMXB GX 17+2
demonstrated that SXT not only is suitable for spec-"
"tral and timing studies in soft X-rays, but also can be"
"used for spectro-timing analyses (Malu et al., 2020). In"
"this paper, the cross-correlation studies using SXT and"
"LAXPC light curves showed time lags of the order of a
hundred seconds."
4. Neutron star high-mass X-ray binaries
A neutron star HMXB is a binary system in which the
"neutron star accretes matter from a high-mass star (e.g.,"
"Walter et al., 2015). In such a system, the magnetic"
"field of the neutron star is usually high (∼ 1012 G),
and hence the accretion disk is typically truncated far"
"from the star. As a result, the accreted matter is chan-"
"neled on to the magnetic polar caps, making the source"
"a pulsar. These systems are ideal to study an interac-
tion between the accreted matter and the strong stel-"
"lar magnetic field. Several neutron star HMXBs, for"
"example, 4U 0728–25, GRO J2058+42, 4U 1909+07,"
"have been observed with AstroSat, and SXT was used"
"to characterize the broadband spectra and pulse profiles
in soft X-rays (Roy et al., 2020; Mukerjee et al., 2020;"
"Jaisawal et al., 2020)."
5. Ultra-luminous X-ray pulsars
"Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs), given their lu-"
"minosities typically exceeding 1039 erg s−1, could be"
"accreting intermediate-mass black holes, or neutron"
"stars or stellar-mass black holes having accretion with
super-Eddington rates. A subset of ULXs have been"
confirmed to be accreting neutron stars from the ob-
"served spin-induced brightness pulsations, and they are"
"known as ultra-luminous X-ray pulsars (ULPs; e.g.,"
"King et al., 2017).
The characterization of the first Galactic ULP, Swift"
"J0243.6+6124, can therefore be extremely useful to un-"
derstand this important class of sources. AstroSat ob-
"served the 2017-2018 outburst of Swift J0243.6+6124,
and characterized its broadband spectrum, as well as"
energy-dependent and luminosity-dependent pulse pro-
"files in the energy range of 0.3 − 150 keV (Beri et al.,"
2021). SXT was particularly useful to measure the con-
"tinuum spectrum, as well as pulse profiles (see Fig. 4),
in soft X-rays. Besides, recent observations of the Be"
X-ray binary and pulsar RX J0209.6–7427 with As-
troSat SXT and LAXPC have indicated that its spectral
"and timing properties are remarkably similar to those
of ULXs, suggesting that this source could be a ULP"
"(Chandra et al., 2020)."
6. Cataclysmic variables
AstroSat SXT can characterize spectral and temporal
"properties of cataclysmic variables (CVs), i.e., accret-"
"ing white dwarfs. A sub-type of such binary systems,
in which the white dwarf accretes matter from a red"
"giant donor star via an accretion disk, can have explo-"
sive thermonuclear burning of the accumulated hydro-
gen rich material. This may lead to an outburst with a
massive ejection of the material at velocities ≥ 300 km
#### Page 4 of 1 J. Astrophys. Astr. (0000) 000: ####
Figure 2. AstroSat SXT and LAXPC joint spectrum from the BHXB MAXI J1535–571. The model used to fit is an absorbed
"disk blackbody plus cut-off powerlaw, the latter representing a Comptonization component (upper panel). This brings out"
two prominent features – Fe Kα emission line and Compton hump – of the reflection component of the spectrum in the
data-to-model ratio plot (lower panel). It is clearly seen that both the disk blackbody and the asymmetry of the Fe Kα line
"due to relativistic effects can be measured only with SXT, which are crucial to estimate the black hole mass and spin (see"
"section 2.; figure courtesy: Navin Sridhar; Sridhar et al., 2019)."
"s−1. These are known as Symbiotic Recurrent Novae,"
and only four such objects are currently known to exist
"(Schaefer, 2010).
AstroSat SXT observed one such nova, V3890 Sgr,"
in two long observations in 2019 from 5th Septem-
"ber to 16th September, just ∼ 8 days after its third"
"recorded outburst, with the highest cadence monitor-"
"ing from a low-Earth orbit satellite (Singh et al., 2021).
The observations caught the first appearance of Super"
Soft Source (SSS) emission (< 1 keV) on day 8.57 af-
"ter the outburst, revealing the presence of a very high"
"mass white dwarf. Rapid and highly variable evolu-
tion of the SSS, that included its complete vanishing"
"during days 8.6 − 8.9 and subsequent appearance, fol-"
lowed by another extremely low flux state during days
"16.8− 17.8, and rising again were observed. A detailed"
"spectral modeling, using white dwarf emission models
for the SSS and plasma models for higher energy (1− 7"
"keV) emission, to study the source spectral evolution"
has been carried out. The rapid spectral evolution (see
"Fig. 5) on nearly hourly time scales is not explained by
evolutionary models of accretion and ejecta."
7. Active galactic nuclei
"Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are supermassive black
holes, which accrete gas from the surrounding medium"
near the centres of galaxies. AGNs can radiate promi-
"nently in a wide energy range – from radio to γ-rays,"
and are rich in observational features in multiple wave-
"bands. Based on these features, these objects have been
divided into several subclasses, such as Seyfert galaxies"
and Blazars. AGNs are extremely important to study
"the strong gravity regime, accretion/ejection mecha-"
"nisms, the feedback to the host galaxy and the inter-
galactic medium, and cosmology (e.g., Netzer, 2015)."
"AstroSat has observed several AGNs, and SXT"
has significantly contributed to the spectral and timing
"characterization of some of them. For example, SXT"
"has measured the broadband spectrum and variability of
the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy RE J1034+396 in soft"
"X-rays, and contributed to the source power spectrum,"
"which, when compared with the power spectrum of the"
"BHXB GRS 1915+105, indicated a supermassive black
hole mass of ∼ 3 × 106 M⊙ (Chaudhury et al., 2018)."
"In another work, the variability of a Blazar, Mrk 421,"
"was measured with AstroSat SXT and LAXPC, as well"
"as with Swift, which was very promising to establish a"
"way to probe the disk-jet connection (Chatterjee et al.,"

"models tbabs(bbodyrad+nthcomp) and tbabs(bbodyrad+nthcomp+xillvercp), respectively. This figure shows that"
"SXT and XMM-Newton EPIC-PN residuals match well with each other, with the SXT spectrum extending farther in lower"
"energies (see section 3.; figure courtesy: Aru Beri; Sharma et al., 2020)."
"2018). Besides, SXT was useful to characterize the soft"
"X-ray spectrum of another Blazar, RGB J0710+591"
"(Goswami et al., 2020).
Simultaneous UV/X-ray observations of a Seyfert"
galaxy with AstroSat can be useful to probe the ther-
mal Comptonization responsible for the broadband X-
"ray emission. Joint X-ray spectral analyses of five sets
of SXT and LAXPC spectra revealed a steepening and"
brightening X-ray power-law component with increas-
ing intrinsic UV emission for the Seyfert 1.2 AGN IC
"4329A (Tripathi et al., to be submitted). These ob-"
"servations implied that UV emission from the disk in-
deed provides the primary seed photons for the Thermal"
"Comptonization process, and the X-ray spectral vari-"
ability is caused by either cooling of the hot corona or
"increasing optical depth of the corona, each with in-
creasing UV flux."
8. Stars
Coronal activity in stars can be studied by observing
"the variation of its high-energy radiation, including oc-"
"casional flares (Gudel & Naze, 2009). Such a study"
"can be useful not only to probe the stellar physics and
the surrounding environment, but also to understand"
the impact of the ejected particles and radiation on the
"plausible planets, including their habitability. AstroSat"
SXT is capable of tracking the stellar soft X-ray inten-
"sity variation, which was demonstrated by an observa-
tional campaign on our nearest star Proxima Centauri"
"with SXT, Chandra Low Energy Transmission Grating"
Spectrometer (LETGS) and Hubble Space Telescope
"(HST). Proxima Centauri is an M-dwarf with an Earth-
like planet within its habitable zone, and several flares"
and the non-flare emission observed from the star were
"useful to probe the coronal temperatures, abundance,"
"etc. (see Fig. 6; Lalitha et al., 2020). Particularly,
one flare was observed with all three instruments, and"
"showed the Neupert effect, that is the UV emission pre-"
ceding the soft X-ray emission.
9. Conclusions
Recent publications in refereed journals have con-
"firmed that SXT can successfully study spectral and
timing properties of a variety of cosmic sources, as a"
"standalone telescope, as well as in combination with"
"other AstroSat science instruments and other satellites,"
"such as Chandra, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and even"
"HST. Since the launch of AstroSat in late 2015, SXT
has been performing as expected, without any signif-"
"icant degradation of its capabilities. If this continues,"
"SXT can be very useful for deep observations, as well"
"as to track the evolution of relatively bright X-ray tran-
sients in a more dedicated manner in the future."
