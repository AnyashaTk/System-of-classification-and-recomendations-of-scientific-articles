ABSTRACT
"We present ALMA [C II] 158 µm line and far-infrared (FIR) continuum emission observations toward
HSC J120505.09−000027.9 (J1205−0000) at z = 6.72 with the beam size of ∼ 0′′.8 × 0′′.5 (or 4.1
kpc × 2.6 kpc), the most distant red quasar known to date. Red quasars are modestly reddened
by dust, and are thought to be in rapid transition from an obscured starburst to an unobscured
normal quasar, driven by powerful active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback which blows out a cocoon of
interstellar medium (ISM). The FIR continuum of J1205−0000 is bright, with an estimated luminosity
of LFIR ∼ 3×10"
"12 L⊙. The [C II] line emission is extended on scales of r ∼ 5 kpc, greater than the FIR
continuum. The line profiles at the extended regions are complex and broad (FWHM ∼ 630− 780 km
s−1). Although it is not practical to identify the nature of this extended structure, possible explanations
include (i) companion/merging galaxies and (ii) massive AGN-driven outflows. For the case of (i), the
companions are modestly star-forming (∼ 10 M⊙ yr"
"−1), but are not detected by our Subaru optical
observations (yAB,5σ = 24.4 mag). For the case of (ii), our lower-limit to the cold neutral outflow
rate is ∼ 100 M⊙ yr"
"−1. The outflow kinetic energy and momentum are both much smaller than what
predicted in energy-conserving wind models, suggesting that the AGN feedback in this quasar is not
capable of completely suppressing its star formation."

1. INTRODUCTION
"It has long been considered that mergers or inter-
actions of gas-rich galaxies are the trigger for intense
starburst and black hole growth (e.g., Sanders et al.
1988; Hopkins et al. 2006). In this scenario, a sub-
stantial fraction of the black hole growth takes place
inside a dusty starburst, during which time the sys-
tem appears as an obscured active galactic nucleus
(obscured AGN, Hickox & Alexander 2018). Sub-
sequent strong AGN feedback, particularly in the
form of massive outflows (e.g., Maiolino et al. 2012;
Cicone et al. 2014; Carniani et al. 2016; Bischetti et al.
2019; Fluetsch et al. 2019; Lutz et al. 2020), is expected
to clear gas and dust from the galaxy, halting further
star formation and black hole growth. This feedback is
also invoked in galaxy evolution models to shape the
galaxy mass function and ultimately black hole-host
galaxy co-evolution relations (Kormendy & Ho 2013).
High-redshift quasars are a unique laboratory to test"
"or refine our understanding of the early supermas-
sive black hole (SMBH) and galaxy formation (e.g.,
Inayoshi et al. 2019). To date, > 200 quasars with
absolute ultraviolet (UV) magnitude M1450 . −22 are
known at z > 5.7, most of which were discovered
by wide-field optical and near-infrared surveys (e.g.,
Fan et al. 2001; Bañados et al. 2016; Matsuoka et al.
2016, 2018a,b). Sub/millimeter observations have re-
vealed that their host galaxies often possess copious
amounts of dust (∼ 108 M⊙) and gas (∼ 10"
"10 M⊙) with
high star formation rates (SFR) of & 100–1000M⊙ yr"
"(e.g., Wang et al. 2013; Venemans et al. 2016, 2017;
Decarli et al. 2018), while smaller values are found in
lower luminosity quasars (e.g., Willott et al. 2013, 2015,
2017; Izumi et al. 2018, 2019)."
∗ NAOJ Fellow
"As a galaxy-overdensity increases the likelihood of
interactions and mergers of galaxies, deep submillime-
ter searches for companion star-forming galaxies have
been performed toward z & 6 quasars mainly by us-
ing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Ar-
ray (ALMA). Such efforts tried to detect C+ 2P3/2 →
2P1/2 157.74 µm (hereafter [C II] 158 µm) line
and/or rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) continuum emis-
sion from companions. Indeed, some works found com-
panions (e.g., Decarli et al. 2017; Trakhtenbrot et al.
2017; Willott et al. 2017; Neeleman et al. 2019), or
very close likely-merging galaxies (Decarli et al. 2019;
Venemans et al. 2019; Bañados et al. 2019), to the
optically-luminous (M1450 . −26 mag) quasars, which
would support the triggering of quasars by gas-rich ma-
jor mergers. Contrary to this, no overdensity of sub-
millimeter continuum emitters was reported for the case
of optically less-luminous (M1450 & −25 mag) quasars
(Izumi et al. 2019), implying that rather secular pro-
cesses (e.g., Shirakata et al. 2019; Marshall et al. 2020)
may also be capable of triggering z & 6 quasars.
As massive quiescent galaxies already exist at z ∼ 3−4"
"(e.g., Straatman et al. 2014; Estrada-Carpenter et al.
2020), we also anticipate that AGN feedback is already
taking place at higher redshift. An outstanding case
is the z = 6.42 quasar J1148+5251, in which a mas-
sive AGN-driven outflow (outflow rate Ṁout > 1400M⊙
yr−1) extending to r > 10 kpc is detected in the [C II]
158 µm emission line (Maiolino et al. 2012; Cicone et al.
2015). However, there is no other single z > 6 quasar
in which [C II] outflow has been reported, likely due to
inadequate sensitivity. To overcome the sensitivity is-
sue, Bischetti et al. (2019) stacked the [C II] cubes of
48 quasars at 4.5 < z < 7.1, and reported a successful
detection of a broad [C II] wing: the inferred outflow"
"rate (Ṁout ∼ 100 M⊙ yr
−1) is only modest, but may be"
enough to quench star formation in the central regions of
Extended [C II] structure in the z = 6.72 red quasar J1205−0000 3
"these galaxies. On the other hand, Novak et al. (2020)
performed another stacking analysis of [C II] cubes of
27 z & 6 quasars, revealing no clear evidence of [C II]
outflows (see also Decarli et al. 2018). Hence the situ-
ation is quite controversial these days. In either case,
however, previous z & 6 studies are biased toward the
unobscured (= blue) quasar population.
In this regard, one intriguing population of quasars,"
"whose host galaxies have not been studied at all at
z > 6, are the so-called red quasars. Unlike the
unobscured population, they are reddened (E(B −
V ) > 0.1) by dust at rest-UV (e.g., Richards et al.
2003; Glikman et al. 2004, 2018; Ross et al. 2015). Red
quasars typically have high Eddington ratios and are
accompanied by broad absorption line (BAL) features
indicative of nuclear fast outflows (e.g., Richards et al.
2003; Urrutia et al. 2009). At lower redshifts like z .
2.5, red quasars often host galaxy-scale outflows at var-
ious gas phases (e.g., Brusa et al. 2018; Perrotta et al.
2019; Zakamska et al. 2019). In addition, high resolu-
tion imaging observations revealed that red quasars tend
to be hosted by major mergers (e.g., Urrutia et al. 2008;
Glikman et al. 2015). These properties support an evo-
lutionary scenario, in which red quasars are emerging
from the merger-induced dusty starburst phase likely by
blowing out surrounding medium with powerful winds
(e.g., Farrah et al. 2012). However, as no red quasar
has been identified at z > 5 primarily due to their ap-
parent faintness in the rest-UV, it is not clear if this
picture also holds in the first generation of quasars."
1.1. Our target: J1205−0000
"Very recently, we successfully discovered two red
quasars at z > 5.8 (Kato et al. 2020) by match-
ing the deep sample of quasars optically-selected from
the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) wide-field sur-
vey (Aihara et al. 2018) with mid-infrared photometric
data obtained by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Ex-
plorer (WISE). In this work, we present our ALMA
observations of [C II] 158 µm line and underlying
FIR continuum emission of one of these two sources,
J120505.09−000027.9 (hereafter 1205−0000; Figure 1
top-right) at z = 6.7, by far the highest redshift red
quasar known to date (Kato et al. 2020) 1. Without cor-
recting for dust extinction, J1205−0000 has a rest-frame
UV magnitude of M1450 = −24.4 mag (Matsuoka et al.
2016). But once the extinction (E(B − V ) = 0.12 mag)
is accounted for, the quasar has M1450 = −26.1 mag,
with an Eddington ratio of 0.22 (Kato et al. 2020): here
the reddening was estimated by fitting a typical quasar
template to the broad band (optical to mid-IR) spec-
tral energy distribution with the Small Magellanic Cloud"
"1 Mazzucchelli et al. (2017) performed submm observations toward
this quasar by using NOEMA interferometer, but did not detect
[C II] emission as the line was out of their frequency coverage."
"(SMC) dust extinction law. J1205−0000 hosts promi-
nent N V and C IV BALs as well, confirming the exis-
tence of nuclear outflows (Onoue et al. 2019).
In the following parts, we describe ALMA observa-"
"tions in § 2, extended nature of [C II] emission in § 3, and
possible origins of the extended structures in § 4. We
provide our conclusions in § 5. This is the twelfth in a se-
ries of publications presenting the results from our high
redshift quasar survey, the Subaru High-z Exploration
of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs). Throughout
this work, we adopt the standard cosmology with H0 =
70 km s−1 Mpc−1, ΩM = 0.3, and ΩΛ = 0.7."
2. ALMA OBSERVATIONS
"We observed the redshifted [C II] line and FIR contin-
uum emission of J1205−0000 in Band 6 on 2020 Febru-
ary 26 (ID = 2019.1.00074.S, PI: T. Izumi), with 41
antennas. Our observations were conducted in a single
pointing with a 24′′ diameter field of view. The base-
line length ranged from 15.1 m to 783.5 m, resulting
in a maximum recoverable scale of ∼ 6′′. J1256−0547
was observed as a flux and bandpass calibrator and
J1217−0029 was monitored to calibrate the complex
gain. The total on-source time was 71 minutes.
The data were processed using CASA version 5.6"
"(https://casa.nrao.edu). All images were reconstructed
with the tclean task using natural weighting to max-
imize the sensitivity. We averaged several channels to
obtain a velocity resolution of 100 km s−1, which re-
sulted in a 1σ channel sensitivity of 0.13 mJy beam−1"
"(beam size = 0′′.77 × 0′′.48, P.A. = −58◦). Note that
we first cleaned the line cube including the continuum
emission down to 3σ level to determine the line posi-
tion. With this knowledge, we identified the channels
free of line emission. All these line-free channels were
integrated to generate a continuum map (1σ = 17.6 µJy
beam−1), which was subtracted in the uv plane by us-
ing the first-order polynomial before making the final
line cube.
Throughout the paper, only statistical errors are dis-"
"played unless mentioned otherwise (absolute flux uncer-
tainty ∼ 10%; ALMA Cycle 7 Proposer’s Guide). As
the [C II] emission turned out to fall at around the edge
of one of the spectral windows, we display spectral data
from two contiguous windows when necessary. We also
used the MIRIAD software (Sault et al. 1995) for some of
the analyses in this paper."
3. RESULT: EXTENDED [C II] EMISSION
"The top panels of Figure 1 show the distributions of
the velocity-integrated [C II] 158 µm line emission and
FIR continuum emission. The optical y-band image of
J1205−0000 taken with the Subaru HSC is also shown
for a reference. Figure 2 shows the [C II] channel maps
revealing the global velocity structure. We describe de-
tails of this emission in the following. The relevant phys-
ical properties are summarized in Table 1."

of the single Gaussian fit to these spectra are shown in Table 1.
3.1. FIR continuum properties
"The continuum emission (λobs = 1.2 mm) comes from
the central ∼ 1′′ (see Table 1 for detailed sizes measured
with the CASA task imfit). The continuum peaks
at (RA, Dec)ICRS = (12"
"h05m05s.080, −00◦00′28′′.04),
which is consistent with the optical quasar position.
To include all extended emission, we measure the con-
tinuum flux density with a 2′′ diameter circular aper-
ture placed at this peak position, resulting in f1.2mm =
1.17± 0.04 mJy.
We determine the FIR luminosity (LFIR; 42.5–122.5"
"µm) and the total IR luminosity (LTIR; 8–1000 µm)
by assuming an optically-thin modified black body with
dust temperature Td = 47 K and emissivity index"
"β = 1.6, values which are characteristic of high-redshift
luminous quasars (Beelen et al. 2006) and are commonly
adopted in the literature (e.g., Izumi et al. 2018). Af-
ter correcting for the contrast and the additional heat-
ing effects of the cosmic microwave background radia-
tion (da Cunha et al. 2013), we obtain LFIR = (2.7 ±
0.1) × 1012 L⊙ and LTIR = (3.9 ± 0.1) × 10"
"12 L⊙, re-
spectively. Note that there is actually a wide variety in
Td from source to source (Venemans et al. 2018). If we
adopt Td = 35 K, typical for local star-forming galaxies
(U et al. 2012), these values become ∼ 2× smaller.
With this LTIR (Td = 47 K) and the calibration of"

3.2. [C II] line emission
"Figure 1 demonstrates that the [C II] emission is spa-
tially more extended than the FIR continuum emission,
extending to r ∼ 1′′ (5.4 kpc) 2, and has a complex
morphology. The extended structure that is directly
connected to the continuum-bright core region is real,
as we see positive signals from several contiguous veloc-
ity channels measured there (Figure 1; positions A–C),"
"2 Although the distribution is complex, we fit a 2-dimensional el-
liptical Gaussian to it (CASA task imfit; Table 1). The estimated
beam-deconvolved size is ∼ 7.7× 4.1 kpc2, which is much larger
than that of the FIR continuum."
"over [−500, +500] km s−1 relative to the systemic ve-
locity (defined in the following).
Figure 3 shows an area-integrated spectrum measured"
"over the region within 1′′.5 radius of the nucleus in which
[C II] integrated-intensity is detected at more than 3σ.
We first fit the spectrum with a single Gaussian func-
tion (Figure 3a), but the observed profile clearly deviates
from this model; we found χ2/d.o.f. = 37.6/22 (esti-
mated over ±1200 km s−1 range) for this single Gaus-
sian fit. A notable deviation can be found at a positive
velocity channels of ∼ 300 − 500 km s−1. As the spa-
tially extended regions (Figure 2) have such high posi-
tive velocities, they must contribute to this excess wing
of the area-integrated spectrum. We then performed a
double Gaussian fit (Figure 3b) to account for that ex-

With the [C II] core flux and the 1.2 mm continuum"

[C II] equivalent width as EW[CII] = 0.67 ± 0.05 µm.
This is roughly half of the mean EW[CII] of local star-
forming galaxies (1.27±0.53 µm, e.g., Dı́az-Santos et al.
2013). In optically low-luminosity z > 6 quasars (e.g.,
HSC quasars with M1450 > −25 mag) EW[CII] is usually
> 1 µm, but optically luminous quasars tend to show
EW[CII] < 1 µm (Izumi et al. 2019), the latter of which

some of the [C II] emission may be due to the quasar
itself (i.e., narrow line region). Indeed, L[CII] shows
a marginal correlation with AGN power (Izumi et al.
2019)."
3.3. Comparison to the other z & 6 quasars
"We briefly compare the quasar nuclear bolometric lu-
minosity (LBol) and LFIR of a sample of z & 6 quasars
in Figure 4. Here we adopted the bolometric correc-
tion factor 4.4 from 1450 Å luminosity (Richards et al.
2006) to compute LBol. The same assumptions pre-
sented in § 3.1 are made to derive LFIR. Optically lumi-
nous quasar data is compiled from a recent survey work
of Venemans et al. (2018), whereas we collected the data
of relatively low-luminosity quasars from Willott et al.
(2013, 2015, 2017) and Izumi et al. (2018, 2019).
Although there is admittedly a wide spread in LFIR for"
"a given LBol, J1205−0000 shows a characteristic LFIR
to the optically luminous quasars once its dust extinc-
tion is corrected. If we assume that a quasar-phase
happens during a longer timescale starburst-phase (e.g.,
Davies et al. 2007; Hopkins et al. 2008; Bergvall et al."
Extended [C II] structure in the z = 6.72 red quasar J1205−0000 7
"2016), there was once a growing obscured AGN phase in
J1205−0000 which was embedded in this starburst host
galaxy.
At the lower quasar luminosity regime, i.e., LBol <"
"1013 L⊙, there are only two quasars (out of twelve)
having comparable LFIR to J1205−0000, namely
J2239+0207 (Izumi et al. 2019) and VIMOS2911
(Willott et al. 2017). J2239+0207 is likely to have a
close [C II] companion galaxy, which may have triggered
its intense starburst (Izumi et al. 2019). VIMOS2911,
which was originally discovered by Kashikawa et al.
(2015), seems to be an outlier in this plane as no
companion was reported (Willott et al. 2017), as well
as its narrow [C II] line profile (FWHM = 264 km
s−1) indicates an absence of a merger-like active event.
The remaining low-luminosity quasars all show LFIR <
1012 L⊙ (some show as low as < 10"
"11 L⊙), which is
clearly not the case of the optically luminous quasars.
Indeed, we found a positive correlation between"
"logLBol and logLFIR, after excluding the objects with
upper limits on LFIR, as"
"LFIR
L⊙"
= (0.64±0.03)×log
"LBol
L⊙"
+(3.55±0.45).
"(1)
A Spearman correlation coefficient for this logLBol–
logLFIR data is 0.56 (p-value = 2.0 × 10"
"−4). Although
it is still a marginal correlation, this implies that a black
hole and its host galaxy are actually co-evolving at this
high redshift. In addition, if we assume a common
star-formation efficiency over the whole quasars used
here, this correlation suggests that an optically luminous
quasar tends to form in a gas richer galaxy. Note that
Venemans et al. (2018) did not find a significant correla-
tion between these two luminosities, likely because they
only studied optically luminous quasars."
4. NATURE OF THE EXTENDED [C II] EMISSION
"We now turn to the physical origin of the extended
[C II] structure, which also contributes to the [C II]
wing in the area-integrated spectrum. Major possibil-
ities include companion/merging galaxy and cold out-
flow. However, as detailed later, it is not possible to
distinguish these two scenarios with the current dataset.
Thus, we discuss both of these scenarios and provide rel-
evant properties, respectively in the following. Note that
other key properties including the early co-evolution of
this quasar will be discussed in our forthcoming paper,
along with those of the other HSC quasars observed in
our ALMA Cycle 7 program (T. Izumi et al. in prepa-
ration)."
4.1. Companion/merging galaxies?
"Major mergers of gas-rich galaxies has been con-
sidered to be a promising driver of quasar activ-
ity (e.g., Sanders et al. 1988; Di Matteo et al. 2005;
Hopkins et al. 2006). High resolution and/or high sen-"

The corresponding M1450 is also shown. Literature data
"of some optically luminous quasars (Venemans et al. 2018),"
"as well as low-luminosity quasars (Willott et al. 2013, 2015,"
"2017) including our HSC quasars (Izumi et al. 2018, 2019),"
"are shown. J1205−0000 after (before) extinction correction
is indicated by the red filled (open) star. The diagonal line"
shows our linear regression fit to these objects excluding
those with upper limits on LFIR.
"sitivity observations at the low redshift universe in-
deed show an enhanced AGN fraction in major merger
systems (e.g., Ellison et al. 2011; Silverman et al. 2011;
Goulding et al. 2018; Koss et al. 2018). It is also
noteworthy that (intrinsically luminous) red quasars
tend to be hosted by major merger systems (e.g.,
Urrutia et al. 2008; Glikman et al. 2015). In this con-
text, it is intriguing that recent sensitive ALMA obser-
vations of rest-FIR continuum and/or [C II] emission
started to uncover star-forming companion galaxies to
some z & 5 − 6 luminous quasars (e.g., Wang et al.
2011; Trakhtenbrot et al. 2017; Decarli et al. 2017;
Willott et al. 2017; Neeleman et al. 2019), with some of
these companions very close to, or even merging with,
the main quasar (Decarli et al. 2019; Venemans et al.
2019; Bañados et al. 2019; Venemans et al. 2020).
We found that the [C II] spatial distribution of"
"J1205−0000 including the channel maps (Figures 1 and
2) well resembles that of J1342+0928 at z = 7.54
(Bañados et al. 2019), which is considered to be an on-
going merger system. Therefore it is plausible that the
extended [C II] structure of J1205−0000 is due to very
close companion or merging galaxies. As the [C II] emis-
sion extends toward multiple directions, there could be
corresponding multiple mergers in J1205−0000. This
picture fits into an evolutionary scenario in which a red"
8 T. Izumi et al.
"quasar corresponds to an emergent phase from a merger-
induced dusty starburst. A high fraction of merger event
in red quasar-host galaxies (e.g., Urrutia et al. 2008;
Glikman et al. 2015) measured at lower redshifts also
supports this scenario. Although we need higher reso-
lution and sensitivity [C II] data to better understand
the dynamical nature of this system, J1205−0000 has a
great potential to be an ideal laboratory to study physi-
cal properties of merging galaxies that would eventually
evolve into an unobscured luminous quasar.
Note that we do not find any companion in our op-"
"tical z- and y-band maps (∼ 0.′′8 resolution) with 5σ
limiting magnitudes of (zAB, yAB) = (25.1, 24.4), taken
by HSC (Matsuoka et al. 2016, see also Figure 1). Al-
though previous ALMA observations actually uncovered
optically-unidentified [C II] or FIR continuum emitters
around some z > 6 quasars (e.g., Decarli et al. 2017;
Mazzucchelli et al. 2019), the situation appears to be
different in J1205−0000. Those known companions are
typically bright at FIR with SFRIR of > 100 M⊙ yr"
"−1.
Hence their stellar emission would suffer severe dust
extinction, which can make them optically unidentifi-
able (Mazzucchelli et al. 2019). Contrary to this, the
FIR continuum emission of J1205−0000 is undetected
(< 1.5σ) at the regions with the spatially extended
[C II] emission (Figure 1). An inferred 3σ upper limit
on SFRIR by assuming a modest Td of 35 K (typical
value of local star-forming galaxies, U et al. 2012) is
only ∼ 10 M⊙ yr"
"−1. Hence a corresponding dust ex-
tinction is not so significant for the potential compan-
ions of J1205−0000. Rather, an insufficient optical sur-
vey depth would simply matter. If we suppose Lyman
break galaxies (LBGs) are responsible for the potential
companions, our y-band observation (5σAB = 24.4 mag)
only probes the bright-end of a UV luminosity function
of LBGs at z ∼ 7 (Ono et al. 2018). In this regard,
much deeper data from future facilities such as James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is needed to conclusively
identify the companions."
4.2. Cold neutral outflows?
"The extended and complex gas morphology of
J1205−0000 also reminds us that of J1148+5251, the
only other known z > 6 quasar with prominent [C II]
outflows. While J1148+5251 is ∼ 5× brighter than
J1205−0000 at UV and the observed [C II] extent is
as large as r ∼ 30 kpc (Cicone et al. 2015), this hints
at the existence of cold outflows also in J1205−0000.
In addition, the off-center [C II] spectra are all broad
(FWHM & 600− 800 km s−1). These are even broader
than that of the core component, as well as than those of
known companion galaxies of z > 6 quasars (. 400−500
km s−1, e.g., Neeleman et al. 2019), which would pre-
fer the outflow scenario. Thus, we discuss potential
outflow properties hereafter by assuming that the ex-
tended structure is formed fully due to cold outflows.
Given that the (potential) outflows are both spatially"
"and spectrally resolved, we can measure the dynamical
timescales of each [C II] blob defined in Figure 1 (A, B,
C). With these timescales, we follow the standard pre-
scription (e.g., Bischetti et al. 2019) to estimate outflow
rate, kinetic power, and momentum (Table 2)."
"We define the outflow rate as Ṁout = Moutvout/Rout,
where Mout is outflowing mass, vout is outflow velocity,
and Rout is the distance from the continuum peak. For
vout, we adopt |∆v| + FWHM/2, which combines the
shift of the velocity centroid from the systemic and the
FWHM of each blob. Rout is directly measured from
Figure 1 as 3.5, 6.4, and 5.1 kpc for the blobs A–C,
respectively. Note that vout is projected along the line of
sight, and Rout is projected in the plane of the sky, thus,
τout should be corrected by a factor | tanα|"
"−1, where α
is the angle between our line-of-sight and the outflow
direction of each blob. While we do not know α a priori,
the average of this factor over all angles is unity.
We calculate the outflow mass in neutral hydrogen gas"
Mout as
"Mout

= 0.77
0.7L[CII]
1.4× 10−4
"×
1 + 2e−91/Tex + ncrit/n"
2e−91/Tex
"where XC+ is the C
+ fraction per H atom, Tex is the"
"excitation temperature in K, n is the gas density, and
ncrit is the line critical density (∼ 3 × 10"
"3 cm−3). As
the actual gas density is unknown, we here assume the
high density limit (n ≫ ncrit) to provide a lower limit on
Mout. The factor 0.7 in the first parenthesis indicates
a typical fraction of [C II] arising from photodissocia-
tion regions (PDRs; i.e., the remaining 30% originates
from H II regions). For consistency with previous works
(e.g., Maiolino et al. 2012; Cicone et al. 2015), we adopt
XC+ = 1.4 × 10"
"−4 and Tex = 200 K, which are charac-
teristic to PDRs (e.g., Hollenbach & Tielens 1997), but
varying Tex ∈ [100, 1000] K changes the inferred Mout
by only ∼ 20%.
Interestingly, the (projected) flow times of the blobs"
"A–C are all clustered around ∼ 107 yr, which sug-
gests that these outflows were launched at roughly the
same time. Summing over these three blobs, the total
atomic outflow mass and outflow rate are Mout,A−C ="
"9.0± 0.9)× 108 M⊙ and Ṁout,A−C = 97± 15 M⊙ yr

Note that, however, our (possible) outflow rate only"
"refers to the neutral atomic component, while a signifi-
cant fraction of the outflowing gas would be in a molec-
ular phase. Indeed, Fluetsch et al. (2019) found in local
galaxies that the total mass-flow rate is ∼ 0.5 dex larger"

a lower limit on Mout, and we measured rates only at the

"−1.
This is factor & 3 greater than the [C II]-based SFR,
and it is not typical for star formation to drive a wind
at a much greater rate than the SFR (e.g., Cicone et al.
2014). We therefore naively suppose that the quasar it-
self powers this outflow. We emphasize that J1205−0000
is the highest redshift red quasar known to date. There-
fore, it is intriguing that the existence of outflows on
the scale of the host galaxy is hinted at here, suggesting
that the surrounding interstellar medium is actively be-
ing blown out, as predicted in SMBH/galaxy evolution
scenarios (e.g., Hopkins et al. 2006).
We found that the peak flux density of the red"
"wing is ∼ 30% of that of the core component, while
Maiolino et al. (2012) found a broad-to-narrow peak
flux density ratio of ∼ 15% for the case of J1148+5251.
The (possible) outflow velocity is much smaller in
J1205−0000 than J1148+5251, but we may be lim-
ited by the sensitivity of our measurement to detect
faster components. Interestingly, a similar line profile
to J1205−0000 is seen in cold outflows of lower red-
shift obscured quasars (e.g., Brusa et al. 2018; Fan et al.
2018). Hence suppose for example that the high-peak
wing is due to a dense gas that once obscured the nu-
cleus in a shell-like form. It had a high wind velocity
when it was launched, but is now decelerated after trav-
eling a long way from the center. As time progresses
and the quasar becomes less reddened, the outflow will
continue to slow down. It would be hard to identify
such a low-velocity component as an outflow unless it is
spatially resolved. Indeed, spatially extended but low-
velocity (|∆v| < 200 km s−1) structures are also found
in J1148+5251 (Cicone et al. 2015).
If the extended structures were formed genuinely due"
"to outflows, both the outflow kinetic power"
"Ėout =
1"
"2
Ṁoutv"
"2
out (3)"
and the momentum load
"Ṗout/ṖAGN =
Ṁout × vout
LAGN/c"
"are significantly smaller (Table 2) than what energy-
conserving AGN feedback models typically predict
(Ėout ∼ 0.05 × LAGN, Ṗout/ṖAGN ∼ 20, e.g.,
King & Pounds 2015). The small values found here are
comparable to those of J1148+5251 (Cicone et al. 2015),
implying that these may be typical among both red and
blue z & 6 quasars. Hence, the nuclear winds contribute
only a small fraction of the galaxy-scale feedback if we
apply this energy-conserving feedback scenario. This in-
dicates that, without additional feedback from star for-
mation, the AGN feedback is not able to completely
suppress star formation over the entire host galaxy."
5. SUMMARY
"We have presented ALMA observations of [C II] line
and underlying FIR continuum emission of the high-
est redshift red quasar known to date, J1205−0000 at
z = 6.72, which was discovered in our deep optical
imaging survey with the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam
(HSC). Although it appears as a low-luminosity quasar
(M1450 = −24.4 mag), its intrinsic luminosity is as high
as M1450 = −26.1 mag once its dust extinction is cor-
rected. A red quasar population has been considered as
an emergent phase from a dusty starburst by blowing
out its surrounding dense obscuring medium. The main
findings of this paper are summarized as follows."
"1. We successfully detected the [C II] line and FIR
continuum emission. The [C II] emission is spa-
tially more extended (over r ∼ 5 kpc scale)
than the continuum emission. The area-integrated
[C II] line profile is complex and is characterized
by two components, i.e., a main core component
that is attributed to the host galaxy itself and
an additional red wing component. Summing up
these two, we found the line luminosity of L[CII] ="
"(1.9 ± 0.1) × 109 L⊙. The FIR continuum emis-
sion is also bright as LFIR = (2.7± 0.1)× 10"
"12 L⊙
(Td = 47 K, β = 1.6)."
"2. The SFR inferred from the continuum luminosity
and [C II] core luminosity is 575±21M⊙ yr"
"−1 and
108 ± 7 M⊙ yr"
"−1, respectively. Note that, how-
ever, these would be regarded as upper limits as
we neglect a contamination from this intrinsically
luminous quasar itself."
10 T. Izumi et al.
"3. Based on the [C II] equivalent width and LBol–
LFIR relation, we found that J1205−0000 shows
consistent properties to z & 6 optically luminous
quasars once its dust extinction is corrected. We
also found a marginal positive correlation between
LBol and LFIR, implying a black hole and its host
galaxy are co-evolving."
"4. Although it is not practical to identify the physi-
cal origin of the spatially extended [C II] emission
with the current dataset, possible explanations in-
clude (i) companion/merging galaxies and (ii) cold
outflows. Both of these appear fascinating as they
well fit into the merger-induced galaxy evolution
scenario."
"5. If the extended structure is due to (multiple) com-
panion/merging galaxies, this indicates that this
red quasar indeed emerges with a merger event.
While no counterpart was identified in our op-
tical imaging survey with Subaru/HSC (e.g., y-
band 5σ limiting magnitude = 24.4 mag), dust
extinction would not be the prime cause of this
given the non-detection of FIR continuum emis-
sion. Rather, we may still not be sensitive enough
to detect normal galaxies like LBGs at that high
redshift. Deeper imaging observations by future
facilities like JWST are necessary to search for the
possible companion/merging galaxies."
"6. If the extended structure is due to cold outflows,
we can argue that this red quasar is in a key
transition phase from a dusty starburst by blow-
ing our its surrounding medium. On the other
hand, our lower-limit on the cold neutral outflow
is only ∼ 100M⊙ yr"
"−1, and we found that the out-
flow kinetic energy and momentum are both much
smaller than what predicted in energy-conserving
wind models. This suggests that the AGN feed-
back in this quasar, if genuinely exists, is not suffi-
cient to suppress star-formation of the host galaxy."
"In this work, we revealed some intriguing host galaxy
properties of this red quasar. This red quasar was orig-"
"inally identified by matching our low-luminosity quasar
sample and the mid-IR photometric data obtained by
WISE (Kato et al. 2020). As the HSC survey has still
been on-going and our sample of z = 6−7 low-luminosity
quasars has been growing, we would be able to find other
red quasars at this high redshift. They should be a good
sample for extensive follow-up studies by, e.g., ALMA
and JWST, to better understand the early black hole
growth and co-evolution."
