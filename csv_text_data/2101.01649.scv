ABSTRACT
The MGRO J2019+37 region is one of the brightest sources in the sky at TeV energies. It was de-
tected in the 2 year HAWC catalog as 2HWC J2019+367 and here we present a detailed study of this re-
gion using data from HAWC. This analysis resolves the region into two sources: HAWC J2019+368 and
"HAWC J2016+371. We associate HAWC J2016+371 with the evolved supernova remnant CTB 87, al-"
though its low significance in this analysis prevents a detailed study at this time. An investigation of the
morphology (including possible energy dependent morphology) and spectrum for HAWC J2019+368
is the focus of this work. We associate HAWC J2019+368 with PSR J2021+3651 and its X-ray pulsar
"wind nebula, the Dragonfly nebula. Modeling the spectrum measured by HAWC and Suzaku reveals"
a ∼ 7 kyr pulsar and nebula system producing the observed emission at X-ray and γ-ray energies.

1. INTRODUCTION
The brightest source in the Cygnus region observed by
the Milagro observatory was MGRO J2019+37 (Abdo
et al. 2007a). Milagro measured its flux to be about 80%
of the Crab Nebula flux at 20 TeV and showed an extent
"of ∼0.75◦ (Abdo et al. 2012). The MGRO J2019+37
region was later observed by MAGIC and VERITAS"
"for short durations, collecting 15 and 10 hours of data,"
"respectively, which led to upper limits consistent with"
"Milagro (Bartko et al. 2008; Kieda 2008). Soon after,"
the Tibet Air Shower array confirmed the Very-High-
Energy (VHE) extended source detection (Amenomori
"et al. 2008). However, ARGO-YBJ later reported a non-"
detection of MGRO J2019+37 and reported upper limits
for that location. This was attributed to either insuffi-
cient exposure to the source or variability of the emission
"over time (Bartoli et al. 2012).
Deep observations of the MGRO J2019+37 region by"
VERITAS resolved it into two sources: VER J2019+368
and VER J2016+371 (Aliu et al. 2014). VER J2019+368
"is a brighter extended source, which accounts for"
"the bulk of the emission from MGRO J2019+37,"
though the origin of the emission remained unknown.
"VER J2016+371 is the other source, which is a point-"
like source to VERITAS. It was suggested that the most
likely counterpart of VER J2016+371 is a Pulsar Wind
Nebula (PWN) in the SuperNova Remnant (SNR) CTB
87 because of the co-location of the TeV γ-ray and X-
ray emission as well as the luminosity in those energy
ranges.
The MGRO J2019+37 region overlaps with several
"SNRs, HII regions, Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, high-energy"
"γ-ray (> 100 MeV) sources, and the hard X-ray tran-"
sient IGR J20188+3647 (17-30 keV) (Sguera 2008; Abdo
et al. 2012). A young energetic radio and γ-ray pul-
"sar, PSR J2021+3651, (Roberts et al. 2002; Halpern"
"et al. 2008) and its nebula, PWN G75.1+0.2, are also"
in the vicinity (Abdo et al. 2007b). PSR J2021+3651
"has a period (P ) of 104 ms, spin-down luminosity (Ė)"
"of 3.4×1036 erg s−1 and a characteristic age (τc) of 17.2
kyr (Roberts et al. 2002)."
PSR J2021+3651 has previously been proposed
to be the engine powering the PWN giving rise to
"the extended TeV emission seen by Milagro, due"
to its high Ė (Saha & Bhattacharjee 2015). How-
"ever, we note that Paredes et al. (2009) have sug-"
gested that PSR J2021+3651 cannot power the whole
"MGRO J2019+37 region alone, and proposed that the"
star-forming region Sharpless 104 (Sh 2-104) may con-
tribute some fraction of the measured flux. Another
proposed scenario for the VHE emission was the winds
"from WR stars in the young cluster Ber 87, although"
this model proved challenging to fit to the available data
(Bednarek 2007).
Chandra ACIS-S observations of the region around
PSR J2021+3651 lead to the detection of an X-ray
PWN G75.0+0.1 (Hessels et al. 2004). The peak of
"TeV emission is offset by ∼20′, and the measured size
of X-ray PWN is ≤ 15′ (Aliu et al. 2014). Due to
the significantly smaller size of the X-ray PWN com-"
"pared to the size of the TeV emission, it was difficult"
to draw any conclusion regarding their association. In
a recent detailed spectral and morphological study of
the X-ray PWN using the data from Suzaku-XIS and
"XMM-Newton, there is an indication that X-ray PWN"
"and TeV emission are associated, and the PWN asso-"
ciated with PSR J2021+3651 is a major contributor to
Analysis of HAWC J2019+368 3
"the TeV emission, explaining about 80% of the emission"
(Mizuno et al. 2017). The location of the peak TeV γ-
ray emission in VER J2019+368 is offset from the pulsar
"location (Aliu et al. 2014), which is a typical behaviour"
in PWNe powered by pulsars of similar age. This be-
haviour can be explained if electrons and positrons prop-
"agate away from the pulsar and lose energy, leading to"
energy-dependent morphology and the highest energy
γ-ray emission seen where the high-energy e± originate.
A scenario in which high energy leptons are produced
in the PWN powered by PSR J2021+3651 is supported
by the TeV emission of VER J2019+368 and the X-ray
morphology (Aliu et al. 2014; Mizuno et al. 2017). The
"hard spectral index (1.75± 0.3) measured by VERITAS
for VER J2019+368 in Aliu et al. (2014) resembles Vela"
"X. The morphology of Vela X, the only other PWN sys-"
"tem exhibiting double tori, powered by a pulsar simi-"
"lar to PSR J2021+3651, also favors this as a source of"
high energy leptons (Hessels et al. 2004; Van Etten et al.
2008).
The Cygnus region is prominently visible in HAWC
Observatory sky-maps. 2HWC J2019+367 is the source
associated with MGRO J2019+37 and VER J2019+368
(Abeysekara et al. 2017a). Our updated analysis al-
"lows measurements of γ-ray flux above 50 TeV, which is"
critical for observing sources like eHWC J2019+368(one
of three HAWC sources that have significant emission
above 100 TeV). The emission in this energy regime
makes eHWC J2019+368 the site of one of the most en-
ergetic particle accelerators in our galaxy (Abeysekara
et al. 2020).
We will examine the morphology and spectrum of this
"source in this work, which combines and extends the"
prior analyses presented in (Brisbois 2019; Joshi 2019).
The study of the energy-dependent morphology will con-
tribute towards establishing the nature of the TeV emis-
sion. This is enabled by recent improvements to en-
ergy estimation and corresponding sky-maps available
for the HAWC data (Abeysekara et al. 2019). Addition-
"ally, the high-energy sensitivity will enable us to probe"
spectral features such as the existence of a spectral soft-
"ening beyond the VERITAS energy range, which would"
be expected if the TeV emission originates from inverse
Compton (IC) scattering. Significant softening in the
"spectrum favors a leptonic scenario, because of the sup-"
pression of the γ-ray emission due to Klein-Nishina (KN)
effects (Moderksi et al. 2005).
2. DATA AND METHODS
The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) obser-
vatory is an extensive air shower array sensitive to as-
trophysical γ-ray flux from ∼300 GeV to >100 TeV. It
"is located at 18◦59′41′′N, 97◦18′30.6′′W on Sierra Ne-"
gra in Mexico. HAWC consists of 300 Water Cherenkov
"Detectors (WCDs), which each contain four Photomul-"
tiplier Tubes (PMTs). More information on the design
and construction of HAWC can be found in Abeysekara
et al. (2017a). The HAWC analysis here uses the same
ground parameter energy reconstruction technique pre-
sented in Abeysekara et al. (2019) with data from June
2015 to July 2018 totaling 1038.8 days of data.
The γ-ray spectrum and morphology are fit simulta-
neously using the Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood
(3ML) Framework with the hawc hal plugin (Vianello
"et al. 2015, 2018). The analysis was performed using a"
Region Of Interest (ROI) with a 3◦ radius centered at
"(l,b)=(75◦,0.3◦). This ROI is shown in Figure 1."
"First, the optimal morphological model of the source"
is determined. This morphology study only considers
power law spectral models. Once the best morphological
"model is found, a search for spectral curvature is per-"
"formed, using the optimal morphological model found in"
the first study and again fitting the parameters for the
morphology of the HAWC J2019+368.
"A likelihood ratio (difference in test statistic: ∆TS = −
2 log(L0/L1), following the same convention in Abey-"
sekara et al. (2020)) is performed for nested models to
"determine which model is preferred. However, when"
"models are not nested, the Bayesian Information Crite-"
rion (BIC) is used (Kass & Raftery 1995; Liddle 2007).
This is particularly important for comparing exponen-
tially cutoff power laws and log parabolic spectral mod-
"els, which have the same number of degrees of freedom."
An additional study is performed looking for energy-
dependent morphology or a shift in the centroid of emis-
sion by making longitudinal profiles oriented along the
position angle of the line joining the PSR J2021+3651
and the best fit location of HAWC J2019+368. This is
"similar to that performed in Aliu et al. (2014), Aharo-"
"nian et al. (2006), and Abdalla et al. (2019). This study"
is distinct from the previous morphological/spectral
"study, and only considers the morphology of the excess"
counts above the background. This approach allows us
to probe the morphological features in the data with-
out assuming a particular model of the morphology and
spectrum. The details and results are described in Sec-
tion 4.
"Finally, using GAMERA (Hahn 2016) these results"
are used to examine the underlying particle distribution
under the assumption that they are produced by Inverse
Compton (IC) scattering. More details on the modeling
and interpretation are discussed in Section 5 and 6.
3. MORPHOLOGICAL AND SPECTRAL FIT

"Figure 1. Significance map with relevant sources labelled
assuming an α = −2.7 spectrum. The ROI is indicated
by the black circular contour. VERITAS source positions
are taken from Abeysekara et al. (2018). The position of
PSR J2021+3651 is taken from Roberts et al. (2002)."
"As shown in Figure 1, this region is dominated by"
emission near the center of the ROI. The best-fit model
is comprised of two sources: HAWC J2019+368 and
HAWC J2016+371 on top of a uniform background.
The background accounts for emission from extended
"sources potentially leaking into the ROI, such as one"
"or more extended or diffuse γ-ray sources. At first,"
"when considering a single source morphological hy-
pothesis, a significant excess was seen nearly coinci-"
"dent with VER J2016+371. Adding a point source,"
"HAWC J2016+371, at the location of the maximum"
residual improved the model by ∆TS = 39.0. The need
"for a second source is also clear from Figure 2, where a"
5σ excess is visible at the location of VER J2016+371.
"Then, including a uniform background source im-"
proved the model consisting of HAWC J2019+368 and
"HAWC J2016+371 by ∆TS = 29.3. This model,"
"consisting of two γ-ray sources and a background, is"
then taken as the nominal source model of the re-
gion. HAWC J2019+368 and HAWC J2016+371 are
"located at (RA, Dec) = (304.92◦, 36.76◦) and (RA,"
"Dec) = (304.1◦, 37.2◦), respectively. The model for"
"HAWC J2019+268 is an elliptical gaussian shape, with"
"parameters for the semimajor axis (a), eccentricity (e),"
and rotation describing the angle between the line of

constant declination and the major axis (θrot). The
"model corresponds to an ellipse with minor axis 0.12◦±
0.02◦. The pointing uncertainty on the source positions"
is 0.10◦ (Abeysekara et al. 2017b).
A study looking for curvature in the spectrum of
HAWC J2019+368 is then performed. A log parabola
(power law with exponential cutoff) spectral assump-
tion for HAWC J2019+368 is significantly preferred over
a pure power law model by ∆TS = 69.0 (58.9). Us-
ing BIC to find the preferred model between the (non-
"nested) curved spectral models, a log parabola spectrum"
is preferred with a ∆BIC = 10.1. The best fit parame-
ters for the reported log parabola spectrum are shown
in Table 1. The best fit parameters for an exponentially
cutoff power law are shown in Table 2. The spectral en-
ergy distribution of HAWC J2019+368 is shown in Fig-
"ure 3, with the VERITAS data points from Abeysekara"
et al. (2018) scaled by 2.7 according to the procedure de-
scribed in Section 3.1. The HAWC J2016+371 spectral
"energy distribution is shown in Figure 4, with the cor-"
responding data points from Abeysekara et al. (2018).
HAWC J2016+371 was not significantly detected in any
"individual energy bin, and therefore only the fit is re-"
ported here.

The systematic uncertainty bands shown in Figures 3

above while varying the simulated model of HAWC. The
same procedure and detector response files were used to
produce the systematic uncertainty band as in Abey-

mined by adding a step function cutoff to the nominal

the nominal model and the nominal model with the cut-

energies and once at the lower energies— to determine
the energy range over which this model describes the
source.
3.1. Comparison to VERITAS measurements
"6 Brisbois, Joshi et al."
"Figure 5. VERITAS Morphology map of VER J2019+368
(taken from Abeysekara et al. (2018)). The smaller red con-
tour is the 0.23◦ extraction region from which the spectrum
reported in Abeysekara et al. (2018) is taken. The larger red
dashed contour is the 0.5◦ from which the spectrum reported
in Aliu et al. (2014) is taken. The black elliptical contour is
the 1σ contour for the morphology reported in this work for
HAWC J2019+368. The color scale is arbitrary and scaled
such that the maximal pixel value is 1."
"From their studies published in 2014 and 2018, the"
VERITAS collaboration extracted a spectrum from a
smaller region than the reported morphology of the
source (Aliu et al. 2014; Abeysekara et al. 2018). This is
"different from HAWC, where the morphology and spec-"
trum are fit simultaneously in the ROI. This leads to
a predictable systematic offset in the reported flux be-
tween the two instruments when two conditions are met:
the measured morphology by VERITAS is larger than
"the extraction region, and the morphologies measured"
by HAWC and VERITAS are similar. This is not as
significant an issue for sources that appear point-like for
both instruments such as VER J2016+371 (Abeysekara
et al. 2018) and HAWC J2016+371 (this work) or the
Crab Nebula (Abeysekara et al. 2019; Meagher 2015).
"To account for this, we divide the flux reported by"
VERITAS by the fraction of the reported morphology
contained within the extraction region. This has the
effect of scaling the flux up to the morphology by a factor
"of 2.71, under the assumption that the spectrum is the"
same for the entire source extent. In Figure 5 one can
see that a substantial fraction of the source reported in
Aliu et al. (2014) and Abeysekara et al. (2018) is not
contained by the extraction region used to report the
spectrum.
4. ENERGY DEPENDENT MORPHOLOGY
To study the potential energy-dependent morphology
"of HAWC J2019+368, we examine the longitudinal pro-"
file of the data. The profile of the excess counts over
the background is obtained within a region of the sky
in different energy bands. The quarter decade energy
bins were combined into four energy bands from 0.3-1.7
"TeV, 1.7-10 TeV, 10-56 TeV, and 56-316 TeV to perform"
the study. A selection of the 2D bins ( as described in
Abeysekara et al. (2019)) is done in each energy band
"(fraction hit bins greater than 2, 5, 7, and 9 for the"
"energy bands 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively) so that the"
best Point Spread Function (PSF) possible is retained
without significantly losing statistics in each bin.
The region taken for the profiles is centered at the
location of the PSR J2021+3651. The orientation
"of the region is along the position angle of −77.90◦,
which is the line joining the PSR J2021+3651 and"
HAWC J2019+368 positions. This orientation was cho-
sen to test the hypothesis that the peak of the TeV
emission would move to the pulsar location with in-
creasing energy together with the change in the size of
the emission region.

the four reconstructed energy bands and are shown"

trum of HAWC J2019+368. The measured spectrum
for HAWC J2019+368 also shows that the first signifi-
"cant flux point is at > 2 TeV (see Figure 3), which is"
in agreement with the upper bound of the first energy
band at 1.77 TeV. We see significant excess in energy
"bands 2, 3, and 4, which corresponds to the energy range"
above 1.77 TeV. The excess profiles were fitted with a
Gaussian function and examined for size and location of
the centroid of emission relative to PSR J2021+3651.
To estimate the size of the PSF in each longitudinal
"profile, we simulated a point source at the location of"
PSR J2021+3651 with a power law of spectral index 2.2.
"Similarly, excess count profiles are obtained and fitted"
with a Gaussian for this simulated point source. This 1σ
width of the fitted Gaussian is hereafter referred to as
PSF′ for the purposes of this study. The PSF′ obtained
for different energy bands are shown in the right panel
of Figure 6.

width of the fitted Gaussian as shown in Figure 6. The PSF′
"is corrected for the systematic difference of 0.05◦ between
data and simulations (see Section 4). The mean position of
the fitted Gaussian is used to calculate the distance to the
pulsar location."
In Figure 7 we show the size and distance of the peak
TeV emission with respect to the pulsar location in en-
"ergy bands 2, 3, and 4 using the excess count profiles."
The size was obtained by subtracting the 1σ width of
the PSF′ in quadrature from the 1σ fit size of the excess
profiles in each energy band. The 1σ width of the PSF′
was corrected by 0.05◦ to account for a systematic differ-
ence of 5% between simulations and data (Abeysekara
et al. 2019). The distance to the pulsar was calculated
from the mean position of the excess profile fit. There is
a very mild indication of the decrease in size with energy
"bands of increasing energy. However, the uncertainty on"
the measured size is large and there is no significant shift
towards the pulsar position with increasing energy.
5. SPECTRAL MODELING
Amongst the different scenarios that can explain the
"multi-wavelength emission from HAWC J2019+368, the"
observed spatial association between the X-ray and TeV
"emission, as well as the mild indication that the size of"
"the TeV emission shrinks with increasing energy, seem to"
point towards a leptonic origin. Therefore we limit this
analysis to a leptonic scenario. Exploring a hadronic or
a lepto-hadronic origin of the TeV emission and their
comparison is beyond the scope of this work.
"In this section, we present a model assuming a leptonic"
scenario where the emission is originated by a PWN
powered by PSR J2021+3651. The observed period (P )
"and its time derivative (Ṗ ) are 104 ms and 9.57× 10−14
s s−1, respectively, for PSR J2021+3651 (Roberts et al."
"2002). The characteristic age, τc, of the pulsar is 17.2"
kyr (see Equation 1). It is worthwhile to note that the
"τc is only an accurate measure of the pulsar age,"
(n− 1)Ṗ
"(
P0
P"
")n−1]
, (1)"
when the assumption of braking index n = 3 and the
"birth period P0 � P is true (Gaensler & Slane 2006).
For the distance to the pulsar, the dispersion-based"
"measurement is quite large, ≥ 10 kpc (Roberts et al.
2002), which conflicts with distance derived consider-"
ing the X-ray measurements (Van Etten et al. 2008) of
"∼ 4 kpc. The recent study of Chandra archival X-ray
data by Kirichenko et al. (2015), taking into account an"
extinction-distance relation using the red-clump stars as
"standard candles in the line of sight, suggests a distance"
"of ∼1.8 kpc. Therefore in this work, we will be using
the distance of 1.8 kpc."
"In the following, we will describe the model in Sec-"
tion 5.1 and then move to two scenarios where the model
will be used to describe the observed X-ray and TeV
"emission together. In the first scenario, designated the"
"one zone model (see Section 5.2), the observed X-ray and"
the whole range of TeV emission are described together.
"However, it is not ideal to model the X-ray emission be-"
tween 2 and 10 keV (hard X-ray emission) together with
"8 Brisbois, Joshi et al."
"TeV emission between ∼1 TeV and at least ∼100 TeV γ-
ray energy because different components of the parent"
electron population (hereafter meaning both electrons
and positrons) are responsible for the emission measured
at X-ray and TeV energies. The size of the X-ray emis-
"sion, ∼4′ × 10′ in full width at half maximum (Mizuno
et al. 2017), is very small compared to the HAWC TeV"
"emission of size ∼20′×50′ (1σ containment, see Table 1).
The component of the electron population emitting hard"
X-rays at 2-10 keV must be the one emitting the high-
est energy γ-rays at several tens of TeV and must be of
higher energy than the one responsible for the extended
TeV emission. This is because lower energy electrons
have longer cooling timescales and can still produce TeV
emission by traveling farther.
"In the second scenario, the two zone model (see Sec-"
"tion 5.3), the X-ray emission is compared with the high-"
est energy TeV emission. Only the recently injected
electrons will be used to describe the X-ray emission
together with the whole history of injected electrons to
describe the TeV emission. The possibility of undetected
"X-ray emission, comparable to the size of the TeV emis-"
sion region will be taken into account to describe the
whole history of the system.
5.1. Model Considerations
The pulsar braking index is assumed to be n = 3.
"The cut-off energy (Emax), the birth period (P0), and"
the conversion efficiency (�) are treated as unknown pa-
rameters to describe the injected particle spectrum. The
true age (τ) of the system is calculated as a function of
P0 using Equation 1 instead of using the characteristic
age (τc).
We used the GAMERA software to perform the spec-
tral modelling (Hahn 2016). GAMERA can define a
"time-dependent model of relativistic electrons, including"
"injection and cooling, and output the associated photon"
emission given a set of radiation fields. We consider
a broken power-law with an exponential cut-off for the
spectrum of the injected electrons. The break in the
injected electron spectrum is believed to be due to two
different electron populations (wind and radio) which
dominate below and above the break energy (Eb) respec-
tively. The value of Eb and the injection spectral indices
of the radio and wind populations are set to be their typ-
"ical values of 0.1 TeV, −1.5, and −2.0 (Meyer et al. 2010;
Atoyan & Aharonian 1996). A cut-off is treated as a free"
parameter because the injected particles (e±) can only
be accelerated up to a certain maximum energy (Emax)
(Zhang et al. 2008; Gaensler & Slane 2006). The radi-
ation fields used to calculate the IC emission are calcu-
lated from the model presented in Popescu et al. (2017)
at the location of PSR J2021+3651.
"The time evolution of the parameters B, Ė, and P are"
specified following Gaensler & Slane (2006). The spin-
down time scale (τ0) of the system is an important input
for defining the time evolution of electrons in the system
(Gaensler & Slane 2006; Venter & de Jager 2007). The
spin-down timescale can be expressed as a function of
"P0 as τ0 = P
2
0P
−1/(2Ṗ ) (Gaensler & Slane 2006). This"
allows us to choose the birth period of the pulsar that
gives the best fit to the data. The nebular B-field is given
"by B(t) = B0[1 + (t/τ0)
0.5]−1. The normalization of the"
"injected particle spectrum is determined by � × Ė(t),
the fraction of the spin-down luminosity going into the"
production of electrons. The function Ė(t) is defined as
"Ė(t) = Ė0 (1 + t/τ0)
−2"
". Lastly, the pulsar slows down"
"its rotation according to P (t) = P0 (1 + t/τ0)

"This way, our data constrains the birth period and"
also estimates the true age of the system. The injected
particle spectrum for given values of assumed and un-
known parameters is then evolved in the presence of
magnetic and radiation fields to calculate the evolved
particle spectrum as shown in Figure 8. The evolved
particle spectrum is used to calculate the emitted pho-
"ton spectrum, which is then matched to the observed"
X-ray and TeV emission.
5.2. One Zone Model

The emitted photon spectrum of the one zone model
is shown in Figure 9. The model synchrotron (dashed
lines) and IC (solid lines) emission are manually tuned
to match the observed X-ray and γ-ray emission. It can
be seen that the model synchrotron and IC emission are
reasonably consistent with the observed X-ray and γ-ray
data SED.

is tuned manually to provide an approximate match to the
X-ray and γ-ray emission in the whole energy range. The
present-day B-field is 2 µG"
The estimated value of the present day magnetic field
"is 2 µG, which is low (relative to the ISM) and depends"
on the relative normalization of the peak of the syn-
"chrotron and IC emission. The estimated value for P0
of 80 ms corresponds to an age of ∼7 kyr for the sys-
tem. The required conversion efficiency (�) of pulsar"
"spin-down power to particle injection is 5%, with the"
estimated cut-off energy (Emax) of the injected particle
"spectrum being 300 TeV. However, there are certain lim-"
itations of the outcomes of the one zone model mainly
pertaining to the obtained B-field of 2 µG. The esti-
mated value of the B-field is very low in comparison
to all expectations for a PWN and to the mean B-field
"of the local ISM (∼ 3µG). This model would predict
identical X-ray and γ-ray morphology, which is in con-"
"tradiction with the observations, as the observed size of"
the X-ray PWN is significantly smaller than that of the
TeV emission.
5.3. Two Zone Model
The low magnetic field derived in the one-zone model
indicates that describing the TeV and hard X-ray (2-10
keV) emission together using the whole electron popu-
lation is not optimal. The limitations of the one zone
model can be resolved by considering that the electrons
producing hard X-rays are only a subset of the total
electron population emitting γ-rays. The energy of an
"electron (Ee, as given in Mizuno et al. (2017)), emitting"
"synchrotron radiation with mean energy EX−ray, due to"
"a magnetic field B, is given by"
"Ee ' 132 TeV

Assuming a minimum magnetic field strength of 3µG
(equal to the local ISM) the corresponding parent elec-
"tron population component should be of energy ∼300
TeV for 5 keV X-rays (Mizuno et al. 2017)."
Given the radiation fields from the model at 300 TeV
"electron energies, the most relevant radiation field is the"
"Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), with a magnetic"
"field strength of ∼3µG. The relevant cooling timescales
are of the order of ∼2 kyr using"

where ET is the target photon energy (Hinton & Hof-

observed normalization of X-ray emission such that the
electrons currently producing hard X-rays are as much
"as 2 kyr old, resulting in a required present day B-field"
of 3.5 µG. To match the model synchrotron and IC peak
"to the observed X-ray and TeV emission peak, a birth"
"period of 80 ms is required, therefore the true age of the"
system for the two-zone model agrees with the one-zone
"model with a value of ∼7 kyr. However, due to the in-
creased B-field, the conversion efficiency is marginally"
increased to a value of 6.5% in this case. The cut-off en-
ergy in the injected particle spectrum remains the same.

"the total injection history of ∼7 kyr. In this case, the to-
tal synchrotron emission overshoots the observed X-ray"
SED by a factor of 4-5 at 2 keV. This may be due to the
smaller region on the sky observed by the X-ray obser-
"vations compared to the TeV observations, and result in"
some of the emission being unmeasured. It is also men-
tioned by Mizuno et al. (2017) that the observed X-ray
emission should be taken as the lower limit.
"The X-ray emission seen by Suzaku is ∼4′× 10′ in full
width at half maximum (Mizuno et al. 2017) while the γ-"
"ray emission is about ∼20′×50′ using the same measure,
meaning the TeV emission seen by HAWC is a factor"
of 25 larger in solid angle compared to the Suzaku ob-
servations. The dimmest reported flux from the Suzaku
"observations is ∼1.7×10−13 erg cm−2 s−1 in a 5′×3′ re-
gion (Mizuno et al. 2017). By scaling this flux in X-rays"
from the smaller observed region to the HAWC emission
"region, one would get a factor of 2-3 higher in measured"
X-ray flux.
"The peak of the X-ray SED at 2 keV is about ∼4 ×
10−12 erg cm−2 s−1, therefore by taking into account the"
"expected missing emission it would be around∼1×10−11
erg cm−2 s−1. On Figure 10 the present day synchrotron"
"peak is near the value of ∼10−11 erg cm−2 s−1, whereas
the observed peak is coincides with the most recent ∼2
kyr of emission. The observed γ-ray emission can be"
"compared to the model emission, where it can be seen"
that the model’s present-day IC emission is reasonably
consistent with the observed TeV emission.
6. DISCUSSION
To examine the obtained birth period (P0) of 80
"ms and true age (τ) of ∼ 7 kyr, one can compare
HAWC J2019+368 with the observed behaviour of"
HESS J1825-137. Both of these sources are bright ex-
tended TeV sources with similar associated pulsars. The
associated pulsar of HESS J1825-137 is PSR B1823-13.
The comparison of the pulsar properties of PSR J2021-
3651 and PSR B1823-13 is shown in Table 3.
"It can be seen that both pulsars have similar P , Ṗ , Ė,"
"and τc. However, the main difference lies in the observed"
γ-ray luminosities of these two systems. For a given
distance of 1.8 kpc and 4 kpc for HAWC J2019+368
"and HESS J1825-137, respectively, the integrated γ-"
"ray luminosities are ∼ 1033 and ∼ 1035 erg s−1, re-
spectively. In order to match the γ-ray luminosity of"
"HAWC J2019+368 to the one for HESS J1825-137, the"
distance to the HAWC J2019+368 system would have to
"be ∼18 kpc. However, with the previous distance mea-
surements this seems to be very unlikely (see Section"
"5.1). In both systems, the assumed conversion efficiency"
of spin-down power of the pulsar to e± are below 10%
(Aharonian et al. 2006). Assuming the radiation fields
"in both systems do not differ drastically, and with simi-"
"lar B-fields of a few µG, the energy conversion efficiency"
of e± to γ-ray production should be similar for both.
One possible explanation for the differing luminosities
is that PSR J2021+3651 has a larger P0 (80 ms in this
"work) compared to PSR B1823-13 (∼1 ms or ∼15 ms,
from Khangulyan et al. (2018); Principe et al. (2020))."
Due to the similar present day P and Ṗ of the two sys-
"tems and assuming Ṗ did not change rapidly in the past,"
PSR B1823-13 must have injected more power into the
system compared to PSR J2021+3651.
"The larger P0 of PSR J2021+3651, in turn, makes the"
"HAWC J2019+368 system younger (∼7 kyr) compared
to its characteristic age of ∼17 kyr. This interpreta-
tion agrees with the peak emission energies of HESS"
"J1825-137 and HAWC J2019+368, which are at ∼0.1
TeV (Principe et al. 2020) and ∼20 TeV (Figure 3), re-
spectively. Given the pulsars’ observed similarity, the"
pulsar powering HAWC J2019+368 system should be
younger than the one powering HESS J1825-137 to ex-
plain the different spectral features at TeV energies: the

One can estimate the parent electron population en-"
ergy for a given γ-ray photon energy in the Thompson
"regime (only assuming CMB, see Longair (2011)) as:"
"Ee ' 17.2 TeV
(
Eγ−ray
1TeV"
")0.5
. (5)"
"For a 20 TeV photon, the parent electron population"
"would be of energy ∼80 TeV. The KN effect only starts
to dominate above tens of TeV of corresponding γ-ray"
energies (assuming electrons are only scattering off of
"CMB photons). Using equation 3, the corresponding"
cooling timescale for 80 TeV electrons in a 3.5 µG B-field
"and CMB are of the order of ∼9 kyr, which is similar to
the estimated age of the system, ∼7 kyr. The electrons
with energies > 80 TeV are already cooled, making the"
"TeV spectrum softer above γ-ray energies of ∼20 TeV.
The lower-energy electron population < 80 TeV has not"
"cooled yet, making the spectral index hard up to 20 TeV"
in γ-ray energies. This can also be seen from Figure 8
where the break in the evolved particle spectrum can be
"seen at ∼80 TeV.
It is also to be noted that Aliu et al. (2014) showed"
cone-shaped radio emission starting at the pulsar loca-
tion and extending towards the centroid of TeV emission
for VER J2019+368. The positions of VER J2019+368
"(RA, Dec = 304.846◦, 36.779◦) and HAWC J2019+368"
"(RA, Dec = 304.92◦, 36.76◦) are separated by 0.06◦,"
which is within the VERITAS PSF (0.1◦ above 1 TeV)
and HAWC PSF (0.1◦-0.3◦ for the events above 3.16
TeV depending on the bin) (Aliu et al. 2014; Abey-
"sekara et al. 2018, 2019). Both observations indepen-"
dently support the claim that emission at TeV energies
"is offset from the pulsar location (RA, Dec = 305.27275◦,"
36.85133◦) by approximately 0.3◦ (Abdo et al. 2009).
This is because the lower energy (< 80 TeV) electrons
can still emit in TeV energies via IC due to their longer
"cooling timescales, and within that time the pulsar had"
"moved to its present location. On the other hand, due to"
the higher energies of the X-ray emitting electrons and
"therefore smaller cooling timescales, the X-ray emission"
is closer to the pulsar position (Mizuno et al. 2017). If
we assume that the pulsar was born at the location of
"HAWC J2019+368, and assume that the current loca-"
"tion of the pulsar is due to only its proper motion, the"
"transverse velocity would be ∼1300 km s−1. The ob-
tained transverse velocity is certainly at the higher end"
of the pulsar transverse velocity distribution (Faucher-
"Giguere & Kaspi 2006), however it would not be unre-"
alistic.
The measured extension of HAWC J2019+368 is
about 0.36◦ along the major axis obtained from the
morphology fit using an asymmetric 2D Gaussian as
"described in Section 3, which would correspond to a"
"projected size of ∼11 pc. In the energy-dependent mor-
phology study (see Section 4), energy band 3 has similar"
size and corresponds to the energy range between 10 and
"56 TeV. The median γ-ray energy in this band is ∼23
TeV, which corresponds to electron energy of about ∼80
TeV (using Equation 5)."
"Using these pieces of information, we may comment"
on the transport of electrons in an advection or diffusion
scenario. Recalling that the cooling timescale of mono-
"energetic 80 TeV electrons is ∼9 kyr, the corresponding
advective transport speed of electrons is about ∼1200
km s−1. The Bohm diffusion coefficient is D(E) ="
"ηrgc/3, where rg = 3.3×1015(E/10TeV)(B/10µG)−1cm
and c is the speed of light in vacuum (Aharonian 2004)."
"In the case of Bohm diffusion (η = 1), the diffusion"
"coefficient in a 3.5 µG B-field would be ∼ 7.5 × 1026
cm2 s−1. This value is similar to the case of Geminga"
and B0656+14 where the diffusion coefficient is much
smaller than the ISM value derived from the boron-
to-carbon ratio (Abeysekara et al. 2017c). The latter
"can be expressed as: D(E) = D(10GeV)(E/10GeV)δ,"
"where D(10GeV) ∼1028 cm2 s−1 and δ = 0.5 (Aharo-
nian 2004), which would yield a value of ∼9× 1029 cm2
s−1 for ∼80 TeV electrons."
If diffusion is the mechanism dominating the trans-
"port for HAWC J2019+368, it would imply that the"
magnetic field is much more turbulent than the average
"12 Brisbois, Joshi et al."
"in the ISM, which is not surprising considering that we"
are in a region heavily dominated by the pulsar wind.
"Hence, the advection velocity or diffusion coefficient is"
constrained by the morphology of the TeV emission re-
"gion. However, a detailed study of transport mecha-"
nisms (advection/diffusion) would require a better mea-
surement of energy-dependent morphology.
7. CONCLUSIONS
"In this work, we have performed the first detailed"
spectral and morphological study using HAWC data
"of the region surrounding MGRO J2019+37, re-"
solving it into the sources HAWC J2019+368 and
HAWC J2016+371. The morphology and spectrum
in this work agrees well with the VERITAS measure-
ments from Aliu et al. (2014) and Abeysekara et al.
"(2018), consisting of an elliptical Gaussian source (for"
HAWC J2019+368 and VER J2019+368) and point
source (for HAWC J2016+371 and VER J2016+371).
The agreement between HAWC and VERITAS for the
spectrum and morphology in this region is an impor-
tant milestone in comparisons between IACTs and
"ground array detectors like HAWC. Previously, differ-"
ences between measured spectra and morphology were
attributed to not well understood systematic differences
(Abeysekara et al. 2017a). These differences may now
be explainable and quantifiable (in some cases) as the
difference between the extraction region used to produce
"the spectrum, and the morphology measured."
The detection of HAWC J2016+371 confirms the
source VER J2016+371. Given its very recent con-
"firmation as a PWN via X-ray measurements, as the"
"HAWC exposure to this source grows, it may be useful"
to examine the emission from this source in detail to
"see if its TeV emission is similar to other PWNe, or if"
the supernova remnant hosting the nebula may be ac-
celerating protons to TeV energies (Guest et al. 2020).
Determining the origin of the uniform background γ-ray
source in the morphology model is an important subject
for future study.
We find that the emission from HAWC J2019+368
together with the X-ray data is well described via emis-
sion from a young PWN system powered by a ∼7 kyr
old pulsar. This allows us to estimate the PWN proper-
"ties of the system such as the magnetic field, the pulsar"
"spin-down energy to electron conversion efficiency, and"
the maximum electron energy. Follow-up studies at X-
ray energies may find a spatially extended emission re-
gion that might agree with the morphology measured by
"HAWC and VERITAS, a finding which would support"
the two zone model of electrons described in this work.
The energy-dependent morphology study does not
show conclusive evidence in favor of shrinking size with
increasing energy due to large uncertainties in the mea-
"surements. Nevertheless, it enables us to constrain the"
particle transport in a PWN system. This may be im-
proved upon with more data in the future. The recent
upgrade of HAWC with an outrigger array will play a
crucial role by increasing HAWC’s sensitivity to showers
at the highest energies as it increases the instrumented
area of HAWC by a factor of 4-5 (Marandon et al. 2019;
Joshi & Schoorlemmer 2019).
