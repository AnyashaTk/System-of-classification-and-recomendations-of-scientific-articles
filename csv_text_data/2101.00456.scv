ABSTRACT
"Context. The efficiency of the different processes responsible for the evolution of interstellar dust on the scale of a galaxy, are to date
very uncertain, spanning several orders of magnitude in the literature. Yet, a precise knowledge of the grain properties is the key to
addressing numerous open questions about the physics of the interstellar medium and galaxy evolution.
Aims. This article presents an empirical statistical study, aimed at quantifying the timescales of the main cosmic dust evolution
processes, as a function of the global properties of a galaxy.
Methods. We have modelled a sample of ' 800 nearby galaxies, spanning a wide range of metallicity, gas fraction, specific star
formation rate and Hubble stage. We have derived the dust properties of each object from its spectral energy distribution. Through an
additional level of analysis, we have inferred the timescales of dust condensation in core-collapse supernova ejecta, grain growth in
cold clouds and dust destruction by shock waves. Throughout this paper, we have adopted a hierarchical Bayesian approach, resulting
in a single large probability distribution of all the parameters of all the galaxies, to ensure the most rigorous interpretation of our data.
Results. We confirm the drastic evolution with metallicity of the dust-to-metal mass ratio (by two orders of magnitude), found by
previous studies. We show that dust production by core-collapse supernovae is efficient only at very low-metallicity, a single supernova
producing on average less than ' 0.03 M�/SN of dust. Our data indicate that grain growth is the dominant formation mechanism at
metallicity above ' 1/5 solar, with a grain growth timescale shorter than ' 50 Myr at solar metallicity. Shock destruction is relatively
efficient, a single supernova clearing dust on average in at least ' 1200 M�/SN of gas. These results are robust when assuming different
stellar initial mass functions. In addition, we show that early-type galaxies are outliers in several scaling relations. This feature could
result from grain thermal sputtering in hot X-ray emitting gas, an hypothesis supported by a negative correlation between the dust-to-
stellar mass ratio and the X-ray photon rate per grain. Finally, we confirm the well-known evolution of the aromatic-feature-emitting
grain mass fraction as a function of metallicity and interstellar radiation field intensity. Our data indicate the relation with metallicity
is significantly stronger.
Conclusions. Our results provide valuable constraints for simulations of galaxies. They imply that grain growth is the likely dust
production mechanism in dusty high-redshift objects. We also emphasize the determinant role of local low-metallicity systems to
address these questions."

1. INTRODUCTION
"Characterizing the dust properties across different galactic envi-
ronments is an important milestone towards understanding the
physics of the InterStellar Medium (ISM) and galaxy evolution
(Galliano et al. 2018, for a review). Interstellar grains have a ne-
farious role of obscuring our direct view of star formation (e.g.
Bianchi et al. 2018). The subsequent unreddening of Ultravi-
olet-(UV)-visible observations relies on assumptions about the
constitution and size distribution of the grains, as well as on the
relative star-dust geometry (e.g. Witt et al. 1992; Witt & Gordon
2000; Baes & Dejonghe 2001). Dust is also involved in several
important physical processes, such as the photoelectric heating
of the gas in PhotoDissociation Regions (PDR; e.g. Draine 1978;
Kimura 2016) or H2 formation (e.g. Gould & Salpeter 1963;
Bron et al. 2014). The uncertainties about the grain properties
have dramatic consequences on the rate of these processes and
are the main cause of discrepancy between PDR models (Röl-
lig et al. 2007). Finally, state-of-the-art numerical simulations of
galaxy evolution are now post-processed to incorporate the full
treatment of dust radiative transfer in order to reproduce realistic
observables (e.g. Camps et al. 2016, 2018; Trayford et al. 2017;
Rodriguez-Gomez et al. 2019; Trčka et al. 2020). These simula-
tions rely on assumptions about the dust emissivity, absorption
and scattering properties, which changes from galaxy to galaxy
(e.g. Clark et al. 2019; Bianchi et al. 2019)."
"We are far from being able to predict the dust composition,
structure and size distribution, in a given ISM condition. Ab ini-
tio methods are currently impractical because of the great com-
plexity of the problem. Empirical approaches face challenges,
too. The last four decades have shown that each time we were in-
vestigating a particular observable with the hope of constraining
the grain properties, these properties were proving themselves
more elusive because of their evolution, as illustrated in the fol-
lowing."
"– The diversity of extinction curve shapes within the Milky
Way (Fitzpatrick 1986; Cardelli et al. 1989) and the Magel-
lanic Clouds (Gordon et al. 2003) can be explained by vari-
ations of the size distribution and carbon-to-silicate grain ra-
tio (Pei 1992; Kim et al. 1994; Clayton et al. 2003; Cartledge
et al. 2005)."
"– Elemental depletion patterns strongly depend on the density
of the medium, suggesting that dust is partly destroyed and
reformed in the ISM (Savage & Mathis 1979; Crinklaw et al.
1994; Jenkins 2009; Parvathi et al. 2012)."
"– Variations of the InfraRed (IR) to submillimeter (submm)
emissivity as a function of the density of the medium,
whether in the Milky Way (Stepnik et al. 2003; Ysard
et al. 2015) or in the Magellanic clouds (Roman-Duval
et al. 2017), are interpreted as variations of the grain man-
tle thickness and composition, and grain-grain coagulation
(e.g. Köhler et al. 2015; Ysard et al. 2016)."
"– The wide variability of the relative intensity and band-to-
band ratio of the mid-IR aromatic feature spectrum, wit-
nessed within the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, is the evi-
dence of the variation of the abundance, charge and size dis-
tribution of the band carriers (e.g. Boulanger et al. 1998;
Madden et al. 2006; Galliano et al. 2008b; Schirmer et al.
2020)."
"– The wavelength-dependent polarization fraction in extinc-
tion and emission provides additional constraints on the
composition of the grains, as well as on their shape and align-
ment (e.g. Andersson et al. 2015; Fanciullo et al. 2017)."
"To understand the evolution of the global dust content of a
galaxy, one must be able to quantify the timescales of the pro-
cesses responsible for dust formation and destruction. These pro-
cesses can be categorized as follows."
"Stardust production takes place primarily in the ejecta of:
(i) Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars; and (ii) type II Su-
perNovae (SN II; core-collapse SN). SNe II potentially dom-
inate the net stardust injection rate (e.g. Draine 2009, for a
review), but their actual yield is the subject of an intense de-
bate. Most of the controversy lies in the fact that, while large
amounts could form in SN II ejecta (e.g. Matsuura et al.
2015; Temim et al. 2017), a large fraction of freshly formed
grains could not survive the reverse shock (e.g. Nozawa et al.
2006; Micelotta et al. 2016; Kirchschlager et al. 2019). Es-
timates of the net dust yield of a single SN ranges in the
literature from ' 10−3 to 1 M�/SN (e.g. Todini & Ferrara
2001; Ercolano et al. 2007; Bianchi & Schneider 2007; Boc-
chio et al. 2016; Marassi et al. 2019)."
"Grain growth in the ISM refers to the addition of gas atoms
onto pre-existing dust seeds (e.g. Hirashita 2012). It could be
the main grain formation process, happening on timescales
. 1 Myr (e.g. Draine 2009). It is however challenged due to
the lack of direct constraints and because we currently lack
a proven dust formation mechanism, at cold temperatures."
"Grain destruction can be attributed to: (i) astration, i.e. their
incorporation into stellar interiors during star formation;
(ii) sputtering and shattering by SN blast waves. The sec-
ond process is the most debated, although it is less contro-
versial than stardust production and grain growth efficien-
cies. Timescales for grain destruction in the Milky Way range
from ' 200 Myr to ' 2 Gyr (Jones et al. 1994; Slavin et al.
2015)."
"In the Milky Way, there is a convergent set of evidence pointing
toward a scenario where: (i) stardust accounts for at most ' 10 %
of ISM dust; (ii) most grains are therefore grown in the ISM
(e.g. Draine & Salpeter 1979; Dwek & Scalo 1980; Jones et al.
1994; Tielens 1998; Draine 2009). The goal of this paper is to
explore how particular environments could affect these conclu-
sions, by modelling nearby extragalactic systems. By studying
nearby galaxies, we also aim to provide a different perspective
on these questions."
"Several attempts have been made in the past to quantify the
evolution of the dust content of galaxies via fitting their Spectral
Energy Distribution (SED; e.g. Lisenfeld & Ferrara 1998; Mor-
gan & Edmunds 2003; Draine et al. 2007; Galliano et al. 2008a;
Rémy-Ruyer et al. 2014, 2015; De Vis et al. 2017b; Nersesian
et al. 2019; De Looze et al. 2020; Nanni et al. 2020). Although
these studies provided important benchmarks, most of them were
limited by the following issues: (i) their coverage of the param-
eter space was often incomplete, especially in the low-metal-
licity regime, which is crucial to quantify stardust production
(cf. Sect. 5); (ii) potential systematic effects, originating either in
the SED fitting or in the ancillary data, were questioning some
of the conclusions; (iii) dust evolution models were most of the
time not fit to each galaxy, but simply visually compared1, which
can lead to some inconsistencies (cf. Sect. 5.2.3)."
"The present paper is an attempt at addressing these limita-
tions. We rely on the homogeneous multi-wavelength observa-
tions and ancillary data of the DustPedia project (Davies et al.
2017) and of the Dwarf Galaxy Sample (DGS; Madden et al."
"1 Among the cited studies, only Nanni et al. (2020) and De Looze et al.
(2020) perform an actual fit of individual galaxies."
"Article number, page 2 of 64"
F. Galliano et al.: A Nearby Galaxy Perspective on Dust Evolution
"2013). We adopt a Hierarchical Bayesian2 (HB; cf. Sect. 3.1)
approach when comparing models to observations, in order to
limit the impact of systematic effects on our results (Galliano
2018, hereafter G18). Finally, we perform a rigorous dust evo-
lution modelling of individual objects in our sample, in order to
unambiguously constrain the dust evolution timescales. Sect. 2
presents the data we have used. Sect. 3 presents our model and
discusses the robustness of the derived dust parameters. Sect. 4
provides a qualitative discussion of the derived dust evolution
trends. Sect. 5 describes the quantitative modelling of the main
dust evolution processes. Sect. 6 summarizes our results. Several
technical arguments are detailed in the appendices, so that they
do not alter the flow of the discussion."
2. THE GALAXY SAMPLE
"This study focuses on global properties of galaxies. Integrat-
ing the whole emission of a galaxy complicates the interpre-
tation of the trends, as we will discuss in Sect. 4. However, it
also presents some advantages: (i) we can include galaxies un-
resolved at infrared wavelengths; and (ii) we can provide bench-
marks for comparisons to unresolved studies of the distant Uni-
verse or to one-zone dust evolution models. Several upcoming
studies on a subsample of resolved DustPedia galaxies will dis-
cuss the improvements that the spatial distribution of the dust
properties provides (Roychowdhury et al., in prep.; Casasola
et al., in prep.)."
2.1. The Infrared Photometry
"We present here the integrated, multi-wavelength photometry of
our sample, used to constrain the global dust properties of each
galaxy. We focus on the mid-IR-to-submm regime, as it is where
dust emits."
2.1.1. The DustPedia Aperture Photometry
"We use the photometry of the 875 galaxies of the DustPedia sam-
ple presented by Clark et al. (2018, hereafter C18)3. Since we
focus on the mid-IR-to-submm regime, we restrain the wave-
length range to photometric bands centered between 3 µm and
1 mm. The list of photometric bands we have used is given in
Table 1. C18 has provided a dedicated reduction of the Herschel
broadband data and an homogenization of the Spitzer, WISE
and Planck observations. Foreground stars have been masked.
Aperture-matched photometry has been performed on each im-
age and a local background has been subtracted from each flux.
A consistent noise uncertainty was estimated for each measure-
ment. IRAS fluxes from Wheelock et al. (1994) were added to
the catalog. We refer the reader to C18 for more details about
the data reduction and photometric measurement."
"The SED model (Sect. 3.1), that we have applied to our data,
performs a complex statistical treatment, allowing us to analyze
even poorly sampled SEDs. However, the efficiency of such a
model can be affected by the presence of systematic effects not
properly accounted for by the uncertainties. In order to be con-
servative, we have therefore excluded a series of fluxes, based on
the following criteria."
"2 In principle, we should say Bayesian-Laplacian, in place of
Bayesian, as Pierre-Simon Laplace is the true pioneer in the devel-
opment of statistics using the formula found by Thomas Bayes (Hahn
2005; McGrayne 2011).

During the inference process (Sect. 3.2), the observed fluxes are com-
pared to the SED model integrated within the transmission of these fil-
ters, with the appropriate flux convention."

"1. The C18 catalog flags about 22 % of its fluxes, for different
reasons: artefacts, contamination by nearby sources, incom-
plete extended emission, etc. We have excluded all the fluxes
that are flagged. For 89 galaxies, all IR fluxes end up flagged.
These galaxies have therefore been excluded."
"2. Several galaxies contain a significant emission from their Ac-
tive Galactic Nucleus (AGN). This emission is characterized
by a prominent synchrotron continuum and copious amounts
of hot dust (Tdust & 300 K), resulting in a rather flat mid-
IR continuum. Our dust model (Sect. 3.1.1) is optimized for
regular interstellar dust. Our distribution of starlight intensi-
ties (Sect. 3.1.2) is usually not flexible enough to account for
the hot emission from the torus. We have therefore excluded
19 sources presenting such an emission at a significant level,
following Bianchi et al. (2018), who used the criterion of
Assef et al. (2018) based on the WISE1 and WISE2 fluxes to
identify AGNs4."
"3. We have performed a preliminary least-squares fit with our
reference SED model (Sect. 3.3), in order to identify where
the largest residuals are.
(a) A few short wavelength bands present a large deviation"
"from their SED model and their adjacent fluxes5. After
inspection of the images, the discrepancies are likely due
to residual starlight contamination."
"(b) Several long-wavelength IRAS fluxes are significantly
deviant from their nearby MIPS and PACS fluxes6."
"4 Those are: ESO 434-040, IC 0691, IC 3430, NGC 1068, NGC 1320,

"The reason of these discrepancies is obscure. However,
Sect. 3.3 will present a test comparing SED results with
and without IRAS data, showing they are not crucial to
our study."
"(c) Three additional galaxies are not properly fitted7. These
objects present the characteristics of an AGN and are in-
deed classified as such (Liu & Zhang 2002). They were
not accounted for by the Assef et al. (2018) criterion. It
is however consistent with the fact that this criterion has
a 90 % confidence level."
"We have excluded all these problematic fluxes. Criterion 3
is more qualitative than 1 and 2, but it allows us to identify
potential systematics that were missed."
"In total, we are left with 764 DustPedia galaxies.
The monochromatic fluxes (in Jy) were converted to"
"monochromatic luminosities (in L�/Hz), using the distances
from the HyperLeda database (Makarov et al. 2014)."
2.1.2. The Dwarf Galaxy Sample
"Metallicity is a crucial parameter to study dust evolution
(cf. Sect. 5 and Rémy-Ruyer et al. 2014, 2015). In particular, the
low-metallicity regime, represented by dwarf galaxies, provides
unique constraints (e.g. Galliano et al. 2018), yet the DustPedia
sample selected sources larger than 1′. In order to improve the
sampling of the low-metallicity regime, we have thus included
additional galaxies from the Dwarf Galaxy Survey (DGS; Mad-
den et al. 2013)."
"Among the 48 sources of the DGS, 35 are not in the DustPe-
dia sample. We have added these sources to our sample. These
galaxies have been observed with Spitzer, WISE and Herschel.
We use the aperture photometry presented by Rémy-Ruyer et al.
(2013, 2015). We do not expect systematic differences between
the DustPedia and DGS aperture fluxes. Appendix B.1 compares
the photometry of the DGS sources that are in DustPedia. Both
are indeed in very good agreement. Similarly to the DustPedia
sample, we apply the three exclusion criteria of Sect. 2.1.1."
"1. We exclude the fluxes that have been flagged.
2. No significant AGN contribution is present in this sample.
3. Rémy-Ruyer et al. (2015) advise to not trust the PACS pho-"
"tometry for HS 0822+3542. Since this source is neither de-
tected with SPIRE, we simply exclude it."
"In total, we are left with 34 DGS galaxies, in addition to those
already included in DustPedia."
2.1.3. Photometric Uncertainties
"Our combined sample contains 798 galaxies. For each of them,
we consider the following two sources of photometric uncer-
tainty."
"The noise: it includes statistical fluctuations of the detectors
and residual background subtraction. It has been thoroughly
estimated by C18 and Rémy-Ruyer et al. (2015). We assume
that the noise of each waveband of each galaxy follows an
independent normal distribution8."
"PGC 090942, IC 2574, UGC 06016, NGC 3454, NGC 4281,
NGC 4633, NGC 5023, NGC 7715.
7 Those are: NGC 1052, NGC 2110 and NGC 4486.
8 We note here that the background subtraction introduces an uncer-
tainty which is independent between galaxies. Indeed, we estimate the"
"Calibration uncertainties: they are systematics, i.e. fully cor-
related between different galaxies, and partially correlated
between wavebands. We assume they follow a joint, multi-
variate normal distribution, whose covariance matrix is given
in Appendix A."
"Table 1 gives the number of galaxies observed though each
waveband, and the number of detections (flux greater than 3σ,
where σ refers solely to the noise uncertainty). The number of
available filters per galaxy ranges between 1 and 19, and its me-
dian is 11. There is a median number of 2 upper limits per galaxy."
2.2. The Ancillary Data
"We present here the ancillary data gathered in order to character-
ize the ISM conditions in each galaxy."
2.2.1. The Stellar Mass
"For the DustPedia sample, we adopt the stellar masses of Ners-
esian et al. (2019). Theses masses were derived from UV-to-mm
SED fitting, using the code CIGALE (Boquien et al. 2019), with
two stellar populations. For the DGS, the stellar masses are given
by Madden et al. (2014), using the Eskew et al. (2012) relation,
based on the IRAC1 and IRAC2 fluxes. Eskew et al. (2012) em-
phasize that the largest source of systematic uncertainties in the
stellar mass is the Initial Mass Function (IMF). Both Nersesian
et al. (2019) and Eskew et al. (2012) adopt a Salpeter (1955)
IMF, therefore limiting potential biases between the two sam-
ples. Other potential biases, such as the form of the assumed star
formation history, should not be an issue with our sample. For in-
stance, both Mitchell et al. (2013) and Laigle et al. (2019) tested
the reliability of stellar mass estimates using numerical simula-
tions of galaxies, and showed that they gave consistent results at
low redshift. We use M? to denote the stellar mass."
"Nanni et al. (2020, hereafter N20) have reestimated the stel-
lar masses of the DGS, with CIGALE. They report systematically
lower values, compared to Madden et al. (2014), sometimes by
an order of magnitude. We discuss the possible reasons of this
discrepancy in Appendix B.2, concluding that our estimates are
likely more reliable."
2.2.2. The Metallicity
"For DustPedia galaxies, we use the metallicities derived by De
Vis et al. (2019), using the S calibration of Pilyugin & Grebel
(2016, hereafter PG16_S). For the DGS, we use the metallic-
ities derived by De Vis et al. (2017b), using the same PG16_S
calibration. De Vis et al. (2017b) show that this particular cali-
bration is the most reliable at low-metallicity."
"We adopt the solar elemental abundances of Asplund et al.
(2009): the hydrogen mass fraction is X� = 0.7381, the he-
lium mass fraction, Y� = 0.2485, the heavy element mass frac-
tion, Z� = 0.0134, and the oxygen-to-hydrogen number ratio,
12 + log(O/H)� = 8.69 ± 0.05. Throughout this study, we as-
sume a fixed elemental abundance pattern. It implies that the to-
tal metallicity, Z, scales with the oxygen-to-hydrogen number
ratio as:"
Z ' 2.04 × 10−9 × 1012+log(O/H) Z�. (1)
"background in each waveband for each galaxy separately. The result-
ing biases are thus randomly distributed across the sample. It would
not have been the case, if we had considered individual pixels inside a
galaxy."
"Article number, page 4 of 64"
F. Galliano et al.: A Nearby Galaxy Perspective on Dust Evolution
"For that reason, in the rest of the paper, we refer to both Z and
12 + log(O/H), as metallicity."
2.2.3. The Gas Mass
"Neutral gas. The neutral hydrogen masses, derived from
[H i]21 cm, have been compiled by De Vis et al. (2019), for Dust-
Pedia, and Madden et al. (2013), for the DGS. Integrating the H i
mass in the aperture used for the photometry is not always pos-
sible for the smallest sources, as they are not resolved by single
dish observations. This is particularly important for dwarf galax-
ies, where the H i disk tends to be significantly larger than the
optical/IR radius (e.g. Begum et al. 2008), as we will discuss in
Sect. 4.1.3. Roychowdhury et al. (in prep.) recently obtained in-
terferometric, spatially-resolved [H i]21 cm observations of 20 of
the lowest-metallicity galaxies in our sample (12 + log(O/H) ≤
8.0)9. They integrated these H i masses in the aperture used for
the photometry in order to provide a better estimate of the gas
mass associated with the dust emission. We have adopted these
more accurate values, for these 20 objects. We have multiplied
the H i mass of each galaxy by 1/(1 − Y� − Z) ' 1.35 to account
for helium (assumed independent of metallicity) and heavier el-
ements. We use MH i to denote the total atomic gas mass probed
by [H i]21 cm."
"Molecular gas. Casasola et al. (2020a) compiled observations
of 12CO lines for 245 late-type DustPedia galaxies. They con-
verted these observations in molecular masses, assuming a con-
stant XCO conversion factor (Bolatto et al. 2013), and corrected
them for aperture effects. The uncertainties are the quadratic sum
of the 12CO line noise measurement and 30 %, corresponding to
the uncertainty on the XCO. We adopt these values when avail-
able. For the other DustPedia and DGS galaxies, we infer the H2
mass, with the approximation used by De Vis et al. (2019, Eq. 7).
It uses the scaling relation between MH i/M? and MH2/MH i, de-
rived by Casasola et al. (2020a). The scatter of this relation is
propagated and accounted for in the uncertainties. These molec-
ular gas masses are also corrected for helium and heavy ele-
ments. We use MCOH2 to denote the total molecular gas mass de-
rived from actual 12CO line observations, and MH2 , to denote the
method-independent total molecular mass, either derived from
12CO lines or from the De Vis et al. (2019) approximation."
2.2.4. The Star Formation Rate
"For DustPedia, the Star Formation Rate (SFR), has been derived
by Nersesian et al. (2019). The SFR was a free parameter of
the SED fit they performed with CIGALE. For the DGS, we used
the SFR estimated by Rémy-Ruyer et al. (2015), using a combi-
nation of the Hα656.3nm line and of the Total InfraRed luminos-
ity (TIR). Although the two estimators are different, we do not
expect significant biases between DustPedia and the DGS. In-
deed, both account for: (i) the escaping power from young ion-
izing stars, with the UV SED or the Hα656.3nm line; and (ii) the
power re-radiated by dust, with the IR SED or the TIR. In addi-
tion, both assume a Salpeter (1955) IMF, which, similarly to the
stellar mass (Sect. 2.2.1), is the main source of uncertainty. We"

2.2.5. Uncertainties of the Ancillary Data
"The SED analysis we will present in Sect. 3.1 includes the ancil-
lary data, as a prior. For that purpose, it is preferable to consider
the logarithm of quantities that can span several orders of mag-
nitude. The independent ancillary data parameters we use as a
constraint are listed in the first five lines of Table 2. The total gas
mass is Mgas = MH i + MH2 and the"

lar fraction, f COH2 = M"

"Table 2, parameters derived from these quantities, including the
method-independent molecular fraction, fH2 = MH2/Mgas. All
the extensive quantities (masses and SFR) have been homoge-
nized to the distances adopted in Sect. 2.1."

"We assume that the uncertainty of the 5 independent ancil-
lary parameters (first part of Table 2) follows a split-normal dis-
tribution (G18, Sect. 3.2.3). We propagate the uncertainties and
their correlations in the derived parameters (second part of Ta-
ble 2)."
3. THE SED MODELLING APPROACH
"We now describe our modelling approach, as well as the con-
sistency tests we have performed to assess the robustness of our
results."
3.1. Our In-House Hierarchical Bayesian SED Model
"HerBIE (HiERarchical Bayesian Inference for dust Emission;
G18) is a hierarchical Bayesian model aimed at inferring the
Probability Density Functions (hereafter PDF) of dust parame-
ters (dust mass, etc.), from their SED, rigorously accounting for
the different sources of uncertainties. As any Bayesian model,
HerBIE computes a posterior PDF as the product of a classi-
cal likelihood and a prior PDF. What makes this model hier-
archical is that the prior depends on a set of hyperparameters.
These hyperparameters are: (i) the average of each physical pa-
rameter; and (ii) their covariance matrix. The hyperparameters
are inferred, together with the parameters of each individual
galaxy. We are therefore sampling a single, large-dimension10,
joint PDF. Since the shape of the prior is inferred from the data,
the information of the whole sample is used, in this process, to"
"10 The dimension of the parameter space is approximately the product
of the number of galaxies and the number of model and ancillary param-
eters (G18, Sect. 3.3). In the present case, it has ' 798×(7+5) ' 10 000
dimensions."
"Article number, page 5 of 64"
A&A proofs: manuscript no. manuscript
"refine our knowledge of each individual galaxy. In particular, it
is relevant to keep in our sample even poorly-constrained SEDs,
with upper limits or missing fluxes. Such a model is also effi-
cient at suppressing the numerous noise-induced, false correla-
tions between parameters, encountered when fitting SEDs with
least-squares or non-hierarchical Bayesian methods (Shetty et al.
2009; Kelly et al. 2012; Galliano 2018; Lamperti et al. 2019). It
has recently been used to study the anomalous microwave emis-
sion in the Milky Way (Bell et al. 2019)."
"From a technical point of view, HerBIE uses a Markov Chain
Monte-Carlo (hereafter MCMC), with Gibbs sampling (Geman
& Geman 1984). As mentioned in Sect. 2.2, we include the an-
cillary data in our prior. This process is fully demonstrated in
Sect. 5.3 of G18. These ancillary data do not enter the dust
model, but they provide information that helps to better constrain
the hyperparameters, in a holistic way. In other words, the infor-
mation provided by the gas mass or the metallicity helps to bet-
ter constrain the dust SED fit. It is a Bayesian implementation of
Stein’s paradox (Stein 1956; Efron & Morris 1977)."
3.1.1. Parametrization of the Dust Model
"To infer dust parameters with HerBIE, we adopt the framework
provided by the grain properties of the THEMIS11 model (Jones
et al. 2017). THEMIS is built, as much as possible, on labora-
tory data, and reproduces dust observables of the Galactic ISM.
One of its originalities is that it accounts for the aromatic and
aliphatic mid-IR features with a single population of small, par-
tially hydrogenated, amorphous carbons, noted a-C(:H). Conse-
quently, it does not include Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons
(PAH) per se. Although largely dehydrogenated, small a-C(:H)
are very similar to PAHs. The other main component of THEMIS
is a population of large, a-C(:H)-coated, amorphous silicates,
with Fe and FeS nano-inclusions.
THEMIS is designed to model the evolution of: (i) the size"
"distribution, (ii) the a-C(:H) hydrogenation, and (iii) the man-
tle thickness, with the InterStellar Radiation Field (ISRF) and
gas density. With the observational constraints of Sect. 2.1, we
can not reliably constrain the mantle thickness, as its effect on
the shape of the far-IR SED is too subtle. Nor can we constrain
the a-C(:H) hydrogenation, as broadband fluxes do not provide
unambiguous constraints on the 3.4 µm feature. We can how-
ever study the variations of the size distribution of small a-C(:H),
from galaxy to galaxy, as it will affect the strength of the bright
mid-IR aromatic features."
"We have therefore parametrized the size distribution in the
following way."
"1. We have divided the a-C(:H) component into (cf. Fig. 1):
Very small a-C(:H) (denoted VSAC) of radius smaller than"
"7 Å, responsible for the mid-IR feature emission, with
more weight in the short wavelength bands;"
"Small a-C(:H) (denoted SAC) of radius between 7 Å and
15 Å, responsible for the mid-IR feature emission, with
more weight in the long wavelength bands;"
"Medium and large a-C(:H) (noted MLAC) of radius larger
than 15 Å, carrying the featureless mid-IR continuum
and a fraction of the far-IR peak."
2. The silicate-to-MLAC ratio is kept constant.
"Using qX to denote the mass fraction of component X, the size
distribution is controlled by two parameters: (i) the mass fraction"
11 www.ias.u-psud.fr/themis/
"Fig. 1. Parametrization of the THEMIS model. Panel (a) shows the size
distribution of the two main components of THEMIS: amorphous car-
bons and silicates. We show how we divide the a-C(:H) size distribution
into three independent components. Panel (b) shows the SED corre-
sponding to each component (same color code as panel a). The SED is
shown for the ISRF of the solar neighborhood (Mathis et al. 1983)."
"of aromatic-feature-carrying grains, qAF ≡ qVSAC + qSAC; and
(ii) the very-small-a-C(:H)-to-aromatic-feature-emitting-grain
ratio, fVSAC ≡ qVSAC/qAF. Comparing these parameters to dust
models with PAHs (e.g. Zubko et al. 2004; Draine & Li 2007;
Compiègne et al. 2011), qAF is the analogue of the PAH mass
fraction, qPAH introduced by Draine & Li (2007, hereafter
DL07). The difference here is that, qAF = 17 %, while qPAH ="
"Article number, page 6 of 64"
http://www.ias.u-psud.fr/themis/
"
F. Galliano et al.: A Nearby Galaxy Perspective on Dust Evolution"
"4.6 %, in the diffuse Galactic ISM12. This is because a-C(:H)
have a smaller fraction of aromatic bonds per C atom. More mass
is therefore needed to produce the feature strength of a PAH."
"This parametrization has the great advantage of being lin-
ear. A simpler version, fixing fVSAC, has been implemented in
CIGALE by Nersesian et al. (2019). A more physical way to vary
the size distribution would be to vary the minimum cut-off size
and the index of the power-law size distribution (cf. Jones et al.
2013, for the description of the size distribution of THEMIS).
However, this alternate parametrization would be CPU time con-
suming, and would not produce noticeable differences in the re-
sulting broadband SED (cf. Appendix C)."
3.1.2. The Mixing of Physical Conditions
"A model, such as THEMIS, is not directly applicable to observa-
tions of galaxies. Indeed, the monochromatic flux of a whole
galaxy comes from the superposition of grains exposed to a
range of physical conditions. This well-known problem can be
addressed assuming a distribution of starlight intensity inside
each galaxy. We adopt the prescription proposed by Dale et al.
(2001), where the dust mass, Mdust, follows a power-law distri-
bution, as a function of the starlight intensity, U:"
"dMdust ∝ U
−α dU for Umin < U < Umin + ∆U. (2)"
"The parameter U is the frequency-integrated monochromatic
mean intensity of the Mathis et al. (1983) diffuse ISRF. It is nor-
malized so that U = 1 in the solar neighborhood (e.g. Eq. 2 of
Galliano et al. 2011). This phenomenological composite SED is
the powerU model component of G18 (Sect. 2.2.5). We add to
the emission the starBB component of G18 (Sect. 2.2.6), in or-
der to account for the residual diffuse stellar emission at short
wavelengths."
"The list of free SED model parameters, that HerBIE infers,
is thus the following. Similarly to the ancillary parameters (Ta-
ble 2), we use the natural logarithm of quantities varying over
more than an order of magnitude."
"1. ln Mdust, the dust mass, scales with the whole dust SED.
2. ln Umin ∈ [ln 0.01, ln 103] is the minimum cut-off in Eq. (2).
3. ln ∆U ∈ [ln 1, ln 107] controls the range in Eq. (2).
4. α ∈ [1, 2.5] is the power-law index in Eq. (2).
5. ln qAF ∈ [ln 10−5, ln 0.9] is defined in Sect. 3.1.1.
6. fVSAC ∈ [0, 1] is defined in Sect. 3.1.1.
7. ln L? is the luminosity of the residual stellar emission (cf."
"G18, Sect. 2.2.6)."
"These parameters are however not the most physically relevant.
In the rest of the present article, we focus our discussion on the
following three parameters, marginalizing over the other ones:
(i) Mdust; (ii) 〈U〉; and (iii) qAF, where 〈U〉 (Eq. 9 of G18) is
the mean of the distribution in Eq. (2). It quantifies the mass-
averaged starlight intensity illuminating the grains. It is a func-
tion of the three parameters Umin, ∆U and α (Eq. 10 of G18).
It can be related to an equivalent large grain equilibrium temper-
ature, Teq, through: 〈U〉 ' (Teq/18 K)5.8 (e.g. Nersesian et al.
2019).
12 We note here that the estimated mass fraction of PAHs in the dif-
fuse Galatic ISM depends on the set of mid-IR observations used to
constrain it. For instance, DL07 use COBE/DIRBE broadbands, while
Compiègne et al. (2011) use a scaled Spitzer/IRS spectrum. It results in
different levels of mid-IR emission and PAH fraction: Compiègne et al.
(2011) find qPAH = 7.7 %. Since THEMIS is calibrated with the same
observations as Compiègne et al. (2011), it is possible to estimate the
value of qPAH that would result in the same level of mid-IR emission as
qAF: qPAH ' 0.45 × qAF (ratio of 7.7 % to 17 %)."
"3.1.3. Questionable Assumptions and Residual
Contaminations"
"In our experience, the model of Sect. 3.1.2 is the most appropri-
ate for galaxies observed with the typical spectral coverage of
Table 1. It presents however the following limitations."
"Shape of the ISRF. We assume that dust is heated by the
Mathis et al. (1983) ISRF, scaled by a factor U. We assume in the
model that the shape of this ISRF does not vary between galaxies
nor within regions inside galaxies. It is obvious that this assump-
tion is not correct. However, its consequences are minimal on the
parameters we are interested in, for the following reasons."
"– Mdust and 〈U〉 depend mainly on the far-IR peak emission,
which is dominated by large grains. These grains are at ther-
mal equilibrium. Their emission therefore does not depend
on the shape of the ISRF, only on the absorbed power."
"– qAF controls the fraction of small, stochastically-heated
grains. The emission from these grains depends on the shape
of the ISRF (e.g. Camps et al. 2015). However, since small
a-C(:H) are destroyed in H ii regions (cf. Sect. 4.2.3 of Gal-
liano et al. 2018, and Sect. 4.2), they are effectively heated
by a rather narrow spectral range (4 eV . hν < 13.6 eV),
where they exist. This effect is demonstrated on Fig. 7 of
Draine (2011), with PAHs. We thus do not expect that ac-
tual variations of the ISRF shape will significantly bias our
estimate of qAF."
"Evolution of small a-C(:H). The abundance of small a-C(:H)
and their properties evolve with the ISRF and the gas density.
These grains are dehydrogenated and destroyed by intense IS-
RFs; they are also accreted onto large grains, in dense regions
(e.g. Jones et al. 2013; Köhler et al. 2015). Our parametriza-
tion (Sect. 3.1.1) allows us to explore variations of qAF between
galaxies, but we assume that qAF is constant, for all U, within
each galaxy. However, this assumption will not bias our global
estimate of qAF, as this parameter is merely a way to give a phys-
ical meaning to the observed LAF/TIR ratio (LAF denoting the
power emitted by the aromatic features). This assumption would
only be problematic if we were trying to estimate the local value
of qAF in PDRs, for instance. Indeed, we would, in this case,
underestimate qAF, by assuming that a fraction of the aromatic
feature emission comes from H ii regions, which are generally
hotter than PDRs, and thus more emissive."
"Grain opacity. We assume that the grain opacity does not
vary between galaxies, nor within regions inside galaxies. There
are several indications that this hypothesis is not correct (e.g.
Sect. 4.2.1 of Galliano et al. 2018). In particular, the far-IR
opacity can typically vary by a factor of ' 3 with the ac-
cretion/removal of mantles and grain-grain coagulation (Köh-
ler et al. 2015). Such variations will bias our estimate of the
dust mass. In addition, the submm/mm silicate emissivity im-
plemented in THEMIS has an unphysical power-law dependence
at long wavelengths. Accounting for a more realistic opacity,
based on laboratory measurements such as those of Demyk et al.
(2017b,a), will likely affect our dust mass estimates. This is an
important effect that we can not avoid. We discuss its conse-
quences in Sect. 4.1.3, when interpreting our results."

"Residual contaminations. The following emission processes,
not accounted for in our model, could be present in our observa-
tions."
"– Several gas lines contribute to the emission in the photomet-
ric bands of Table 1. The brightest are: [O i]63µm, [O iii]88µm,
[C ii]158µm, [O i]145µm and 12CO(J=3→2)867µm. Without ded-
icated spectroscopic observations, the subtraction of these
lines is hazardous. Luckily enough, their intensities are, to
first order, proportional to TIR (e.g. Cormier et al. 2015).
They constitute therefore a bias proportional to the flux, that
can be taken into account together with the calibration bias,
as we will show in Sect. 3.2."
"– The submm excess is an excess emission of debated origin,
appearing longward 500 µm (cf. Sect. 3.5.5 of Galliano et al.
2018, for a review). Since it is not accounted for in our
model, it could bias our submm SED. This effect is however
probably negligible in our sample, for the following reasons.
1. This submm excess is model-dependent. THEMIS has a"
"flatter submm opacity than models based on the DL07
optical properties (e.g. Fig. 4 of Galliano et al. 2018).
It is therefore more emissive in the submm regime and
minimizes the contribution of the excess."
"2. This excess is observed in dwarf galaxies, but is rarely
detected in higher metallicity systems (e.g. Galliano
et al. 2003, 2005; Galametz et al. 2009; Rémy-Ruyer
et al. 2015; Dale et al. 2017). Yet, data longward 500 µm,
in our sample, are available only for large objects, due to
the large Planck/HFI beam."
"3. Residuals of our model run (Sect. 3.2) do not show sig-
nificant excesses in the submm bands."
"– Residual stellar emission could contaminate the shortest
wavelength bands. Improper stellar subtraction could lead
to positive or negative offsets, independently in the different
bands."
3.2. The Reference Run
"The results we will present in Sect. 4 are obtained with the model
described in Sect. 3.1. We call it our reference run. Fig. 2 shows
the SED fit of four representative objects, obtained with this
run. In panels (a), (b) and (c), SEDs of three arbitrarily cho-
sen galaxies, representative of Early-Type Galaxies (ETG), Late-
Type Galaxies (LTG) and irregulars, respectively, are displayed.
The PDF of the SED is shown as a yellow density plot. We also
show the PDF of the synthetic photometry (violin plots13 of dif-
ferent colors). The comparison of this synthetic photometry to
the observed flux (circles with an error bar) reflects the quality
of the fit. We discuss a more thorough and technical fit quality
test in Appendix D. Panel (d) shows the example of a galaxy
where most of the fluxes are 3σ-upper limits (displayed when
Fν < σnoiseν ). When the evidence provided by the data is weak,
which is the case when few detections are available, the poste-
rior distribution becomes dominated by the prior. This is what
we see here. The range spanned by this SED PDF is the extent
of the prior. The global scaling of this SED is very uncertain,
but its shape is realistic. This would not be the case with a non-
hierarchical model."
"Fig. 3 shows the inference of the calibration biases, δ(λ), of
each waveband (Sect. 2.1.3). Basically, the model fluxes are cor-
rected by factors 1 + δ(λ). For each waveband, the dashed-line"
13 violin plots are 90◦-rotated histograms.
"error bar represents the ±1σ interval of the prior on the calibra-
tion bias. This prior is a multivariate normal distribution, cen-
tered on 0, with the covariance matrix of Eq. (A.2). As discussed
in Sect. 3.1.3, besides accounting for the uncertainty in the cali-
bration of each instrument, these coefficients can account for ex-
ternal contaminations and fitting residuals. We can interpret the
most deviant values of Fig. 3 in this light. The posterior values
of δ lying outside their ±2σ prior are the following."
"160 µµµm: both overlapping bands PACS3 and MIPS3 indicate an
excess emission of about 15 %. A significant fraction of this
excess is likely due here to contamination by the brightest
line of the ISM, [C ii]158µm. The [C ii]158µm intensity is about
' 1 % the FIR (far-IR; 60-200 µm) power (Malhotra et al.
1997, 2001; Brauher et al. 2008; Cormier et al. 2015). Its
contribution to the PACS3 and MIPS3 is thus expected to
be a few percent, as these bands are narrower than the FIR
range."
"12 µµµm and 22 µµµm: the deficit could be due to a systematic dif-
ference between the size distribution of medium a-C(:H)
grains implemented in THEMIS and in the diffuse ISM of
these galaxies. Although the model was different, Galliano
et al. (2011, Appendix A.2) had to decrease the abundance of
the grains carrying the 24 µm continuum in the Large Mag-
ellanic Cloud (LMC), for a similar reason."
"Apart from these deviations, the two overlapping bands WISE1
and IRAC1 indicate that the model, on average, underestimates
the observations by ' 10 % around 3.5 µm. This could be due to
either the continuum or the 3.3/3.4 µm features. The constraint
of the size distribution of THEMIS by the SED of the Milky Way
(Fig. 3 of Jones et al. 2013), has been performed with a medium
resolution IRS spectrum for all a-C(:H) features, except the two
in question here. The global emissivity of these features is the
most uncertain of the model. We also notice that the SPIRE cal-
ibration biases go in opposite directions, while they should be
partially correlated (Appendix A.5). The HFI1 and HFI2 cal-
ibration biases agree very well with SPIRE. This is the sign
that there is a systematic residual proportional to the flux in this
wavelength range. It could mean that the slope of THEMIS is not
steep enough in the 200 − 500 µm range14. The fact that the
HFI3 is almost 0 would mean that the slope flattens again long-
ward ' 800 µm. This is very speculative, but we note that this
behaviour is qualitatively consistent with the optical properties
measured in the laboratory by Demyk et al. (2017a)."
"The parameters inferred with this run, for each galaxy, are
given in Table H.1 (electronic version only). We report only the
parameter values and their uncertainties (mean and standard-
deviation of the posterior PDF). The skewness and correla-
tion coefficients can be retrieved from the DustPedia archive
(http://dustpedia.astro.noa.gr). The length of the MCMC of this
run is 1 000 000, where we have excluded the first 100 000 steps,
to account for burn-in. The maximum integrated autocorrelation
time (Eq. 43 of G18) is 65 000."
3.3. Additional Runs: Robustness Assessment
"In order to assess the robustness of our results, we have per-
formed several additional runs, with different assumptions. We
now discuss the comparison of these tests with our reference
run. We focus on the derived dust mass and do not display the
redundant comparisons with 〈U〉. Indeed, TIR is usually well"

cretion and coagulation that could account for a steeper far-IR slope."

"and irregulars). Furthermore, there are more drastic underesti-
mates than overestimates. The galaxies with Mdust/Mrefdust ' 10"
"are indeed essentially sources with only far-IR upper limits, hav-
ing a negligible weight in the chi-squared. These SEDs are thus
wrongly fit a with very high 〈U〉, and scaled on the mid-IR
fluxes, leading to a drastic underestimate of the dust mass."
"Non-hierarchical Bayesian. We have fit the full sample of
Sect. 2 with the physical model of Sect. 3.1, replacing the hy-
perparameter distribution by a flat prior (cf. Sect. 4.2.3 of G18).
This flat prior is bounded, with limits well beyond the displayed
parameter range. This run thus samples the likelihood of each
galaxy, independently, but does not benefit from an informative
prior, inferred from the whole sample. The result is shown in
panel (b) of Fig. 4. Similarly to the least-squares example above,"
"there is no bias for the well sampled sources (Mrefdust & 10
6 M�),"
"but there is a significant scatter for sources with Mrefdust . 10
6 M�."
"The scattered sources are underestimates, for similar reasons as
the least-squares example. The amplitude of the scatter is how-
ever smaller than for the least-squares run. In addition, even the
most extremely scattered sources are 2σ-consistent with the 1:1
relation. This is because a Bayesian method samples the likeli-
hood as a function of the parameters, but stays conditional on
the data, while a frequentist approach (e.g. least-squares) sam-
ples the likelihood as a function of the data, thus considering
data that have not actually been observed, leading to biases (e.g.
Jaynes 1976; Wagenmakers et al. 2008)."
"No Planck & IRAS data. To understand the role of the far-IR
coverage, we have fit the sample of Sect. 2 without the Planck
and IRAS data, using the physical model of Sect. 3.1. In this
case, the far-IR coverage is provided by the sole Herschel data.
There is thus no data longward 500 µm. The result is shown in
panel (c) of Fig. 4. The absence of this data does not bias the fit,
it simply introduces some scatter, consistent with the 1:1 rela-
tion (cf. Sect. 5.2 of G18 for more discussion on this effect). The
irregulars are marginally overestimated, due to the lack of suffi-
cient SPIRE detections. Some of these sources do not have any
submm detections, higher dust masses are therefore allowed."
3.3.2. Influence of the Dust Model Assumptions
"With the Galliano et al. (2011) dust mixture. We have fit the
full sample of Sect. 2 with the HB model of Sect. 3.1, replacing
the THEMIS grain properties by those of the Amorphous Carbon
(AC) model of Galliano et al. (2011). The far-IR opacity of the
two grain mixtures are comparable (cf. Fig. 4 of Galliano et al.
2018). The only fundamental difference is that the aromatic fea-
tures are accounted for by PAHs, not by a-C(:H). Panel (a) of
Fig. 5 compares Mdust to our reference model. As expected, the
two values are in good agreement. The moderate scatter is due
to the mild difference between the two far-IR opacities. How-
ever, most of the ratios are 1σ-consistent with the 1:1 relation.
Panel (b) of Fig. 5 compares the qPAH of this run to the qAF of
the reference run. In Sect. 3.1.1, we noted that we should have
qPAH/qAF ' 0.45. In the present case, we have a ratio of ' 0.6.
A possible explanation of this difference is the following. The
parametrization of the THEMIS’s aromatic spectrum shape is con-
trolled by fVSAC (Sect. 3.1.1), which alters the a-C(:H) mass. On
the contrary, for the Galliano et al. (2011) AC model, the shape
of the aromatic spectrum is controlled by the fraction of ion-
ized PAHs, which does not alter the PAH mass. A systematically"

"lower 8-to-12 µm ratio compared to the Galaxy’s diffuse ISM
would explain a qPAH/qAF ratio higher than expected."
"Modified black body with β = 1.79. We have fit the photom-
etry of Sect. 2, longward 100 µm, with a Modified Black Body
(MBB; e.g. Sect. 2.2.2 of G18). In this first test, we fix the emis-
sivity index β = 1.79 and the level of the opacity to mimic the
far-IR opacity of THEMIS: κ(λ) = 0.64 m2 kg−1 × (250 µm/λ)1.79
(e.g. Sect. 3.1.1 of Galliano et al. 2018). Panel (c) of Fig. 5 com-
pares Mdust to our reference run. We can see that Mdust is about
0.8 times lower. This value is consistent with what Galliano et al.
(2011, Appendix C.2) found in the LMC. This difference is due
to the fact that a MBB is an isothermal approximation. Since a
SED fit is roughly luminosity weighted, the MBB does not ac-
count for the coldest, less emissive, but massive regions in the
galaxy. It thus systematically underestimates the mass."
"Modified black body with free β. Similarly to the previous test,
we have fit the photometry of Sect. 2, longward 100 µm, with
a MBB, but letting β free, this time. Such a model can poten-
tially infer the grain optical properties through the value of β and
the grain physical conditions through the temperature, Td. This
potentiality is however limited by the mixing of physical condi-
tions (e.g. Sect. 2.3.1 of Galliano et al. 2018). Panel (a) of Fig. 6
compares Mdust to our reference run. We can see the dust mass is
not extremelly biased, although there is some scatter. The β− Td
relation of this run is presented in Appendix E."
"With the DL07 ISRF distribution. We have fit the full sample of
Sect. 2 with the physical model of Sect. 3.1, replacing the ISRF
distribution of Eq. (2) by the DL07 prescription:"
"dMdust
dU"
= Mdust
"(1 − γ)δ(U − Umin) + γ(α − 1)U−α
U1−αmin − (Umin + ∆U)"
" .
(3)"
"This prescription is our Eq. (2) plus a uniformly illuminated
component at U = Umin, with the parameter γ controlling the
weight of the two components. We follow DL07 by fixing α = 2
and Umin + ∆U = 106. Consequently, the far-IR/submm slope,
beyond the large grain peak emission (' 100 µm), is the slope
of the large grain emission at U = Umin, making this model very
similar to a fixed-β MBB in the far-IR/submm range. In compar-
ison, the ISRF distribution of our reference run allows us to ac-
count for a flattening of the far-IR/submm slope, by mixing dif-
ferent ISRF intensities, down to lower temperatures (Sect. 2.3.1
of Galliano et al. 2018). Apart from the ISRF distribution, the
other features are similar to our reference run: THEMIS grain
mixture and HB method. Panel (b) of Fig. 6 compares Mdust to
our reference run. We notice, as expected, the same systematic
shift, here by a factor ' 0.7, as for the fixed-β MBB (Table 3)."
3.3.3. Comparison to CIGALE Results
"Nersesian et al. (2019) have modelled the DustPedia sample,
using the code CIGALE (Boquien et al. 2019), which fits the
dust SED with: (i) the THEMIS grain properties; (ii) the DL07
ISRF distribution; and (iii) a non-hierarchical Bayesian method.
Panel (c) of Fig. 6 shows its comparison to our reference run. As
expected, it is very similar to the DL07 ISRF distribution test in
panel (b) of the same figure. In particular, the mass is shifted by
the same ' 0.7 factor (Table 3). Note that Nersesian et al. (2019)"
"did not analyze the sources from the DGS, which are mostly the
scattered values (in blue) at low Mrefdust. Concerning the fraction
of small a-C(:H), the values of Nersesian et al. (2019) are in very
good agreement with our reference run."
"In summary, the comparisons of Sects. 3.3.1 to 3.3.3 have
demonstrated that the discrepancies induced by different fitting
methods or model assumptions can be well understood. We are
therefore confident that our reference run is the most robust
among the diversity of approaches we have tested."
3.4. Comparison with Lianou et al. (2019)
"Lianou et al. (2019, hereafter L19) recently used our model,
HerBIE, to analyze the DustPedia photometry. There are three
main technical differences between our analysis and theirs."
"1. They used the implementation of the 2013 version of the
THEMIS model (Jones et al. 2013), while we use the revised
2017 version (Jones et al. 2017)."
"2. They did not profit from the possibility to include ancillary
data in the prior (Sect. 3.1)."
"3. They did not include the remaining sources from the DGS
sample."
"The comparisons of Mdust and qAF are shown in Fig. 7.
Panel (a) of Fig. 7 shows that their dust mass is about a fac-"
"tor of 2 lower than ours. This can be partly understood in the
light of the difference in grain mixtures. Indeed, Jones et al.
(2017) revised the THEMIS model by including the more real-
istic Köhler et al. (2014) optical properties. To fit the same ob-
servational constraints, they compensated this update by chang-
ing the mantle thickness, as well as the dust-to-gas mass ratio:
Mdust/MH = 8.6×10−3 according to Table 2 of Jones et al. (2013)
and Mdust/MH = 7.4 × 10−3 according to Table 1 of Jones et al.
(2017). This sole modification explains why a mass derived with
the 2013 THEMIS version would be a factor of ' 0.86 lower than
with the 2017 version. However, this does not explain the whole
extent of the discrepancy. The comparison of our dust masses
with those derived with CIGALE (Sect. 3.3.3) certainly excludes
such a large error, on our side. It can be noted that there is also
some scatter around the median ratio of Mdust/Mrefdust. A part of
this discrepancy can naturally be explained by the fact that sev-
eral galaxies have a very poor spectral coverage. As demon-
strated in Sect. 3.2, the prior becomes dominant in this case.
In our case, the prior contains the information provided by the
ancillary data, thus helping to reduce the dust parameter range."
"Panel (b) of Fig. 7 shows the comparison of qAF. The two
quantities are in good agreement. There is some scatter around
the median, for the same reason as mentioned for Mdust. How-
ever, the problem with this quantity is the way L19 discuss
it. They improperly report the meaning of qAF that they call
“‘QPAH’” (L19, Sect. 3, 5th item). They write it represents “the
mass fraction of hydrogenated amorphous carbon dust grains
with sizes between 0.7 nm and 1.5 nm”, while it actually is the
mass fraction of a-C(:H) with sizes between 0.4 nm and 1.5 nm.
Furthermore, they claim the Galactic value of this parameter
is 7.1 %, while it is qGalAF = 18.6 % for the 2013 version and
qGalAF = 17.0 % for the 2017 version. The value of 7.1 % is the
mass fraction of a-C(:H) between 4 Å and 7 Å. Consequently,
they mistakenly show that most of the DustPedia sample has a
higher fraction of small a-C(:H) than the Milky Way, while it is
not the case (cf. Sect. 4.2)."
"In summary, we are confident that our derived parameters are
both more precise and more accurate than L19’s."

4. THE DERIVED DUST EVOLUTION TRENDS
"In this section, we present the main dust evolution trends derived
from the reference run (Sect. 3.2). These results are displayed as
correlations between two inferred parameters, for each source
in the sample. Displaying the full posterior PDF of each galaxy
as density contours is visually impractical. Instead, we display
its extent as a Skewed Uncertainty Ellipse (SUE; Appendix F).
SUEs approximately represent the 1σ contour of the PDF, re-
taining the information about the correlation and the skewness
of the posterior, with a dot at the maximum a posteriori. When
discussing parameter values in the text, we often quote the 95 %
Credible Range (CR95%), which is the parameter range exclud-
ing the 2.5 % lowest and 2.5 % highest values of the PDF. We
also adopt the following terminology."
"– We call Extremelly Low-Metallicity Galaxy (ELMG), a sys-
tem with Z . Z�/10."
"– To simplify the discussion, since the heavy-element-to-gas
mass ratio, Z, is usually called metallicity, we introduce the
term dustiness to exclusively denote the dust-to-gas mass ra-"
"Zdust ≡
Mdust
Mgas"
"– We denote by specific, quantities per unit stellar mass (simi-
lar to sSFR): (i) the specific dust mass is sMdust ≡ Mdust/M?;
(ii) the specific gas mass is sMgas ≡ Mgas/M?."
"Note that, in all the displayed relations, the number of objects
depends on the availability of the ancillary data (Table 2)."
4.1. Evolution of the Total Dust Budget
"We first focus on scaling relations involving the total dust mass,
Mdust, with respect to the gas and stellar contents, the metallic-
ity and the star formation activity. Casasola et al. (2020a) have
explored additional scaling relations, focussing on DustPedia
LTGs."

"Fig. 8. Dust-related scaling relations. In the four panels, the SUEs represent the posterior of each galaxy, using the reference run (Sect. 3.2). The
SUEs are color-coded according to the Hubble stage of the object (Sect. 3.3). We show the Milky Way values, as a yellow star, for comparison.
We emphasize that, although we are showing different parameters of the same sample, the different panels do not exactly contain the same number
of objects (Table 2). In particular, there are fewer reliable metallicity measurements, especially for ETGs."
4.1.1. Qualitative Discussion
"Fig. 8 presents four important scaling relations. Panel (a) shows
the evolution of the dust-to-baryon mass ratio:"
"fdust ≡
Mdust"
"Mgas + M?
, (5)"
as a function of the gas fraction:
"fgas ≡
Mgas"
"Mgas + M?
. (6)"
"This well-known relation was previously presented by Clark
et al. (2015), De Vis et al. (2017a) and Davies et al. (2019).
It shows that: (i) at early stages ( fgas & 0.7; mainly irregu-
lars), there is a net dust build-up; (ii) it then reaches a plateau
(0.2 . fgas . 0.7; mainly LTGs) where the dust production is
counterbalanced by astration; (iii) at later stages ( fgas . 0.2;
mainly ETGs), there is a net dust removal. Several sources have
peculiar positions relative to the above mentioned trend."
"1. The irregular (blue SUE) with fdust ' 0.01 is PGC 166077. It
is however technically not an outlier, as CR95%( fdust) = [1.7×
10−3, 2.8 × 10−2], overlapping with the rest of the sample."
"Article number, page 16 of 64"
F. Galliano et al.: A Nearby Galaxy Perspective on Dust Evolution
"2. The two ETGs (red SUEs) with a low fdust, at fgas ' 0.3
and fgas ' 0.6, are NGC 5355 and NGC 4322, respectively.
For NGC 4322, CR95%( fdust) = [1.2 × 10−6, 1.4 × 10−4],
marginally overlapping with the rest of the sample. For
NGC 5355, however, CR95%( fdust) = [2.7×10−6, 6.8×10−5],
making it a true outlier."
"3. The ETG (red SUE) with fgas ' 1 is ESO 351–030. It is the
Sculptor dwarf elliptical galaxy. This is not an outlier to the
relation, but it indisputably lies outside of its group."
"Panel (b) of Fig. 8 presents the relation between the specific
gas mass, and the dustiness. Such a relation was previously pre-
sented by Cortese et al. (2012), Clark et al. (2015) and De Vis
et al. (2017a). There is a clear negative correlation between these
two quantities, showing that when a galaxy evolves, its ISM gets
progressively enriched in dust and its gas content gets converted
to stars. There is one notable feature deviating from this main
sequence: a vertical branch at sMgas ' 0.1, exhibiting a sys-
tematically lower dustiness. This branch is mostly populated by
ETGs and contains most of the ETGs of the relation. We will
discuss the likely origin of this branch in Sect. 4.1.2. Finally, the
peculiar sources of panel (a) logically stand out in this panel too."
"1. PGC 166077 is the blue SUE at Zdust ' 0.05. It is not a clear
outlier, as CR95%(Zdust) = [0.01, 0.13]."
"2. NGC 5355 and NGC 4322 are the red SUEs at sMgas ' 0.4
and sMgas ' 1.5, respectively."
"3. The bottom red SUE, at sMgas ' 1600, is ESO 351-030."
"Panel (c) of Fig. 8 shows the relation between the specific
dust mass and the specific star formation rate, sSFR. This re-
lation was previously presented by Rémy-Ruyer et al. (2015)
and De Vis et al. (2017a). It was also discussed in Cortese
et al. (2012) with sSFR replaced by its proxy NUV-r. In the
same way, but on resolved 140-pc scales, it was shown in
M 31 by Viaene et al. (2014). There is a clear positive cor-
relation between the two quantities. The different galaxy types
are grouped in distinct locations: (i) ETGs are clustered around
10−4 . sSFR . 0.01 Gyr−1; (ii) LTGs are clustered around
0.01 . sSFR . 1 Gyr−1; (iii) Irregulars tend to lie around
0.1 . sSFR . 10 Gyr−1, but are more scattered than the other
types, with a systematically lower sMdust than what the extrapo-
lation of the trend would suggest. This scaling relation provides
an interesting approximation to derive the dust content from SFR
and M?, two quantities which usually are easy to estimate. In
particular, the relation is quasi-linear in the low sSFR regime,
with:"
"Mdust
M�"
"' 7.3+10.4
−6.1 × 10"
"SFR
M�/yr"
"for sSFR . 0.1 Gyr−1, (7)"
"with CR95%(Mdust/SFR) = [0.12, 53] × 107 yr.
Panel (d) of Fig. 8 shows the variation of the dustiness as"
"a function of the metallicity (Eq. 1). Such a relation is one of
the most common benchmarks for global dust evolution mod-
els (cf. Sect. 5), and has been presented by numerous studies
(e.g. Lisenfeld & Ferrara 1998; James et al. 2002; Draine &
Li 2007; Galliano et al. 2008a; Galametz et al. 2011; Rémy-
Ruyer et al. 2014; De Vis et al. 2017b). There is a clear corre-
lation between the two quantities, reflecting the progressive dust
enrichment of the ISM, built from heavy elements injected by
stars at the end of their lifetime. Few ETGs are present, due to
the lack of reliable gas metallicity estimates for these objects.
These would occupy the high-metallicity regime. Compared to
Rémy-Ruyer et al. (2014), who presented a similar trend for the"
"DGS sources, we notice that a few sources are missing and some
metallicities have been updated. This comes from the fact that
we have adopted the more robust DGS metallicity reestimates by
De Vis et al. (2017b), with published nebular lines and using the
PG16_S calibration (Sect. 2.2.2). The lowest metallicity source,
at 12 + log(O/H) ' 7.15, is I Zw 18. The most dust-deficient
source of the panel, at Zdust ' 1.9×10−6, is UGCA 20. It is a clear
outlier to the trend with CR95%(Zdust) = [1.3 × 10−6, 3.0 × 10−6]."
4.1.2. Comparison to X-Ray Luminosities
"The ETG outliers, visible in panel (b) of Fig. 8 and discussed in
Sect. 4.1.1, are likely due to enhanced dust destruction by ther-
mal sputtering in their hot, X-ray emitting gas (e.g. Bocchio
et al. 2012; Smith et al. 2012), as suggested by De Vis et al.
(2017a). We could conceive a reverse causality where it is the
low dust abundance that allows a higher fraction of escaping
X-ray photons. However, this is unrealistic, as X-ray observa-
tions clearly indicate that ETGs are permeated by a coronal gas
that is usually not found in later types of galaxies (Mathews &
Brighenti 2003, for a review). In order to support the likeliness
of the thermal sputtering scenario, we have compiled X-ray lu-
minosities from the literature (Table 4). Fig. 9 displays the dust-
to-stellar mass ratio as a function of the X-ray photon rate per
dust grain, LX/Mdust, for the 256 galaxies in our sample with
published X-ray luminosities. This figure shows a mild negative
correlation between the two quantities, consistent with the en-
hanced dust destruction in X-ray-bright galaxies. ETGs clearly
lie in the bottom right quadrant of this figure. It is reminiscent of
Figure 10 in Smith et al. (2012), displaying LFIR/LB as a function
of LX/LB."
"We note there is however a significant intrinsic scatter in this
relation. This could be due to the fact that most of the studies
listed in Table 4 quote a total X-ray luminosity, including both:
(i) point sources (AGNs, binary systems); and (ii) the diffuse
thermal emission that is sole relevant to our case15. In addition,
the spectral range used to compute the X-ray luminosity varies
from one instrument to the other (Table 4), leading to systematic
differences. Nonetheless, accounting for these differences, which
is beyond the scope of this paper, would likely not change the
plausibility that dust grains are significantly depleted in ETGs
due to thermal sputtering."
4.1.3. On the variation of the Dust-to-Metal Mass Ratio
"Panel (d) of Fig. 8 shows that the dustiness-metallicity rela-
tion is non-linear. Rémy-Ruyer et al. (2014) first argued, re-
lying on insights from the models of Asano et al. (2013) and
Zhukovska (2014), that such a trend was the result of different
dust production regimes: (i) at low 12 + log(O/H), dust produc-
tion is dominated by condensation in type II Supernova (SN)
ejecta, with a low yield; (ii) around a critical metallicity16 of
12 + log(O/H) ' 8, grain growth in the ISM becomes dominant,
causing a rapid increase of Zdust; (iii) at high 12 + log(O/H), the
dust production is dominated by grain growth in the ISM, with
a yield about two orders of magnitude higher than SN ii, and
is counterbalanced by SN ii blast wave dust destruction. Rémy-
Ruyer et al. (2014) argued that the intrinsic scatter of the rela-"

(2009) and Kim et al. (2019) extract the thermal emission of the gas.
We use these values for the sources in these catalogs.
16 This is a concept introduced by Asano et al. (2013). Its exact value
depends on the star formation history of each galaxy."

was due to the fact that each galaxy has a particular Star Forma-
tion History (SFH). We will explore this aspect in Sect. 5. In the
following paragraphs, we discuss the different biases that could
have induced an artificial non-linearity in our empirical trend."
"Comparison to DLAs. Fig. 10 shows the evolution of the dust-
to-metal mass ratio (DTM) as a function of metallicity. It is an-
other way to look at the data in panel (d) of Fig. 8. A constant
DTM corresponds to a linear dustiness-metallicity trend. The
SUEs in Fig. 10 are not consistent with a constant DTM (hor-
izontal yellow line). However, there are reports in the literature
of objects exhibiting an approximately constant DTM, down to
very low metallicities: Damped Lyman-α Absorbers (DLA). We
have overlaid the DLA sample of De Cia et al. (2016). These
measures are performed in absorption on redshifted systems,
along the sightline of distant quasars. The metallicity and DTM
are derived from a combination of atomic lines of volatile and
refractory elements. We can see that the DLA DTMs vary sig-
nificantly less than in our nearby galaxy sample17. Such an evo-
lutionary behaviour requires a high SN-dust condensation effi-
ciency coupled to a weak grain growth rate in the ISM (e.g. De
Vis et al. 2017b). Alternatively, the DLA estimates could be bi-
ased. It is indeed not impossible that the hydrogen column den-
sity of most DLAs includes dust- and element-free circumgalac-
tic clouds in the same velocity range. It would result in a typical
solar metallicity object appearing to have a solar DTM, and at
the same time, an artificially lower metallicity, diluted by the ad-
ditional pristine gas along the line of sight."
"Fig. 10. Comparison to DLAs. This figure shows the relation between
the metallicity and the dust-to-metal mass ratio, for the reference run
(Sect. 3.2). This figure is very similar to panel (d) of Fig. 8: the only
difference is that the y-axis has been divided by Z (related to the x-
axis through Eq. 1). We have overlaid in magenta the DLA measures
from Table 6 of De Cia et al. (2016). The horizontal yellow line cor-
responds to the Galactic dust-to-metal mass ratio. The Bayesian corre-
lation coefficient of the nearby galaxy sample is ρ = 0.636+0.021"
"−0.023, with
CR95%(ρ) = [0.59, 0.68]."

lower than metallicities measured in emission (e.g. Hamanowicz et al.

"Accounting for the Gas Halo. The contamination of the gas
mass estimate by external, dust- and element-poor gas is also
a potential issue for our nearby galaxy sample. This is partic-
ularly important for low-metallicity, dwarf galaxies, where the
IR-emitting region is usually small compared to the whole H i
halo (e.g. Walter et al. 2007; Begum et al. 2008). For instance,
Draine et al. (2007) hinted that the trend between Z and Zdust
was close to linear, when the gas mass used to estimate Zdust was
integrated in the same region as the dust mass. They only had
9 galaxies below 12 + log(O/H) < 8.1. We have addressed this
issue by adopting the interferometric [H i]21 cm observations of
20 of the lowest metallicity galaxies in our sample, including
the lowest metallicity system, I Zw 18 (Roychowdhury et al., in
prep.; Sect. 2.2.3). We have integrated the gas mass within the
photometric aperture for these 20 objects. I Zw 18 still lies two
orders of magnitude below the Galactic DTM, despite this cor-
rection. On the contrary, it is possible that the DTM of UGCA 20,
the lowest SUE in Fig. 10, has been underestimated, as it has not
been resolved in H i. We have to admit that there is still room
for improvement as several of the ELMGs are barely resolved
in the IR. Thus, although we corrected for a large fraction of
the H i halo, there might still be residual gas not associated with
the star forming region within our aperture. We might therefore
be underestimating the dustiness of our ELMGs. This will have
consequences in Sect. 5. The amplitude of this underestimation
is not quantifiable as these sources are not resolved in the far-IR.
It is however difficult to imagine that there would still be 99 %
of gas not associated with IR emission within our aperture. In-
deed, for the most extreme case, I Zw 18, our aperture is only
1.5 times the optical radius (Rémy-Ruyer et al. 2013), which
should be comparable to the IR radius. The overall rising DTM
with 12 + log(O/H) of Fig. 10 is therefore unlikely due to an
improper correction of the H i envelopes of ELMGs."
"Variation of the Grain Opacities. We have noted in Sect. 3.1.3
that our dust mass estimates depend on the rather arbitrary grain
opacity we have adopted. This grain opacity has been designed
to account for the emission, extinction and depletions of the dif-
fuse Galactic ISM (cf. Sect. 3.1.1). A systematic variation of the
overall grain opacity with metallicity could change the slope of
the trend in Fig. 10. In order to move I Zw 18 up to the Galactic
DTM, we would need to adopt a grain emissivity diminished by
about two orders of magnitude18. Qualitatively, the ISM of an
ELMG, such as I Zw 18, is (e.g. Cormier et al. 2019): (i) per-
meated by hard UV photons; (ii) very clumpy with a low cloud
filling factor. With more UV photons to evaporate the mantles
and less clouds to grow them back, we could assume that the
grains in such a system would be reduced to their cores (cf. Fig-
ure 16 of Jones et al. 2013). Demantled, crystalline, compact
grains are indeed among the least emissive grains. However, to
our knowledge, there are no interstellar dust analogs having a
far-IR opacity two orders of magnitude lower than those used
in the THEMIS model. The Draine & Li (2007) mixture, which
resembles compact bare grains, is only a factor of ' 2 less emis-
sive than THEMIS (e.g. Figure 4 of Galliano et al. 2018). We
could also imagine that the composition of the dust mixture itself
changes. In particular, the fraction of silicates could be higher
in ELMGs, as C/O and O/H are correlated (Garnett et al. 1995).
This would have a limited effect, since: (i) a decrease of the large
a-C(:H) abundance by 50 % would decrease the global emissiv-
ity of THEMIS in the SPIRE bands by 15 − 30 %; (ii) a variation"
"18 For I Zw 18, CR95%(DTM) = [2.3×10−3, 7.9×10−3], while DTM� '
0.5."
"of the forsterite-to-enstatite ratio would change the emissivity by
less than 30 %. It is therefore very unlikely that the dependence
of DTM with metallicity is artificially induced by our grain opac-
ity assumption."
"Variation of the Size Distribution. Another factor that could
affect the trend of Fig. 10 is that we have fixed the size dis-
tribution of the large grains. In principle, relaxing this assump-
tion and allowing the size distribution to be dominated by Very
Small Grains (VSG) in low-metallicity sources, would raise the
DTM of objects such as I Zw 18. Indeed, VSGs are stochas-
tically heated. They spend most of their time at very low tem-
peratures between successive photon absorptions. Their excur-
sion at T & 20 K will span only a fraction of their time. A
mixture of VSGs would thus appear less emissive than a larger
grain at an equilibrium temperature close to the high end of
their temperature distribution. We have demonstrated this effect
in Fig. 11. We have simulated a VSG-dominated SED mimick-
ing a typical ELMG, peaking around λ ' 40 µm, and with very
weak aromatic feature emission (Fig. 11; panel b; blue curve).
The size distribution needed to produce such a SED is made al-
most exclusively of a ' 1.5 nm radius grains (Fig. 11; panel a;
blue curve). We have fit this synthetic SED with our reference
model (Sect. 3.1.2), keeping the large grain size distribution
fixed (Fig. 11; panel a; red curve), but varying the ISRF distri-
bution. This model reproduces very well the photometric fluxes
(Fig. 11; panel b; red circles), but requires a total dust mass a fac-
tor of ' 3 lower than the VSG model. This effect goes in the right
direction but is not enough to explain the 2 orders of magnitude
required to account for a constant DTM in Fig. 10. We could
further decrease the emissivity of the VSG model by lowering
the size of the grains. However, it would result in a SED peaking
shortward λ ' 30 µm, inconsistent with our observations. Fi-
nally, VSG-dominated ELMGs would not be in agreement with
theoretical dust size distribution evolution models (e.g. Hou
et al. 2017; Hirashita & Aoyama 2019; Aoyama et al. 2020).
At early stages, these models predict the ISM being populated
of large grains. The reason is that the dust production at these
stages is thought to be dominated by SN-ii-condensed dust, and
grains condensed in core-collapse SN ejecta are essentially large
as the small ones are kinetically sputtered (e.g. Nozawa et al.
2006)."
"Very Cold Dust. A significant fraction of the dust mass could
have been overlooked, hidden in the form of very cold dust
(Tdust . 10 K). The emission of this component would man-
ifest as a weakly emissive continuum at submm wavelengths,
that we have not accounted for. Very cold dust has been invoked
to explain the submm excess in dwarf galaxies (cf. Sect. 3.1.3).
It could thus be invoked to flatten our dust-to-metal mass ratio
trend, in principle. However, while the excess has been reported
by numerous studies, predominantly in dwarf galaxies (e.g. Gal-
liano et al. 2003, 2005; Dumke et al. 2004; Bendo et al. 2006;
Galametz et al. 2009; Bot et al. 2010), very cold dust does not
appear as one of its viable explanations. Indeed, to reach such a
low temperature, very cold dust should be shielded from the gen-
eral ISRF in massive dense clumps. In the LMC, Galliano et al.
(2011) showed that the excess emission at 10 pc scale was diffuse
and negatively correlated with the gas surface density, inconsis-
tent with the picture of a few dense clumps. Similarly, Galametz
et al. (2014) and Hunt et al. (2015) showed that this excess was
more prominent in the outskirts of late-type disk galaxies, where
the medium is less dense. In addition, other realistic physical"

"Fig. 11. Demonstration of a VSG-dominated SED. Panel (a) shows the
size distribution of the two models we are comparing here: the reference
model in red, which is simply the THEMIS model, with the small grains
scaled down to mimic the SED of a typical ELMG; and a VSG model,
in blue, which is a log-normal size distribution, peaking at 1.5 nm with
a log-width of 0.2. The optical properties of the VSG model are those
of THEMIS, and we have kept the same silicate-to-carbon grain mass ra-
tio. In both cases, the curves represent the size distributions of a-C(:H)
and silicates. Panel (b) shows the corresponding SEDs for the two mod-
els. The SED of the reference model has been scaled down by a factor
of 0.30, to fit the VSG SED. It means the VSG SED reproduces the
reference model with a dust mass 3.33 times higher. The VSG SED is
uniformly illuminated by an ISRF with U = 10, while the reference
model has a distribution of ISRFs with 〈U〉 = 200. The blue filled and
red empty circles show the synthetic photometry of each model in the
IRAC, MIPS1, PACS and SPIRE bands."
"processes to explain this excess have been proposed (Meny et al.
2007; Draine & Hensley 2012). Dust analogs also exhibit a flat-
ter submm slope that could partly account for this excess (De-
myk et al. 2017a). More qualitatively, it is difficult to conceive
of the presence of massive dense clumps in ELMGs, where the
dust-poor ISM is permeated by intense UV photons from the
young stellar populations that are forming. In addition, this dust
would likely be associated with dense gas that we have not ac-
counted for, limiting its impact on the estimated dustiness."
"Systematic Uncertainty on the ELMG’s DTM. Overall, it ap-
pears that none of our model assumptions could be demonstrated
to be responsible for artificially inducing the observed variation
of the DTM. The trend of Fig. 10, for nearby galaxies, is there-
fore likely real. It is however possible that the dustiness of the
ELMGs has been underestimated. We can quote a rough system-
atic uncertainty for an object such as I Zw 18, the following
way."
"– Since the H i aperture is a factor of ' 1.5 times the optical
radius, Zdust might be underestimated by a factor at most '
1.52 = 2.25."
"– We have discussed that the grain opacity could have been
overestimated by a factor of ' 2. The systematic uncertainty
on Zdust is thus at most a factor of ' 2."
"– We have discussed that our grain size distribution assumption
could lead to an underestimate of Zdust by a factor of at most
' 3."
"Overall, we can consider that the dustiness of ELMGs could have
been underestimated by a factor of '"
"√
2.252 + 22 + 32 = 4.25."
4.2. Evolution of the Aromatic Feature Emitters
"We now focus our discussion on another important dust param-
eter, the mass fraction of aromatic feature emitting grains, qAF
(Sect. 3.1.1). Note that, in the THEMIS model, all grains are ei-
ther pure a-C(:H) or a-C(:H)-coated. All of them therefore po-
tentially carry aromatic features. However, only the smallest
ones (a . 10 nm) will fluctuate to high enough temperatures
(T & 300 K) to emit these features. Finally, we remind the reader
that, assuming aromatic features are carried by PAHs, qAF is for-
mally equivalent to ' 2.2 × qPAH (Sect. 3.1.1)."
4.2.1. The Competing Small a-C(:H) Evolution Scenarios
"The strong spatial variability of the aromatic feature strength
has been known for several decades. Dramatic variations have
been observed within Galactic and Magellanic H ii regions (e.g.
Boulanger et al. 1998; Madden et al. 2006; Galametz et al. 2013),
as well as among nearby galaxies (e.g. Galliano et al. 2003, 2005;
Engelbracht et al. 2005; Madden et al. 2006). The following sce-
narios have been proposed."
"Photodestruction. The aromatic feature strength appears to
be negatively correlated with the presence of intense/hard
UV fields. For instance, Boulanger et al. (1998) showed
that their strength in Galactic PDRs is decreasing when the
intensity of the ISRF is increasing. Madden et al. (2006)
showed that their strength, within Galactic and Magellanic re-
gions and within nearby galaxies, is negatively correlated with
[Ne iii]15.56µm/[Ne ii]12.81µm, an ISRF hardness indicator. Numer-
ous studies confirmed these trends, showing the depletion of aro-"

F. Galliano et al.: A Nearby Galaxy Perspective on Dust Evolution
"matic features around massive stars, as a result of the photodisso-
ciation and photosublimation of small a-C(:H). At the same time,
it was also shown that the aromatic feature strength is empiri-
cally correlated with metallicity. This is clear in nearby galaxies,
as a whole (e.g. Engelbracht et al. 2005; Madden et al. 2006), as
well as within extragalactic H ii regions (e.g. Gordon et al. 2008;
Khramtsova et al. 2013). This correlation is not inconsistent with
photodestruction, as most low-metallicity galaxies detected at IR
wavelengths to date are actively forming stars. Their ISM, less
opaque due to a lower Zdust, is permeated by an intense UV field,
potentially destroying small a-C(:H) on wider scales. It is also
consistent with the increasing strength of the 2175 Å bump with
metallicity, comparing sightlines in the Small Magellanic Cloud
(SMC), LMC and Milky Way (e.g. Gordon et al. 2003). The
extinction bump is indeed thought to be carried by small carbon
grains with aromatic bonds (Joblin et al. 1992)."
"Inhibited formation. Alternatively, several studies have ex-
plored the possibility that small a-C(:H) are less efficiently
formed at low-metallicity. Galliano et al. (2008a) showed that,
assuming small a-C(:H) are formed from the carbon produced
by AGB stars (on timescales of ' 400 Myr) and the rest of the
grains are mostly made out of the elements produced by massive
stars (on timescales of ' 10 Myr), the aromatic feature emitters
are under-abundant at early stages of galaxy evolution. Another
scenario, developed by Seok et al. (2014), reproduces the trend
of aromatic feature strength with metallicity, assuming small a-
C(:H) are the product of the shattering of larger carbon grains
(see also Rau et al. 2019; Hirashita & Murga 2020). Finally,
Greenberg et al. (2000) have proposed that aromatic feature car-
riers could form on grain surfaces in molecular clouds and be
photoprocessed in the diffuse ISM. Sandstrom et al. (2010) and
Chastenet et al. (2019) show that the spatial distribution of qPAH
in the Magellanic clouds is consistent with this scenario. This
process would also explain the fact that these grains are under-
abundant in ELMGs, as the molecular gas fraction rises with
metallicity."
4.2.2. Empirical Correlations within Our Sample
"The different processes we have just listed are not exclusive and
could very well compete within the ISM. It is however important
to understand which one controls the overall abundance of small
a-C(:H), at galaxy-wide scales."
"Fig. 12 shows qAF as a function of the average starlight in-
tensity, 〈U〉 (Sect. 3.1.2), and metallicity, in our sample. Sim-
ilar relations were previously shown by Draine et al. (2007),
Galliano et al. (2008a), Khramtsova et al. (2013) and Rémy-
Ruyer et al. (2015). The two SUEs at high 〈U〉 (panel a) are
I Zw 18 and SBS 0335-052. Their SEDs indeed peaks around
30 µm. However, their qAF appear higher than the extrapola-
tion of the general trend, with CR95%(qAF) = [0.012, 0.035] for
I Zw 18 and CR95%(qAF) = [0.024, 0.064] for SBS 0335-052.
Mid-IR Spitzer-IRS spectroscopy did not detect aromatic fea-
tures in these galaxies (Wu et al. 2007; Houck et al. 2004). The
true value of qAF is likely lower for these two objects. The reason
of this overestimation lies in the difficulty to estimate aromatic
feature strengths solely with broadband fluxes, when the feature-
to-continuum ratio is weak. Indeed, in the weak aromatic feature
regime, qAF is biased by the color of the mid-IR continuum (cf.
Figure 1 of Galliano et al. 2008a)."
"Overall, we find clear correlations in both panels of Fig. 12,
consistent with past studies. However, the relation appears more"
"scattered with 〈U〉, than with 12 + log(O/H). The correlation co-
efficient of panel (a) is only ρ = −0.434+0.038"
"−0.028 with CR95%(ρ) =
[−0.49,−0.35], while it is ρ = 0.762+0.018"
"−0.030 with CR95%(ρ) =
[0.70, 0.79] for panel (b). We could argue that panel (b) of Fig. 12
contains only the 376 sources with metallicity measurements
(Table 2), while panel (a) contains the 798 sources with pho-
tometric fluxes, including very noisy ETG SEDs. If we consider
only the subsample of panel (a) with metallicity measurements,
the correlation coefficient does not significantly improve: ρ =
−0.486+0.034"
"−0.026 with CR95%(ρ) = [−0.54,−0.42]. If we also exclude
the two biased estimates of I Zw 18 and SBS 0335-052, the cor-
relation coefficients do not change much: ρ = −0.432+0.040"
"−0.029 with
CR95%(ρ) = [−0.49,−0.35] for panel (a) and ρ = 0.768+0.018−0.031
with CR95%(ρ) = [0.70, 0.80] for panel (b)."
"We could also question the accuracy of 〈U〉 as an ISRF tracer.
Indeed, 〈U〉 is a mass-averaged ISRF intensity, giving a large
weight to the coldest regions within the beam. Rémy-Ruyer et al.
(2015) and Nersesian et al. (2019) used sSFR, which is luminos-
ity weighted, in place of 〈U〉 and found a good negative corre-
lation with qPAH and qAF, respectively. In our sample, the cor-
relation coefficient between ln qAF and ln sSFR is not improved:
ρ = −0.488+0.028"
"−0.024 with CR95%(ρ) = [−0.53,−0.43].
Therefore, it appears that qAF correlates much more robustly"
"with metallicity than ISRF indicators, in our sample. This result
is worth noting, especially since several studies focussing on a
narrower metallicity range concluded the opposite (e.g. Gordon
et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2011). It probably relies on the fact the
metallicities we have adopted (Sect. 2.2.2) correspond to well-
sampled galaxy averages, while in the past a single metallicity,
often central, was available and may have not been representa-
tive of the entire galaxy. This result suggests that photodestruc-
tion, although real at the scale of star-forming regions, might
not be the dominant mechanism at galaxy-wide scales and that
one needs to invoke one of the inhibited formation processes dis-
cussed in Sect. 4.2.1."
4.3. Approximate Analytical Metallicity Trends
"It can be interesting to have a simple analytical approximation
describing how Zdust and qAF vary as a function of 12+ log(O/H).
To that purpose, we have performed polynomial fits of the rela-
tions in panel (d) of Fig. 8 and panel (b) of Fig. 12. These fits are
displayed in Fig. 13."
"A 4th degree polynomial fit of the dustiness-metallicity rela-
tion gives, posing x = 12 + log(O/H):"
"log Zdust ' 11471.808 − 5669.5959x + 1045.9713x
2"
"−85.434332x3 + 2.6078774x4.
(8)"
"This equation provides a good fit of our trend, for the metal-
licity range covered by our sources. However, it gives a rising
dustiness trend with decreasing metallicity below I Zw 18. To
improve this relation, we can assume that the dustiness will be
proportional to 12 + log(O/H) at extremelly low-metallicity, as
we will show in Sect. 5.3 that dust evolution in this regime is
dominated by SN ii production. We therefore modify Eq. (8), as:"
log Zdust ' −13.230 + x for x < 7.3. (9)
"This fit splits our data in two equal size samples above and be-
low. To quantify its uncertainty, we can compute the envelopes
corresponding to encompassing 68 % and 95 % of the sources,
adding [−0.27,+0.29] and [−0.68,+0.70] respectively to the fit
of log Zdust."

"In the case of qAF, a 1st degree polynomial gives a satisfac-
tory fit as a function of 12 + log(O/H):
log qAF ' −9.001 + 0.9486x. (10)
Its 68 % and 95 % envelopes are obtained adding [−0.13,+0.10]
and [−0.36,+0.20], respectively."
"5. EMPIRICAL QUANTIFICATION OF KEY DUST
EVOLUTION PROCESSES"
"We now analyze the trends of Fig. 8, in a more quantitative way,
with the help of a grain evolution model. The goal here is two-
fold: (i) by fitting theoretical tracks to our sample, we intend to
test if it is possible to account for the variation of the main galaxy
parameters, with only a few evolutionary processes; (ii) we aim
to give a self-consistent empirical quantification of the main ad
hoc tuning parameters controlling these evolutionary processes."
5.1. The Cosmic Dust Evolution Model
"Cosmic dust evolution models compute the variation of the dust
content19 of a galaxy as a function of time. Dwek & Scalo
(1980) presented the first model of this kind, developed as an
extension of models computing the elemental enrichment of the
ISM (Audouze & Tinsley 1976, for an early review). Subse-
quent attempts, with various degrees of complexity, followed
(e.g. Dwek 1998; Lisenfeld & Ferrara 1998; Hirashita 1999;
Morgan & Edmunds 2003; Inoue 2003; Dwek et al. 2007; Gal-
liano et al. 2008a; Calura et al. 2008; Valiante et al. 2009; Matts-
son & Andersen 2012; Asano et al. 2013; Zhukovska 2014; Feld-
mann 2015; De Looze et al. 2020; Nanni et al. 2020). Recently,
19 they can also eventually compute the variation of the grain size dis-
tribution and composition with time (e.g. Hirashita et al. 2015)."
"such models have been used to post-process numerical simula-
tions in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of
galaxy evolution (e.g. Aoyama et al. 2017)."
5.1.1. Model Hypothesis
"We adopt the one-zone dust evolution model of Rowlands et al.
(2014) updated by De Vis et al. (2017b)20. It solves the coupled
differential equations accounting for the time evolution of the
mass of the four following quantities."
"Stars are made out of the gas, which is partially returned to the
ISM at the end of their lifetime. The model tracks their evo-
lution as a function of their mass, which determines their
lifetime and their elemental and dust yields. The role of this
component therefore relies greatly on the form of the as-
sumed IMF (e.g. Salpeter 1955; Chabrier 2003)."
"Gas is depleted by astration and outflow, and is replenished by
stellar feedback and by inflow of metal- and dust-free gas."
"Heavy elements are injected in the ISM by stars at the end
of their lifetime. A fraction of them is recycled into stars
through astration and lost via outflow."
"Dust is produced by three main processes: (i) condensa-
tion in Low- and Intemediate-Mass Star (LIMS) ejecta
(m? < 8 M�)21; (ii) condensation in SN ii ejecta
(m? ≥ 8 M�); (iii) grain growth in the ISM, by accretion"
"20 We started from the public Python code provided by the authors at
https://github.com/zemogle/chemevol. We have rewritten it in Fortran
for numerical efficiency, since we needed to generate large grids of mod-
els. We have also implemented an adaptative temporal grid to ensure
numerical precision at later stages of evolution.
21 following De Vis et al. (2017b), we assume that LIMSs condense
15 % of their heavy elements into dust."

"The drivers of the evolution of these quantities are: (i) the as-
sumed SFH (i.e. the SFR as a function of time); (ii) the assumed
inflow and outflow rates."
5.1.2. The Tuning Parameters
"The efficiencies of individual dust evolution processes are
poorly known (see reviews by Dwek 2005; Draine 2009; Jones
2016a,b,c; Galliano et al. 2018). From a theoretical point of
view, these efficiencies depend on the most elusive detailed mi-
croscopic dust properties: chemical constitution, structure (crys-
talline, amorphous, aggregate, etc.) and size. Consequently, the-
oretical estimates usually span several orders of magnitude.
From an observational point of view, unambiguous constraints"
"of the evolution rates are also problematic, because it is nearly
impossible to isolate a dust source or sink in a telescope beam.
Dust evolution models therefore use simple parametric efficien-
cies controlled by tuning parameters."
"Dust condensation in SN-II ejecta. Dust formed by massive
stars (m? ≥ 8 M�) is thought to dominate the dust production at
early stages, below the critical metallicity (cf. Sect. 4.1.3). The
dust evolution model we are using assumes the theoretical dust
yields, mSNdust, of Todini & Ferrara (2001), modified by a general
tuning parameter, δSN (Table 5). These dust yields can also be
integrated over the IMF, φ(m?):"

5.2. Modelling the Evolution of Individual Galaxies
"We use the dust evolution model of Sect. 5.1 to fit, for each
galaxy: Mdust, Mgas, M?, SFR and Z. Dust destruction in X-ray
emitting gas is not taken into account in this model. We there-
fore exclude the ETGs (T ≤ 0) which would not be consistently
fitted (cf. Sect. 4.1.2). The sample we model here contains 556
sources."
5.2.1. The Model Grid
"We have generated a large grid of models that we interpolate to
find the best evolution tracks for each of our sources. We assume
a delayed SFH (Lee et al. 2010):"
"ψ(t) = ψ0
t"
"τSFH
exp"
"t
τSFH"
")
, (15)"
"parametrized by the SFH timescale, τSFH, and a scaling factor,
ψ0. We assume a Salpeter (1955) IMF in order to be consistent
with the observed SFR and stellar mass estimates (Sect. 2.2).
Exchanges of matter between galaxies and their environment
can have a significant role in regulating the global dustiness
at all redshifts (e.g. Jones et al. 2018; Ohyama et al. 2019;
Sanders et al. 2020; Burgarella et al. 2020). We account for in-
flow and outflow, assuming their rates are proportional to SFR:
Rin/out(t) = δin/out × ψ(t). Table 6 gives the parameters of our dust
evolution model grid. We perform log-log interpolation of this
grid in order to estimate the tracks corresponding to any arbi-
trary combination of parameters."
"The SFH we have adopted here, to compute the chemical
evolution, is different from the SFH used by Nersesian et al.
(2019) to model the SEDs and estimate the observed SFR and
M? (cf. Sect. 2.2.1). Ideally, adopting the same SFH would be
more consistent. However, adding a second functional form to
Eq. (15), accounting for a potential recent burst, would push
this model beyond our current computational capabilities, by in-
creasing the number of free parameters. At the same time, the
elemental and dust enrichment by this recent burst would prob-
ably be negligible. Alternatively, we could have also modelled
the SED, using solely Eq. (15). The problem, in this case, is that
the use of a single stellar population biases the estimate of M?
(cf. Appendix B.2)."
5.2.2. Hierarchical Bayesian Dust Evolution Inference
"To constrain our dust evolution model, we consider the posterior
inference of our reference run (Sect. 3.2) as a set of observa-
tional constraints. We fit the four independent, intensive quanti-
ties: sMdust, sMgas, sSFR and Z. The complex PDF, including the
intricate parameter correlations, is preserved in this process. We
make the restrictive assumption that the three tuning parameters,"
"Table 6. Dust evolution parameter grid. Individual galaxy parameters
control the particular SFH of each galaxy. Common dust evolution pa-
rameters are fitted to the whole sample, assuming their values are the
same for each galaxy. The grid step (4th column) is logarithmic for
all parameters except the time grid. The SFR scale is normalized to
the total initial mass of the galaxy, M0. All extensive quantities com-
puted by the model are proportional to M0, while intensive quantities
are independent of M0. In practice, we generate a grid for an arbitrary
M0 = 4× 1010 M�. This parameter cancels out in the process, as we are
fitting ratios (Sect. 5.2.2)."
"Parameter Notation Range Step
Individual galaxy parameters"
"Age [Gyr] t [0.001, 15] 0.15
SF timescale [Gyr] τSFH [0.1, 30] 0.57 (ln)

Grain growth �grow [100, 10000] 0.17 (ln)
SN dest. [M�] mdestgas [50, 1500] 0.34 (ln)"
"δSN, �grow and mdestgas are universal and are therefore identical in
every galaxy. Consequently, we assume that the difference be-
tween galaxies is solely the result of their particular individual
SFH. We vary the age of the galaxy, t, the two SFH parameters,
τSFH and ψ0, and the inflow and outflow rates, δin and δout."
"On the universality of the tuning parameters. As we have
seen, the three tuning parameters hide effects of the dust con-
stitution, size distribution, fraction of cold clouds, etc. These
quantities could vary across different environments. However, as
we will show in Sect. 5.3.1, the SN II dust condensation domi-
nates in the low-metallicity regime, while grain growth and SN
destruction are important above the critical metallicity. Thus, the
parameters that we will constrain are representative of the regime
where they dominate the dust budget. Exploring their variation
with the environment is probably premature. We will however be
able to infer the variation of the timescales across galaxies, from
Eqs. (11) – (14). In addition, if we were to infer one set of tuning
parameters per galaxy, it would imply that they vary as a func-
tion of the galaxy’s global parameters. In order to be consistent,
we would then need to implement these variations of the tuning
parameters in the dust evolution model, and change their value
at each time step, accordingly."
"The model prior. We have built a HB model to infer these
parameters. The prior of the five SFH-related parameters is a
multivariate Student’s t distribution controlled by hyperparam-
eters, similar to the treatment in HerBIE. We have assumed
wide log-normal priors for the three common tuning parame-
ters. These priors are centered at ln 0.1, ln 1000 and ln 320 M�
with standard-deviations, 0.8, 0.8 and 0.4, for δSN, �grow and
mdestgas , respectively. These priors were designed so that their ±3σ
range roughly corresponds to the extent of the values reported
in the literature: 1 % . δSN . 100 %, 100 . �grow . 104"
"and 100 M� . mdestgas . 1000 M�. It does not mean that these
parameters can not exceed these limits, but it will be a pri-
ori improbable. The reason to adopt weakly informative pri-
ors is to avoid unrealistic degeneracies. For instance, there is
a well-known degeneracy between grain growth and grain de-"
"Article number, page 24 of 64"

"struction (e.g. Mattsson & Andersen 2012; De Vis et al. 2017b;
De Looze et al. 2020). Indeed, the ratio of the two timescales,
τdest(t)/τgrow(t) ∝ �grow/mdestgas × (Z(t) − Zdust(t)) is not constant,
but the metallicity dependence is quite mild in the narrow range
above the critical metallicity. This is enough to allow the MCMC
to explore unrealistically high values of �grow and mdestgas , if we as-
sume a flat prior."
"HB run specifications. Accounting for the missing ancillary
data, we have a total of 1913 observational constraints, for our
556 sources. One may note that we are fitting a model with
5 × 556 + 3 = 2783 parameters and 5 + 5 + C25 = 20 hyper-
parameters. This is not an issue in the Bayesian approach (e.g.
Hogg et al. 2010). Model parameters are rarely completely inde-
pendent. Furthermore, the hyperprior is the dominant constraint
for very scattered parameters (G18). Finally, by sampling the
full joint PDF, a Bayesian model clearly delineates the various
degeneracies, provided the MCMC has converged towards the
stationary posterior. We have run 12 parallel MCMCs, starting
from uniformly distributed random initial conditions within the
parameter ranges in Table 6, in order to ensure the uniqueness of
our posterior. The results discussed below are from a 105 length
MCMC, removing the first 104 steps to account for burn-in. The
longest integrated autocorrelation time is 6200."
5.2.3. The Fitted Dust Evolution Tracks
"The four panels of Fig. 14 present the same relations as in Fig. 8,
for the subsample of 556 sources. The posterior PDF of the
dust evolution tracks is displayed as colored density contours,
marginalizing over the SFH of individual galaxies."
"Qualitative inspection. At first glance, we can see that the
tracks of Fig. 14 reproduce the data quite well. Apart from a few
outliers, there are however two notable systematic discrepancies."
"1. The sMdust-sSFR trend of panel (c) is poorly reproduced. The
initial rise of sMdust at sSFR & 0.3 Gyr"
"−1 undershoots sev-
eral of the starbursting dwarf galaxies. Overall, this discrep-
ancy is quite mild, as most of the SUEs in this area are less
than 2σ away from the trend. The recent burst of star for-
mation, that is not accounted for by the chemical evolution
model, is likely responsible for the enhanced observed SFR.
On the contrary, a starburst occuring in more evolved ob-
jects, on the left of this trend, might simply contribute to
the general scatter of the relation and go unnoticed. Below
sSFR . 0.1 Gyr−1, there is a general decreasing trend of
sMdust with decreasing sSFR, but our model is essentially
flat. This is the most troublesome discrepancy of our analy-
sis. We will discuss it fully below."
"2. In panel (a), several high-gas-fraction sources are undershot
by the model, although most of them are only less than 2σ
away from the tracks. Those are the irregular galaxies around
the critical metallicity regime. They are in the stage where
the dustiness changes rapidly, due to the increased contribu-
tion of grain growth. These outliers can be seen in panel (b),
around sMgas ' 10, in panel (c), around sSFR ' 3 Gyr"
"−1,
and in panel (d), around 12+log(O/H) ' 8. The model poorly
reproduces the rapid dustiness rise around the critical metal-
licity, in panel (d)."
"On the sMdust-sSFR relation. The quasi-linear trend of sMdust
with sSFR, for sSFR . 0.1 Gyr−1 (panel (c) of Fig. 14), is not"
"accounted for by our model. N20 argue that outflows is respon-
sible for this trend23. Indeed, outflow depletes the dust content
proportionally to SFR, without affecting the stellar content. It
seems like a natural explanation. The outflow rate, δout, is a free
parameter in our model. However, it does not produce a linear
sMdust-sSFR relation. Fig. 15 shows the same data as in panel (c)
of Fig. 14. We have overlaid several dust evolution tracks corre-
sponding to our maximum a posteriori parameters, varying δout.
This figure is similar to Fig. 6 of N20. We note the following."
"1. We can see that no single track can reproduce the trend. It
could be a satisfactory explanation if galaxies were rapidly
evolving off the main trend, staying only a small fraction
of their lifetime on the horizontal branch. However, look-
ing at the top axis of Fig. 15, we realize that a galaxy should
spend about half of its lifetime on the horizontal branch. If
our model was correct, there should have been, statistically, a
significant number of sources deviating from the main trend."
"2. The range of δout values that can account for most of the trend
is quite narrow (Fig. 15). It would mean that the outflow has
to be precisely regulated. It seems unlikely."
"3. If this trend was solely due to outflow, the specific gas mass
would follow it closely, which is not the case. This point has
also been discussed by Cortese et al. (2012)."
"In summary, it appears our failure at reproducing the sMdust-
sSFR relation is rather an incapacity of our model to produce
a realistic trend, rather than a fitting issue. As we will see in
Sect. 5.3.3, this is not an IMF-related issue. Since the other
trends are acceptably reproduced, the problem might lie in the
only quantity represented in panel (c) of Fig. 14 not appearing in
the other panels: the SFR. Our adopted SFH (Eq. 15) and our in-
flow and outflow prescriptions might be too simplistic to account
for the wealth of data we have here (cf. e.g. Leja et al. 2019, for
a discussion on the limitations of the delayed SFH)."
"The importance of fitting dust evolution models. We stress the
importance of actually fitting, in a consistent way, dust evolu-
tion models, rather than simply performing visual comparisons.
Here, we have attempted to fit M?, Mgas, Mdust, Z and SFR for
each galaxy. This rigorous process highlights the model limi-
tations. Most past studies have merely overlaid tracks on their
data, producing a convincing but inconsistent interpretation. For
instance, De Vis et al. (2017b), who used the same dust evolu-
tion model as we use, and compared it to a similar sample as
ours, were able to produce tracks accounting for most of the ob-
servations in the panels (a) and (d) of our Fig. 14. However, two
quantities of a given galaxy, such as the dust and stellar masses,
were usually explained with different values of the dust evolu-
tion parameters, at different ages. On the contrary, our approach
allows us to avoid mutually inconsistent explanations of different
trends and correlations. Overall, performing a rigorous fit does
not help getting better solutions, but it definitely helps avoiding
bad ones."

Sect. 5.2.3."

ψ0 = 40 M�/yr, δin = 1.0, δSN = 0.01, �grow = 4500 and mdestgas =
1200 M�/SN. The different lines correspond to different values of δout.
The top axis displays the age of the galaxy corresponding to the partic-
ular SFH of the model run. We have used a Salpeter (1955) IMF."
"The relatively small uncertainties on these parameters reflect
the fitting uncertainties. They indicate the values we infer are
not ambiguous. However, they do not include the assumption-
dependent uncertainties. In particular, the precise value of 〈YSN〉
relies mainly on our estimate of the dustiness of the few ELMGs
in our sample. In Sect. 4.1.3, we have extensively discussed the
different systematic effects that could have biased these esti-
mates. If some of these effects are, at some point, proven to be
relevant, our inference of 〈YSN〉 would have to be revised ac-
cordingly. To first order, the SN dust yield is proportional to the
dustiness of the lowest metallicity objects:"

tive conclusions we can draw from our analysis are thus that:"

Note that the interpolation between models does not produce a
perfectly smooth distribution. The edges of our model grid are
visible in this corner plot. This does not however impact the re-
sults as our grid samples well enough the PDF."
5.3.2. The Dust Evolution Timescales
"It is possible to estimate the posterior PDF of the dust evolu-
tion timescales of each galaxy, from the inferred parameters of
Figs. 16 – 17, using Eqs. (11) – (14). Fig. 18 displays these
timescales as a function of metallicity. Although there is some
scatter due to the different SFH and age of galaxies in a given
metallicity bin, we note that these timescales evolve."
"The SN II dust condensation timescale (panel (a) of Fig. 18)
is around τcond ' 100 Myr for ELMGs, implying that dust
can be dominated by stardust in this regime. It rises up to
τcond ' 1000 Gyr around solar metallicity, indicating this
process is not sufficient to account for all ISM dust in evolved
systems."
"The grain growth timescale (panel (b) of Fig. 18) is quite scat-
tered. It starts around τgrow ' 1 Gyr in the ELMG regime and
decreases down to τgrow ' 50 Myr around solar metallicity.
The average value of our sample at 12 + log(O/H) ≥ 8.5 is
τgrow ' 45 Myr. It is another way to show that dust formation
is dominated by grain growth around solar metallicity."
"The SN II dust destruction timescale (panel (c) of Fig. 18) is
also scattered but stays around τdest ' 300 Myr across our
metallicity range."

"The Milky Way value displayed in the three panels is consistent
with the cloud of points in the highest metallicity domain."
"There is a common misconception that dust destruction by
SN II blast waves is unimportant at early-stages, because the
dustiness is so low that few grains are destroyed by a single
SN II. However, we show here that this is not the case as: (i) the
SN II rate is on average higher at low-metallicity; (ii) the fraction
of grains destroyed by a single SN II is dustiness-independent."
5.3.3. Sensitivity to the IMF
"As we discussed in Sects. 2.2.3 – 2.2.4, the main uncertainty on
our estimated M? and SFR comes from our IMF assumptions.
Those were derived with a Salpeter (1955) IMF. Here, we ex-
plore the sensitivity of our results assuming a Chabrier (2003)
IMF. To be consistent, we first need to correct our estimated M?
and SFR. According to Madau & Dickinson (2014, Sect. 3.1),
we need to multiply SFR by 0.63 and M? by 0.61. We have
then generated another grid of models similar to Table 6 with
the Chabrier (2003) IMF, and performed the fitting process of"

timescales. The SUEs represent the value of these timescales as a func-
tion of metallicity, for each galaxy. The yellow star represents the Milky
Way, at the maximum a posteriori of the three tuning parameters."
"Sect. 5.2.3. The full results are given in Appendix G. The upshot
is that the inferred tuning parameters are roughly consistent with
our estimates in Sect. 5.3.1:"
"– 〈YSN〉 ' 2.5+0.2−0.3 × 10

"– �grow ' 4485+11−17;
– mdestgas ' 1289"

"The differences can be explained by the different relative con-
tribution from LIMSs. The only value that differs sensibly is"
"〈YSN〉. This difference is however simply due to the fact the low-
metallicity dustiness is overshot by the model with the Chabrier
(2003) IMF."
"This agreement was expected. The reason is that, to first or-
der, LIMSs represent a dead weight in both the SED and the
chemical enrichment. The total power emitted by stellar popu-
lations is dominated by massive stars. This is the reason why
SFR and M? estimates are so dependent on the IMF assump-
tion. From the dust evolution modelling, the elemental and star-
dust enrichment is also dominated by massive stars. The only
quantity for which we infer a different value is logically ψ0. It
is ' 50 % higher to generate the same number of massive stars,
compensating for the 0.63 correction factor."
5.4. Discussion
5.4.1. On the Low Inferred SN II Dust Yield
"Our SN II dust yield is lower than the most recent estimates in
situ. Measuring the dust mass produced by a single SN II is quite
difficult, as it implies disentangling the freshly-formed dust from
the surrounding ISM. It also carries the usual uncertainty about
dust optical properties. A decade ago, the largest dust yield ever
measured was YSN ' 0.02 M� (in SN 2003gd; Sugerman et al.
2006). The Herschel space telescope has been instrumental in
estimating the cold mass of SuperNova Remnants (SNR). The
yields of the three most well-studied SNRs are now an order of
magnitude higher:"
"Cassiopeia A: YSN ' 0.04−1.1 M� (Barlow et al. 2010; Arendt
et al. 2014; De Looze et al. 2017; Bevan et al. 2017; Priestley
et al. 2019);"
"The Crab nebula: YSN ' 0.03 − 0.23 M� (Gomez et al. 2012;
Temim & Dwek 2013; De Looze et al. 2019);"
"SN 1987A: YSN ' 0.45 − 0.8 M� (Dwek & Arendt 2015; Mat-
suura et al. 2015)."
"In all these cases, the newly-formed grains have not yet experi-
enced the reverse shock (Bocchio et al. 2016). The net yield is
thus expected to be significantly lower."
"Even if ' 10− 20 % of the dust condensed in an SN II ejecta
survives its reverse shock (e.g. Nozawa et al. 2006; Micelotta
et al. 2016; Bocchio et al. 2016), we have to also consider the
fact that massive stars are born in clusters. The freshly-formed
dust injected by a particular SN II, having survived the reverse
shock, will thus be exposed to the forward shock waves of nearby
SNe II (e.g. Martínez-González et al. 2018). This effect is not ac-
counted for by Eq. (14), as it does not account for clustering, nor
does it account for the excess dustiness around these stars due to
the recent grain production. Our estimate of 〈YSN〉 is therefore an
effective empirical yield, that probably accounts for this effect."
5.4.2. The Relevance of Local Low-Metallicity Galaxies
"Our analysis confirms the long-lasting consensus that Milky Way
dust is essentially grown in the ISM (Sect. 1). The apparently
paradoxical fact here is that we have drawn this conclusion from
the low-metallicity domain. It is because dust production is dom-
inated by SN II condensation below the critical metallicity that
we could constrain its efficiency and show it is unimportant at so-
lar metallicity. The relevance of dwarf galaxies here is not neces-
sarily that they can be considered as analogs of primordial distant
galaxies, but that they sample a particular, key, dust production
regime."

5.4.3. Implications for High-Redshift Systems
"High-redshift (z & 6) objects exhibiting copious amounts of
dust (' 107 − 108 M�), close to the reionization era, have been
challenging grain formation scenarios (e.g. Dwek et al. 2007;
Valiante et al. 2009; Dwek et al. 2014; Laporte et al. 2017).
These objects are indeed only a few 100 Myr old, but have a
roughly Galactic dustiness. SN II dust condensation would need
to have a high efficiency (' 1 M�/SN) to account for the ob-
served dust mass (Dwek et al. 2007, 2014). AGB star yield can
explain this dust content for z ' 6 objects (Valiante et al. 2009),
but not at z ' 8 (Laporte et al. 2017)."
"Our results imply that grain growth should be the dominant
dust formation mechanism in these galaxies. The dustiness of
these massive objects being roughly Galactic, their metallicity
should thus be Galactic too. The grain growth timescale should
therefore be shorter than ' 100 Myr (panel (b) of Fig. 18), well
below the age of these systems. Consequently, these very distant
galaxies may not be the best laboratories to constrain the SN II
dust yield."
5.4.4. Comparison with Recent Studies
"As stated in Sects. 1 and 5.2.3, past studies have not been rig-
orously fitting cosmic dust evolution models to observations of
galaxies. Recently, N20 and De Looze et al. (2020, hereafter
DL20) have addressed this issue. N20 have adopted a relatively
coarse dust evolution model grid with a frequentist fitting ap-
proach. Although interesting, their approach does not allow them
to rigorously quantify parameter degeneracies and uncertainties.
The comparison with their results is therefore limited. We have
discussed the main discrepancies between the present work and
theirs in Sects. 2.1.2 and Sect. 5.2.3."
"DL20 have analyzed the JINGLE galaxy sample, follow-
ing a methodology similar to ours, fitting the IR SED of each
galaxy, and subsequently fitting one-zone dust evolution tracks
to their derived M?, Mgas, Mdust, Z and SFR. They adopted a
non-hierarchical Bayesian approach. To our knowledge, this is
the first article, similar to ours, to perform a rigorous fit of dust
evolution models, with clearly quantified parameter uncertain-
ties. Their results however qualitatively differ from ours. DL20
find an overall high SN II dust yield, and a low grain growth effi-
ciency (the tuning parameters are not assumed universal in their
study). In our opinion, the discrepancy between our results and
those of DL20 comes from the two following points."
"1. DL20’s metallicity coverage is more limited than ours. They
have only one source below 12 + log(O/H) = 8.0, and none
below 12 + log(O/H) = 7.8 (see e.g. their figure 7). Conse-
quently, they do not sample the stardust regime, below the
critical metallicity. Disentangling SN II dust condensation,
grain growth and shock destruction, with their data, is there-
fore rendered difficult."
"2. The posterior distribution of the dust evolution parameters
inferred by DL20, as seen in their figures G.7 to G.12 (they
focus their analysis on their galaxy bins 3 and 4), rarely goes
down to zero probability within the range allowed by their
uniform prior. It means the weight of evidence provided by
their data is relatively mild. Our inference of �grow and mdestgas
are consistent with their PDF, as they fall in a high proba-
bility domain in all their models. We simply have a smaller
uncertainty, thanks to our low-metallicity coverage. This is
more pronounced for their distribution of δSN (their fsurvival).
DL20 would have also benefitted from extending their prior"
"range down to smaller values, as they do not consider yields
below δSN = 10 %, while we infer a value around δSN ' 1 %."
6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
"This article has presented an observational study aimed at con-
straining the timescales of the main processes controlling the
evolution of interstellar dust in galaxies. The principal highlights
are the following."
"1. We have gathered the 3-µm-to-1-mm photometry and ancil-
lary data of 798 nearby galaxies from the DustPedia (Davies
et al. 2017) and DGS (Madden et al. 2013) surveys. We
have attempted to create the most conservative, homoge-
neous sample, by controlling the factors that could lead to
systematic biases (Sect. 2):
(a) the DustPedia and DGS IR data reduction and photome-"
"try have been performed consistently;
(b) the stellar mass and SFR have been estimated using the"
"same IMF;
(c) the metallicities have been estimated using one uniform"
"calibration;
(d) the total gas masses have been derived from [H i]21 cm and"
"12CO(J=1→0)2.6mm observations, when available. When
CO data was not available, the molecular gas mass was
estimated from a scaling relation."
"(e) Resolved interferometric [H i]21 cm observations of 20 of
the lowest metallicity objects were used in order to ex-
tract the gas mass corresponding exactly to the IR photo-
metric aperture."
"2. We have performed a hierarchical Bayesian dust SED fit
of the 798 galaxies, using the code HerBIE (G18) with the
THEMIS grain properties (Jones et al. 2017).
(a) This allowed us to infer the dust mass, Mdust, mean"
"starlight intensity, 〈U〉, and the mass fraction of
aromatic-feature-emitting grains, qAF, in each galaxy
(Sect. 3.2). The inferred parameters are given in Ta-
ble H.1."
"(b) We have compared our inferred parameters to a series of
additional runs, as well as to independent literature stud-
ies, in order to demonstrate the influence of the different
assumptions of our model and assess the robustness of
our results (Sects. 3.3 – 3.4)."
"3. We have displayed several well-known scaling relations in-
volving M?, Mgas, Mdust, 12 + log(O/H), SFR, qAF and 〈U〉,
for our sample (Sect. 4).
(a) We have shown that there is a drastic evolution with"
"metallicity of the dust-to-metal mass ratio (by two orders
of magnitude). We have extensively discussed the dif-
ferent biases that could artificially produce such a trend,
concluding they were unlikely (Sect. 4.1.3)."
"(b) We have noticed that early-type galaxies have a system-
atically lower dust-to-gas mass ratio than other types in
the same gas-to-stellar mass ratio range. We have inves-
tigated the possibility that this was resulting from the
enhanced dust destruction due to thermal sputtering in
the hot X-ray emitting gas permeating these objects. This
scenario is supported by a rough negative correlation be-
tween the dust-to-star mass ratio and the X-ray photon
rate per dust grain (Sect. 4.1.2)."
"(c) We have displayed the well-known trends of qAF with
12 + log(O/H) and 〈U〉. Our data indicate the correlation
with 12 + log(O/H) is significantly better (Sect. 4.2). It"
"Article number, page 30 of 64"
F. Galliano et al.: A Nearby Galaxy Perspective on Dust Evolution
"implies that, at the scale of a galaxy, the overall abun-
dance of small a-C(:H) grains might be principally con-
trolled by the efficiency of their formation (stardust pro-
duction and/or shattering of larger carbon grains). The
photodestruction of small a-C(:H) might overall be cir-
cumscribed around star forming regions."
"4. We have performed a hierarchical Bayesian fit of a one-
zone dust evolution model to the derived M?, Mgas, Mdust,
12 + log(O/H) and SFR of a subsample of 556 late-type and
irregular objects (Sect. 5).
(a) We have inferred the efficiency of the three main dust"
"evolution tuning parameters (Sect. 5.3): (i) the IMF-av-
eraged SN II dust yield is 〈YSN〉 . 0.03 M�/SN; (ii) the
grain growth efficiency parameter (Mattsson et al. 2012)
is �grow & 3000; (iii) the average gas mass cleared of dust
by a single SN II shock wave is mdestgas & 1200 M�/SN.
Our results therefore imply that dust production is domi-
nated by grain growth in the ISM above a critical metal-
licity of 12 + log(O/H) ' 8.0. They also suggest that the
massive amounts of dust detected in high redshift sys-
tems (z & 6) likely grew in the ISM."
"(b) We have shown that ELMGs were crucial in constrain-
ing these parameters, as they sample a regime where dust
production is dominated by SN II condensation. A steep,
strongly non-linear, dustiness-metallicity relation, such
as the one we have found, is the unambiguous evidence
that stardust can not dominate the content of solar metal-
licity systems."
"(c) We have shown and explained why these conclusions
were, to first order, independent of our IMF assumption
(Sect. 5.3.3)."
"(d) Our model fails at reproducing the relation between the
sSFR and the dust-to-star mass ratio. We suspect this is
due to the oversimplicity of our SFH, inflow and outflow
prescriptions."
"Several of the limitations of our study could be addressed
by spatially resolving star forming regions. Performing a simi-
lar analysis on ' 100 pc scales within galaxies would allow us
to access another important parameter: the density of the ISM.
This quantity drives mantle growth and coagulation. Local vari-
ations of the dust-to-metal mass ratio are good indications of
grain growth and can help us break the degeneracy with SN II
destruction (Sect. 5.2.2). In addition, spatial resolution would be
a way to address the origin of the trend of qAF with metallicity
(Sect. 4.2), as well as resolving ETGs to quantify the grain sput-
tering timescale (Sect. 4.1.2). Numerous spatially resolved dust
studies have already been published (e.g. Galliano et al. 2011;
Mattsson & Andersen 2012; Draine & Hensley 2013; Hunt et al.
2015; Roman-Duval et al. 2017; Aniano et al. 2020). We are cur-
rently preparing several papers of a resolved subsample, with the
same consistent approach as employed in the present manuscript
(Roychowdhury et al.; Casasola et al., in prep.). The main ob-
servational challenge in order to address these degeneracies is
however to obtain spatial resolution in ELMGs, at far-IR wave-
lengths. The data are currently very limited, because the sensitiv-
ity of Herschel was not high enough. SPICA (van der Tak et al.
2018) was the only observatory on the horizon to have the sen-
sitivity to produce resolved far-IR maps of ELMGs. Its sudden
cancellation by ESA might leave the important open questions
raised in this paper unanswered for several decades."

Appendix A: CALIBRATION UNCERTAINTIES
"The HB approach is one of the only methods allowing a rigorous
treatment of the photometric calibration uncertainties. These un-
certainties are indeed systematic effects, with both spectral and
spatial correlations. Some studies account for their spectral cor-
relations, but ignore their spatial correlations (e.g. Gordon et al.
2014). In the present paper, following G18, we assume that cal-
ibration uncertainties are perfectly correlated between sources,
and partially correlated between wavelengths. In this section, we
discuss the values of these uncertainties and of their correlation
coefficients."
"The DustPedia photometric fluxes, given in the archive24,
Fν(λ0) at wavelength λ0, are accompanied with a total uncer-
tainty being the quadratic sum of noise and calibration errors:"
σC18ν (λ0) =
"√(
σnoiseν (λ0)"
"(
δC18cal (λ0) × Fν(λ0)"
")2
, (A.1)"
"where δC18cal (λ0) is the calibration uncertainty (Table 1 of C18).
HerBIE treats the noise and calibration uncertainties separately.
Therefore, we keep the noise uncertainty, σnoiseν (λ0), but we build
a covariance matrix of the absolute calibration uncertainties,
Vcal, to replace the δC18cal coefficients."
Appendix A.1: The Full Covariance Matrix
"Using the separation strategy (Barnard et al. 2000), we decom-
pose the covariance matrix of the absolute calibration uncertain-
ties as:"
"Vcal = S calRcalS cal, (A.2)"
"where S cal is the diagonal matrix of standard-deviations and Rcal
the correlation matrix. The non-trivial elements of S cal and Rcal
are given in Tables A.1 – A.2. We describe, in the following
sections A.2 to A.8, how we obtained these values from the lit-
erature."
Appendix A.2: Spitzer/IRAC
"The calibration of IRAC data is presented by Reach et al. (2005).
It is performed using a subsample of the stellar catalog of Co-
hen et al. (2003). The components entering in the uncertainty
on the absolute calibration are given by Eq. (13) of Reach et al.
(2005) and the corresponding values in their Table 7. The first
term is the correlated uncertainty, σabs = 1.5 %, correspond-
ing to the uncertainty in the predicted fluxes of Vega and Sirius.
The second term is the uncorrelated uncertainty on the calibrator"
"fluxes:
√"
"(σ2groud − σ
2
abs)/n = 0.87 %, with σground = 2.3 % and"
"n = 4. Finally, there is an uncorrelated term introduced by the
dispersion of the IRAC observations of the calibrators: σrms/"
"where σrms = 2.0 %, 1.9 %, 2.1 % and 2.1 % for IRAC1, IRAC2,
IRAC3 and IRAC4, respectively."
"In addition, one must multiply the point source calibrated
fluxes by aperture correction factors. According to the IRAC in-
strument handbook25 (Sect. 4.11), these factors have a 10 % un-
certainty. We include this extra source of uncertainty, assuming
it is uncorrelated. These correction factors have been applied by
C18 for all the DustPedia galaxies and by Rémy-Ruyer et al.

Eq. A.2). See Table 1 for waveband naming conventions."
"Waveband label Calibration uncertainty

"(2015) for half of the DGS galaxies, the other half being nearly
point sources. The IRAC calibration uncertainties will thus be
overestimated for about 15 of our sources."
Appendix A.3: Spitzer/MIPS
"MIPS calibration has been independently performed for each of
its three wavebands. The 24 µm calibration is presented by En-
gelbracht et al. (2007). It is primarily based on observations of
A stars. The authors recommend adopting a net calibration un-
certainty of 4 %. The 70 µm calibration is presented by Gordon
et al. (2007). It is primarily based on observations of B and M
stars. The authors recommend using a calibration uncertainty
of 5 %, dominated by repeatability scatter. Finally, the 160 µm
calibration, presented by Stansberry et al. (2007) is performed
on observations of asteroids, simulatenously in the three MIPS
bands. This 160 µm calibration uncertainty is therefore tied to
24 and 70 µm. The authors estimate a 7 % uncertainty tied to
these bands, for a total uncertainty of 11.6 %. To simplify, we
assume that the calibration uncertainty is the quadratical sum of
4 % correlated with MIPS1, 5 % correlated with MIPS2, and the
remaining 9.7 % uncorrelated."
Appendix A.4: Herschel/PACS
"PACS calibration is performed on five stars, used as primary cal-
ibrators (Balog et al. 2014). The absolute calibration uncertainty
for point sources appears to be dominated by the stellar model
uncertainty of 5 %, correlated between bands. In addition, there
is a 2 % repeatability uncertainty, uncorrelated between bands.
The extended source calibration uncertainty is not quantified by
the instrument team."

Appendix A.5: Herschel/SPIRE
"SPIRE calibration, presented by Griffin et al. (2013) is per-
formed on Neptune. The uncertainty comes from three sources.
There is a 4 % correlated uncertainty on Neptune’s model. There
is also a 1.5 % uncorrelated uncertainty due to the noise in Nep-
tune’s observations. Finally, there is a 4 % uncorrelated uncer-
tainty on SPIRE’s beam area."
Appendix A.6: WISE
"WISE data have been calibrated by Jarrett et al. (2011) using ob-
servations of a network of stars in both ecliptic poles (Cohen
et al. 2003) and an additional red source, the galaxy NGC 6552.
These calibrators have been observed with Spitzer/IRAC and
Spitzer/MIPS, and compared to WISE. It appears that the rela-
tive WISE calibration, tied to Spitzer, is accurate to 2.4 %, 2.8 %,
4.5 % and 5.7 % (for WISE1, WISE2, WISE3 and WISE4, re-
spectively). These uncertainties come from the scatter of individ-
ual calibrators and can therefore be considered independent. The
red calibrator (NGC 6552) is reported to be too bright by ' 6 %
by Jarrett et al. (2011). However, Brown et al. (2014) revised
the central wavelength of the WISE4 band to correct systematic
discrepancies observed with red sources."
"The absolute calibration accuracy of WISE is not discussed
by Jarrett et al. (2011). We can simply assume that each WISE
band will be tied to the closest Spitzer band: WISE1 with
IRAC1; WISE2 with IRAC2; WISE3 with IRAC4; WISE4 with
MIPS1. We can thus quadratically add the Spitzer calibration
uncertainties to these bands and assume that this term will be
correlated with the Spitzer bands. However, we do not include
the IRAC uncertainty on the extended source correction (Ap-
pendix A.2), as these calibrators are point sources."
Appendix A.7: IRAS
"The IRAS flux calibration is presented by Wheelock et al. (1994,
Sect. VI.C.2)26. The 12 µm flux is calibrated on observations of
the star α-Tau, assuming the absolute flux value derived from
the ground-based 10 µm photometry by Rieke et al. (1985), ac-
curate within 3 %. An additional source of error comes from the
uncertainty of 2 % on the model used to extrapolate the flux at
12 µm. The 25 and 60 µm fluxes are calibrated by extrapolat-
ing the 12 µm flux, using stellar models, normalized to the Sun.
The uncertainty in this extrapolation, based on the scatter of in-
dividual stars, is estimated to be 4 % and 5.3 %, respectively
(Table VI..C.1 of Wheelock et al. 1994). These uncertainties,
which can be assumed to be independent, have to be quadrati-
cally added to the 12 µm uncertainty, which is a fully correlated
term. The 100 µm calibration is based on observations of aster-
oids, where the 60 µm flux is extrapolated to 100 µm, assum-
ing that the 25/60 and 60/100 color temperatures are identical.
Wheelock et al. (1994) estimate that the total relative calibration
uncertainty at 100 µm is 10 %, due to the model uncertainty and
scatter of the asteroid observations. This uncertainty is correlated
with the 60 µm."
"For extended sources, uncertainties in the frequency re-
sponse and the effective detector area have to be considered
(Wheelock et al. 1994, Sect. VI.C.4). The uncertainty on the fre-
quency response is not fully quantified, except that it should be
7 %/µm of the central bandwidth, with an uncertainty of 0.3 µm
on the bandwidth (Sect. VI.C.3 of Wheelock et al. 1994). It is"

"also specified that the 100 µm uncertainty can be significant for
objects cooler than 30 K, which is our case. The uncertainty on
the detector areas is given by Table IV.A.1 of Wheelock et al.
(1994) showing the flux dispersion of each individual detector,
during a cross-scan of the planetary nebula NGC 6543. The av-
erage dispersions of 6.4 %, 6.5 %, 11 % and 10.9 % (for IRAS1,
IRAS2, IRAS3 and IRAS4, respectively) can be considered as
an additional, independent source of uncertainty."
Appendix A.8: Planck/HFI
"The calibration of the HFI data used by C18 is presented
by Planck Collaboration et al. (2016). The two short wave-
length bands (350 and 550 µm) are calibrated on Neptune
and Uranus. The uncertainty on the model is 5 % includ-
ing 2 % spectrally independent. The statistical errors on the
observations of the calibrators are 1.4 % and 1.1 %, respec-
tively, which can be considered independent. The models
of Neptune used here and for SPIRE (Appendix A.5) are
the ESA3 and ESA4 models (ftp://ftp.sciops.esa.int/pub/hsc-
calibration/PlanetaryModels/), respectively. Both models differ
only by 0.3–0.6 % in the SPIRE and HFI bands. They will thus
induce correlation. To simplify, we assume that the HFI cali-
bration factors derived from Neptune (correlated with SPIRE)
and Uranus (not correlated with SPIRE) are averaged. We obtain
calibration uncertainties ' 30 % lower than Planck Collabora-
tion et al. (2016), as they have opted for the more conservative,
linear addition of independent errors. We choose here the more
rigorous quadratrical addition."
"The four long wavelength bands of HFI are calibrated on
the CMB dipole. The first source of uncertainty is the scatter
of individual bolometers: 0.78 %, 0.16 %, 0.07 % and 0.09 % at
850 µm, 1.38, 2.1 and 3.0 mm. The second source of uncer-
tainty comes from the gain variations: 0.03 %, 0.04 %, 0.05 %
and 0.05 %, respectively. These different uncertainties can be
considered independent."
Appendix B: HOMOGENEITY OF THE SAMPLE
Appendix B.1: DustPedia and DGS Photometry
"Fig. B.1 displays the comparison, in the 6 Herschel bands, of the
photometry of the sources of the DGS that are part of the Dust-
Pedia sample. The DustPedia photometry has been estimated by
C18 (cf. Sect. 2.1.1), and the DGS photometry, by Rémy-Ruyer
et al. (2015, cf. Sect. 2.1.2). Both are in very good agreement."
Appendix B.2: Derivation of the Stellar Mass
"To further investigate the discrepancy between the CIGALE fits
of N20 and the Eskew et al. (2012) approximation used by Mad-
den et al. (2014), discussed in Sect. 2.2.1, we have compared
the two estimators on our sample. To close the controversy, we
have modelled the UV-to-mm SED of the 35 DGS galaxies that
were not in DustPedia, with CIGALE, using the same settings as
Nersesian et al. (2019, i.e. using two stellar populations). We
therefore have CIGALE-derived M? for our whole sample. This
is shown in panel (a) of Fig. B.2. The stellar mass derived using
CIGALE with two stellar populations are in very good agreement
with the Eskew et al. (2012) approximation."
"Panel (b) of Fig. B.2 compares the same CIGALE-two-
population estimates with the values of M? reported by N20.
The main differences are the following, noting that the stellar"

"Fig. B.1. Comparison between the DustPedia and DGS photometry. The
13 sources of the DGS which are part of the DustPedia catalog are com-
pared in the 3 PACS and 3 SPIRE bands (one color per filter). The x
axis shows the photometry estimated by C18, while the y axis shows
the photometry estimated by Rémy-Ruyer et al. (2015). The dashed line
represents the 1:1 relation."
"masses quoted by N20 come from the SED modelling presented
by Burgarella et al. (2020)."
"1. Nersesian et al. (2019) used the UV-optical photometry
of Clark et al. (2018), which have been homogenized
(cf. Sect. 2.1), whereas Burgarella et al. (2020) gathered UV-
optical data from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database
(NED). The latter is a compilation of data from the literature
that can be inhomogeneous in terms of photometric aperture,
extinction correction and removal of foreground stars."
"2. Nersesian et al. (2019) used CIGALE with two stellar popula-
tions: (i) an old exponentially decreasing SFH; (ii) a young
burst. In contrast, Burgarella et al. (2020) used a single de-
layed SFH, which can lead to underestimating the mass, be-
cause of the outshining effect of the recent star formation
(e.g. Lopes et al. 2020). For instance, Buat et al. (2014) con-
ducted a large comparison of stellar mass estimates and con-
cluded that models using two stellar populations were pro-
viding the best fits. This can explain why the IRAC1 and
IRAC2 fluxes are systematically underestimated by the mean
model of N20 (cf. their figure A.1), while it is not the case for
Nersesian et al. (2019, http://dustpedia.astro.noa.gr/Cigale).
Yet, these bands sample the spectral range where the bulk
of the stellar mass dominates the emission. In addition, most
of the galaxies of the DGS are Blue Compact Dwarf galax-
ies (BCD). These galaxies are known to be actively form-
ing stars and have an old underlying stellar population (e.g.
Hunter & Gallagher 1989; Grebel 1999; Kunth & Östlin
2000; Aloisi et al. 2007; Janowiecki et al. 2017)."
"3. Nersesian et al. (2019) used a Salpeter (1955) IMF, whereas
Burgarella et al. (2020) used a Chabrier (2003) IMF leading
to a systematic scaling by a factor 0.61."
"Fig. B.2. Comparison of stellar mass estimators. Panel (a) compares the
CIGALE estimates of M?, using two stellar populations (x-axis), with the
Eskew et al. (2012, y-axis) empirical approximation, both assuming a
Salpeter (1955) IMF. Panel (b) compares the same x-axis as panel (a) to
the CIGALE estimates, using a single stellar population and a Chabrier
(2003) IMF, by N20. In both panels, the blue symbols correspond to
the values presented in Nersesian et al. (2019), and the red symbols
correspond to the values estimated for this study, with the same CIGALE
settings. The solid yellow line represents the 1:1 relation. The dashed
yellow line in panel (b) represents the 1:0.61 relation that accounts for
the difference in IMFs."
"The comparison of these two estimates, in panel (b) of Fig. B.2,
shows that the stellar masses of N20 are most of the time system-
atically lower than those of Nersesian et al. (2019), sometimes
drastically."
"Appendix C: ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE
PARAMETRIZATION OF THEMIS"
"We have presented the way we parametrize the THEMIS size dis-
tribution in Sect. 3.1.1. It consists in linearly scaling the fractions
of a-C(:H) smaller than 7 Å, and between 7 and 15 Å. We call it
the linear parametrization. It is controlled by the two parameters
qAF and fVSAC, introduced in Sect. 3.1.1. In the present appendix,
we demonstrate, on an example, that this parametrization is flex-"
"Article number, page 37 of 64"
http://dustpedia.astro.noa.gr/Cigale
"
A&A proofs: manuscript no. manuscript"
"ible enough to mimic the original parametrization of THEMIS.
The THEMIS size distribution of small a-C(:H) is a power-law,
with minimum cut-off size amin = 4 Å and index α = 5 (Table 2
of Jones et al. 2013). We call it the non-linear parametrization.
Varying amin and α is probably more physical than our linear
method, as it preserves the continuity of the size distribution.
However, it produces SEDs with very similar shapes."
"Fig. C.1. THEMIS parametrization comparison. The two panels display
the same quantities as Fig. 1. On each panel, the red curve shows
THEMIS, non-linearly parametrized, i.e. varying the minimum cut-off
radius, amin, and the index of the power-law1 size distribution, α. The
blue curve shows THEMIS, linearly parametrized, with the method de-
scribed in Sect. 3.1.1. The dots on the two SED curves (panel b) repre-
sent the synthetic photometry, i.e. the model integrated in the filters of
Table 1."
"This is demonstrated on Fig. C.1. This figure displays the
same quantities as Fig. 1, but compares the two parametriza-
tions. The red curves show the size distribution (panel a) and the
corresponding SED (panel b), for the non-linear method, with
amin = 5 Å and α = 4. The blue curves show the same quantities,
with the linear method. We see that the broadband fluxes (dots
in panel b) produced by these two parametrizations are very sim-
ilar. The fact that they are not exactly the same is not important
here. What is relevant is that the two methods can alter the SED
with the same dynamical range."
Appendix D: POSTERIOR PREDICTIVE P-VALUE
"We have estimated the posterior predictive p-value (PPP; e.g.
Gelman et al. 2004) of our reference run (Sect. 3.2). PPPs are
the Bayesian equivalent to a chi-squared test. They allow us to
quantify the goodness of our fit. PPPs are estimated by generat-
ing sets of replicated observables, noted Drep, from our posterior
distribution, conditional on the actual data (Sect. 2), noted D:"
"p(Drep|D) =
∫"
"p(Drep|X)p(X|D) dX, (D.1)"
"where X are the model parameters. In practice, these replicated
sets are simply estimated by computing the SED model for sam-
ples of the parameters drawn from the MCMC. The comparison
to the data requires the assumption of a test statistic, T (D, X).
We adopt the commonly-used χ2 discrepancy quantity:"
"T (D, X) ≡
∑"
"[
Di − µ(Di|X)"
"]2
σ(Di|X)2"
", (D.2)"
"where the index i represents every observable of every galaxy,
and the quantities µ(Di|X) and σ(Di|X) are the mean and
standard-deviation of the replicated data. We then need to es-
timate the probability:"
"pB ≡ P
(
T (Drep|X) ≥ T (D|X) |D"
")
. (D.3)"
"If the difference between the replicated set and the data is solely
due to statistical fluctuations, this probability should be on aver-
age 50 %. A model passes the test, at the 98 % credence level, if
1 % < pB < 99 %."
"In our case, we get pB = 0.68 %, indicating our model fails
this test (it passes the 99 % credence level, though). Investigating
the cause of this low p-value, we notice that a few observations
are responsible for large deviations. Fig. D.1 displays the SEDs
containing the 9 most deviant fluxes."
"IC 0319 and NGC 4322: the problematic flux is PACS1. For
IC 0319, it clearly lies above the rest of the observations,
but has a small error bar. There is likely a problem with this
particular measure. The problem is more difficult to assess
for NGC 4322. However, the model is pulled well below this
flux by the three SPIRE upper limits."
"UGC 05336 and PGC 041994: the problems come from sev-
eral far-IR upper limits. We display 3σ upper limits when
the value of the measured flux is smaller than its 1σ noise
level. In the case of the highlighted bands, the actual value
of the fluxes are negative, either because of statistical fluctu-
ations, or background over-subtraction. Since the modelled
flux can not be negative, we have T (Drep|X) � T (D|X) for
all replicated sets, pulling pB to the tail of the distribution."
"Article number, page 38 of 64"
F. Galliano et al.: A Nearby Galaxy Perspective on Dust Evolution
"Fig. D.1. SEDs of the 4 galaxies causing the maximum deviations of the
PPP. The black circles with error bars are the observables. Most of them
are upper limits. The blue line is the maximum a posteriori model, and
the purple dots are the synthetic photometry. The problematic fluxes are
identified by a red circle."
"In summary, we are not in the case where the model would pro-
vide a poor fit on average. A few discrepant data, that are treated
as outliers by the model (i.e. which have a very limited impact
on the results), are responsible for failing the PPP test. Excluding
these 9 observables, which represent only 0.07 % of our sample,
we get pB = 1.3 %, making our model pass the test. In practice,
such a test is quite strict, knowing the complexity of our hierar-
chical model and of the data. Indeed, the frequentist equivalent
would be to test the chi-squared of all our SED fits at once. Ac-
counting for missing data, the model for our 798 galaxies would
have 3655 degrees of freedom. For a 98 % confidence level, the
reduced chi-squared would be required to lie in the narrow range
0.95 < χ̄2 < 1.05. This is because the more data we have, the
smaller the statistical fluctuations should be."

negative correlation (such as shown by e.g. Dupac et al. 2003).
We show this plot as a reference for comparison to other studies,
since the MBB is the most commonly used model. Nonetheless,
we emphasize that its physical interpretation is rendered diffi-
cult by the fact that β is degenerate with the mixing of physical
conditions (cf. Sect. 2.3.1 of Galliano et al. 2018, for a review)."
Appendix F: UNCERTAINTY REPRESENTATION
"We detail here the way we display uncertainties in correlation
plots throughout this article."
Appendix F.1: Skewed Uncertainty Ellipses
"Our HB model computes the full posterior distribution of the pa-
rameters of each source. Such a distribution is usually asymmet-
ric and correlations between parameters can be strong. Display-
ing this marginalized posterior distribution as density contours,
for several hundreds of sources, is visually ineffective. In 2D
correlation plots, uncertainty ellipses are a widely-used device
to display the extent of the posterior and show the correlation
between parameters. However, it does not account for its skew-
ness. To address this issue, we display each posterior as a Skewed
Uncertainty Ellipse (SUE), which is the 1σ contour of a Bivari-
ate Split-Normal distribution (BSN; Villani & Larsson 2006),
having the same means, variances, skewnesses and correlation
coefficient as the posterior. We add a central dot corresponding
to the mode of this BSN. Fig. F.1 demonstrates the different ways
of displaying uncertainties, for a typical PDF (orange density).
Panel (c) shows the corresponding SUE. It has the advantage of"

We choose M-estimators (Mosteller & Tukey 1977), which are
a generalization of maximum-likelihood estimators. They have
been popularized in astrophysics by Beers et al. (1990). Loca-
tion and scale M-estimators, using Tukey’s biweight loss func-
tion were presented by Lax (1975). Posing ui = (xi− lx)/(c× sx),
where lx = med(X) is the median of the sample X = {xi}i=1...N ,
sx = 1.4826 × med(|X − med(X)|) is the Median Absolute Devi-
ation (MAD) of X, and c is a tuning parameter, the M-estimator
of the mean is:"
"µ̂(X) = lx +
∑
|ui |<1(xi − lx)(1 − u"
"2∑
|ui |<1(1 − u"
"2
, (F.20)"
and for the variance:
"V̂(X) =
N ×"
"∑
|ui |<1(xi − lx)"
"2(1 − u2i )
4[∑"
"|ui |<1(1 − u
2
i )(1 − 5u"
"2
i )
] [∑"
"|ui |<1(1 − u
2
i )(1 − 5u"
"2
i ) − 1"
"] .
(F.21)"
"Considering a second sample Y = {yi}i=1...N , an M-estimator of
the covariance is presented by Mosteller & Tukey (1977). Posing
vi = (yi − ly)/(c × sy), the covariance can be estimated as:"
"V̂(X,Y) =
N ×"
"∑
|ui |<1,|vi |<1(xi − lx)(1 − u"
"2(yi − ly)(1 − v2i )
2[∑"
"|ui |<1(1 − u
2
i )(1 − 5u"
"2
i )
] [∑"
"|vi |<1(1 − v
2
i )(1 − 5v"
"2
i )
] ."
(F.22)
"These estimators are implemented in the Python astropy
module (Astropy Collaboration et al. 2013, 2018). We have de-
signed our own skewness W-estimator:"
"γ̂(X) =
∑
|ui |<1 u"
"3
i (1 − u"
"2∑
|ui |<1(1 − u"
"2
. (F.23)"
"We have also slightly improved astropy’s implementation by
iterating on Eqs. (F.20) – (F.23), replacing lx, ly, sx and sy with
µ̂(X), µ̂(Y),"
"√
V̂(X) and"
"√
V̂(Y), respectively, until a 10−5 relative"
"accuracy is reached. The tuning parameter is usually taken as
c = 6 for the mean and c = 9 for the variance, covariance and
skewness."
"Appendix G: DUST EVOLUTION RESULTS
ASSUMING A CHABRIER IMF"
"We have performed the modelling of Sect. 5.2.2, assuming a
Chabrier (2003) IMF. The data have been corrected accordingly:
M? has been multiplied by 0.61 and SFR by 0.63 (Madau &
Dickinson 2014), as these two quantities were derived assum-
ing a Salpeter (1955) IMF. Fig. G.1 shows the fit of the scaling
relations; it is the equivalent of Fig. 14. Figs. G.2 – G.3 dis-
play the PDF of the dust evolution and SFH-related parameters,
respectively; they are the equivalent of Figs. 16 – 17. The in-
ferred timescales are displayed in Fig. G.4; it is the equivalent of
Fig. 18."
