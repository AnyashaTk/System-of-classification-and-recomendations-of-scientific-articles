ABSTRACT
"The period versus mass diagrams (i.e., rotational sequences) of open clusters provide crucial con-"
"straints for angular momentum evolution studies. However, their memberships are often heavily con-"
"taminated by field stars, which could potentially bias the interpretations. In this paper, we use data"
"from Gaia DR2 to re-assess the memberships of seven open clusters with rotational data, and present"
an updated view of stellar rotation as a function of mass and age. We use the Gaia astrometry to
"identify the cluster members in phase-space, and the photometry to derive revised ages and place"
the stars on a consistent mass scale. Applying our membership analysis to the rotational sequences
"reveals that: 1) the contamination in clusters observed from the ground can reach up to ∼ 35%; 2) the
overall fraction of rotational outliers decreases substantially when the field contaminants are removed,"
but some outliers still persist; 3) there is a sharp upper edge in the rotation periods at young ages;
"4) stars in the 1.0–0.6M� range inhabit a global maximum in terms of rotation periods, potentially"
"providing an optimal window for habitable planets. Additionally, we see clear evidence for a strongly"
mass-dependent spin-down process. In the regime where rapid rotators are leaving the saturated do-
"main, the rotational distributions broaden (in contradiction with popular models), which we interpret"
as evidence that the torque must be lower for rapid rotators than for intermediate ones. The cleaned
rotational sequences from ground-based observations can be as constraining as those obtained from
space.

1. INTRODUCTION
"Together with mass and metallicity, rotation is one"
of the defining properties of stars. Stellar rotation is
strongly mass-dependent (Kraft 1967a; Garćıa et al.
"2014), and while stars with radiative envelopes (M &
1.4M�) live their lives as rapid rotators, stars with con-"
vective envelopes spin down as they age (Skumanich
1972). The overall framework of the rotational evolu-
tion of low mass stars is that they are born with a range
"of rotation rates (∼ 1–10 days; Herbst et al. 2002) and
star-disk coupling timescales (from < 1 and up to ∼ 10
Myr; Williams & Cieza 2011), and once they arrive onto"

"the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS), they experience"
a decrease in their rotational velocities due to angular
momentum losses caused by magnetized winds (Parker
1958; Schatzman 1962; Weber & Davis 1967; Kawaler
1988; Pinsonneault et al. 1989).
"For lower main-sequence stars, the observable stellar"
"properties do not appreciably change with time, which"
makes the determination of ages of individual stars chal-
"lenging (Soderblom 2010). In this regard, the empirical"
spin-down of low mass stars offers a valuable age diag-
"nostic, and this idea is known as gyrochronology (Barnes"
"2003, 2007; Mamajek & Hillenbrand 2008)."
"If properly validated, gyrochronology can provide"
valuable age information for Galactic and stellar pop-
"ulation studies (McQuillan et al. 2013, 2014; Davenport"
"2017; Davenport & Covey 2018; van Saders et al. 2019),"

as well as for the characterization of exoplanet hosts
"(e.g., Gallet & Delorme 2019; Carmichael et al. 2020;"
David et al. 2020; Gallet 2020; Zhou et al. 2021). More-
"over, although stellar evolution theory is successful in"
"predicting numerous properties of stars, this is not the"
case for the evolution of angular momentum and its re-
"lated physical processes (e.g., transport in stellar interi-"
"ors, birth conditions, magnetic braking). Consequently,"
stellar models that incorporate it need to be calibrated
"with empirical observations (e.g., Gossage et al. 2020)."
All of the above add to a compelling need for gy-
"rochronology to be examined and tested. For old ages (&
few Gyr), these efforts have used field stars (Irwin et al."
2011; Angus et al. 2015; Newton et al. 2016; van Saders
et al. 2016) and wide separation binaries (Chanamé &
Ramı́rez 2012; Janes 2017; Godoy-Rivera & Chanamé
"2018). For young ages (. 1 Gyr), the calibrations have
been based on the empirical rotational sequences (i.e.,"
period versus mass or temperature diagrams) of star-
"forming regions, associations, and open clusters (Denis-"
"senkov et al. 2010; Gallet & Bouvier 2013, 2015; Angus"
et al. 2019).
"With the advent of space-based missions, the field of"
stellar rotation is entering a new era. The unparalleled
astrometry from the Gaia mission (Gaia Collaboration
et al. 2018a) has already allowed new gyrochronology
"inspections to be carried out (e.g., Curtis et al. 2019b;"
"Angus et al. 2020). In addition to this, results obtained"
from the observations by the Kepler and K2 missions
(Borucki et al. 2010; Howell et al. 2014) have showed
striking trends at various ages. These include strongly
mass-dependent rotation rates in populations younger
"than 10 Myr (Somers et al. 2017; Rebull et al. 2018,"
"2020), unusual spin-down behavior in ∼ 1–3 Gyr-old
clusters (Curtis et al. 2019a, 2020; Gruner & Barnes"
"2020; see also Agüeros et al. 2018), and anomalously"
"rapid rotation in & 5 Gyr-old field stars (van Saders
et al. 2016)."
"The strengths of space data, namely unparalleled time"
"coverage and photometric precision, have indeed pro-"
"vided exquisite data in selected regimes. However, for"
"many interesting clusters, a combination of crowded"
"fields, faint sources, and long rotation periods, make"
obtaining data from space surveys impractical. By con-
"trast, ground-based surveys can measure precise and ac-"
"curate rotation periods for even faint sources, because"
star spot modulation induces relatively large photomet-
ric signals. The native seeing even from average sites is
"also far better than the 4′′ pixels of Kepler and K2, or"
the 21′′ pixels of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satel-
"lite (TESS; Ricker et al. 2015). As a result, ground-"
based surveys are still fundamental for studies of stellar
rotation.
"In this context, although star clusters have played a"
crucial role in our understanding of angular momen-
"tum evolution, a thorough decontamination of their ro-"
tational sequences is currently lacking. For the sys-
"tems that have been observed from the ground, the"
field contamination in their sequences is expected to
"go from ∼ 20% (e.g., Hartman et al. 2009a) and reach
up to ∼ 40–60% (e.g., Irwin et al. 2007a, 2008, 2009).
This makes the revision of their memberships an im-"
"perative task, something the unprecedented space-based"
data from Gaia is particularly well-suited for. The goal
of this paper is to use the high-precision Gaia astrom-
etry to clean the rotational sequences of a sample of
"open clusters, with the prospects of providing revised"
"gyrochronology calibrators, and an updated view of stel-"
lar rotation as a function of mass and age.
"This paper is structured as follows. In §2 we present
the sample of star clusters with rotation period mea-"
"surements we study. In §3 we illustrate our method us-
ing one cluster as a working example, where we use the"
Gaia astrometry to identify likely cluster members and
"calculate their stellar masses and temperatures. In §4
we show the results of applying this procedure to all of"
"our clusters, and discuss the effects that the member-"
"ship analysis has on the rotational sequences. In §5 we
revise the properties of the clusters we study and com-"
"pare them with literature values. In §6 we discuss our
findings and present an updated view of stellar rotation."
We conclude in §7.
2. SAMPLE SELECTION AND ROTATION
PERIOD DATA
2.1. Selecting our Sample
We compile a list of open clusters that satisfy four
conditions: 1) they hold high scientific interest for
constraining the processes that govern stellar rotation;
"2) they have rotation period information, derived uni-"
"formly within each cluster, for ∼ hundreds of candidate
members; 3) they have reliable Gaia data that allows us"
to accurately model them astrometrically; 4) they po-
tentially have enough non member contamination that
a careful membership analysis to clean their rotational
sequences would have significant impact. The rotation
periods we use come from both ground- and space-based
"optical photometric monitoring, and the membership"
contamination is expected to be higher for the clusters
observed from the ground than for those observed from
space. Details on the Gaia data and astrometric mod-
eling are provided in §3.

"Note—The clusters are sorted by increasing age. The
quoted ages come from Gallet & Bouvier (2015) and are
the classical, pre Gaia values. The period measurements are
taken from the references cited throughout §2. Note that for
M37 we are adopting the clean sample defined by Hartman
et al. (2009a), and that for NGC 6811 we are combining the
Meibom et al. (2011b), Curtis et al. (2019a), Santos et al.
(2019), and Santos et al. (in prep) samples."
We select the richest clusters observed by the Moni-
"tor Project (NGC 2547, M50, NGC 2516), which span"
a range of ages and have been poorly studied for mem-
"bership (§2.2.1). We include the rich M37 cluster, one
of the oldest clusters with stellar rotation information"
"(Hartman et al. 2009a), for which a high membership"
"contamination has been claimed (§2.2.2). We also in-
clude benchmark clusters that have been studied from"
"space (Pleiades, Praesepe, NGC 6811), and that span a"
"range of ages (§2.2.3). We limit our selection to open
clusters but do not include star-forming regions and as-"
"sociations, which require a more complex treatment of"
"membership (e.g., Gagné & Faherty 2018; Galli et al."
2018; Kuhn et al. 2019). We also exclude systems that
are either too close or too distant for a reliable member-
"ship analysis, or that have poor Gaia data, or systems"
"with smaller or heterogeneous rotation samples (§2.3).
Table 1 lists the seven open clusters we study1, to-"
gether with the number of stars in each of them with
period measurements. Table 1 also reports their classi-
cal literature ages (Gallet & Bouvier 2015; see also Gal-
"let & Bouvier 2013 and Denissenkov et al. 2010), but we"
"highlight that for our analysis, we perform an indepen-"
dent derivation of revised cluster properties using Gaia
data and recent spectroscopic results (see §5).
2.2. Rotation Period Catalogs
"2.2.1. NGC 2547, M50, and NGC 2516"
"1 Alternative names for some of our systems are:
Pleiades=M45=Melotte 22; M50=NGC 2323; M37=NGC 2099;
Praesepe=M44=Melotte 88=NGC 2632; NGC 6811=Melotte
222. All throughout this paper we refer to them with the names
listed in Table 1."
The Monitor Project2 performed an optical photomet-
ric survey of several young open clusters using 2- and 4-
m class telescopes with wide field cameras (Irwin et al.
2007a). The derived lightcurves allowed for searches of
transiting planets (Miller et al. 2008) and eclipsing bi-
"naries (Irwin et al. 2007b), as well as measurements of"
rotation periods.
"Of the clusters observed by the Monitor Project, we"
"include NGC 2547, M50, and NGC 2516 in our sam-"
ple. All three of these clusters offer interesting con-
straints on stellar rotation evolution. With an age of
"∼ 35 Myr, NGC 2547 is a well-populated system where
solar analogs have just arrived on the main sequence,"
and data in this age range (younger than the Pleiades
and older than star-forming regions) is a sensitive test of
"theory. With ages of ∼ 130 and 150 Myr, M50 and NGC
2516 offer natural comparison points for the benchmark"
"Pleiades cluster. Additionally, the contamination rates"
"quoted for these clusters are in the ∼ 40–60% range (Ir-
win et al. 2007a, 2008, 2009), which hints that a revision"
of their rotational sequences could be significant.
"NGC 2547, M50, and NGC 2516 were studied in a"
"similar fashion by Irwin et al. (2008), Irwin et al. (2009),"
"and Irwin et al. (2007a), respectively. These authors"
"surveyed a region out to ∼ 50′, ∼ 30′, and ∼ 60′ from
the clusters’ center, identified candidate members on the"
"basis of V versus V −I color-magnitude diagram (CMD)
selections, and reported rotation periods for 176, 812,"
"and 362 stars, respectively."
2.2.2. M37
"M37 (age of ∼ 550 Myr) is one of the very few open
clusters with a large rotational sample that are older"
"than 500 Myr. This, in addition to its age being close to"
"the classical ∼ 580 Myr age for Praesepe, and a quoted
∼ 20% contamination rate (Hartman et al. 2009a), make
it an interesting system to include in our sample."
Hartman et al. (2008b) observed the M37 cluster with
the 6.5-m MMT telescope in order to constrain its pa-
"rameters, study variable stars (Hartman et al. 2008a),"
"measure rotation periods (Hartman et al. 2009a), and"
study the occurrence rate of transiting planets (Hart-
man et al. 2009b). Given the exquisite optical observa-
"tions, thorough lightcurve analysis, and the aforemen-"
"tioned expected contamination rate, we include M37 in"
our sample.
"Hartman et al. (2009a) surveyed a region out to ∼
20′ from the cluster center, identified candidate mem-"
"bers on the basis of two CMD selections (r versus g − r
and g − i), and reported rotation periods for 575 stars."

"Of these, however, only 367 are considered by Hartman"
"et al. (2009a) to be the clean periodic sample, where"
the different algorithms for determining periods showed
"good agreement with each other, and their results did"
not differ by more than 10%. We take this clean sample
as our nominal M37 data set.
"2.2.3. Pleiades, Praesepe, and NGC 6811"
The Kepler spacecraft in both its original 4-year mis-
"sion and subsequent K2 mission, observed several open"
clusters of a range of ages. These observations pro-
"duced lightcurves with exquisite photometric precision,"
and have been used to construct rotation period catalogs
for a number of clusters.
"Of the clusters observed by Kepler and K2, we include"
"the Pleiades, Praesepe, and NGC 6811 in our sample."
"Given their proximity, the Pleiades (distance of ≈ 136
pc; age of ∼ 125 Myr) and Praesepe (distance of ≈ 186
pc; age of ∼ 580 Myr) clusters have been used for ro-
tation studies for several decades (e.g., Anderson et al."
1966; Kraft 1967b; Dickens et al. 1968; Stauffer et al.
1984; Stauffer & Hartmann 1987; Queloz et al. 1998;
"Terndrup et al. 1999, 2000; Scholz & Eislöffel 2007; De-"
lorme et al. 2011; Agüeros et al. 2011; Douglas et al.
"2014; Rebull et al. 2016a,b, 2017; Stauffer et al. 2016),"
and the periods derived from the K2 observations com-
prise their state-of-the-art rotational samples. While the
number of NGC 6811 stars with Kepler periods is lower
"compared to the aforementioned clusters, its old age (∼
1000 Myr) makes it a remarkably interesting system for"
"stellar rotation studies (e.g., Meibom et al. 2011b; Curtis"
et al. 2019a; Rodŕıguez et al. 2020; Velloso et al. 2020).
"• Pleiades: Rebull et al. (2016a) performed a com-
prehensive lightcurve analysis of the stars observed"
"by K2 in a region out to ∼ 350′ from the clus-
ter center. Rebull et al. (2016b) expanded on this
by meticulously classifying and identifying the dif-"
ferent structures present in the periodograms and
"lightcurves, and Stauffer et al. (2016) then used"
this to study the Pleiades in the context of angu-
lar momentum evolution. The sample of candi-
date members used by these studies comprises 759
stars with measured periods that were classified as
Best+OK members by Rebull et al. (2016a) on the
basis of proper motions and position in the CMD
selections. We take this sample as our nominal
Pleiades data set. We note that although the K2
observations missed part of the northern region of
"the cluster, this is unlikely to bias the period dis-"
tribution (Rebull et al. 2016a).
"• Praesepe: a similar study to that of the Pleiades
was carried out for Praesepe by Rebull et al."
"(2017). In this case, the candidate members ex-"
"tend out to ∼ 400′ from the cluster center, and
they were selected on the basis of proper mo-"
tions and CMD position. The final Rebull et al.
(2017) sample comprises 809 candidate members
with measured periods.
"• NGC 6811: Meibom et al. (2011b) studied can-
didates that were previously vetted using radial"
velocity (RV) data in a region out to 30′ from the
"cluster center, and reported periods for 71 stars."
Curtis et al. (2019a) surveyed a region of 60′ ra-
"dius, selected candidate members on the basis of"
"Gaia CMD position and astrometry, and reported"
periods for 171 stars. We complement these with
the Santos et al. (2019) and Santos et al. (in prep)
"Kepler field catalogs, which reported periods for"
194 NGC 6811 candidate members. To maximize
"the number of stars with measured periods, we"
combine all of these catalogs and end up with 235
stars after accounting for repetitions. For stars in
"common among the references, we prioritize the"
Santos et al. (2019) and Santos et al. (in prep)
"periods first, Curtis et al. (2019a) second, and Mei-"
bom et al. (2011b) third (although a comparison of
these values showed excellent agreement). While
the periods of our joint NGC 6811 catalog are de-
"rived from slightly different techniques, the studies"
carried out by these three references are all based
on the same Kepler data.
2.3. Potential Expansions to our Cluster Sample
There are a number of systems that we initially con-
sidered including in our sample given their high scien-
"tific interest, but that we discarded for specific reasons,"
which we discuss below. We leave an equivalent inves-
tigation of them as future work to be done with a more
"sophisticated underlying model, and when higher preci-"
sion astrometry becomes available.
"• ρ Ophiuchus, Taurus, Upper Scorpius, and h Per:
Rebull et al. (2018), Rebull et al. (2020), and"
Moraux et al. (2013) reported periods for these
"young associations (ages of ∼ 1, 3, 8, and 13 Myr,
respectively). Given their young ages, these sys-"
tems offer interesting pre main-sequence stellar
"rotation constraints. However, given their more"
"complex kinematics and reddening distributions,"
somewhat different analysis techniques would be
required. We therefore defer their consideration
to a subsequent paper.
"• IC 2391/2602 and α Per: with ages of ∼ 50 and ∼
80 Myr respectively, these clusters offer snapshots"
Rotation of Open Clusters Stars with Gaia 5
of the evolution of stellar rotation at young ages
that could be compared with slightly younger and
"older systems (e.g., NGC 2547 and the Pleiades)."
"Unfortunately, the rotation samples for these sys-"
tems are still small (< 40 stars each) and heteroge-
neous (Denissenkov et al. 2010; Gallet & Bouvier
2015).
"• M34: rotation periods for stars in this ∼ 220 Myr-
old cluster have been reported by Irwin et al."
"(2006) (as one of the Monitor Project targets),"
"James et al. (2010), and Meibom et al. (2011a)."
Although we initially attempted to include M34 in
"our sample, the Gaia data of this system showed"
"odd gaps in spatial and magnitude space, possi-"
bly related to problems with the scanning pattern
of this region of the sky. This prevented us from
carrying out a similar study for this cluster at this
"• Hyades: rotation periods for stars in this ∼ 625
Myr-old cluster have been reported by a number"
"of authors (e.g., Delorme et al. 2011, Douglas et al."
"2016, Douglas et al. 2019), and the Hyades is suf-"
"ficiently close (≈ 47 pc; Gaia Collaboration et al.
2018b) and well studied that we do not anticipate"
substantial membership issues.
"• NGC 6819: rotation periods for 30 stars in this
cluster were reported by Meibom et al. (2015)."
"Given its age of ∼ 2 Gyr (Bossini et al. 2019),
studying this cluster is of high scientific interest."
"However, given its small parallax (≈ 0.356 mas;
Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2018), and the current preci-"
"sion of the Gaia data, this cluster would naturally"
be harder to fit with our current method.
3. METHOD
"In this section, we describe the method we use to an-"
"alyze the clusters in our sample. In §3.1 we use the
Gaia astrometry to fit the cluster and the field in phase-"
"space, and calculate membership probabilities. Since"
the periodic samples are deep and include faint stars
"with large formal astrometric errors, we classify stars"
"into four different groups: highly likely cluster members,"
"highly likely non members, an intermediate category of"
possible members (typically faint objects with large as-
"trometric uncertainties), and a category of stars without"
enough information to be classified. We are interested
"in both single and binary stars, and while we attempt to"
"avoid biasing our results against binaries, there are Gaia"
selection effects related to the excess astrometric noise
from them. We do not apply a Hertzsprung–Russell
"(HR) diagram selection, but our final samples are strik-"
"ingly clear in that plane. In §3.2 we crossmatch the Gaia
data with the periodic sample. In §3.3 we combine all of
the above with state-of-the-art evolutionary models to"
calculate stellar masses and temperatures.
"For presentation purposes, we use NGC 2547 as a"
"working example, although we proceed in an identical"
fashion for all the systems. We present the results of
applying this procedure to all our clusters in §4.
"3.1. Gaia Data, Cluster Fitting, and Membership"
Probabilities
"In §3.1.1 we describe the Gaia data, in §3.1.2 we use
them to characterize the cluster and the field in parallax"
and proper motion space by fitting a model that allows
"for intrinsic dispersions, and in §3.1.3 we classify the
stars in different categories and calculate memberships"
"probabilities, identifying highly likely cluster members."
3.1.1. Gaia DR2 Data
The astrometric data used in this work is the data
release 2 (DR2) of the Gaia mission3 (Gaia Collabora-
"tion et al. 2018a). Gaia DR2 provides positions, proper"
"motions, and parallaxes, as well as photometry in the"
"G, GBP, and GRP bands for ∼ 80% of its ∼ 1.7 billion
stars. Although Gaia also provides RV measurements"
"for some of these stars, this subset only corresponds to"
". 0.5% of the Gaia sample, and we therefore do not use
this parameter in our membership study."
We download the Gaia DR2 data for all the sources
contained within the region where the NGC 2547 rota-
tion period catalog reports candidate cluster members
"(out to ∼ 50′ from the cluster center, see §2.2.1).
Regarding the Gaia DR2 parallaxes, as reported by"
Lindegren et al. (2018) and confirmed by several other
works (Chan & Bovy 2020; Riess et al. 2018; Schönrich
"et al. 2019; Stassun & Torres 2018; Zinn et al. 2019),"
there is a zero-point offset that needs to be considered.
"For the remainder of this paper, we adopt the global"
mean value of 29 µas for all the clusters (in the sense that
the Gaia parallaxes are too small) reported by Lindegren
"et al. (2018), with the exception of NGC 6811, for which"
we adopt the Kepler field 53 µas value from Zinn et al.
(2019). Spatial variations in this zero-point offset are
"3 We note that, although nearing the completion of this work the
early data release 3 (EDR3) from Gaia became available (Gaia
Collaboration et al. 2020), we do not anticipate that using these
newer data would substantially change the results here presented.
This arises from the fact we are studying predominantly nearby
clusters, where the DR2 parallax and proper motion errors are
already small. Additionally, EDR3 does not contain new RV data
with respect to DR2."

real but modest for the systems that we are interested in.
"Furthermore, since we are interested in studying stars at"
"the same true distance, the exact zero-point value does"
not strongly impact our membership results (although
"it could impact our cluster ages, see §5)."
3.1.2. Cluster Fitting
Our method is similar to membership probability
"studies found in the literature, and its goal is to sep-"
arate the cluster population from the field population in
"phase-space. For instance, Vasilevskis et al. (1958) and"
Sanders (1971) used a 2D-version of this method using
proper motions to compute memberships for a number of
clusters. Other studies that have used similar versions of
"this method are Francic (1989), Jones & Walker (1988),"
"Jones & Stauffer (1991), and Jones & Prosser (1996)."
A 3D-version including parallaxes as well as individual
"star measurement errors and correlations, in addition to"
"allowing for an intrinsic dispersions, has been recently"
"used by Franciosini et al. (2018), Roccatagliata et al."
"(2018), and Roccatagliata et al. (2020)."
"In our method, a given star i has a probability of"
"belonging to either population P (field F or cluster C),"
with the total likelihood being:
"Li = fFLF,i + fCLC,i , (1)"

"By using these equations on the Gaia data, we can de-"

"To accurately derive these parameters, we apply a"
set of quality and geometric cuts. We highlight that
these cuts are applied only when defining the sample
we use to derive the cluster and field astrometric pa-
"rameters, but in §3.1.3 we apply our membership clas-
sification to the full Gaia sample. We run our maxi-"
mum likelihood calculation using the subset of stars with
astrometric excess noise= 0 and apparent G <18
"mag. In this way, we only fit the stars with well-defined"
"astrometric solutions, and derive representative cluster"
parameters that are not affected by uncertain measure-
ments of individual faint stars. We additionally note
that the photometric monitoring survey that provides
rotation period information searched for candidate clus-
ter members far in the outskirts of NGC 2547 (Irwin
"et al. 2008). In our cluster parameter calculation, how-"
"ever, we perform our fit using a subset of stars located"
closer to the cluster center (but not so close such that
the intrinsic dispersions we derive are affected by this
decision).
We use Python’s minimize function (method=SLSQP)
to run our maximum likelihood calculation and derive
"the cluster and field parameters (i.e., $C , µαC , µδC ,"
"σ$C , σµαC , σµδC for the cluster, and the analogous set"
of parameters for the field population). We report the
calculated cluster parameters in Appendix A.
3.1.3. Membership Probability Calculation
Now that we have calculated the cluster and field
"parameters, we can evaluate Equation (1) for individ-"
"ual stars and calculate membership probabilities. First,"
"however, quality cuts need to be applied to the Gaia"
"astrometry, as the data are not of equal quality for all"
"stars, and they strongly depend on the target bright-"
"ness. For instance, typical parallax (proper motion) un-"
"certainties are of order ∼ 0.05 mas (0.05 mas yr−1) for
a G = 16 mag star, and of order ∼ 0.5 mas (1.5 mas
yr−1) for a G = 20 mag star."
"Additionally, the presence of binary stars needs to be"
considered. Binary stars with measured periods are in-
"teresting targets for rotation studies (e.g., Stauffer et al."
"2018; Tokovinin & Briceño 2018), and can provide im-"
portant clues when investigating rotation in stellar pop-
"ulations (e.g., Simonian et al. 2019, 2020). Because of"
"this, and to not bias our rotational sequences, we pur-"
posely avoid discarding binary stars with our astromet-
ric quality cuts.
"Of the initial pool of stars, we select those with mea-"
"sured positions, proper motions and parallaxes. Addi-"
Rotation of Open Clusters Stars with Gaia 7
"tionally, following Gaia Collaboration et al. (2018b),"
we select stars with visibility periods used>8
"and with
√
χ2/(ν′ − 5)<1.2max(1, exp(−0.2(G −"
"19.5))), where χ2≡astrometric chi2 al and
ν′≡astrometric n good obs al. The latter of these
quality cuts removes most of the artifacts while retain-"
ing genuine binaries (where naturally the single-star
"solution does not provide a perfect fit; e.g., see Be-"
lokurov et al. 2020).
The stars excluded by these quality cuts do not have
enough information for a reliable membership probabil-
"ity to be calculated. Nonetheless, we do not remove"
"them from our sample, as some of them could correspond"
to stars with measured rotation periods. We assign them
the classification flag of “no info” stars and include
"them in the NGC 2547 rotational sequence shown in §4.
The stars that survive the astrometric quality cuts"
have enough information such that we can perform a
thorough membership classification. At this point we
separate stars that could be cluster members from those
"that are most likely not members. For a given star i, we"
calculate the quantity:
"∆i =
1√
3"
"√
($C −$i)2
(σ2$C + σ"
"(µαC − µαi)2
(σ2µαC"
"+ σ2µαi
)"
"+
(µδC − µδi)2
(σ2µδC"
"+ σ2µδi
)"
where values with the C index represent the cluster pa-
"rameters derived in §3.1.2. We classify the stars with
values of ∆i > 3 as “non members”, as they are lo-"
cated outside the cluster’s 3σ ellipsoid in phase-space.
"All of the remaining unclassified stars have ∆i ≤ 3
and are technically consistent with the cluster phase-"
"space parameters (at the 3σ level). This population,"
"however, has a contribution from objects that have large"
"astrometric uncertainties (particularly in parallax), for"
which a reliable classification is hard to determine with
"the existing data. Therefore, another selection crite-"
rion is required in order to separate the likely cluster
members from this ambiguous population. For this pur-
"pose we again use the method described in §3.1.2, and
calculate membership probabilities for all objects with"
"∆i ≤ 3. Following Equation (1), for a given star i, the
cluster membership probability is calculated as:"
"PC,i =
fCLC,i
Li"
"Conversely, this corresponds to 1 − PF,i, where PF,i is
the field membership probability for the star i. The"
distribution of cluster membership probabilities for all
"stars with ∆i ≤ 3 in the NGC 2547 field is shown in
Figure 1."
"For NGC 2547, we find the distribution of cluster"
"membership probabilities to be strongly bimodal, with"

most of the sample having probabilities close to either
"0 or 1. Although not explicitly shown, the membership"
probability distribution has a strong dependence on the
"stars’ apparent G band magnitude, with the distribution"
"being mostly bimodal for bright stars, and becoming"
blurrier for fainter stars (with increasingly more stars
"having intermediate probability values; e.g., see Figure"
5 of Jones & Prosser 1996). This magnitude-dependent
"outcome is typical, as bright stars tend to have more"
"precise astrometric measurements, and the method pro-"
vides a yes or no answer regarding their memberships.
"On the other hand, faint stars typically have larger as-"
"trometric uncertainties, which only allow the method to"
provide an intermediate answer.
"With this in mind, we apply a final selection criterion"
"and classify the stars with PC ≥ 0.90 as “probable
members”, and those with PC < 0.90 as “possible"
members”. We show the resulting phase-space projec-
"tions and apparent CMD of these populations, in ad-"
"dition to the “non member” population, in Figures"
2 and 3. (The “no info” population is absent from

for those stars.)

criteria was used to define the three populations, the prob-

that our selection method is identifying likely cluster mem-
bers. The non members show the typical behavior of the
background field, while the possible members mainly consist
of faint stars (G & 19.5 mag). The “turnover” to bluer col-
ors for apparent G & 18.5 mag for the probable members

lower values included stars with incoherent kinematics
and photometry. We nonetheless note that the overall
number of probable and possible members do not con-
"siderably change unless very high (Pmin &0.95) or very
low (Pmin .0.05) threshold values are used (see Figure
1). Furthermore, Appendix B reports the Gaia data"
for the probable and possible members and their clus-
"ter membership probabilities, and the reader is free to"
experiment with customized threshold values.
Figure 2 shows that the probable members (blue
points) tend to be clustered in phase-space with a small
number of stars located in the outskirts. On the other

cupy a much larger region in the phase-space projections
(with stars populating virtually all corners of the dia-
"grams), but tend to be concentrated at smaller parallax"
and proper motion values. The possible members (cyan
"points) appear as an intermediate population of stars,"
located in between the cluster and the field.
Figure 3 complements what is seen in Figure 2. The
probable members form a tight isochrone-like sequence
in the apparent CMD (with the exception of the color
"turnover for apparent G & 18.5 mag; see discussion be-
low), with even a parallel sequence being visible indicat-"
"ing the presence of photometric binaries (e.g., Hurley &"
Tout 1998). The non members behave as expected from
"the field, with the two main branches (main-sequence"
and giant branch) being clearly visible in the data. The
possible members mainly populate the bottom part of
"the plot, demonstrating that this population is domi-"
"nated by faint stars that, consequently, have large as-"
"trometric uncertainties, which in turn causes them to"
"have ∆i ≤ 3 values (differentiating them from the non
members). While some of these possible members could"
"very well be real cluster members, the current preci-"
sion of their astrometric information does not allow for
a more stringent classification.
We highlight that even though our classification
method is completely agnostic to the photometry of the
"stars, and it is solely based on kinematics, it seems to ap-"
propriately select stars that form a main-sequence in the
CMD. We take this as a confirmation that our method
is properly identifying likely cluster members and dis-
tinguishing them from the field.
A peculiar feature can be seen in Figure 3 for apparent
"G & 18.5 mag. At this apparent magnitude, instead
of continuing to the bottom-right part of the diagram,"
the probable members start to turn to bluer colors for
fainter magnitudes. This feature has already been found
by other works when using the Gaia DR2 photometry
"(e.g., Arenou et al. 2018; Lodieu et al. 2019a,b; Smart"
"et al. 2019), and it arises from an overestimation of the"
"flux in the GBP passband for faint, red sources (Riello"
"et al. 2018, 2020)."
3.2. Crossmatch
Now that we have kinematically classified every Gaia
"DR2 star in the field of NGC 2547 as either a probable,"
"possible, or non member, or a no info star, we proceed"
to connect this with the rotation sample of Irwin et al.
(2008).
We crossmatch both catalogs using the CDS X-Match
"Service on VizieR4. First, we download all the Gaia DR2"
matches to a given NGC 2547 star within 3′′. This pro-
"duces matches for all stars, with some of them (∼ 10%)
being matched to two Gaia sources. The distribution of"
"angular separations is strongly peaked at small values,"
"with ∼ 80% of the stars having a match within 0.2′′, a
tail extending out to 0.5′′, and some matches extending"
past this value out to 3′′.
To select the best possible matches for stars matched
"to two Gaia sources, we compare the V magnitudes"
from Irwin et al. (2008) with the G magnitudes from
Gaia. This exercise helps us break the ties and decide
"which star is the correct match. In all cases, the Gaia"
star with the more similar brightness corresponds to the
closer match in angular separation. The second matched
"star is typically several magnitudes fainter, with angular"
separations greater than 1′′ (the outliers of the separa-
tion distribution). We only keep one Gaia match per
"star, and are left with an angular separation distribu-"
"tion where ∼ 95% of the stars have a match within 0.3′′,
and all of them have a match within 0.9′′."
In order to test the reliability of our crossmatch-
"ing approach, we use the Pleiades cluster as a bench-"
mark for which a completely independent crossmatching
is available. We first replicate the same crossmatch-
ing procedure used in NGC 2547 with our Pleiades
data. We then take the 2MASS IDs for the Pleiades
"stars from Rebull et al. (2016a), and look them"
up in the precomputed 2MASS-Gaia DR2 crossmatch
(gaiadr2.tmass best neighbor) that can be found in
the ESA’s webpage of the Gaia Archive5. We find an
excellent agreement (> 99.7% of coincidence) between
ESA’s crossmatch and ours for the stars found by both
"methods (and moreover, VizieR produces matches for 10"
Pleiades stars not found by ESA). We take this as a con-
firmation that our crossmatching is properly combining
the periodic samples with the Gaia sources.
3.3. Mass and Temperature Calculation
In order to perform comprehensive comparisons of the
"rotational sequences of the open clusters, we need to"
"place them on a common scale. For this, we derive mass"
and temperature values for the cluster members by com-
paring the photometric data with state-of-the-art evolu-
tionary models in absolute magnitude space. Although
the papers that reported periods also reported photom-
"etry in at least two bands for most of our clusters (e.g.,"
"V and I for NGC 2547; see §2), the specific filters vary"
"4 http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/

"http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/

"
10 Godoy-Rivera et al."
"on a cluster by cluster basis. Instead of using these, we"
"take advantage of the uniform G, GBP, and GRP pho-"
tometry provided by Gaia DR2. This also allows us to
derive masses and temperatures for all the Gaia cluster
"members, not just the subset with measured periods."
For stars with measured photometry in the three Gaia
"bands, we deredden the observed magnitudes following"
"the approach of Gaia Collaboration et al. (2018b), where"
"the extinction coefficients depend on GBP − GRP color
and extinction itself. For stars that lack a measured"
"GBP−GRP color, we adopt the PARSEC coefficients6 for
a G2V star (AG/AV = 0.85926, AGBP/AV = 1.06794,"
and AGRP/AV = 0.65199; Bressan et al. 2012; Chen
"et al. 2014). We use the NGC 2547 E(B − V ) and
distance modulus values (see §5), assume AV = 3.1 ×
E(B − V ) (Cardelli et al. 1989), and calculate absolute
and dereddened photometry. We show the extinction-"
corrected absolute CMD of the probable and possible
NGC 2547 members in Figure 4.
The data can now be directly compared with stellar
models to infer mass and temperature values. We down-
load a PARSEC isochrone with the corresponding NGC
"2547 age and metallicity (see §5), and show it as the or-
ange line in Figure 4. We initially also considered using"
the MIST (Dotter 2016; Choi et al. 2016) and BHAC15
"(Baraffe et al. 2015) models, but the PARSEC models"
showed better agreement when compared with the data.
"This is not surprising, as the PARSEC models include"
empirical corrections to fit the mass-radius relation of
"dwarf stars, which in turn produces a better agreement"
with the CMDs of clusters (Chen et al. 2014).
The bright probable cluster members show an excellent
agreement with the model in Figure 4. As discussed in
"Figure 3, the GBP−GRP color misbehaves for apparent
G & 18.5 mag, and the probable member sequence be-
comes bluer for fainter magnitudes. This limit is trans-"
lated to the absolute and dereddened CMD and shown
"as the horizontal dashed line in Figure 4, with the dotted"
line showing a similar apparent G = 17.5 mag limit. We
"use these two apparent magnitude limits, here translated"
"to absolute magnitude space, to define different regimes"
in our mass and temperature calculation.
"Additionally, whenever possible, the effects of binarity"
on the CMD need to be considered. Photometric bi-
naries appear as brighter/redder stars compared to the
"main-sequence locus, and to account for them we follow"
the procedures of Stauffer et al. (2016) and Somers et al.
"(2017). In this approach, when the Gaia (GBP −GRP)0
color is reliable, stars are projected down (or up) onto"

"• Faint regime: For stars fainter than the dashed

"
Rotation of Open Clusters Stars with Gaia 11"
"lute magnitude), or stars that lack a GBP or GRP
magnitude, we cannot rely on the (GBP − GRP)0
color to do a de-projection. Instead, we simply"
"keep the calculated MG0 value as is, and define"
"MG0,proj to be equal to it. This is therefore a"
regime where we do not account for unresolved
companions.
"• Intermediate regime: For stars in between the dot-
ted and dashed lines (17.5 ≤ G ≤ 18.5 mag range
translated to absolute magnitude), we do an inter-"
"mediate, ramp-like calculation. We calculate the"
values we would have obtained following the bright
"and faint regimes separately, and combine them"
in a progressive way with the extremes matching
"the corresponding methods, effectively avoiding a"
sharp transition between the different regimes.
"For every star, this procedure collapses the observed"
"photometry to the single quantity MG0,proj . We use"
this value to interpolate the corresponding NGC 2547
PARSEC model in the magnitude-mass and magnitude-
temperature space. We only interpolate in the regime
"of stars fainter than the main-sequence turnoff (i.e., we"
do not report masses for evolved stars) and down to the
faintest MG0 magnitude allowed by the model. We re-
port our derived masses and temperatures for the NGC
2547 probable and possible members in Appendix B.
For the subset of NGC 2547 stars with period mea-
"surements, Irwin et al. (2008) calculated masses us-"
ing their I band magnitudes and the NextGen models
(Baraffe et al. 1998). These values offer a completely
"independent reference point to validate our own masses,"
and we compare our estimates with theirs in Figure 5.
It is important to highlight one key difference between
both methods: we account for the presence of photomet-
"ric binaries (when possible), while Irwin et al. (2008) do"
"not. Accordingly, we find the mass difference to be a"
strong function of mass itself. For stars in the faint
"regime, where we do not account for binaries, we see"
a good agreement but with an approximately constant
"offset of ∆Mass ≈ −0.05M� that is likely due to the
different underlying models used in the interpolation."
"For higher masses, the scatter increases and many stars"
"have positive mass differences, indicating cases where"
Irwin et al. (2008) did not account for the contribu-
"tion of unresolved companions. Overall, we find a good"
"agreement, with mean and standard deviation values of"
"∆Mass being ≈ 0.01 and 0.08 M�, respectively.
The above comparison validates our method, and sug-"
gests that masses derived in this way are subject to a
"systematic uncertainty of order ∼ 0.05 M�. More im-

4. RESULTS
"This section has two parts. In §4.1, we show the re-
sults of applying our method described in §3 to all our
clusters. In §4.2, we show the effects that discarding the
non member contamination has on the individual cluster"
rotational sequences.
4.1. Applying our Method to all the Clusters
"We follow the method described in §3 for NGC 2547,
and apply it to the other six clusters listed in Table 1."
We report the astrometric parameters we calculate for
"the clusters in Appendix A, where we also compare them"
with the values reported in the literature. We find our
astrometric parameters to be in good agreement with
"those reported by other studies, with fractional differ-"
ences being typically at the ∼1–2% level or less.
12 Godoy-Rivera et al.
"For each cluster, we classify every Gaia star contained"
within the region where the corresponding rotation pe-
"riod catalog reports candidate members, into one of the"
"four previously described categories (no info, probable,"
"possible, or non member). To separate between these"
"categories, we use the same criteria described in §3.1.3:
stars that do not pass the astrometric quality cuts are"
"classified as no info; stars with ∆i > 3 (i.e., outside the"
cluster’s 3σ ellipsoid in phase-space) are classified as non
"members; stars with ∆i ≤ 3 and membership probabil-
ity PC < 0.90 are classified as possible members; stars"
"with ∆i ≤ 3 and PC ≥ 0.90 are classified as probable
members. We report tables with the corresponding list"
of probable and possible members for every cluster in
Appendix B.
"Analogously to Figures 1 and 3 for NGC 2547, Fig-"
ures 6 and 7 show the membership probability distribu-
tion and apparent CMDs for all the clusters we study.
"The phase-space projections for all clusters, analogous"
"to Figure 2 for NGC 2547, can be found in Appendix C."
"Figure 6 shows that, for every cluster, in the sample"
"of Gaia stars that satisfy ∆i ≤ 3, there is a population
of stars with membership probabilities close to 1. This"
"population represents a set of likely cluster members,"
"and we classify those with PC ≥ 0.90 as probable mem-
bers (and the rest as possible members). On the low-"
"probability end, however, clear cluster-by-cluster dif-"
ferences can be observed. While clusters such as the
Pleiades and Praesepe show only a small number of pos-
"sible members, M50 and NGC 6811 are in the opposite"
situation. These differences are explained by consider-
ing how similar or different the astrometric parameters
"of a given cluster are, compared with the field (which"
is typically a diffuse background population with small
"parallax and low proper motion). In other words, a clus-"
"ter with a large parallax and proper motion (e.g., the"
Pleiades or Praesepe) will be more distinct and sepa-
"rated from the field in phase-space, and therefore it is"
highly unlikely that unassociated field stars will have
"similar astrometry (i.e., ∆i ≤ 3), and hence a small
number of possible members is expected. On the other"
"hand, field stars are more likely to mimic the astrometry"
of a cluster that has a small parallax and a low proper
"motion (e.g., M50 or NGC 6811), and therefore the num-"
ber of stars that are kinematically consistent with the
cluster increases.
"The apparent CMDs of all our clusters, shown in Fig-"
"ure 7, display an isochrone-like sequence of probable"
"members, with clear binary sequences being identified"
"in all of them. The older clusters M37, Praesepe, and"
"NGC 6811 show not only a main-sequence population,"
but also a few giant stars (with Praesepe even showing a

cluster members, as they are inside the cluster’s 3σ ellipsoid
in phase-space). All of the clusters show a population of stars
with membership probabilities close to 1, which correspond
to likely cluster members. For all the clusters we use the same
threshold (Pmin =0.90; red dashed line) to separate probable
cluster members (PC ≥ Pmin) from possible members (PC <
Pmin)."

"to obtain unbiased cluster memberships, our method is"
"completely agnostic to the Gaia photometry, and these"
results are a consequence of our careful astrometric anal-
"ysis. Additionally, as previously found for NGC 2547,"
"we observe the turn over to bluer GBP − GRP colors

all the clusters we study (analogous to Figure 3). For ev-
ery cluster, we recover an isochrone-like sequence of probable
members (even though our selection criteria do not include
any photometric information and is purely based on astrom-
etry), and the older clusters even show evolved populations
such as giants and white dwarfs in their CMDs. The turnover
to bluer colors for apparent G & 18.5 mag that we first noted
in NGC 2547 is recovered to varying degrees in all the clus-
ters (e.g., observed as a sharp break in NGC 2516, or as
a large scatter at that G magnitude in M50), further con-
firming that this is a systematic effect coming from the Gaia
photometry. The dotted and dashed lines show the G = 17.5

further evidence that this corresponds to an artifact of
"the Gaia photometry (see §3.1.3 for details).
As discussed in §3.1.3, our ability to cleanly separate"
between possible and probable members is a strong func-
"tion of the stars’ apparent G band magnitude, as the"
quality of their astrometry decreases with decreasing
"brightness. This can be clearly seen, for instance, in"
"the CMD of NGC 6811, where all the stars fainter than"
14 Godoy-Rivera et al.
"apparent G ' 19 mag are classified as either possible or
non members, and none of them are classified as probable"
members. Real NGC 6811 members with G > 19 mag
are simply too faint for Gaia DR2 to provide precise
"astrometry, preventing us from reliably differentiating"
them from the field stars.
"Analogously to Figure 4 for NGC 2547, Figure 8 shows"
the extinction-corrected absolute CMD for the proba-
ble and possible members of all the clusters. We use
"the clusters’ respective E(B − V ) and distance moduli
to calculate absolute and dereddened photometry, and"
compare it with PARSEC models of the corresponding
"ages and metallicities (see §5). Some discrepancies arise
for low mass stars, where the probable members appear"
"brighter/redder than the model (e.g., see the ∼ 0.4M�
stars in Pleiades and Praesepe). As other studies sug-"
"gest, these differences could arise due to the known ra-"
"dius inflation problem in cool dwarfs (e.g., Torres &"
Ribas 2002; Clausen et al. 2009; Torres et al. 2010; Kraus
"et al. 2011; Somers & Stassun 2017; Jackson et al. 2018,"
2019). Accounting for the underlying physical process
that causes this in the models is beyond the scope of this
"paper, but we refer interested readers to the works by"
Somers & Pinsonneault (2015) and Somers et al. (2020).
"Regardless, while evidently not perfect, Figure 8 shows"
a good overall agreement of the data with models across
the HR diagram for all the clusters.
"We follow the procedure described in §3.3, and use
the absolute CMDs to calculate masses and tempera-"
tures for the probable and possible cluster members. We
report these values in Appendix B. For the subset of
stars with independent mass and temperature estimates
"from other studies, we compare these values with ours in"
"Appendix D. Globally, we find our masses and temper-"
atures to be in good agreement with those reported by
the period references. The comparisons suggest possible
"systematic uncertainties of ∼ 0.05–0.1M� in mass and
∼ 150 K in temperature, which are modest considering
the different methods, photometric data, and underlying"
stellar models employed.
The crossmatching between the periodic samples and
the Gaia DR2 data is done in identical fashion for all
"of the clusters, following the approach of §3.2. Unlike
the case of NGC 2547, however, we do not find a Gaia"
DR2 counterpart for every periodic star in most of the
other clusters. Our recovery rates (and number of stars
not found in the crossmatching over the number of stars
with measured periods) are: 100% (0/176) for NGC
"2547, 99.9% (1/759) for Pleiades, 94.3% (46/812) for"
"M50, 99.4% (2/364) for NGC 2516, 96.7% (12/367) for"
"M37, 99.8% (2/809) for Praesepe, and 100% (0/232) for"
NGC 6811. The only clusters with recovery rates below
"99% are M50 and M37, which correspond to distant sys-"
tems where the periodic samples extend to magnitudes
"fainter than the apparent G ≈ 21 mag limit of Gaia
DR2. In the following, we classify the stars not found"
"in the crossmatching as no info stars, as their member-"

4.2. Rotational Sequences: Using the Gaia Astrometry
to remove the Non Member Contamination
"For the remainder of this section, we focus exclusively"
on the subset of main-sequence stars with period mea-
"surements, the periodic samples. We proceed to investi-"
gate how the rotational sequences of the clusters change
when we consider the astrometric classifications previ-
"ously derived. For this, we remove from our sample"
all the Pleiades and Praesepe stars that Rebull et al.
"(2016b) and Rebull et al. (2017) classify as pulsators,"
as well as the giant NGC 6811 stars for which Santos
et al. (in prep) reports rotation periods (which are
"longer than 100 days). Additionally, for the Pleiades"
"and Praesepe stars with multiple period measurements,"
we only consider their main periods as the adopted ro-
"tation period (P1 from Rebull et al. 2016a,b and Rebull"
et al. 2017). Tables with the membership classifications
"and periods, as well as other important parameters (e.g.,"
"Gaia DR2 IDs, derived masses and temperatures, mem-"
bership probabilities) for the periodic samples are re-
ported in Appendix E.
Figure 9 shows the results of applying our astrometric
classification to the rotational sequences of the periodic
"samples. For each cluster, we show both the literature"
"sequence (i.e., pre Gaia DR2 membership analysis), and"
"its revised version reported in this work (i.e., post Gaia"
DR2). The literature rotational sequences (left column)
include all the candidate cluster members reported in
"the original period references, and we color code them"
according to our astrometric classifications. The revised
"sequences (right column), only show probable members,"
"possible members, and no info stars, but do not show"
stars classified as non members. Since at this point we
have no means to either confirm or reject the member-
"ship status of the no info stars, we simply add them to"
the possible members category in the revised sequences
of Figure 9.
Before comparing the literature and revised rotational
"sequences in detail, we note that a strong artifact inher-"
ited from the Gaia astrometry is present in the mem-
bership classification of our most distant clusters. In
"M50 (distance of ∼ 970 pc), for Teff & 4500 K, most of
the stars are classified as either probable or non mem-"
"bers. On the other hand, stars cooler than this limit"

"Figure 9. Period versus temperature (i.e., rotational sequence) for all the clusters we study. The clusters’ names and revised
ages are shown in the legend in the bottom left corner of each plot. For each cluster we show two panels: the literature sequence
(i.e., pre Gaia DR2 membership analysis; left panel) and its revised version reported in this work (i.e., post Gaia DR2; right
panel). The literature sequences show all the stars reported in the original period references, and we color code them according
to our astrometric classification: no info star (open black pentagons), non member (red squares), possible member (open cyan
diamonds), or probable member (blue circles). The number of stars in each category is shown in the parenthesis accompanying
the labels. The revised sequences only show the probable members, possible members, and the no info stars, but the non member
stars are not shown to demonstrate the effects that removing field contamination has on the individual diagrams. For plotting
purposes, in the revised sequences we combine the possible members with the no info stars into one category (shown as the
open green diamonds), as we cannot assess the membership of these stars with the current data. The dotted and dashed lines
correspond to the apparent G = 17.5 and 18.5 mag limits from Figure 7 translated to Teff coordinates. Note that the revised
M50 sequence does not include stars cooler than the dashed line, as in that regime we expect the field contamination to dominate
the diagram. We observe varying degrees of non member contamination, with the clusters observed from the ground showing
higher rates, and the more distant clusters having more uncertain revised sequences (see §4 and §6)."
16 Godoy-Rivera et al.
are mostly classified as possible members (and further-
"more, for Teff . 3500 the predominant category is no
info stars). This is a direct consequence of the qual-"
ity of the Gaia astrometry decreasing monotonically for
"fainter, cooler targets, where our classification method"
"can no longer reliably identify probable or non members,"
and we instead classify most stars as possible members.
"A similar effect is observed in M37 (distance of ∼ 1440
pc), with the limit being around Teff ' 4000. This ef-
fect is absent in the rotational sequence of NGC 6811"
"(distance of ∼ 1080 pc), but only because the periodic
sample does not extend to such faint, cool stars."
We now examine Figure 9 in detail and discuss how
the inclusion of the astrometric information affects the
rotational sequence of each cluster independently:
"• NGC 2547: for this cluster we classify ∼ 25% of
the Irwin et al. (2008) candidates as non members."
"By removing this contamination, the rotational se-"
"quence changes considerably. At a given Teff, most"
of the non members actually correspond to stars
"with the longest periods, and after including our"
"membership analysis, only 2 stars with period >"
"10 days remain (one of them a probable member,"
"while the other a no info star). Interestingly, the"
revised NGC 2547 sequence exhibits strong Teff-
and mass-dependent trends in the period distri-
"bution, with the mean period decreasing with de-"
creasing Teff for Teff < 3500 K. Given its young
"age (∼ 35 Myr), we expect the period versus Teff
distribution of NGC 2547 to be strongly affected"
by processes that regulate stellar rotation at birth.
"• Pleiades: we find the non member contamination
to be small (. 4%), and that removing it, for the
most part, does not empty specific regions in the"
"rotational sequence. This finding is not surprising,"
as the Pleiades stars studied with K2 by Rebull
"et al. (2016a), Rebull et al. (2016b) and Stauffer"
et al. (2016) had been previously vetted by proper
motion surveys. Further examination of the stars
"classified as non members reveals that ≈ 70% of
them have ∆i values between 3 and 5 (i.e., are"
"outside the cluster’s 3σ ellipsoid in phase-space,"
"but within 5σ), suggesting that a less stringent"
astrometric selection could have classified them as
"possible cluster members. Additionally, for the"
Pleiades we observe an interesting phenomenon
(also observed in Praesepe): there is a large num-
ber of no info stars across the entire Teff range.
This is noticeably different from the cases of M50
"and M37, where the no info stars are heavily con-"
"centrated at the faint, cool end of the distribu-"
"tions. We further discuss this in §6, but in short,
these no info stars mainly correspond to photo-"
"metric binaries, which points to biases in the Gaia"
DR2 astrometry.
"• M50: this cluster shows the largest differences of
all when we compare the literature and revised ro-"
"tational sequences. For Teff > 4500 K, we find the"
literature sequence to have substantial non mem-
"ber contamination (≈ 36%), and we observe that
the different astrometric populations occupy par-"
"ticular regions of the rotational sequence. Firstly,"
"we note that all of the stars with periods . 0.1 day
are cleanly identified as non members. This is not"
"surprising, as these periods most certainly do not"
correspond to rotational signals but rather pulsa-
"tion signals from field stars. Secondly, we note"
"that most of the long period stars (& 10 days) are
actually classified as non members. Thirdly, af-"
"ter removing the field contamination, the probable"
members do form a rather clean sequence of rota-
"tion period as a function of Teff, and both branches"
of slowly and rapidly rotating stars observed in the
Pleiades can now be seen in the revised M50 se-
"quence. For Teff . 4000 K, the quality of the Gaia
DR2 astrometry does not allow us to classify stars"
"reliably, but we expect the contamination fraction"
to be of similar or higher significance than that of
stars with Teff > 4500. Given how uncertain this
"part of the diagram is, in the analysis that follows"
"we simply discard the M50 stars cooler than ∼
4000 K (vertical dashed line in Figure 9, i.e., the"
apparent G = 18.5 mag limit translated to Teff co-
"ordinate), and only consider the stars hotter than"
this limit.
"• NGC 2516: this cluster shows a very low contam-
ination rate, with only ≈ 3% of the stars being
classified as non members, and ≈ 88% of the Ir-
win et al. (2007a) stars being classified as probable"
members. We suspect this arises from the fact that
this cluster is very rich and therefore dominates
(in terms of number counts; see Figure 7) over the
field population in the CMD selection done by Ir-
"win et al. (2007a). Accordingly, both literature"
and revised rotational sequences are almost iden-
"tical, with the period distribution showing strong"
"mass dependent trends. We note, however, that"
the periodic NGC 2516 stars spans a narrow range
"in temperature (and mass), and the sample is lim-"
ited to Teff < 4400 K (M < 0.7M�).
"• M37: for Teff & 4000 K, we find the non mem-
ber contamination to be ≈ 4%, which is small"
Rotation of Open Clusters Stars with Gaia 17
"compared to the ∼ 20% contamination rate ex-
pected by Hartman et al. (2008b). Similarly to"
"NGC 2516, we think this arises from the richness"
"of the cluster compared to the field, in addition to"
the double CMD selection done by Hartman et al.
"(2008b). Interestingly, however, the locations of"
many of the non members do not seem to be ar-
bitrary. Most of them are stars that lie well off of
the converged period sequence (at both longer and
"shorter periods), and are clearly separated from"
the probable members in the rotational sequence.
This result implies that the converged sequence
"at this age (∼ 500 Myr; §5) is actually stronger
than previously thought. We note, nonetheless,"
that a few rotational outliers still survive the as-
trometric selection at both longer and shorter pe-
"riods than the converged sequence. Additionally,"
"and similarly to M50, M37 also exhibits a clear"
"break in the astrometric classification, in this case"
"around 4000 K. For stars cooler than this limit,"
our method cannot confidently separate probable
"members from non members, and we instead clas-"
sify most of them as possible members or no info
"stars. Nevertheless, and in contrast to M50, given"
how clean the Hartman et al. (2008b) membership
"was in the Teff & 4000 K regime, we expect most
of the stars cooler than this value to be real M37"
"members, and we do include them in the analysis"
that follows.
"• Praesepe: the non members correspond to ≈ 7%
of the sample, and this small contamination rate is"
not surprising given the previous CMD and proper
motion vetting in the K2 stars studied by Re-
bull et al. (2017). Further examination of these
"non member stars reveals that ≈ 40% of them
have ∆i values between 3 and 5, and therefore"
a less stringent astrometric selection could have
classified them as possible cluster members. Sim-
"ilarly to the Pleiades, the non members do not"
seem to empty specific regions in the rotational
"sequence, with the exception of the stars located"
in the 4300 < Teff < 5500 K range. Many of these
stars have longer periods than the converged se-
"quence, and the revised rotational sequence ap-"
pears narrower than previously thought for this
"Teff range at this age (∼ 700 Myr; §5). We find
this result to be similar to that of M37, perhaps"
hinting to a universal but previously hidden phe-
"nomenon. Nonetheless, we also note that few ro-"
tational outliers survive the astrometric analysis
and are still present in the revised sequence. Fi-
"nally, and similarly to the Pleiades, we find that"
"the no info Praesepe stars populate the entire Teff
range of the sequence. These stars mostly appear"
"as photometric binaries in the CMD, and we fur-"
ther discuss them in §6.
"• NGC 6811: this cluster shows a very low contami-
nation rate, with only ≈ 2% of the stars being clas-
sified as non members. This is consistent with ex-"
"pectations, given the samples that the NGC 6811"
rotation period catalogs were based on. Meibom
"et al. (2011b) vetted stars on the basis of RV data,"
Curtis et al. (2019a) combined CMD selections
with a set of astrometric cuts to ensure consis-
tency with the cluster’s phase-space projections
(although they did not take the stars’ uncertainties
"or intrinsic cluster dispersion into account), and"
Santos et al. (in prep) performed their lightcurve
analysis based on our sample of probable members.
While all of the above work together to produce a
"low contamination rate by construction, three of"
the five stars classified as non members are clear
outliers when compared with the probable mem-
bers sequence. Similar to what we see in the other
"old clusters (M37 and Praesepe), however, the re-"
vised sequence does show a number of long period
"outliers, hinting to a rare channel that produces"
slow rotation for a small fraction of members in
& 0.5 Gyr-old clusters.
"Finally, we point out a feature that is ubiquitous in all"
the clusters we study: the revised rotational sequences
show a number of rapid rotators that survive all the as-
trometric cuts. These are stars that likely correspond to
"synchronized binaries, and they stand out more clearly"
"in the older M37, Praesepe, and NGC 6811 clusters with"
periods of 0.5–2 days and 5000 < Teff < 6000 K.
After having analyzed how the clusters’ rotational se-
quences change when the non member contamination
"is excluded, we emphasize that properly accounting for"
cluster membership remains a fundamental piece of em-
pirical studies of stellar rotation. Incorrect or biased
conclusions could be derived from rotational sequences
that lack the appropriate vetting. Replicating our anal-
ysis with improved astrometry should further refine the
"astrometric classifications, and expand the mass and"
temperature range where the probable and non members
can be reliably distinguished from each other.
5. CLUSTER PROPERTIES
5.1. Revising the Cluster Properties
To perform meaningful inter-cluster comparisons of
"stellar rotation, reliable cluster properties are needed."
"In the pre Gaia era, classic works such as Denissenkov"
18 Godoy-Rivera et al.
"et al. (2010), Gallet & Bouvier (2013), and Gallet &"
Bouvier (2015) thoroughly compiled periodic samples as
well as properties for a large number of clusters. Nev-
"ertheless, the heterogeneous nature of their parameter"
compilation (adopting values from varied techniques and
"data sets), can result in inhomogeneities in the adopted"
"masses, ages, and metallicity scales. Nowadays, the sys-"
tematic observations of star clusters by spectroscopic
"surveys (Netopil et al. 2016; Gaia-ESO, Spina et al."
"2017, Magrini et al. 2017; APOGEE, Majewski et al."
"2017, Jönsson et al. 2020), as well as the uniform all-sky"
"Gaia data, provide an opportunity to study these sys-"
tems in a more consistent and homogeneous fashion. In
"the following, we attempt, to the extent that it is possi-"
"ble, to compile and derive cluster properties that are in"
a consistent and uniform scale.
"The mass and temperature values calculated in §3 and
§4, as well as the discussion presented in §6, require four
cluster properties to be known: distance modulus, red-"
"dening, age, and metallicity. The former two are needed"
to translate the observed photometry to absolute and
"dereddened CMD space, while the latter two are re-"
quired to compare the data with the appropriate stellar
"evolutionary model. For distance modulus, we adopt the"
values derived from our astrometric analysis (consider-
"ing the parallax zero-points described in §3.1.1), and
for metallicity we compile values reported from recent"
"high-resolution spectroscopic results. In particular, we"
adopt the values reported by Netopil et al. (2016) for
"Pleiades, NGC 2516, M37, Praesepe, and NGC 6811,"
and the value reported by the Gaia-ESO survey (Spina
et al. 2017) for NGC 2547. The only cluster without a
"spectroscopic metallicity measurement is M50, for which"
we adopt a solar value.
Instead of adopting reddening values from the liter-
"ature, we calculate our own using a dedicated fitting"
"routine. For a given cluster, we start by correcting"
the observed G band magnitudes by distance modulus.
"Once the spectroscopic metallicity is known, we down-"
load a set of PARSEC models of that composition with
"a range of plausible ages (e.g., 100, 200, and 300 Myr"
"for NGC 2516). Then, we define a region in the abso-"
lute CMD where the different models agree with each
"other, which excludes the phases near and more evolved"
than the turnoff. We then iterate over a range of pos-
sible reddenings and find the value that produces the
better agreement between the observed data with the
"series of models. For a given E(B−V ) value, we dered-
den the probable cluster members’ photometry (following"
"the approach described in §3.3), define a set of bins in
the (GBP − GRP)0 color coordinate, and calculate the
mean colors and 75th magnitude percentiles (which ac-"

"E(B − V ) value that minimizes the sum of the squared
difference of the data minus the models given the bins,"
"and adopt this as our global cluster reddening. Finally,"
we compare the CMD location of the full sample of prob-

the age following the envelope of hot stars below and
near the turn-off. We estimate that this procedure leads
"to reddenings and ages with typical errors of ∼ 20% and

"completely model-independent ages in the 10–200 Myr
range. These adopted ages are in good agreement with"
the values we derive from our CMD analysis.
5.2. Comparing our Cluster Properties with the
Literature
We now compare the cluster properties we have de-
"rived, with the values that can be found in the literature"
from similar approaches. The main references we use for
this are Gaia Collaboration et al. (2018b) and Bossini
"et al. (2019), who also studied open clusters based on"
"the Gaia DR2 data, and reported parameters for most"
of the clusters in our sample based on comparisons with
PARSEC models. We also use as reference the works by
"Cummings et al. (2016), Cummings & Kalirai (2018),"
and Cummings et al. (2018). Although these did not
"use Gaia data, they reported parameters for many of"
Rotation of Open Clusters Stars with Gaia 19
the clusters in our sample based on CMD fits to UBV
photometry and PARSEC models.
"For distance modulus, our values are calculated from"
"the global cluster parallaxes, accounting for a zero-point"
value of 53 µas in NGC 6811 and of 29 µas for the other
clusters. While Gaia Collaboration et al. (2018b) and
Bossini et al. (2019) (whose membership and astrometry
come from Cantat-Gaudin et al. 2018) do not consider
"these zero-points, in Appendix A we add these offsets"
"to their parallax values for an appropriate comparison,"
"and find differences to be within ≈ ±1%. For metal-
licity, we share references and use high-resolution spec-"
troscopic values from Netopil et al. (2016) or Gaia-ESO
when available.
"For reddening, if we exclude M50 from the compar-"
"ison, we find good agreement with Gaia Collaboration"
"et al. (2018b) and Bossini et al. (2019), and the differ-"
ences between our values and theirs are contained within
"±0.032 mag in E(B − V ). On the other hand, M50 is
the only cluster for which the Gaia Collaboration et al."
(2018b) and Bossini et al. (2019) reddenings differ be-
"tween each other. The former reports E(B−V ) = 0.105
mag, the latter reports 0.153 mag, and we obtain a best-"
"fit value of 0.210 mag. We note, however, that Cum-"
mings et al. (2016) and Cummings & Kalirai (2018) re-
"port E(B − V ) = 0.230 for M50, in better agreement
with our estimate. Ultimately, the above differences in"
reddening are perhaps unsurprising considering the dif-
ferent CMD analysis approaches and parallax zero-point
considerations.
"Regarding stellar ages, we find our revised values to be"
in good agreement with the pre Gaia values from Gallet
& Bouvier (2015) listed in Table 1 (see also Denissenkov
"et al. 2010; Gallet & Bouvier 2013), especially consid-"
ering the associated uncertainties. The largest differ-
"ence is seen for Praesepe, for which we derive an age of"
"700 Myr, while Gallet & Bouvier (2015) adopt 580 Myr."
Given the crucial importance that clusters’ ages play
"in models of angular momentum evolution, the overall"
good agreement between our values and the pre Gaia
ones is a meaningful result of our work.
Comparing our ages with those by Gaia Collaboration
"et al. (2018b), we find our results to be in good agree-"
ment. A similar comparison with Bossini et al. (2019)
shows that their ages seem to be systematically under-
estimated by factors of 30–60% for the younger clusters.
"The exception to the above is NGC 2516, for which Gaia"
Collaboration et al. (2018b) and Bossini et al. (2019)
"report ages of ≈ 300 and 250 Myr, respectively. If con-
firmed, this would position NGC 2516 as an important"
"anchor for stellar rotation at intermediate ages, as few"
systems older than the Pleiades and younger than M37
have such comprehensive periodic data sets. Neverthe-
"less, our analysis favors the classical ∼ 150 Myr age,
and this value is similar to the results by Cummings"
"et al. (2016), Cummings & Kalirai (2018), and Cum-"
mings et al. (2018) (see also Fritzewski et al. 2020 and
Healy & McCullough 2020).
6. DISCUSSION
"In this section, we focus exclusively on the periodic"
"samples, and use them to study stellar rotation as a"
function of mass and age.
6.1. Rotation Data in the Gaia Era
"At this point, for every cluster in our sample, we"
have classified the periodic stars using our astromet-
"ric analysis (§4.1), discussed the effects that removing
the field contamination has on the individual rotational"
"sequences (§4.2), and presented a set of revised proper-
ties that are needed to perform meaningful inter-cluster"
"comparisons (§5). Now, we combine all of these to con-
struct an updated portrait of the evolution of stellar"
rotation.
"We illustrate this in Figure 10, where we show the re-"
vised period versus mass diagrams as a function of age.
The color-coding is the same as the revised sequences
"of Figure 9, and the non member contaminants have"
been removed. This represents the state-of-the-art for
rotation studies in terms of clean samples with stellar
"masses, temperatures, and ages derived in a consistent"
scale. We make these data publicly available in Ap-
pendix E.
One of the major results of our study can be seen
in the rotational sequence of M50 in Figure 10. When
"the non member contamination is removed, the revised"
"M50 sequence clearly resembles that of the Pleiades, as"
we would expect given their similar ages (150 and 125
"Myr, respectively). Incidentally, the low mass end of"
the M50 sequence coincides with the high-mass end of
"the co-eval NGC 2516 sequence (≈ 0.65 M�). This is
illustrated in their respective panels, where we show the"
"M50 sequence in blue and green, and the NGC 2516"
"sequence in grey, and vice versa. Given their indistin-"
"guishable ages, the merged M50 and NGC 2516 data"
can provide a valuable comparison point for the bench-
"mark Pleiades cluster. Likewise, a similar comparison"
can be made for the older M37 and Praesepe clusters.
"Ultimately, the above demonstrates a decisive finding:"
"when careful membership analysis are performed, the"
rotational sequences that have been constructed from
"ground-based observations (e.g., M50 by Irwin et al."
"2009), can be as informative for stellar rotation stud-"
ies as those constructed from space-based observations

"Figure 10. Revised period versus mass diagrams for all the
clusters we study (i.e., after having removed the non mem-
ber contamination). The clusters are sorted by age, going
from young in the top to old in the bottom. The x-axis cor-
responds to the masses we calculated in §4.1 from the Gaia
DR2 photometry. The points are color-coded in the same
fashion as the revised sequences of Figure 9: probable mem-
bers are shown as blue circles, while possible members and no
info stars are combined into one category shown as the open
green diamonds. The dotted and dashed lines correspond to
the apparent G = 17.5 and 18.5 mag limits from Figure 7
translated to mass coordinates. To aid inter-cluster compar-
isons, in some panels we add an additional cluster, with its
revised rotational sequence and name shown in grey in the
background. This figure represents the state-of-the-art data
for studies of stellar rotation (see §6.1)."
"(e.g., the Pleiades by Rebull et al. 2016a). This conclu-"
sion is particularly relevant in the post Kepler and K2
"era, and considering that only a fraction of the TESS"
targets are being observed with long baselines.
"Regarding the field contaminants, our membership"
analysis yields varying degrees of contamination rates.
"As mentioned in §2, we expected the clusters observed
from the ground to show higher contamination rates"
compared to those observed from space. This turns out
"to be the case for NGC 2547 and M50, where we find"
"the contamination to be ≈ 25% and 36%, respectively.
While high, these values are lower than the ∼ 40–60%
rates anticipated by Irwin et al. (2008) and Irwin et al."
"(2009), which were based on predictions from Galactic"
models. For the rest of the sample we find the contam-
"ination rates to be lower, of order . 5% (see §4.2).
Interestingly, although our membership study has pre-"
dominantly removed rotational outliers at both long
"and short periods for several clusters, many outliers are"
nonetheless classified as probable members and remain
in the revised sequences. An interesting example of this
"are the slowly rotating stars (periods ≈ 7–10 days) in
the young NGC 2547 (age of ∼ 35 Myr), which hints
to strongly mass-dependent initial conditions for stel-"
lar rotation (see also Somers et al. 2017; Rebull et al.
"2018, 2020). Similarly, all three & 0.5 Gyr-old clus-
ters show confirmed members that are rotating faster"
"(∼ 1 day) and slower (∼ 20 days) than their slowly ro-
tating branches. Now that the membership status of"
"these outliers have been confirmed, their presence can"
no longer be ignored or attributed to field contaminants.
Unless explained by modern theories of angular momen-
"tum evolution, this could potentially weaken the appli-"
cability of gyrochronology in field stars.
6.2. A Revised Picture of Angular Momentum
Evolution
We now quantify the trends that can be obtained from
the revised sequences of Figure 10. We display this in
"three different approaches, and these are shown in Fig-"
"ures 11, 12, and 13. Additionally, we calculate the per-"
centiles of the rotational distributions of our clusters in
"different mass bins, and we make them publicly available"
in Appendix F.
"Figure 11 shows, for each cluster in our sample, the"
period versus mass diagram of the median rotators in
0.1M� bins. This allows us to simultaneously analyze
the mass and age dependence of stellar rotation. For
"stars with masses below 0.5M�, the median rotation"
periods for the young NGC 2547 (35 Myr) are longer
than those seen in the older Pleiades and NGC 2516
"clusters (125 and 150 Myr, respectively). This is con-"
Rotation of Open Clusters Stars with Gaia 21
"Figure 11. Period versus mass diagram for the median
rotators. The colored squares show the median periods and
their standard errors, computed in 0.1M� bins. The solid
lines show a spline fit to the data. Each cluster is shown
as its own line, with the names, revised ages, and colors
indicated in the legend. For masses < 0.5M�, the median
rotators have a non-monotonic behavior, showing a spin up
from ages of ∼ 35 Myr to 125–150 Myr, and a spin down
afterwards at ∼ 700 Myr. For masses > 0.5M�, they show a
monotonic spin down as a function of time until ∼ 700 Myr,
after which the behavior becomes complicated (see §6.2)."
"sistent with expectations, considering that stars of these"
"masses take a few hundred Myr to reach the ZAMS, and"
are therefore still contracting by the age of NGC 2547.
"By the age of Praesepe (700 Myr), these stars have spun"
"down in a strongly mass-dependent fashion, with lowest"
"masses still showing periods below 1 day, and ∼ 0.4M�
stars rotating at & 10 days."
"The stars more massive than 0.5M�, on the other"
"hand, show a monotonic behavior with time in most"
of the age range probed by our clusters. They consis-
"tently spin down as they age from 35 to 700 Myr, and"
their median rotator trends in Figure 11 do not inter-
"sect each other, in agreement with expectations from"
"a Skumanich-type spin-down (i.e., period ∝ age1/2)."
"The notable exception to this, however, is the compar-"
ison of Praesepe and NGC 6811. For these two clus-
"ters, their rotational sequences do not seem to be sim-"
ple translations of each other to longer or shorter peri-
"ods. Although their age difference is non-negligible (∼
250 Myr), their median rotators are virtually overlap-"
"ping at ∼ 1.1 M� and in the 0.8–0.6M� range. The
latter of these has already been noted by Curtis et al."
"(2019a) (see also Meibom et al. 2011b), and a similar"
overlapping was reported by Agüeros et al. (2018) for
a smaller sample in the 1.4 Gyr-old cluster NGC 752.
"In terms of the interpretation of this feature, Agüeros"
et al. (2018) and Curtis et al. (2019a) have formulated
it as a temporary epoch of stalling in the spin-down
"of K-dwarfs, and Spada & Lanzafame (2020) have pro-"
posed that it arises from the competing effect between
magnetic braking and a strongly mass-dependent inter-
nal redistribution of angular momentum. We leave a
"detailed examination of this as future work, but given"
the considerable difference in metallicity between both
clusters ([Fe/H]= +0.16 dex for Praesepe and +0.03 dex
"for NGC 6811; Netopil et al. 2016), we highlight the im-"
portance of incorporating chemical composition in com-
"prehensive models of angular momentum evolution (e.g.,"
Amard & Matt 2020; Amard et al. 2020; Claytor et al.
2020).
Figure 11 can also be used to remark upon global prop-
"erties of stellar rotation. First, regardless of the age, no"
sharp transition is seen in the rotation periods near the
boundary between partially convective and fully convec-
"tive stars (∼ 0.35M�). Second, as illustrated by NGC
2547 in our sample, and by the young Upper Scorpius"
"and Taurus associations in Somers et al. (2017), Rebull"
"et al. (2018), and Rebull et al. (2020), the initial con-"
"ditions of stellar rotation are strongly mass-dependent,"
and need to be accounted for in models of angular mo-
"mentum evolution. Third, when considering the whole"
"age range probed by our sample (∼ 35 to 950 Myr),
we note that the stars in the 1.0–0.6M� range popu-"
late a global maximum in terms of rotation periods. In
"other words, the median rotators in this mass interval"
"never rotate more rapidly than ∼ 3–4 days. Given the
intimate connection between stellar rotation and activ-"
"ity (e.g., Wright et al. 2011, 2018), where more rapidly"
rotating stars tend to expose their planets to higher lev-
"els of potentially harming radiation, this feature could"
provide an optimal window in the search for habitable
worlds.
"In Figure 12, we show the rotational sequences for the"
"clusters we study, but in this case separating the data"
"into different percentiles of rotation. For each cluster,"
across the mass range where they have period informa-

and 90th percentiles of the period distributions are computed for 40 star bins in data rank ordered by mass, and then boxcar
smoothed. The region of rapid rotators is shown in light grey, that of intermediate rotators is shown in black, and that of slow
rotators is shown in dark grey. M50 and NGC 2516 are shown in a combined panel, given their virtually identical ages and
complementary mass ranges. We see a clear convergence of rotation rates into a narrow sequence in the older clusters, with the
limit (i.e., lowest mass) of this converged branch progressively extending to lower masses for older ages (e.g., ∼ 0.85M� in the
Pleiades to ∼ 0.65M� in Praesepe). For masses below this, the interquartile range is actually broader in the older clusters than
in the younger ones. This suggests that, at fixed mass, the rapid rotators lose less angular momentum (or experience a lower
torque) than the slow rotators. Current models of angular momentum evolution do not reproduce this feature."
Rotation of Open Clusters Stars with Gaia 23
"tion, we show a band of rapid rotators (star within the"
10th to 25th percentiles of the period distribution; light
"grey region), intermediate rotators (25th to 75th per-"
"centiles; black region), and slow rotators (75th to 90th"
"percentiles; dark grey region). At young ages, we ob-"
"serve a well-defined upper limit in the rotation periods,"
"with virtually no stars showing periods longer than ∼
10 days. At late ages, we clearly see the convergence of"
rotation periods to a tight sequence in a heavily mass-
"dependent fashion, in agreement with expectations. The"
convergence in our revised sequences is so strong that
"the upper and lower edges of the distribution in M37,"
"Praesepe, and NGC 6811 in the 1.0–0.8M� range are"
"barely visible. Additionally, in both Figures 11 and 12,"
there is another important clue about the torques from
"magnetized winds. For all clusters, there is a charac-"
teristic mass where the distribution has collapsed down
"into a narrow range, and a mass range just below it"
where stars still retain a range of surface rotation rates.
"For this latter mass range, the width of the interquartile"
"range is broader in the older systems (& 500 Myr) than
it is in the young ones (. 150 Myr). This indicates a
relative divergence in the surface rotation rates, in con-"
trast to the convergence that is predicted by canonical
"models of angular momentum loss (e.g., van Saders &"
Pinsonneault 2013; Matt et al. 2015).
"In other words, the data in Figure 12 appear to require"
lower torques for rapid rotators than for intermediate
"rotators, which acts to create the bimodal distribution"
that has been noted in the literature (and which is now
clearly seen in our sample). One possible explanation
"for this, as proposed by Garraffo et al. (2018), is that"
"there is a change in field topology, such that rapid ro-"
tators have more complex magnetic field configurations
"than intermediate rotators, and are therefore less effi-"
cient at losing angular momentum. Although this con-
"cept is interesting, the data could also be fit with a wind"
"model that incorporates a super-saturation mechanism,"
"where the overall field strength declines. Alternatively,"
it could indicate a dependence of the convective overturn
"timescale on the rotation rate at fixed mass, as loss laws"
are typically parametrized by the ratio of the rotation
"period to this timescale (i.e., the Rossby number). Ulti-"
"mately, a number of additional physical properties that"
are involved in the loss of angular momentum could be
"influencing the empirical sequences (e.g., mass loss rate,"
"dipole field strength, Alfvén radius). It will be informa-"
"tive to compare different proposed mechanisms, but an"
adjustment to canonical models is clearly required. We
note that the late time behavior of the distribution is not
"sensitive to the treatment of this feature, as older stars"
"have lost memory of their initial conditions, and typ-"

percentiles of the angular velocity distributions (normalized

0.5 M� stars shown in the top, 0.8 M� stars shown in the
middle, and 1 M� stars shown in the bottom. Our values
are shown as the black solid line (GPR21), and the litera-
ture values from Gallet & Bouvier (2015) are shown as the
red dashed line (GB15). Our analysis of the clusters’ mem-
berships and properties play a role in shifting our values with
respect to the literature ones in both axes (see §6.2)."
ical semi-empirical approaches are tuned to reproduce
the spin-down of the slow and rapid rotator branches of
"the data. However, the properties of intermediate ro-"
tators in systems that retain rapid rotators will not be
correctly modeled by classical methods.
"Finally, in Figure 13, we show the temporal evolution"
of the rotational percentiles for three different masses
"(0.5, 0.8, and 1M�). We frame this as a comparison with"
"Gallet & Bouvier (2015), and show both sets of values"
for the clusters we have in common7. The comparison is
"made in terms of the 25th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of"
"the distribution of angular velocities (ω = 2π/Prot), nor-"

"malized to the solar value (ω� = 2.87 × 10−6s−1). Our
membership analysis plays a role in shifting our values"
"with respect to the literature ones in both axes, as the"
revised rotational sequences change the angular veloc-
"ity distribution (§4), and the revised cluster properties
change the ages (§5). In general, our percentile evolution
appear less noisy and shows smoother patterns. In the"
"0.5 and 0.8M� stars, our data captures the same broad"
"trends. Importantly, the overall slow rotation in young"
"stars remains, and this provides further evidence for the"
need of core-envelope decoupling in angular momentum
"models (e.g., Denissenkov et al. 2010). Before our work,"
the classification of all of the slow rotators in NGC 2547
"as field contaminants was a real possibility, and while"
"our analysis did remove a number of them, some still"
"remain. For the 1M� stars, our data suggests a faster"
rotation in all percentiles (as our analysis has predom-
"inantly removed slow rotators), and a globally steeper"
spin-down slope that remains approximately constant
(and similar to the Skumanich value) in the entire age
range.
6.3. Gaia Biases against Photometric Binaries
Investigating the behavior of binary stars in empiri-
cal rotation studies is important to better understand
stellar populations and angular momentum evolution.
"In the regime of wide separations, binaries can be used"
to place novel gyrochronology constraints in unexplored
age and metallicity domains (Chanamé & Ramı́rez 2012;
Janes 2017; Godoy-Rivera & Chanamé 2018). In the
"regime of close separations, recent studies have found"
a correlation between rapid rotation and field binaries
"(Simonian et al. 2019, 2020). Specifically in the M-"
"dwarf domain, Stauffer et al. (2018) found that in the"
"young Upper Scorpius association (∼ 8 Myr) and the
Pleiades cluster, the stars with multiple period mea-"
surements from K2 are predominantly photometric bi-
"naries (see also Rebull et al. 2016a, Rebull et al. 2017,"
"and Tokovinin & Briceño 2018). Furthermore, Stauffer"
et al. (2018) showed that the rotation periods of these
"young, unresolved binaries, are much shorter as well as"
similar to each other than otherwise expected for single
M-dwarfs. This hints at the crucial role that binarity
plays in star formation and the rotation rates imprinted
at birth (see also Messina 2019).
"In this context, in Figure 14 we examine the rota-"
tional sequences and CMDs of the no info stars in our
"most nearby clusters (i.e., the targets that did not pass"
"our astrometric quality cuts; see §3.1.3). In the revised
rotational sequences of M50 and M37, the stars classi-"
fied as no info predominantly occupy their very lowest
"Teff (and therefore apparent magnitude) values, which"
indicates that their classification is purely due to low
"quality astrometry. In contrast to this, for the Pleiades"
"and Praesepe, the no info stars span the entire Teff range"
"(see §4.2), and we would have expected them to have
high-quality Gaia astrometry. Considering the previous"
selections made by Rebull et al. (2016a) in the Pleiades
"and by Rebull et al. (2017) in Praesepe, and given the"
"low contamination rates found for these systems in §4.2,
we expect most of these no info stars to be real members"
of these nearby clusters.
The CMDs of Figure 14 show that the no info stars
"appear, predominantly, as photometric binaries with re-"
spect to the sequences of probable members in both the
Pleiades and Praesepe. This result hints to biases in
"the Gaia DR2 data against these unresolved systems,"
"even with conservative quality cuts, where their sepa-"
ration is seemingly too close for the current astrometry
to properly distinguish their orbital and systemic mo-
"tions. Interestingly, many of these no info stars appear"
as rapid rotators in the Pleiades rotational sequence. By
"the age of Praesepe, however, they are overlapping with"
the bulk of the probable members on the slowly rotating
"branch. This indicates that, while their separations are"
"close enough to be unresolved in Gaia, these binaries are"
not synchronized and they are actually spinning down
in a similar fashion as the single stars do. This finding
"is similar to that of Stauffer et al. (2018), who reported"
that the rapid rotation of stars in binaries with respect
"to single stars is gone by the age of Praesepe, but in"
"this case we extend it to higher mass stars, beyond the"
M-dwarf regime.
Figure 14 also provides an interesting distinction in
our membership classification. While presumably some
of the stars classified in the no info category could turn
"out to be field contaminants, the stars classified as non"
members appear to occupy different locations in the ro-
tational sequences and CMDs. Most of these non mem-
bers appear below the track of probable members on the
"CMD, and correspond to rotational outliers in the con-"
verged branch of Praesepe. In addition to their astro-
"metric distinction, we take this as further confirmation"
that the non members and no info stars correspond to
markedly different populations.
"Finally, although our astrometric selections were de-"
"signed to avoid biases against binary stars, we conclude"
that newer Gaia data will be needed to fully resolve
"these photometric binaries. In the meanwhile, while not"
being classified as probable members by our membership
"analysis, we advise future rotation studies of binary stars"
to include these no info stars in their samples for com-
pleteness purposes.

K photometry from Rebull et al. (2016a) and Rebull et al. (2017)(note that the Pleiades (V − K)0 color reported by Rebull
et al. (2016a) was already corrected for extinction). The color and symbol coding are the same from the literature sequences
of Figure 9, and represent our astrometric membership classification. For the purposes of this figure, we highlight the no info
stars and non members over the probable members. For both clusters, the stars classified as no info stars appear predominantly
as photometric binaries on both CMDs, hinting to biases in the Gaia astrometry for these systems. Notably, while in the ∼
125 Myr Pleiades sequence many no info stars correspond to rapid rotators, almost all of them have converged onto the slowly
rotating branch in the ∼ 700 Myr Praesepe sequence. This indicates that, although unresolved, these likely binary systems are
spinning down as single stars do (see §6.3)."
7. CONCLUSIONS
Stellar rotation plays an important role in the life of
"stars, and it is a meaningful age diagnostic for main-"
"sequence targets, a technique known as gyrochronology."
Open clusters have played a key role in stellar rotation
"studies, but their memberships are often uncertain, and"
the expected contamination rates of clusters with ro-
"tation period information can reach up to ∼ 60%. In
this paper, we use the Gaia DR2 astrometry to revise"
the memberships of several open clusters with rotational
"data, and provide an updated portrait of stellar rotation"
"as a function of mass, temperature, and age. We select"
our sample of clusters based on the high scientific inter-
"est they hold, and their large periodic samples, which"
come from both ground- and space-based photometric
monitoring (Table 1).
We perform an unrestricted search for cluster mem-
"bers in the Gaia data, i.e., considering all the Gaia stars,"
regardless of whether they belong to the periodic sam-
ples. We purposely avoid discarding binary stars with
"our astrometric quality cuts, as they provide important"
clues for stellar population studies. For a given clus-
"ter, our astrometric method models both the cluster and"
"the field in parallax and proper motion space, allowing"
"for intrinsic dispersions. From this, we calculate mem-"
bership probabilities and identify probable cluster mem-
"bers, non members (i.e., field stars), and an intermediate"
category of possible members (typically faint stars with
large astrometric uncertainties). An additional category
denominated no info stars is assigned to stars that do
not have enough astrometric information to be classi-
fied. Although our membership selection only includes
"astrometric (but not photometric) data, the CMD pro-"
jections of the probable members show clean isochrone-
like sequences for all the clusters (Figure 7).
"The cluster properties (age, metallicity, distance mod-"
"ulus, reddening), as well as the mass and temperature"
"values of its stars, play a fundamental role in angu-"
lar momentum evolution studies. We use the homoge-
"neous Gaia photometry, and the large samples of proba-"
"ble members we identify, to derive our own revised clus-"
26 Godoy-Rivera et al.
ter properties (Table 2). We do this by comparing the
"photometry with state-of-the-art evolutionary models,"
and complement it with a compilation of high-resolution
"spectroscopic metallicities. Importantly, we find our re-"
vised ages to be in good agreement with pre Gaia litera-
"ture estimates, and in some cases, in disagreement with"
"more recent analyses (see §5). We further exploit the
Gaia photometry and compare it with models to cal-"
culate stellar masses and temperatures for our probable
and possible cluster members. All of this allows us to
perform an analysis of the rotational sequences of the
"clusters in a common mass, temperature, and age scale."
"This is a key piece of our work, and something that has"
been missing in previous cluster studies.
We crossmatch the Gaia stars with the rotation pe-
"riod catalogs, and use our membership analysis to re-"
move the non member contaminants from the rotational
sequences of the clusters (Figure 9). We find varying de-
"grees of non member contamination, with some of the"
clusters observed from the ground showing high rates
"(e.g., ≈ 25% and 36% for NGC 2547 and M50), and the
clusters observed from space showing lower rates (e.g.,"
"≈ 4% for the Pleiades). Notably, discarding the con-
tamination does empty specific regions of the rotational"
"sequences, such as removing many (but importantly not"
"all) of the slow rotators in NGC 2547, as well as preferen-"
"tially removing outliers in the Pleiades, M37, Praesepe,"
"and NGC 6811. M50 is an exceptional case, where our"
revised sequence is considerably different from the pre-
vious literature one. Our analysis removes most of the
"M50 rotational outliers (at both short and long periods),"
and its revised sequence now clearly resembles that of
the benchmark and similar-age Pleiades cluster.
We present an updated and self-consistent portrait of
"the evolution of stellar rotation, and quantify important"
trends that can be obtained from it. Our most impor-
tant findings in these regards are:
"• Once the non member contamination has been
removed, the rotational sequences of clusters ob-"
served from the ground can be as constraining as
those observed from space. This is particularly
relevant for the post Kepler and K2 era (Figure
"• Although our membership analysis has predom-
inantly removed rotational outliers in all of the"
"clusters, many of these still survive at both short"
and long periods. While it is likely that the rapid
"rotators correspond to synchronized binaries, the"
slow rotators can no longer be attributed to field
"star contaminants, and they need to be explained"
by future theories of angular momentum evolution
(Figure 10).
"• Stars in the 1.0–0.6M� range populate a global
maximum in terms of rotation periods. Given the"
"strong rotation-activity connection in stars, this"
potentially provides their planets with an optimal
window for habitability (Figure 11).
"• At the age of the young NGC 2547 cluster (∼ 35
Myr), there is a clear-cut set of maximum initial"
"stellar periods (∼ 10 days). At old ages (& 500
Myr), stars in the 1.1–0.6M� rage converge to a"
sequence that is even narrower than previously ob-
served (Figure 12).
"• In the saturated domain, where stars have not
yet converged into a uniform sequence at fixed"
"mass, the separation (in terms of rotation peri-"
ods) between the intermediate and rapid rotators
increases with age. This feature is not predicted
"by classical models, and we interpret it as the lat-"
ter group experiencing lower torques compared to
the former one (Figure 12).
"• We find biases in the Gaia data against photomet-
ric binaries, which predominantly appear as rapid"
"rotators at young ages, but nonetheless spin-down"
as single stars do (Figure 14).
The data products of this paper will be a useful refer-
"ence for the community. For the clusters in our sample,"
we make publicly available both the catalog of probable
and possible members (regardless of whether they have
"period measurements; Appendix B), as well as the cata-"
log of the periodic stars (regardless of their membership
classification; Appendix E). These catalogs include mass
"and temperature values (calculated in a uniform scale,"
"assuming they are real cluster members), which will be"
a useful reference for future stellar rotation and cluster
"studies. Additionally, we report the percentiles of the"
rotational distributions of our clusters as a function of
"both mass and age, which can be used to calibrate fu-"
ture models of angular momentum evolution (Appendix
"Finally, the field of stellar rotation is entering a new"
era thanks to the wealth of photometric and astrometric
"data provided by space-based missions (e.g., Kepler, K2,"
"TESS, and Gaia). As shown in this work, these can be"
adequately complemented with ground-based observa-
"tions. Still, although the rotational sequences of numer-"
"ous star-forming regions, stellar associations, and open"
"clusters exist in the literature, properly accounting for"
their memberships remains a crucial part of exploiting
Rotation of Open Clusters Stars with Gaia 27
them for angular momentum evolution studies. Exten-
sions of our work would take advantage of improved as-
"trometry and RV measurements (e.g., Gaia DR3) to per-"
"form full 6D kinematic analyses, and increase the sam-"
"ples with other clusters, young associations and mov-"
"ing groups (e.g., Hyades, M34, IC 2391/2602, α Per, ρ"
"Ophiuchus, Taurus, Upper Scorpius, h Per). Comple-"
mentary efforts should expand on these by incorporat-
"ing wide separation binaries and field stars (e.g., Newton"
et al. 2016; Godoy-Rivera & Chanamé 2018; Angus et al.
"2020), as well as systems in unexplored age domains and"
"environments (e.g., Curtis et al. 2019b, 2020; Gruner &"
Barnes 2020).
"Ultimately, future rotation studies should attempt to"
answer the several questions that remain open. Some of
these include: the complicated spin-down behavior seen
"for K-dwarfs in ∼ 1–2.5 Gyr-old clusters (e.g., Meibom
et al. 2011b; Agüeros et al. 2018; Curtis et al. 2019a),"
and the efficacy of new angular momentum evolution
"models in replicating it (e.g., Garraffo et al. 2018; Spada"
& Lanzafame 2020); the role that metallicity could play
"in this problem and in rotation in general (e.g., Amard"
& Matt 2020); the weakened magnetic breaking experi-
enced by stars past half of their main-sequence lives (van
"Saders et al. 2016; see also Lorenzo-Oliveira et al. 2019),"
its dependence on shifts in the magnetic field topology
"(Metcalfe et al. 2019), and exploring whether this ex-"
tends to the M-dwarf domain; placing constraints in the
initial distribution of rotation rates and the role of bi-
naries and other processes that regular rotation at birth
"(e.g., Somers et al. 2017; Rebull et al. 2018; Stauffer"
et al. 2018; Messina 2019); the role that bright faculae
"play in stellar variability (e.g., Montet et al. 2017; Rein-"
hold & Hekker 2020); the prospects of gyrochronology as
an age diagnostic for exoplanet hosts and Galactic pop-
"ulation studies (e.g., Gallet & Delorme 2019; Metcalfe"
"& Egeland 2019; van Saders et al. 2019); and lastly, the"
importance of all of the above in regards to the deep con-
nection between rotation and the various aspects of stel-
"lar activity (e.g., coronal X-ray and chromospheric Ca ii"
"and Hα emission, UV excess, flares; Stelzer et al. 2013;"
Zhang et al. 2020; Dixon et al. 2020; Ilin et al. 2020;
"Godoy-Rivera et al. 2020, submitted), and its depen-"
"dence on stellar structure, the presence of a tachocline,"
"and the evolutionary phase (e.g., Wright et al. 2018;"

have used elsewhere. For abbreviation purposes we only list the possible members with membership probabilities greater than
50%. We are glad to provide extended tables (including the same information for all the possible members as well as for the non
members and no info stars) to interested readers upon request."
B. DATA TABLE FOR THE PROBABLE AND POSSIBLE CLUSTER MEMBERS
Table B1 lists the probable and possible cluster members for all the clusters we study. We report the main Gaia DR2
"astrometric and photometric information, as well as the membership parameters and classifications we derive. Note"
that the parallaxes reported in Table B1 do not include the zero-point corrections that we have used elsewhere.
"We caution that, while Table B1 reports the same set of values for all stars regardless their membership classification,"
"the MG0,proj , mass, and Teff values are calculated assuming as if all the stars are true main-sequence cluster members"
"(and are all at the same respective global cluster parallax). For stars that turn out not to be real members, this will"
"naturally yield an incorrect mass and Teff estimate. Therefore, we suggest that interested readers should only consider"
"the mass and Teff values for the probable members as being meaningful in future studies, until higher quality astrometry"
fully resolves the membership classification of the possible members here reported.
C. ASTROMETRIC ANALYSIS OF CLUSTERS AND PHASE-SPACE PROJECTIONS
"After applying our classification method to all the clusters, we obtain a sample of probable members, possible members,"
"non members, and no info stars for each of them. Figure C1 shows the phase-space projections of these populations"
"(except for the no info stars, which are absent from the plot due to the lack of astrometric information; see §3.1.3).
We now provide an analysis of the astrometric classification in each of the clusters:"
"• NGC 2547: for this cluster, the parallax and proper motion in RA are the variables that allow us to distinguish
the cluster from the field population in phase-space. On the other hand, the proper motion in Dec of the cluster"
is similar to that of the field. The possible members are an intermediate population located in between the cluster
and the field in the phase-space projections.
"• Pleiades: of all the clusters in our sample, this cluster is the one that is the most separated from the field
in phase-space. Given its large parallax, as well as proper motion (particularly in Dec), this cluster can be"
30 Godoy-Rivera et al.
"Figure C1. Phase-space projections of the probable (blue), possible (cyan), and non (red) members for all the clusters we study
(analogous to Figure 2). Each clusters correspond to a row, and they are sorted as presented in Table 1. Note that the range
of the parallax and proper motions vary considerably on a cluster by cluster basis."
Rotation of Open Clusters Stars with Gaia 31
readily differentiated from the background population. Some of the probable members appear as outliers in the
"projections including parallax, but they correspond to stars with uncertain parallax measurements. The small"
number of stars classified as possible members is a direct consequence of the large kinematic differences between
"the cluster and the field. In other words, it is unlikely that a star will have a value of ∆i ≤ 3 (inside the cluster’s
3σ ellipsoid in phase-space) and will have a low cluster membership probability."
"• M50: in this case, the proper motion of the cluster is quite similar to that of the field, and therefore the parallax
plays a crucial role in identifying the probable cluster members. Nonetheless, given the small cluster parallax (∼
1.0 mas) and the therefore larger astrometric uncertainties associated (as the stars in M50 are naturally fainter"
"than those of, for instance, the Pleiades), together with the proper motion similarities with the field, the number"
"of possible members for this cluster is much larger than for others. In other words, given the large astrometric"
"uncertainties, there is a large number of stars with values of ∆i ≤ 3 (inside the cluster’s 3σ ellipsoid) that have
low membership probabilities (P < Pmin). The CMD of this cluster (see Figure 7) demonstrates this, as for"
"magnitudes fainter than apparent G ' 17 mag, the probable members are surrounded by an envelope of possible
members. Additionally, the phase-space projections show that the possible members are overlapping with the"
non members altogether.
"• NGC 2516: for this cluster, the parallax plays an important role when identifying the probable members. Although
there are differences between the cluster and field proper motions (more in the Dec coordinate than in RA), the"
"parallax is the dominant mean to separate the populations. As in the case of NGC 2547, the possible members"
appear as an intermediate population in the phase-space projections.
"• M37: this cluster has the smallest parallax of our entire sample, in addition to having a proper motion in RA
rather similar to that of the field. Thus, the proper motion in Dec plays an important role in the astrometric"
"classification. M37 is also the richest cluster in our sample, and we identify a large number of probable members"
"that densely populate the CMD. Moreover, a few giant stars can be seen in the CMD, highlighting that our"
"classification method is agnostic to the stars photometry, and they naturally arise from a careful astrometric"
selection.
"• Praesepe: similarly to the Pleiades, this cluster is clearly separated from the field in phase-space. Again, some
of the probable members appear as outliers particularly in proper motion space, but they mostly correspond to"
stars with large astrometric uncertainties. The small number of possible members is again a reflection of the
large kinematic difference between the cluster and field.
"• NGC 6811: this cluster has a similar proper motion in RA to that of the field, and therefore the parallax and
proper motion in Dec are the variables that allow us to better distinguish the probable cluster members from"
"the non members. However, given its small parallax value (compared to other clusters), and similarly to M50,
NGC 6811 also has a large number of stars classified as possible members that overlap with the non members"
"in phase-space (and moreover, for magnitudes fainter than apparent G ' 19 mag, the astrometric errors are so
large that no star can be reliably classified as a probable member)"
D. COMPARISON OF OUR MASSES AND TEMPERATURES WITH LITERATURE VALUES
"Analogous to the comparison made in §3.3 for NGC 2547, some of the other clusters we study have mass (and
sometimes Teff) estimates available in the references that we use as source for the period information. In particular,"
"Irwin et al. (2008), Irwin et al. (2009), and Irwin et al. (2007a) report masses for the NGC 2547, M50, and NGC 2516"
"stars, and Stauffer et al. (2016) and Curtis et al. (2019a) report mass and Teff for the Pleiades and NGC 6811 stars."
We show the comparison of these estimates with ours in Figure D1. Note that for M37 and Praesepe the references
"used as source for the period information did not report mass or temperature estimates, and these clusters are missing"
from the comparison.
"The mass comparisons with NGC 2547, M50, and NGC 2516 are topologically similar to each other: in the faint"
"regime (masses below the dashed lines), where we do not account for the contribution of photometric binaries, we"
"see mostly constant differences of order ≈ −0.05M�. For masses higher than this limit, the scatter increases and
we observe that many stars have positive mass differences, which is due to the magnitude projections we use in the"
intermediate and bright regimes.

are shown in yellow, while the Teff comparisons are shown in purple. The axis scale is the same for all the mass and Teff
comparisons. Each panel indicates the respective cluster name in the top right corner and the mean and standard deviation of
the mass or Teff difference in the bottom right corner. The dotted and dashed lines correspond to the apparent G = 17.5 and
18.5 mag limits from Figure 7 translated to mass and Teff coordinates. The top row shows the comparison with the Irwin et al.
(2008), Irwin et al. (2009), and Irwin et al. (2007a) masses for NGC 2547, M50, and NGC 2516, which were all derived in a
similar fashion among each other. The two bottom-left panels show the mass and Teff comparison with the Stauffer et al. (2016)
values for the Pleiades, and the two bottom-right panels show the same for the Curtis et al. (2019a) values for their NGC 6811
stars. The comparisons suggest that our masses and temperatures are subject to systematic uncertainties of ∼ 0.05–0.1M� and
∼ 150 K, which are modest considering the different methods, photometric data, and underlying models employed."
"For the Pleiades, the mass and temperature comparisons with Stauffer et al. (2016) are in agreement with our"
expectations: while we employed the projection technique to account for unresolved binaries in our bright regime and
"partially in our intermediate regime, Stauffer et al. (2016) used this approach for their entire sample. Accordingly,"
"we observe an approximately constant offset trend in ∆Mass (≈ +0.05M�) and ∆Teff (≈ −150 K) for stars more
massive/hotter than the dotted line, which then turns to a mass/Teff-dependent trend for stars in the intermediate"
and faint regimes.
"For NGC 6811, Curtis et al. (2019a) derived temperatures by generating their own color-Teff relations, and translated"
these to masses by interpolating tabulated spectral energy distributions. The mass and Teff comparisons show an
"excellent agreement, with differences being . 0.025M� and . 100 K for most of the mass/Teff range. Given that both
our and their calculation are based only on the Gaia DR2 photometry (unlike the previously described comparisons),"
this result is consistent with the expectations.
"Ultimately, all the mass and temperature comparisons previously described are subject to different assumptions"
"regarding the cluster properties, stellar evolutionary models (and their specific input physics; e.g., Tayar et al. 2020),"
"and considerations for the contribution of unresolved photometric binaries. Furthermore, in most cases, the photometry"
"employed by the references that supply the period information is different from that of Gaia. In spite of this, we observe"
"a good overall agreement with the literature estimates, and these comparisons suggest possible systematic uncertainties"
of ∼ 0.05–0.1M� and ∼ 150 K in our masses and temperatures.

"Note—(The full table is available online in machine-readable format.) From the catalogs used as source of the period mea-
surements, we report the IDs used in them (which vary on a cluster by cluster basis) and the periods. We note that although
many of the Pleiades and Praesepe stars had more than one period reported, this table only lists their main value, i.e., P1 from
Rebull et al. (2016a,b) and Rebull et al. (2017), respectively. From Gaia DR2, we report the main astrometric and photometric
information, and the parallaxes are reported as they appear in Gaia DR2 and do not include the zero-point values we have used
elsewhere. From our analysis we report the membership probability and classification regardless of their category (i.e., probable,
possible or non member, or no info star). We also report our derived projected absolute and dereddened G band magnitudes
(MG0,proj), as well as the respective mass and temperature values obtained by interpolating the models, and the regime in which
they were calculated (see §3.3 for details)."
E. DATA TABLE FOR THE PERIODIC SAMPLES
Table E1 reports the main information and properties for the periodic samples of the clusters we study. We list
"all stars that were reported in the catalogs used as sources for the periods (see §2.2), regardless of their membership
classification, or if we found them when crossmatching with the Gaia DR2 data. Note that the parallaxes reported in
Table E1 do not include the zero-point corrections that we have used elsewhere. We extend the same cautionary note"
"given in Table B1 to Table E1, regarding that the MG0,proj , mass, and Teff values are calculated assuming as if all the"
stars are true main-sequence cluster members (and are all at the same respective global cluster parallax).
F. PERCENTILES OF THE PERIOD DISTRIBUTIONS
Table F1 reports the percentiles of the distribution of rotation periods as a function of mass and age. Note that only
"the stars that survive our membership analysis have been considered (i.e., the stars of the revised rotational sequences,"
see Figure 10). These values can be used to calibrate and test future models of angular momentum evolution.
