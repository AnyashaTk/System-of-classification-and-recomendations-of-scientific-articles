"ABSTRACT
We report on precise Doppler measurements of L231-32 (TOI-270), a nearby M dwarf (𝑑 =
22 pc, 𝑀★ = 0.39 M�, 𝑅★ = 0.38 R�), which hosts three transiting planets that were recently
discovered using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The three planets
are 1.2, 2.4, and 2.1 times the size of Earth and have orbital periods of 3.4, 5.7, and 11.4
days. We obtained 29 high-resolution optical spectra with the newly commissioned Echelle
Spectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) and
58 spectra using the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS). From these
observations, we find the masses of the planets to be 1.58±0.26, 6.15±0.37, and 4.78±0.43 M⊕,
respectively. The combination of radius and mass measurements suggests that the innermost
planet has a rocky composition similar to that of Earth, while the outer two planets have lower
densities. Thus, the inner planet and the outer planets are on opposite sides of the ‘radius
valley’ — a region in the radius-period diagram with relatively few members, which has been
interpreted as a consequence of atmospheric photo-evaporation. We place these findings into
the context of other small close-in planets orbiting M dwarf stars, and use support vector
machines to determine the location and slope of the M dwarf (𝑇eff < 4000 K) radius valley as a
function of orbital period. We compare the location of the M dwarf radius valley to the radius
valley observed for FGK stars, and find that its location is a good match to photo-evaporation
and core-powered mass loss models. Finally, we show that planets below the M dwarf radius
valley have compositions consistent with stripped rocky cores, whereas most planets above
have a lower density consistent with the presence of a H-He atmosphere."

1 INTRODUCTION
"The small, Earth-sized planets that are being discovered around
other stars may or may not resemble our own Earth in terms of com-
position, formation history, and atmospheric properties. They are
also a challenge to study, because they produce such small transit and
radial-velocity (RV) signals. Fortunately, recent progress has been
made on both of these fronts. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satel-
lite (TESS) was launched in April 2018 to conduct an all-sky survey
and discover transiting planets around the nearest and brightest stars
(Ricker et al. 2014). Because the transit signal varies inversely as
the stellar radius squared, searching small M dwarf stars is of par-
ticular interest because there is a greater opportunity to find small
planets. For the same reason, planets around M dwarfs are valuable
targets for atmospheric studies through transmission spectroscopy.
To understand which planets have a rocky composition and whether
they are likely to have atmospheres, precise radius measurements
from transit surveys need to be paired with mass measurements
from dynamical observations such as precise RV measurements.
To this end, the novel Echelle Spectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet
and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO, Pepe et al.
2010, 2014, 2020) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) provides an
unprecedented RV precision."
"Here we present the result of an ESPRESSO campaign (ESO
observing program 0102.C-0456) to characterise three small (1.1,
2.3, and 2.0 𝑅⊕) transiting planets around L231-32 (TOI-270), a
nearby (22 pc), bright (𝐾 = 8.25, 𝑉 = 12.6), M3V dwarf star
(𝑀★ = 0.39 M� , 𝑅★ = 0.38 R�), as well as four additional
ESPRESSO observations obtained as part of observing programs
1102.C-0744 and 1102.C-0958. We also used data from the High
Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) program for
M-dwarf planets amenable to detailed atmospheric characterisa-"

"tion (ESO observing program 1102.C-0339). These planets were
observed to transit by TESS in three subsequent campaigns, each
lasting about 27 days. The transit signals were described and val-
idated by Günther et al. (2019). Because of the characteristics of
the host star and its planets, L231-32 is a prime target for exoplanet
atmosphere studies, which are ongoing with the Hubble Space Tele-
scope (HST, program id GO-15814, PI Mikal-Evans; Mikal-Evans
et al. 2019). Furthermore, simulations have shown these planets
are highly suitable for atmospheric characterisation with the James
Webb Space Telescope (JWST; Chouqar et al. 2020). Further transit
observations with e.g. TESS or other space telescopes may reveal
transit timing variations (TTVs) which can be used to constrain the
planet masses independently of RVs."
"Our mass measurements for these three planets allow us to
constrain their possible compositions. The planets are located on
both sides of the radius valley, which separates close-in super-Earth
planets from sub-Neptune planets (e.g. Owen & Wu 2013; Lopez
& Fortney 2013; Fulton et al. 2017; Van Eylen et al. 2018), and
we show how their compositions can be interpreted in this context.
We furthermore compare the properties of L231-32’s planets with
those of other small planets with precisely measured masses, radii,
and periods, and use this sample to measure the location of the M
dwarf radius valley and its slope as a function of orbital period."
"This paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we describe
the TESS transit observations, and ESPRESSO and HARPS RV
observations. In Section 3, we derive the parameters of the host
star, by combining high resolution spectra with other sources of
ancillary information. In Section 4, we describe the approach to
modeling L231-32 and the properties of its planets. In Section 5,
we show the resulting properties of L231-32’s planets and discuss
the composition of the planets. In Section 6, we compare their
properties to radius valley predictions and to other planets orbiting
M dwarf stars, and measure the location and slope of the M dwarf"

conclusions."
2 OBSERVATIONS AND MODELING
2.1 TESS photometry
"L231-32 (TOI-270; TIC 259377017) was observed by the TESS
mission (Ricker et al. 2014) during three 27-day sectors, namely
sectors 3, 4, and 5, between 20 September 2018 and 11 December
2018. It was observed on CCD 4 of camera 3 in sector 3 and 4, and
on CCD 3 of camera 3 in sector 5. The star was pre-selected (Stassun
et al. 2018) and was observed in a 2-minute cadence for the whole
duration of these sectors. During the TESS extended mission, the
target was re-observed in sectors 30 (between 23 September 2020
and 19 October 2020) and 32 (between 20 November 2020 and 16
December 2020) in the 2-minute cadence mode. The data observed
in sector 30 was taken on CCD 4 of camera 3, while the data
observed in sector 32 was taken on CCD 3 of camera 3. The data
were reduced by the TESS data processing pipeline developed by
the Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC, Jenkins et al.
2016), and the transits of three planet candidates were detected in
the SPOC pipeline and promoted to TESS object of interest (TOI)
status by the TESS science team."
"We started radial velocity (RV) observations to confirm and
measure the mass of these transiting planets with ESPRESSO and
with HARPS, on 9 February and 1 January 2019, respectively (see
Section 2.2). As these observations were ongoing, Günther et al.
(2019) also reported on the validation of these planets, by perform-
ing a statistical analysis of the TESS observations, as well as obtain-
ing ground-based seeing-limited photometry coordinated through
the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP)1."
"We downloaded the TESS photometry from the Mikulski
Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST2) and started our analysis
using the presearch data conditioning (PDC) light curve reduced
by SPOC. We searched for additional transit signals using a Box
Least-Square (BLS) algorithm (Kovács et al. 2002) and the ‘Détec-
tion Spécialisée de Transits’ (DST) algorithm (Cabrera et al. 2012)
for additional transit signals but found no evidence for any transiting
planets in addition to the three that were alerted. In Section 4.1, we
describe our approach to the modeling of the TESS photometry."
2.2 Spectroscopic observations
2.2.1 ESPRESSO
"We obtained 26 high-resolution spectroscopic observations of
L231-32 between 9 February and 22 March 2019 using ESPRESSO
(Pepe et al. 2014, 2020) on the 8.2 m Very Large Telescope (VLT;
Paranal, Chile) as part of observing program 0102.C-0456. Four ad-
ditional observations were obtained as part of observing programs
1102.C-0744 and 1102.C-0958. ESPRESSO is a relatively novel
instrument at the VLT which was first offered to the community in
October 2018."
"Each observation has an integration time of 1200 sec, a median
resolving power of 140,000, and a wavelength range of 380-788
nm. We used the slow read-out mode, which uses a 2x1 spatial by
spectral binning. Observations were taken in high-resolution (HR)"
"1 https://tess.mit.edu/followup/
2 https://archive.stsci.edu/tess"
"mode. One of the observations was flagged as unreliable due to a
detector restart just before the exposure, and we excluded this data
point from the analysis as a restart can result in additional noise.
This leaves a total of 29 ESPRESSO observations that we use in our
subsequent analysis."
"To determine a wavelength-calibration solution, daytime ThAr
measurements were taken and the source was observed with simul-
taneous Fabry-Pérot (FP) exposures, following the procedure out-
lined in the ESPRESSO user manual3. The signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) for individual spectra at orders 104 and 105, which are both
centered at 557 nm, ranges from 9 to 40, with a median SNR of 29."
"To calibrate and reduce the data we used the publicly avail-
able pipeline for ESPRESSO data reduction4, together with the
ESO Reflex tool (Freudling et al. 2013). This tool uses the science
spectra and all associated calibration files (i.e. bias frames, dark
frames, led frames, order definitions, flat frames, FP wavelength
calibration frame, Thorium-FP calibration, FP-Thorium calibra-
tion, fiber-to-fiber efficiency exposure, and a spectrophotometric
standard star exposure) to reduce and calibrate the raw spectra,
and provide 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional reduced spectra5.
All required calibration frames are automatically associated with
the raw science frames and were simultaneously downloaded from
the ESO archive6. We followed the standard pipeline routines for
the ESPRESSO data reduction pipeline using ESO Reflex. The ra-
dial velocities were computed following the procedure described in
Astudillo-Defru et al. (2017b). A slight adaptation to ESPRESSO
data was introduced to construct the stellar template by combining
the two echelle orders covering a common spectral range. The tem-
plate is then Doppler shifted and we maximised its likelihood with
each 2-dimensional reduced spectrum. The mean RV precision is
0.47 m s−1. The resulting RV observations are listed in Table A1."
2.2.2 HARPS
"We used HARPS (Mayor et al. 2003) on the the La Silla 3.6m
telescope to gather 58 additional spectra (program id. 1102.C-0339).
These high-resolution spectra, with a resolving power of 115,000,
were obtained between 1 January 2019 and 17 April 2019, spanning
89 days. We fixed the exposure time to 1800 s, resulting in a total
equivalent to 29 h of open shutter time. The readout speed was set
to 104 kHz. To prevent possible contamination from the calibration
lamp in the bluer zone of the spectral range, we elected to put the
calibration fiber on the sky."
"Raw data were reduced with the dedicated HARPS Data Re-
duction Software (Lovis & Pepe 2007). The resulting spectra have
a signal-to-noise ratio ranging between 14 and 29 at 550 nm, with
a median of 22."
"We then extracted RVs, again following Astudillo-Defru et al.
(2017b), resulting in an RV extraction consistent with how RVs
were extracted for ESPRESSO (see Section 2.2.1). The mean RV
precision of the HARPS observations is 2.05 m s−1 and the data have
a dispersion of 5.10 m s−1. The resulting RVs and stellar activity"

observations is 2.17 m s−1. The HARPS timestamps were converted
to Barycentric Dynamical Time (BJDTDB) for consistency with
ESPRESSO and TESS observations. The resulting RVs and stellar
activity indices are listed in Table A2."
3 STELLAR PARAMETERS
3.1 Fundamental stellar parameters
"We co-added the ESPRESSO spectra and analysed the combined
spectrum of L231-32 to estimate its spectroscopic parameters. We
used SpecMatch-Emp (Yee et al. 2017), which is known to provide
accurate estimates for late-type stars. Following the prescriptions
described in Hirano et al. (2018), we lowered the spectral resolution
of the combined ESPRESSO spectrum from 140, 000 to 60, 000
and stored the spectrum in the same format as Keck/HIRES spectra
before inputting it into SpecMatch-Emp."
"Using SpecMatch-Emp, we determined the stellar effect-
ive temperature (𝑇eff,sm), stellar radius (𝑅★,sm), and metallicity
([Fe/H]sm), and found 𝑇eff,sm = 3506 ± 70 K, 𝑅★,sm = 0.410 ±
0.041 𝑅� , and [Fe/H]sm = −0.20 ± 0.12. To obtain precise stel-
lar parameters, we combined the spectroscopic information with
a distance measurement of the star based on the Gaia paral-
lax (44.457 ± 0.027 mas, Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) and
the apparent magnitude of the star from the 2MASS catalogue
(𝑚Ks ,2MASS = 8.251 ± 0.029, Skrutskie et al. 2006). For the
Gaia observations, we include an additional uncertainty as re-
ported by Stassun et al. (2018), who find a systematic error of
0.082 ± 0.033 mas. We adopted a conservative systematic error of
0.115 mas and add this in quadrature to the internal error on the par-
allax measurement of L231-32. This results in a distance estimate
of 𝑑Gaia = 22.453 ± 0.060 pc."
"To determine stellar parameters that combine the information
from the apparent magnitude, distance, and spectra, we implemen-
ted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) code to estimate the final
stellar parameters. For this, we defined the log likelihood (log 𝐿) as
a function of the stellar radius (𝑅★) and apparent magnitude (𝑚Ks )
as"
"log 𝐿 ∝
(𝑅★ − 𝑅★,sm)2"
"𝜎2
𝑅★,sm"
"+
(𝑚𝐾𝑠 − 𝑚𝐾s,2MASS )"
"𝜎2𝑚𝐾s,2MASS"
"The parameters 𝑅★ and 𝑚Ks are related to each other through the
empirical relations determined by Mann et al. (2015). These rela-
tions show how 𝑅★ depends on [Fe/H] and the absolute magnitude
𝑀Ks , which in turn is related to the apparent magnitude and the
distance through 𝑚Ks − 𝑀Ks = 5 log 𝑑 − 5. We imposed Gaussian
priors on [Fe/H] and 𝑑, i.e."

"2𝜎2[Fe/H]sm

(𝑑 − 𝑑Gaia)2
"2𝜎2
𝑑𝐺𝑎𝑖𝑎"
"ª®¬ . (2)
For 𝑚𝐾𝑠 and 𝑅★, we used a uniform prior distribution. We"
"then sampled the likelihood and prior from Equations 1 and 2 using
a customized MCMC implementation (Hirano et al. 2016), which
employs the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and automatically op-
timises the chain step sizes of the proposal Gaussian samples so that
the total acceptance ratio becomes 20 − 30% after running ∼ 106
steps. From the MCMC posterior sample we determined the median
and 15.87 and 84.13 percentiles to report best values and their un-
certainties, which are shown in Table 1. We further determined the"
"stellar mass (𝑀★) from its corresponding empirical relation based
on 𝑚𝐾𝑠 (Mann et al. 2015, Equation 5). For both stellar radius and
stellar mass, we take into account the uncertainty of the empirical
relationships, which are 2.7% and 1.8%, respectively (Mann et al.
2015). Since the effective temperature (𝑇eff) does not affect the em-
pirical relations, we adopt the spectroscopic effective temperature
as our final value (𝑇eff = 𝑇eff,sm). We use 𝑇eff and 𝑅★ to determine
the stellar luminosity (𝐿), and finally, from mass and radius we also
calculated the stellar density (𝜌★) and surface gravity (log 𝑔). Inter-
stellar extinction was neglected, as the star is relatively nearby. All
these values are reported in Table 1."
"These values can be compared with the stellar parameters de-
rived by Günther et al. (2019). For example, the stellar mass and
radius determined here, 0.386 ± 0.008 𝑀� and 0.378 ± 0.011 𝑅� ,
are consistent with the mass and radius determined by Günther
et al. (2019), i.e. 0.40 ± 0.02 𝑀� and 0.38 ± 0.02 𝑅� , respectively.
The values determined here make use of a high-resolution com-
bined ESPRESSO spectrum in addition to distance and magnitude
information and are slightly more precise. Similarly, the temperat-
ure determined here, i.e. 3506 ± 70 𝐾 is consistent with the value
determined by Günther et al. (2019), i.e. 3386+137−131 𝐾 , and more
precise."
3.2 Stellar rotation
"We also investigated the activity indicators from the spectra (see
Section 2.2) to estimate the stellar rotation period. In doing so, we
focused on the HARPS observations, which span a longer baseline
than the ESPRESSO observations and which are therefore more
suitable to determine the stellar rotation period. We computed the
Generalised Lomb-Scargle periodogram (GLS; Zechmeister & Kür-
ster 2009) of both 𝐻𝛼 and Na D and found consistent periods
of 𝑃 = 54.0 ± 2.4 d and 𝑃 = 61.5 ± 4.0 d, respectively. We
finally also looked at the full-width at half maximum (FWHM)
of the cross correlation function (CCF), which was extracted for
HARPS observations directly by the Data Reduction Software7,
and find 𝑃 = 57.5 ± 5.7 days. We also searched the TESS light
curve for rotational modulation. The PDC pipeline (Stumpe et al.
2012; Smith et al. 2012; Stumpe et al. 2014) produces high qual-
ity light curves well-suited for transit searches. However, stellar
rotation signals can be removed by the PDC photometry pipeline,
so we used the lightkurve package (Barentsen et al. 2019) to
produce systematics-corrected light curves with intact stellar vari-
ability. lightkurve implements pixel-level decorrelation (PLD;
Deming et al. 2015) to account for systematic noise induced by
intra-pixel detector gain variations and pointing jitter. We normal-
ized and concatenated the PLD-corrected light curves, then com-
puted a GLS periodogram of the full time series. A sine-like signal
is clearly visible, and GLS detects a significant ∼1.1 ppt signal at
57.90 ± 0.23 days. We also analysed the full time series with a
pipeline that combines three different methods (a time-period ana-
lysis based on wavelets, auto-correlation function, and composite
spectrum) and that has been applied to tens of thousand of stars
(e.g. García et al. 2014; Ceillier et al. 2017; Mathur et al. 2019;
Santos et al. 2019). The time-period and composite spectrum ana-
lyses find a signal around 46-49 days. The auto-correlation function
does not converge due to the too short length of the observations,
not allowing us to confirm the rotation period with this pipeline."

http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/instruments/harps/doc/DRS.pdf"
"Given the length of the data, it can still be possible that we measure
a harmonic of the real rotation period. Since the total time series
only spans 3× 27 days, it is difficult to ascertain the veracity of this
signal, but it appears consistent with the values determined from
the RV activity indicators. For completeness, we also searched for
signals in the sector-combined PDC light curve, but detected only
short-timescale variability."
"We explored the possibility of estimating the stellar rotation
period from its relationship with the 𝑅′"
"𝐻𝐾
(e.g., Astudillo-Defru"
"et al. 2017a). However, near the Ca II H&K lines, the HARPS data
set has an extremely low flux (with a median SNR of about 0.6) that
limits the precision of this approach to measure the stellar rotation
rate. We find log(𝑅′"
"𝐻𝐾
) = −5.480 ± 0.238, and estimate a rotation"
"period of 88 ± 32 days from this approach.
Based on the combination of RV stellar activity indicators,"
"and the TESS photometry, it appears likely that the stellar rotation
period is approximately 58 days, which is consistent with typically
observed rotation periods for M dwarf stars in this mass range, i.e.
≈ 20 − 60 days (Newton et al. 2016)."
4 ORBITAL AND PLANETARY PARAMETERS
"We modeled the TESS light curve and ESPRESSO RV data us-
ing the publicly available exoplanet code (Foreman-Mackey et al.
2019). This tool can model both transit and RV observations using
a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) scheme implemented in Python
in pymc3 (Salvatier et al. 2016), and has been used to model pho-
tometric and spectroscopic observations of other exoplanets (e.g.
Plavchan et al. 2020; Kanodia et al. 2020; Stefansson et al. 2020).
Below we describe the ingredients of our model and the procedure
for optimising and sampling the orbital planetary parameters."
4.1 Light curve model
4.1.1 Transit model
"We used exoplanet to model the TESS transit light curve, which
makes use of starry (Luger et al. 2019; Agol et al. 2020) to cal-
culate planetary transits. Starry implements numerically stable
analytic planet transit models with polynomial limb darkening—a
generalisation of Mandel & Agol (2002)—along with their gradi-
ents. The transit model contains seven parameters for each planet
(𝑖 ∈ {𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑}), i.e. the orbital period (𝑃𝑖) and transit reference time
(𝑇0,𝑖), the planet-to-star ratio of radii (𝑅𝑝,𝑖/𝑅★), the scaled orbital
distance (𝑎𝑖/𝑅★), the impact parameter (𝑏𝑖), and the eccentricity
(𝑒𝑖) and argument of periastron (𝜔𝑖); furthermore, there are two
stellar limb darkening parameters (𝑞1 and 𝑞2) which are joint for
all three planets. We use a uniform prior for 𝑃𝑖 and 𝑇0,𝑖 centered
on an initial fit of the planet signals, with a broad width of 0.01
and 0.05 days, respectively, which encompasses the final values.
We sample the ratio of radii uniformly in logarithmic space. For 𝑏𝑖
we sample uniformly between 0 and 1. We do not directly input a
prior distribution for 𝑎𝑖/𝑅★, because this parameter is directly con-
strained by 𝜌★ and the other transit parameters. Instead, we input
𝑀★ and 𝑅★ to the model using a normal distribution with mean
and sigma as determined in Section 3. The eccentricity of systems
with multiple transiting planets is low but not necessarily zero (Van
Eylen & Albrecht 2015; Xie et al. 2016; Van Eylen et al. 2019).
We therefore do not fix eccentricity to zero, but place a prior on
the orbital eccentricity, of a Beta distribution with 𝛼 = 1.52 and
𝛽 = 29 (Van Eylen et al. 2019). We sample 𝜔 uniformly between"
"−𝜋 and 𝜋. We adopt a quadratic limb darkening model with two
parameters, which we reparametrize following Kipping (2013) to
facilitate efficient uninformative sampling."
4.1.2 Gaussian Process noise model
"To model correlated noise in the TESS light curve we adopt a
Gaussian process model (Rasmussen & Williams 2006; Foreman-
Mackey et al. 2017). We adopt a stochastically driven damped har-
monic oscillator (SHO) for which the power spectral density is
defined as"
"𝑆(𝛼) =
√︂"
"𝑆0𝛼
4
0"
"(𝛼2 − 𝛼20)
2 + 2𝛼20𝛼"
"2/𝑄20
, (3)"
"where 𝛼0 is the frequency of the undamped oscillator and 𝑆0 is
proportional to the power at 𝛼 = 𝛼0. The SHO kernel is similar
to the quasi-periodic kernel, which has been used extensively to
model stellar activity (e.g. Haywood et al. 2014; Rajpaul et al.
2015; Grunblatt et al. 2015), but can be computed significantly
faster and therefore facilitates a joint-fit of the transit observations
as well as both HARPS and ESPRESSO RV data. Since we do not
a priori know the values of 𝑆0 and 𝛼0 we adopt a broad prior and
relatively arbitrary starting value, in the form of a normal distri-
bution, N(`, 𝜎) where ` and 𝜎 are the mean and standard devi-
ation of the distribution. We adopt log𝛼0 ∼ N(log(2𝜋/10), 10)
and log 𝑆0 ∼ N(log(𝜎2phot), 10), where 𝜎"
"2
phot is the variance of the"
"TESS photometry. To limit the number of free parameters, we set
𝑄0 = 1."
"Furthermore, we add a mean flux parameter (`norm) to our
model. Since we normalized the light curve to zero, we place a
broad prior of `norm ∼ N(0, 10). Finally, we include a noise term,
which we fit as part of the Gaussian process model. We initalise this
term based on the variance of the TESS photometry, with a wide
prior. All parameters and priors are summarised in Table A3."
4.2 Radial Velocity model
4.2.1 Planet orbital model
"We model the radial velocity (RV) variations of the host star using a
Keplerian model for each planet, as implemented in exoplanet. For
each planet, we model the planet mass (𝑀𝑖) which is associated to
a RV semi-amplitude (𝐾𝑖). The other parameters that determine the
planet orbit (𝑃𝑖 ,𝑇0,𝑖 , 𝑒𝑖 , and𝜔𝑖) were already defined in Section 4.1.
For 𝑀𝑖 we adopt broad Gaussian priors centered on initial guesses
of the planet mass, made based on the observed amplitude of the RV
curve. Although some RV observations were taken during transit,
we did not model the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect (Rossiter
1924; McLaughlin 1924), as its RV amplitude is small relative to
our RV precision.8"
"8 Based on the estimated rotation period of 58 days (see Section 3.2) and
the stellar radius, we find a stellar rotation speed, i.e. maximum 𝑣 sin 𝑖 for
𝑖 = 90◦, of 330 m s−1. Given transit depths of the planets, impact parameters,
and stellar limb darkening we estimate the maximum RM RV amplitude
(assuming the planet’s orbit is aligned with the rotation of the star), to be
≈ 0.5 m s−1 (Albrecht et al. 2011)."
"MNRAS 000, 1–?? (0000)"
6 V. Van Eylen et al.
4.2.2 Noise model
"In addition to the formal uncertainty on each RV observation (𝜎rv,
see Section 2.2 and Table A1), we define an additional ‘jitter’ noise
term (𝜎2,rv) which is added in quadrature. We model this with a
wide Gaussian prior as log𝜎2,rv ∼ N(log(1), 5)."
"We furthermore model the noise using a Gaussian process
model, to model any correlation between the RV observations in a
flexible way. This approach has been shown to reliably model stellar
variability (e.g. Haywood et al. 2014). To do so, we again adopt the
SHO kernel that was described in Section 4.1.2. As the TESS light
curve is modified and filtered, we do not necessarily expect the
photometric noise to occur in a similar way as noise in the RV
observations, and so the two GP models are kept independent."
"The SHO kernel is defined as in Equation 3, where we now
have three hyperparameters 𝑆1, 𝛼1, and 𝑄1. In all cases, we adopt
broad priors. The hyperparameter 𝛼1 can be thought of as a periodic
term. We therefore initialise it based on the expected stellar rotation,
which we expect to be at around 55 days (see Section 4.2.3). The
list of priors is shown in Table A3."
4.2.3 Comparing different RV models
"As outlined in Section 4.2.2, we adopt a Gaussian process model
to reliably estimate the planet masses from the RV observations,
where the GP component is used to model the stellar rotation and
activity in a flexible manner. We assessed whether this model is
suitable for these observations."
"We compared several possible RV models. In the first one,
the RVs are modelled without taking into account any component
describing stellar rotation (i.e. a ‘pure’ 3-planet model, without GP).
This model appears to perform significantly worse at modelling the
RV observations than the models with a GP. Notably, it results in
a fit for which the residuals have a distinctly correlated structure,
and the jitter terms are significantly higher, suggesting a component
is missing from the fit. This is not surprising, as we know the
stellar rotation period of about 57 days (see Section 3.2) is likely to
influence the RV signal. Even so, the resulting best-fit masses are
fully consistent with the GP approach to better than 1𝜎, providing
confidence in our fitting approach and suggesting that L231-32 is a
remarkably quiet M star."
"We also explored models in which we replaced the GP com-
ponent with a polynomial trend instead, where we explored several
different orders. In particular, a third order polynomial results in a
fit where the polynomial resembles a sinusoid with a ‘peak to peak’
period of around 50 days, visually similar to the GP model, suggest-
ing it may similarly capture a quasi-periodic stellar rotation. Once
again the planet masses are remarkably consistent, to better than 1𝜎
for all three planets. Another model, in which we included a fourth
‘planet’ (without polynomial trend), once again provides fully con-
sistent masses; the orbital period of this ‘planet’ was ∼63 days,
consistent with the stellar rotation period found in Section 3.2. We
furthermore explored the specific choice of a GP kernel. For this, we
used RadVel9 (Fulton et al. 2018). With RadVel, we modeled the
RV data using a quasi-periodic kernel, which is similar to the SHO
kernel described in Section 4.2.2, but the SHO kernel has proper-
ties that make it significantly faster to calculate (see Section 4.2.2).
This makes the SHO kernel more suitable for performing a joint"
9 https://github.com/California-Planet-Search/radvel
"transit-RV fit. Comparing the best-fit masses using both kernels, we
find that they are consistent to a fraction of 𝜎."
"In summary, these different model choices all result in very
similar mass estimates, and the use of the kernel adopted here
results in virtually the same results as using a quasi-periodic kernel.
We therefore adopt the GP model with the SHO kernel described
in Section 4.2.2, as this can be calculated efficiently allowing for a
joint fit with the transit data, and as a GP model can flexibly model
the suspected stellar rotation signal in a reliable way (e.g. Haywood
et al. 2014). The resulting RV model is shown in Figure 1. We
further calculated the root-mean square (RMS) of the residuals to
the best fit. We find 1.86 m s−1 for HARPS, and 0.95 m s−1 for
ESPRESSO. These small values confirm the quality of the fit and
showcase the precision the ESPRESSO instrument is capable of."
4.3 Joint analysis model
"We now combine the transit model and the RV model to run a joint fit
of the TESS and ESPRESSO/HARPS observations. To summarise,
this model contains eight physical parameters for each planet, as
defined in Section 4.1.1 and Section 4.2.1, i.e. 𝑃𝑖 , 𝑇0,𝑖 , 𝑅𝑝𝑖/𝑅★,
𝑎𝑖/𝑅★, 𝑏𝑖 , 𝑒𝑖 , 𝜔𝑖 , and 𝑀𝑖 . In addition, we provide 𝑀★ and 𝑅★ to
the model (see Section 4.1), because these values inform 𝑎𝑖/𝑅★,
and because the values are used to calculate derived parameters. A
mean flux parameter, `norm is included, as well as a GP model for
the transit light curve as a function of time, as well as a GP model for
the RV data. The resulting parameters are 𝑆0, 𝛼0, 𝑆1, 𝛼1,𝑄1, 𝜎phot,
𝜎2,rv,ESPRESSO, and 𝜎2,rv,HARPS, as defined in Section 4.1.2 and
Section 4.2.2. A summary of all parameters and their priors is given
in Table A3. We infer the optimal solution and its uncertainty using
PyMC3 as built into exoplanet. PyMC3 uses a Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo scheme to provide a fast inference (Salvatier et al. 2016). As
we found the parameter distribution to be symmetric, we report the
mean and standard deviation for all parameters in Table 1."
"We find that the masses of L231-32b, c, and d, are 1.58 ±
0.26 𝑀⊕ , 6.15 ± 0.37 𝑀⊕ , and 4.78 ± 0.43 𝑀⊕ , respectively. In
Figure 2 we show the TESS photometry together with the best-fitting
transit and GP models. We show a zoom-in on the transits folded
by orbital period and the RV curve for each planet in Figure 3."
"5 THE COMPOSITION OF L231-32B, C, AND D"
5.1 Bulk densities and compositions
"Combining the mass measurements (see Section 4.3) with the mod-
elled radii (1.206 ± 0.039 𝑅⊕ , 2.355 ± 0.064 𝑅⊕ , and 2.133 ±
0.058 𝑅⊕), we find planet densities of 4.97 ± 0.94 g cm−3,
2.60 ± 0.26 g cm−3, and 2.72 ± 0.33 g cm−3, respectively. This
implies that the density of the smaller inner planet is significantly
higher than that of the two larger, outer planets."
"We now place the mass and radius measurements of the planets
orbiting L231-32 into context and compare them to composition
models. In Figure 4, we show a mass-radius diagram for small
planets (𝑅 < 3 𝑅⊕ and 𝑀 < 10 𝑀⊕). The properties of L231-
32 are shown, along with those of other planets for which planet
masses and radii are determined to better than 20%. To do so,
we made use of the TEPcat10 database (Southworth 2011) as a
reference, which includes both masses measured through RVs and"

"As can be seen in Figure 4, L231-32b is consistent with a com-
position track corresponding closest to an Earth-like rocky com-
position (i.e., 32.5%Fe, 67.5%MgSiO3). There are only a few sys-
tems with radii as small as that of L231-32b with well-constrained
masses. The only lower-mass planets with precisely known masses
and radii are the seven planets orbiting TRAPPIST-1 (Gillon et al.
2016, 2017; Grimm et al. 2018). Subsequently, L231-32b is now
the lowest-mass exoplanet with masses and radii known to bet-
ter than 20% with a mass measured through RV observations. In
the range of 𝑀𝑝 < 3 𝑀⊕ , there are eight other planets with pre-
cisely known masses and radii, in order of increasing mass they
are GJ 1132b (Berta-Thompson et al. 2015; Bonfils et al. 2018),
LHS 1140c (Dittmann et al. 2017; Lillo-Box et al. 2020), GJ 3473b
(Kemmer et al. 2020), Kepler-78b (Pepe et al. 2013; Howard et al.
2013), GJ 357 b (TOI-562; Luque et al. 2019; Jenkins et al. 2019),
LTT 3780b (TOI-732; Nowak et al. 2020; Cloutier et al. 2020a),
L98-59c (TOI-175; Kostov et al. 2019; Cloutier et al. 2019), and
K2-229b (Santerne et al. 2018; Dai et al. 2019). We zoom in on
these small planets in Figure 5. From this figure, it is clear that all
these planets have a relatively high density, and appear to have a
strikingly similar composition, consistent with models with a core
composition mixture of MgSiO3 and Fe, similar to Earth, even if"
"11 Models are available online at https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/

"some may have a slightly denser (more Iron) or lower density (more
rocky) composition. However, all of these planets are inconsistent
with lower-density compositions, such as that of pure water planets
or planets with even a small mass fraction of H-He atmosphere."
"Unlike the TRAPPIST-1 system, where all seven planets have
a similar high density, for L231-32 there is a remarkable differ-
ence between the density of L231-32b on the one hand, and that
of L231-32c and L231-32d on the other. Unlike L231-32b, the two
other planets are inconsistent with an Earth-like rocky composi-
tion. Instead, when assuming a simple core composition model, the
lower density of these planets implies a model such as that of pure
water, but it is hard to find a plausible physical reason for why three
planets in near-resonant orbits would have formed with such widely
different core compositions. We therefore consider an alternative
set of models, in which these two outer planets consist not only of
a core, but also of a low-density envelope. This atmosphere, which
may consist of H-He, can significantly increase the size of a planet
even if its contribution to its mass is only minor. In Figure 4, we
show composition models (again taken from Zeng et al. 2019) for an
Earth-like core composition (i.e. consistent with the composition of
L231-32b), as well as a mass fraction of 1% or 2% H-He12. These
composition models are sensitive to the effective temperature of the"
"12 These atmosphere models are referred to as containing H2 by Zeng et al.
(2019), but are identical to what is referred to as H-He atmospheres in
photo-evaporation models (e.g. Owen & Wu 2013). Namely, both contain a
mixture of H2 and He. Here we use the H-He nomenclature."

that can explain the respective locations of L231-32b, c, and d on
the mass-radius diagram in terms of the presence of an H-He atmo-
sphere for the outer planets, and the absence of such an atmosphere
for the inner planet."
5.2 Atmospheric studies of L231-32’s planets
"L231-32c and L231-32d are exciting targets for atmospheric stud-
ies for several reasons. First, as we have shown here, L231-32c
and L231-32d likely have a significant atmosphere, and determin-
ing their atomic and molecular composition will help interpret the
evolution history of these planets. L231-32 is an M3V star, with a
radius of 0.38 𝑅� , which results in relatively deep transits even for
small planets, making them more feasible for atmospheric studies
through transmission spectroscopy. Additionally, the star is nearby
(22 pc) and relatively bright (𝐾 = 8.25, 𝑉 = 12.6). Indeed, the first
atmospheric studies of L231-32c and L231-32d are already ongoing
with HST (Mikal-Evans et al. 2019)."
"Figure 6 compares the atmospheric characterisation prospects
for the three L231-32 planets with the rest of the known sub-Neptune
and super-Earth populations. Specifically, the transmission spectro-
scopy metric (TSM) and emission spectroscopy metric (ESM) of
Kempton et al. (2018) have been used to quantify relative signal-"
"to-noises that will be achievable at these two viewing geometries.
Planet properties were obtained from the NASA Exoplanet Archive.
A brightness cut 𝐾 > 5 mag was applied, as it will be challenging to
observe targets brighter than this with JWST (e.g. Beichman et al.
2014) or using multi-object spectroscopy with large ground-based
telescopes such as VLT (e.g. Nikolov et al. 2018)."
"We consider transmission spectroscopy for the sub-Neptunes,
as their low densities make them suitable targets for this type of ob-
servation. Of the sub-Neptunes with radii 1.8− 4 𝑅⊕ and published
masses, L231-32c and L231-32d rank among the most favorable tar-
gets (top panel of Figure 6). Indeed, simulations for L231-32c and
L231-32d have already shown them to be prime targets for atmo-
spheric studies using JWST (Chouqar et al. 2020). Our new mass
determinations rule out a water-dominated atmosphere scenario,
significantly decreasing the expected number of transit observa-
tions necessary for molecular detections, and Chouqar et al. (2020)
estimate that fewer than three transits with NIRISS and NIRSpec
may be enough to reveal molecular features for clear H-He-rich
atmospheres."
"Meanwhile, the super-Earths with radii < 1.8 𝑅⊕ are unlikely
to have retained thick H-He-dominated atmospheres. Instead, if
they possess significant atmospheres, they are likely to have been
outgassed from the interior and to have significantly higher mean
molecular weights, making transmission spectroscopy more chal-"

"Figure 5. Mass-radius diagram for Earth-mass planets. This figure is similar to Figure 4, but zoomed in on planets with 𝑀 < 3𝑀⊕ . Only a small number of
small planets have masses measured to better than 20%. The seven least massive planets all orbit TRAPPIST-1, and their masses were determined through
TTVs. The other planets, in order of increasing mass, are L231-32b, GJ 1132b, LHS 1140c, GJ 3473b, Kepler-78b, GJ 357b, LTT 3780b, L98-59c, and
K2-229b. Their masses were determined through RVs. All of these planets follow relatively similar composition tracks, consistent with a composition similar
to that of Earth, or slightly more dense (more Iron) or less dense (more Rock). Unlike the other two planets orbiting L231-32, i.e. L231-32c and L231-32d,
none of these planets have a low density, and they are all inconsistent with a composition of a pure water planet or compositions that would include the presence
of a significant H-He atmosphere."
"lenging. Koll et al. (2019) have flagged thermal emission measure-
ments with JWST as a promising alternative method for inferring
the presence of an atmosphere on such planets. The bottom panel
of Figure 6 shows that L231-32b ranks moderately high as a target
for this type of measurement, as quantified by its ESM value relat-
ive to other super-Earths. It is also worth noting that L231-32b has
a relatively low equilibrium temperature among the super-Earths
with comparable or higher ESM values. This raises the likelihood
that if L231-32b possesses an outgassed atmosphere with a high
mean molecular weight, it may have avoided photoevaporative loss,
increasing its appeal as a potential rocky target for JWST follow-up
observations."
5.3 Transit timing variations
"As outlined in Günther et al. (2019), the two outer detected planets,
L231-32c and L231-32d, are expected to produce measurable transit
timing variations (TTVs) due to their proximity to 5 to 3 (planet
𝑐 to 𝑏) and 2 to 1 (planet 𝑑 to 𝑐) resonant configurations. The
expected TTV period is approximately 1100 days (Günther et al.
2019). Further transit observations using other ground-based or
space-based instruments may help constrain the TTV signal of these
planets (Kaye et al., in prep.). Such TTV measurements may further"
"refine the planet masses, as well as constrain the orbital eccentricities
and arguments of pericenter."
6 THE RADIUS VALLEY FOR M DWARF STARS
6.1 The three planets orbiting L231-32 and the radius valley
"As seen in Figure 4, L231-32b is consistent with a rocky com-
position without any significant atmosphere. The density of L231-
32c and L231-32d is significantly lower. This may suggest a much
lower-density core, such as a pure water planet, or a core compos-
ition similar to that of L231-32b with a H-He atmosphere. Here,
we argue that the latter scenario naturally explains the masses and
radii of the three planets orbiting L231-32, and that L231-32b likely
formed with an initial H-He envelope similar to that of the two other
planets, but that this atmosphere has been lost so that only a stripped
core remains."
"Although the existence of water worlds has been advocated
(e.g. Zeng et al. 2019), it is unlikely that the three planets close to
mean-motion resonances have different compositions. Specifically,
population synthesis models tend to favour the formation of resonant
systems that are either all water-poor or water-rich (Izidoro et al.
2019; Bitsch et al. 2019); only in rare cases where initial formation
straddled the water snow-line could systems with inner rocky planets"

troscopy metric (TSM) values for sub-Neptunes with radii 1.8-4 R⊕ and

L231-32d rank close to the top of all known sub-Neptunes and are cur-
rently the most favorable known targets with equilibrium temperatures below
600 K. The bottom panel shows the emission spectroscopy metric (ESM) for
super-Earths with radii 𝑅 < 1.8 R⊕ . This includes validated super-Earths
without published masses, as the mass does not affect emission spectro-
scopy. Of the super-Earths, L231-32b ranks among the most favorable with
equilibrium temperatures below 1000K."
"and outer water-rich planets be formed (Raymond et al. 2018).
Alternatively, a model in which L231-32c and L231-32d have a
similar, Earth-like rocky, core composition as L231-32b can match
its locations in the mass-radius diagram, if one is willing to assume
they contain a H-He atmosphere. These atmospheres do not need
to be very massive, with a H-He atmosphere of about 1% of the
total planet mass sufficient to explain its mass and radius, as even a
tiny mass fraction of a H-He atmosphere significantly increases the
planet size (see Figure 4). The exact planet size for a given H-He
envelope mass fraction depends on the temperature of the planet,
a quantity which is generally unknown, as it depends on a planet’s
albedo, which is typically unknown."
"A bimodality in the size and composition of small planets has
been predicted as a consequence of photo-evaporation in which
some planets can lose their entire atmosphere, while others hold
on to a H-He envelope (e.g. Owen & Wu 2013; Lopez & Fortney
2013). Planets with a H-He atmosphere, often called sub-Neptunes,
are significantly larger in size, than stripped core planets that have
lost their atmosphere, i.e. the super-Earths. A valley in the radius
distribution separating these two types of planets has been observed
at about 1.6 𝑅⊕ (e.g. Fulton et al. 2017; Van Eylen et al. 2018; Fulton
& Petigura 2018; Berger et al. 2018). The valley’s exact location is a
function of orbital period (Van Eylen et al. 2018) and may be largely
devoid of planets (Van Eylen et al. 2018; Petigura 2020). Alternative
interpretations of the radius valley have been put forward, such as
a ‘core-powered mass loss’ scenario in which atmosphere loss of
planets is driven by the luminosity of the cooling planet core (e.g.
Ginzburg et al. 2018; Gupta & Schlichting 2020). In this scenario,
the physical mechanism for atmosphere loss is different, but as in
the photo-evaporation scenario the result is a population of stripped
core, super-Earth planets that have lost their atmospheres, which is
separated by a radius valley from sub-Neptunes, which held on to a
H-He envelope."
"The location and slope of the radius valley as observed by Van
Eylen et al. (2018) is consistent with models suggesting planets be-
low the radius valley are stripped cores of terrestrial composition,
which have lost their entire atmospheres. Furthermore, the empti-
ness of the valley would suggest a homogeneity in core composition
(e.g. Owen & Wu 2017). This appears to be what is observed. L231-
32b, the size of which suggests it is a super-Earth, located below the
valley, is consistent with a terrestrial composition, as are other low-
mass planets in the mass-radius diagram (see Figure 5). On the other
hand, planets with a size on the other side of the valley are predicted
to contain a significant H-He atmosphere, which roughly doubles
their size but contributes only a small amount of mass (e.g. Owen
& Wu 2017). This is consistent with the observation of L231-32c
and L231-32d, the size of which indicates they are sub-Neptunes,
located on the upper side of the radius valley."
"We can further check whether the masses and radii of L231-
32’s planets are quantitatively consistent with photo-evaporation
models, in terms of which planets could have lost their atmospheres
based on the star’s history of XUV flux. However, as this XUV his-
tory is not well-understood, we can instead use the relative compos-
ition of the three planets in this system. Under photo-evaporation
models, L231-32b is assumed to have lost its entire initial atmo-
sphere, based on which we can calculate a minimum mass required
for L231-32c and L231-32d not to have lost their atmospheres.
Based on the parameters and their uncertainties listed in Table 1,
we calculate the minimum mass of L231-32c and L231-32d us-
ing the EvapMass code13 as outlined by Owen & Campos Estrada
(2020). These minimum masses answer the question: assuming all
planets in the system were born with H-He atmospheres and that
L231-32b was stripped of its atmosphere, how massive do L231-32c
and L231-32d need to be? We find (at the 95% confidence level)
the photo-evaporation model requires L231-32c to be more massive
than 1.04 M⊕ and L231-32d to be more massive than 0.44 M⊕ .
These lower limits are not particularly constraining, and the meas-
ured masses are significantly larger than these masses. This can be
understood because XUV irradiation is a function of orbital period.
As a result, a scenario in which the inner planet loses its atmosphere,"

determined by the support vectors. The uncertainty on the location of the valley is determined through bootstrap resampling of the sample of planets. This
valley classifies the planets into two categories: super-Earths below the valley and sub-Neptunes above. Two systems, TOI-1235b and LHS 1140b, were not
classified. The dash-dotted line shows the location of the radius valley for FGK stars as determined by Van Eylen et al. (2018). On the right, we show the position
of the sub-Neptunes and super-Earths on a mass radius diagram together with various composition models similar to Figure 4. Sub-Neptunes are consistent
with a rocky core composition with a 1− 2% mass H-He atmosphere, whereas super-Earths are consistent with being rocky cores without an atmosphere. This
matches thermally driven atmospheric mass loss models."
"while the more distant planets hold on to theirs, is often (though not
always) consistent with photo-evaporation."
"To summarise, we find here that the mass and radius meas-
urements of the three planets orbiting L231-32 are consistent with
photo-evaporation models, in which all three planets started out
with a Earth-like rocky core and a H-He envelope. This envelope
was retained by L231-32c and L231-32d, but stripped away for
L231-32b, placing these planets on opposite ‘banks’ of the radius
valley. In Section 6.2, we investigate what photo-evaporation and
core-powered mass loss models predict about the location of the
M dwarf radius valley, and in Section 6.3, we test these models
by comparing L231-32 with other well-studied exoplanets orbiting
M dwarf stars and determining the location of the M dwarf radius
valley."
6.2 Expected location of the M dwarf radius valley
"We now set out to empirically determine the location of the radius
valley for planets orbiting M dwarf stars. To do so, we first quantify
where models predict the M dwarf radius valley to be. Assuming
the photo-evaporation model, we can estimate the position of the
the upper edge of the super-Earths (i.e. the ‘lower boundary’ of the
radius gap). Following Owen & Wu (2017), Owen & Adams (2019),"
"and Mordasini (2020), this upper-edge of super-Earths is given by
the maximum core size for which photo-evaporation can strip away
the atmosphere at that orbital period. This maximum core size can
be found by equating the mass-loss timescale 𝑡 ¤𝑚 to the saturation
timescale of the high-energy output of the star 𝑡sat; adopting energy
limited mass-loss we find (Equation 27 of Owen & Wu 2017):"

encapsulated in how the quantity 𝐿satHE × 𝑡sat varies with stellar
mass. Adopting the scalings presented in Owen & Wu (2017) of

less certain, although it does increase as the stellar mass decreases
(e.g. Selsis et al. 2007). McDonald et al. (2019)’s analysis of the
empirical stellar X-ray evolution models of Jackson et al. (2012)
suggest that 𝑡sat roughly scales like 𝑀−1∗ from G-dwarfs to M-

"Equation 6 suggests the M-dwarf radius gap should lie at slightly

planets orbiting earlier type stars, while the low power indicates that
the location of the valley is not expected to strongly vary with stellar
mass."
"We can now predict the location of the radius valley, based
on the observed radius valley location for FGK stars. For a sample
with masses from around 0.8 to 1.4 𝑀� , with a median mass of
around 1.1 𝑀� , Van Eylen et al. (2018) determined the location of
the radius valley as a function of orbital period as 𝑚 = −0.09+0.02−0.04
and 𝑎 = 0.37+0.04−0.02, for log10 𝑅 = 𝑚 log10 𝑃 + 𝑎. M dwarf stars span
a wide range of masses. The M dwarfs for which we have well-
characterised planets span a mass range of roughly 0.1 − 0.6 𝑀� .
Even this wide mass range translates into only a modest spread in
the expected location of the radius valley, due to the low mass power
in Equation 6, i.e. the M dwarf radius valley should be located about
65 to 90% lower than that of FGK stars, or at a range of 𝑎 from

6.3 Observed location of the M dwarf radius valley
"The ideal sample of planets to determine the radius valley is one
with homogeneously derived parameters, as was key to unveiling
the radius valley for FGK star (e.g. Fulton et al. 2017; Van Eylen
et al. 2018). Unfortunately, such a sample is not readily available
for M dwarf stars. We therefore opt to use a sample of well-studied
planets instead. As before, we start from the TEPcat catalogue, and
limit our sample to small planets (𝑅 < 3 R⊕) orbiting M dwarf
stars (𝑇eff < 4000 K) with well-characterised radii (better than 20%)
and masses (also better than 20%). Limiting our sample to planets
with precise masses ensures that each of these planets has been the
subject of at least one detailed individual study that has determined
both planetary and stellar parameters. We then checked the literature
for the most precise set of parameters for each of these planets, and
list all of their parameters and sources in Table A4."
"15 Gupta & Schlichting (2020) argue for a slightly steeper than ZAMS
𝐿 −𝑀∗ relation used in the photoevaporation comparison, as core-powered
mass-loss is dominated at older, rather than young, ages, unlike photo-
evaporation."

"In Figure 7, we show a period-radius diagram of this sample of
planets. A distinct paucity of planets is observed at around 𝑅 = 1.6−
−1.8 𝑅⊕ . We determine the location and slope of this valley using
support vector machines (SVMs), following the same procedure as
outlined in Van Eylen et al. (2018). With SVMs we can determine
the so-called ‘hyperplane of maximum separation’ between two
populations, which in this case will correspond to an equation of
the radius valley as a function of orbital period."
"To do so we use SVC (support vector classification) as part of
the Python machine learning package scikit-learn. As initial clas-
sification, we consider planets to be on the lower side of the M
dwarf valley if they are below the known location of the radius
valley for FGK stars from Van Eylen et al. (2018) lowered by a
factor 80% as predicted based on the mean mass of the stars in
this sample (0.3 𝑀�) and the scaling for photo-evaporation (see
Section 6.2). We then choose a penalty parameter 𝐶, which repres-
ents a tradeoff between maximising the margin of separation and
the tolerance for data mis-classification (a high value of 𝐶 toler-
ates less mis-classification). As outlined in Van Eylen et al. (2018),
we want a 𝐶 value in which the location of the valley is primarily
determined by the planets nearest to it, and for consistency and to
facilitate comparison, we choose the same value as in that work, i.e.
𝐶 = 10. To obtain a realistic uncertainty on the parameters of the
hyperplane, we need to assess to which degree the SVM procedure
depends on individual planets in the sample. We therefore repeat
the SVM calculation for 5,000 bootstrapped samples, drawn from
the sample of planets while allowing replacement. We then take the
median and standard deviation as best values and uncertainties."
"Following this procedure, we find 𝑎 = 0.30+0.05−0.06 and 𝑚 =
−0.15+0.08−0.05. In Figure 7, we also show a mass-radius diagram of this
sample, which shows that super-Earths located below the valley ap-
pear consistent with atmosphere-free composition models (‘stripped
cores’) and that most sub-Neptunes located above the valley appear
consistent with models of Earth-like rocky cores with a H-He en-
velope containing 1 − 2% of the total mass. Two systems are of
particular interest. TOI-1235b (Cloutier et al. 2020b), with a period
of 3.4 days and a radius of 1.74 R⊕ is located near the center of
the valley. LHS 1140b (Dittmann et al. 2017), with a period of 24.7
days and a radius of 1.64 𝑅⊕ , is located above the valley but with a
mass of 6.38 ± 0.45 M⊕ (Lillo-Box et al. 2020), its density is most
consistent with not having a meaningful atmosphere. To ensure that
neither of these planets is driving the measured location and slope
of the valley, we exclude these systems from the sample so they can-
not be support vectors. When doing so, we find 𝑎 = 0.30+0.03−0.05 and
𝑚 = −0.11+0.05−0.04. These measurements are remarkably consistent,
with a slightly less steep slope and we conservatively adopt these
values. In Figure 7, we show the period-radius and mass-radius
diagram for our sample as well as the best-fitted radius valley, the
support vectors and lines connecting the support vectors, and com-
position models similar to those in Figure 4. In Table 2 we list the
radius valley location determined here for M dwarf stars, and that
for FGK stars from Van Eylen et al. (2018)."

"From Figure 7, we can see that the radius valley determined
here is capable of separating small planets orbiting M dwarf stars
into two categories: super-Earths located below the valley, consist-
ent with a stripped (rocky) core composition, and sub-Neptunes on
the other side of the valley, planets which appear to have a sim-
ilar, rocky, core, but have held on to their H-He atmosphere which
contains about 1 − 2% of the planet’s mass."
"This separation of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes in terms
of both period-radius and mass-radius space is a remarkably good
match to predictions inferred from radius valley models (see Sec-
tion 6.2). Furthermore, the radius valley appears to be located at
slightly lower radii for M stars relative to FGK stars (see Table 2),
which matches the mass dependence predicted by both photo-
evaporation models (see Equation 6) and core-powered mass loss
models (see Equation 7)."
"While the planets on the other side of the radius valley may
also be consistent with low-density core compositions such as that
of pure water (see again Figure 7), we consider this scenario less
plausible for several reasons. Firstly, although a mix of rocky and
lower density cores may similarly result in a radius valley with
two distinct populations (e.g. Venturini et al. 2020), several plan-
ets have densities so low that even pure water planets would be
too dense, unless some atmosphere was present. Furthermore, the
photo-evaporation or core-powered mass loss scenarios (generally,
thermally-driven mass loss) appear to much more naturally explain
how multiple planets in the same system can end up with a very
different mean density. Under these scenarios, all three planets or-
biting L231-32 formed with similar cores and atmospheres, and the
observed density difference is caused by the inner planet losing its
atmosphere. If the outer two planets in this system were instead
low-density cores, i.e. ‘water worlds’, it’s harder to see why their
compositions would be so different given that these three planets
orbit in near-resonance."
"Other systems that contain planets on both sides of the valley
would further strengthen the thermally-driven mass lost argument, if
their mean densities were divergent too. For most other multi-planet
systems in our sample, the planets are all located on one side of the
valley, e.g. K2-146 and Kepler-26 each have two sub-Neptunes,
while TRAPPIST-1 has seven super-Earths. LTT 3780 contains one
super-Earth and one sub-Neptune, and although the orbital peri-
ods are not near resonances, their densities are similarly divergent
as expected from a photo-evaporation or core-powered mass loss
scenario (Cloutier et al. 2020a). LHS 1140 is more puzzling. The
system contains two planets at very different periods, i.e. 3.8 and
24.7 days (see Table A4). The inner planet is firmly consistent with
being a super-Earth, while the outer planet appears to be located
just above the valley for that period, but its mass would suggest it
is a super-Earth (Lillo-Box et al. 2020). One possible explanation
is that this planet, one of the longest-period planets in our sample,
followed a different formation pathway, e.g. it may have formed
later after the gas disk had already dissipated. At least two other
planets (not orbiting M stars), Kepler-100c and Kepler-142c, have
been found inconsistent with photo-evaporation models (Owen &
Campos Estrada 2020). Finally TOI-1235b appears to be located
near or ‘inside’ the radius valley. Given its mass (Cloutier et al.
2020b), it is most likely a super-Earth that has lost its atmosphere.
As TOI-1235 is one of the most massive stars within our sample, it
is possible that the radius valley for this type of star is located at a
slightly higher planet radius than for the average star in our sample."
"The slope of the radius valley as determined here is different
from that determined by Cloutier & Menou (2020), who found a
radius valley proportional to 𝐹−0.060±0.025 where 𝐹 is the insol-"
"ation. As a function of orbital period, this corresponds to a slope
with the opposite sign as the one determined here. There are several
differences between the approach taken here and that by Cloutier &
Menou (2020). Firstly, the authors used a significantly larger sample
of planets than the one considered here, although one that consists of
planets that are generally less well-studied. The approach to finding
the valley is also different, as in such a larger but less well-studied
sample it is harder to directly separate two separate populations.
The authors determine the valley’s location by correcting the ob-
served planet sample for completeness to determine a planet occur-
rence rate, and subsequently determining the location of the peak
of ‘rocky’ and ‘non-rocky’ planets from which the location of the
valley is determined (see also Martinez et al. 2019, for details on
this approach). As a result, whereas in this work the location of
the valley is primarily determined by the planets nearest to it, in
Cloutier & Menou (2020) the valley’s location is inferred from the
‘peak’ locations of super-Earth and sub-Neptune planets instead.
Finally, Cloutier & Menou (2020) determine the radius valley as a
function of incident flux rather than of orbital period. Here, we opt to
use orbital period, because the very small stellar mass-dependence
of photo-evaporation models suggest this is the observable with the
strongest deterministic power (see Equation 6 and Section 6.2), even
when considering a wide range of stellar masses. A larger sample of
small, well-studied planets orbiting M dwarf stars, may help resolve
this discrepancy, ideally with homogeneously derived stellar and
planetary parameters and precise composition measurements."
7 CONCLUSIONS
"We have measured the masses of three planets orbiting L231-32
using observations from ESPRESSO and HARPS. These planets
orbit on both sides of the radius valley, and we find that L231-32b,
which is located below the valley, has a significantly higher dens-
ity than L231-32c and L231-32d, which are located on the other
side of the radius valley. We find that L231-32b is a good match to
composition models of a planet core stripped of its atmosphere, and
consisting of a mixture of rock and iron, similar to Earth. L231-32c
and L231-32d have significantly lower densities, and are consist-
ent with a terrestrial-type core combined with a H-He atmosphere
taking up only 1-2% of the mass of these planets."
"These findings are a good match to predictions of thermally
driven atmospheric mass loss models, such as photo-evaporation or
core-powered mass loss models, in which planets below the radius
valley have been stripped of their atmosphere whereas planets above
the valley have held on to it. We consider such a scenario more
plausible than one in which the core composition of L231-32b is
markedly different from those of L231-32c and L231-32d, as these
planets orbit near resonances (i.e. 5 to 3, and 2 to 1) and likely
formed around the same time out of similar material."
"Putting L231-32 into context with other planets orbiting M
dwarf stars, we determined the presence and location of a radius
valley and its slope as a function of orbital period. We found that the
valley is located at log10 𝑅 = 𝑚 log10 𝑃 + 𝑎 with 𝑚 = −0.11+0.05−0.04
and 𝑎 = 0.30+0.03−0.05. This location is similar to the radius valley
around FGK stars. The slope is of the same sign and similar, and the
valley is located at slightly smaller planet radii for the same orbital
period, as predicted by thermally driven atmospheric mass loss
models. We also investigated the composition of planets orbiting M
dwarfs, both below and above the radius valley. We find that planets
below the valley are consistent with terrestrial-type cores, without
an atmosphere (‘super-Earths’), whereas those located above the"
"MNRAS 000, 1–?? (0000)"
16 V. Van Eylen et al.
"radius valley are generally consistent with having a H-He envelope
of 1-2% of the total planet mass (‘sub-Neptunes’)."
"L231-32b is the smallest planets with a precisely (better than
20%) measured mass through RV observations, highlighting the
potential of TESS in finding new transiting planets orbiting the
nearest and brightest stars, and of state-of-the-art RV instruments
such as ESPRESSO to precisely measure their masses. These pre-
cise masses will further facilitate the interpretation of atmospheric
measurements of L231-32c and L231-32d, as they are prime tar-
gets for transmission spectroscopy using HST and JWST. Finally,
as L231-32’s planets orbit in near-resonances, the observation of
further transits, from ground or in future TESS observations, may
result in the detection of transit timing variations, which could inde-
pendently constrain the planet masses and further refine the values
reported here."
