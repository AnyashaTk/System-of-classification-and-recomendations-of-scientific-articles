ABSTRACT
"Context. The detection of a super-Earth and three mini-Neptunes transiting the bright (V = 9.2 mag) star HD 108236 (also known as TOI-1233)
was recently reported on the basis of TESS and ground-based light curves.
Aims. We perform a first characterisation of the HD 108236 planetary system through high-precision CHEOPS photometry and improve the transit
ephemerides and system parameters.
Methods. We characterise the host star through spectroscopic analysis and derive the radius with the infrared flux method. We constrain the stellar
mass and age by combining the results obtained from two sets of stellar evolutionary tracks. We analyse the available TESS light curves and one
CHEOPS transit light curve for each known planet in the system.
Results. We find that HD 108236 is a Sun-like star with R? = 0.877 ± 0.008 R�, M? = 0.869+0.050−0.048 M�, and an age of 6.7"
"+4.0
−5.1 Gyr. We report"
"the serendipitous detection of an additional planet, HD 108236 f, in one of the CHEOPS light curves. For this planet, the combined analysis
of the TESS and CHEOPS light curves leads to a tentative orbital period of about 29.5 days. From the light curve analysis, we obtain radii of
1.615 ± 0.051, 2.071 ± 0.052, 2.539+0.062"
"−0.065, 3.083 ± 0.052, and 2.017
+0.052
−0.057 R⊕ for planets HD 108236 b to HD 108236 f, respectively. These values"
"are in agreement with previous TESS-based estimates, but with an improved precision of about a factor of two. We perform a stability analysis of
the system, concluding that the planetary orbits most likely have eccentricities smaller than 0.1. We also employ a planetary atmospheric evolution
framework to constrain the masses of the five planets, concluding that HD 108236 b and HD 108236 c should have an Earth-like density, while the
outer planets should host a low mean molecular weight envelope.
Conclusions. The detection of the fifth planet makes HD 108236 the third system brighter than V = 10 mag to host more than four transiting
planets. The longer time span enables us to significantly improve the orbital ephemerides such that the uncertainty on the transit times will be
of the order of minutes for the years to come. A comparison of the results obtained from the TESS and CHEOPS light curves indicates that for
a V ∼ 9 mag solar-like star and a transit signal of ∼500 ppm, one CHEOPS transit light curve ensures the same level of photometric precision as
eight TESS transits combined, although this conclusion depends on the length and position of the gaps in the light curve."

1. Introduction
"Transiting exoplanets provide the unique opportunity to thor-
oughly characterise planetary systems, from atmospheres to or-
bital dynamics, and transiting multi-planet systems play a special
role. Multi-planet systems enable one, for example, to identify
the presence of orbital resonances among the detected planets in
a system, giving the possibility to use transit timing variations
(TTVs) to measure planetary masses and/or detect other plan-"
"ets in the system (e.g. Miralda-Escudé 2002; Holman & Murray
2005; Agol et al. 2005)."
"There are many additional reasons why multi-planet systems
are of particular interest. The existence of multiple planets that
formed in the same disk places stronger constraints on formation
models relative to planets in isolation, motivating the quantifi-
cation of orbital spacings, correlations and differences within a
system (Lissauer et al. 2011; Fabrycky et al. 2014; Winn & Fab-
rycky 2015; Weiss et al. 2018), and inspiring novel approaches to
classification and statistical description (Alibert 2019; Sandford"

"et al. 2019; Gilbert & Fabrycky 2020). The spacing of planets
relative to mean motion resonances provides information about
planetary migration during formation, as well as later tidal ef-
fects on orbits (Delisle et al. 2012; Izidoro et al. 2017). A sys-
tem’s multiplicity is affected after formation by long-term or-
bital dynamics, whether driven internally or as a result of more
distant undetected planetary perturbers (Pu & Wu 2015; Mustill
et al. 2017; He et al. 2020). Changes to orbits can even affect
the climate of planets (Spiegel et al. 2010). Given that our own
Solar System contains multiple planets, this all helps us to un-
derstand points of similarity and divergence between our system
and others."
"Multi-planet systems also offer the opportunity to study the
correlation between the composition (bulk and/or atmospheric)
of planets and their periods or equilibrium temperatures, particu-
larly when both planetary masses and radii have been measured.
This correlation is a powerful constraint on planet formation and
composition models as the number of degrees of freedom one
can play with in models is reduced by the fact that all plan-
ets formed in the same protoplanetary disk. However, observ-
ing such a correlation requires precise transit measurements and
dynamical analyses (to assess mass values via TTVs or radial
velocity follow-up), which in turn can be more easily done once
precise ephemerides of the different planets in the system are
known."
"Finally, multi-planet systems are ideal laboratories for study-
ing the evolution of planetary atmospheres. This process is con-
trolled by the host star’s evolution (i.e. evolution of the stellar
radius, mass, and high-energy radiation), by the physical char-
acteristics of each planet (e.g. planetary mass, radius, and ini-
tial atmospheric mass fraction and composition), and by the or-
bital evolution of each planet. Within multi-planet systems, each
planet evolved in its own way as a result of its specific planetary
and orbital characteristics, but the range of possible evolutionary
paths is limited by the fact that all planets in the system orbit the
same star. This enables one not only to constrain the evolution
history of the planets, but also aspects of the host star that would
be unattainable otherwise, such as the evolution of the stellar
rotation rate (e.g. Kubyshkina et al. 2019a,b; Owen & Campos
Estrada 2020)."
"The majority of transiting multi-planet systems known to
date were detected by the Kepler and K2 missions (e.g. Cough-
lin et al. 2016; Mayo et al. 2018). Among these, about 60 sys-
tems host four or more transiting planets, but only two have
a host star brighter than V = 10 mag1 (Kepler-444: Campante
et al. 2015; HIP 41378: Vanderburg et al. 2016). The launches
of the TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite; Ricker et al.
2015) and CHEOPS (CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite; Benz
et al. 2020) satellites have shifted the focus of the detection and
characterisation of multi-planet systems towards brighter stars.
While TESS, similarly to Kepler and K2, has a wide field of view
(FoV) that is optimised for the detection of a large number of
transiting planets, CHEOPS is a targeted mission, observing one
system at a time to perform a precise characterisation."
"As of 19 November 2020, TESS had discovered 82 confirmed
planets and ∼ 60% of them belong to multi-planet systems. A
non-exhaustive list of the multi-planet systems discovered by
TESS includes HD 15337 (Gandolfi et al. 2019), TOI-125 (Quinn
et al. 2019), HD 21749 (Dragomir et al. 2019), HR 858 (Van-
derburg et al. 2019), LP 791-18 (Crossfield et al. 2019), L98-59
(Kostov et al. 2019), TOI-421 (Carleo et al. 2020), HD 63433
(Mann et al. 2020), and TOI-700 (Gilbert et al. 2020). Follow-"

"ing the completion of its prime mission on 5 July 2020, TESS
was extended for a further 27 months. This will not only allow
us to re-observe many of the targets already studied during the
prime mission to better characterise them, but also to observe
additional stars for the first time."
"Daylan et al. (2020, D20 hereafter) announced the detec-
tion with TESS of four transiting planets orbiting the bright
(V = 9.2 mag) solar-like star HD 108236. The four planets have
periods of about 3.8, 6.2, 14.2, and 19.6 days. The radius of
the innermost planet (≈1.6 R⊕) suggests that this is possibly a
rocky super-Earth, while the larger radii of the three outer plan-
ets (≈2.1, 2.7, and 3.1 R⊕) indicate that they may still host a
lightweight gaseous envelope (Fulton et al. 2017; Owen & Wu
2017; Jin & Mordasini 2018). From the TESS measurements,
it follows that the inner planet lies inside the radius gap (Ful-
ton et al. 2017), while the three larger outer planets are located
around the peak comprising planets with a gaseous envelope,
hence making this system of particular interest for atmospheric
evolution studies."
"D20 performed orbital dynamic simulations that showed that
the system is stable, though a significant exchange of angular
momentum among the planets in the system likely occurred. Fur-
thermore, on the basis of these simulations, D20 suggested the
possible presence of a fifth planet in the system with a period
of 10.9 days. However, a dedicated analysis of the TESS light
curve (LC) did not give definitive proof. Finally, the bright host
star makes the HD 108236 system a primary target for plane-
tary mass measurements through radial velocities (RVs) and for
constraining the atmospheric properties of multi-planet systems
(D20)."
"We report here the results obtained from CHEOPS high-
precision photometric observations of one transit of each de-
tected planet composing the HD 108236 system, taken almost
one year after the TESS observations. The main goals of the ob-
servations presented here were to secure the ephemerides of all
detected planets, to employ the exquisite quality of CHEOPS
photometry to provide a first refinement of the system’s main
properties, and to confirm or disprove the presence of the puta-
tive fifth planet at the approximately 10.9 days indicated by D20."
"This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the
host star properties, and Section 3 describes the CHEOPS and
TESS LCs. The data analysis is presented in Section 4, and re-
sults are reported in Section 5. Section 6 summarises the work
and presents our conclusions."
2. Host star properties
"HD 108236 is a bright Sun-like star (spectral type G3V)
that is also known as HIP 60689, TOI-1233, and Gaia DR2
6125644402384918784. Between 13 December 2019 and 23
January 2020 (UT) we acquired 13 high-resolution spectra
(R = 115 000) of HD 108236 (programme ID 1102.C-0923, PI:
Gandolfi) using the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet
Searcher (HARPS, Mayor et al. 2003) spectrograph mounted
at the ESO-3.6 m telescope of La Silla Observatory, Chile. We
set the exposure time to Texp = 1100–1500 s depending on the
sky and seeing conditions, which led to an average signal to
noise ratio (S/N) per pixel of ∼100 at 550 nm. We used the co-
added HARPS spectrum – which has a consequent S/N∼ 360
per pixel – to derive the fundamental photospheric parameters
of the star, namely, the effective temperature Teff , surface gravity
log g, and metal content [Fe/H]. We obtained Teff = 5660±61 K,
log g = 4.49 ± 0.11, and [Fe/H]= −0.28 ± 0.04 dex, from spec-
tral analysis, which made use of the ARES+MOOG tools (Sousa"
"Article number, page 2 of 22"
Bonfanti et al.: CHEOPS observations of the HD 108236 planetary system
"2014). In short, we measured the equivalent widths of iron lines
using the ARES code2 (Sousa et al. 2007, 2015) on the com-
bined HARPS spectrum. In this step, we used the list of iron
lines presented in Sousa et al. (2008). The best fitting atmo-
spheric parameters were obtained looking for convergence of
both ionisation and excitation equilibria. For this step, we made
use of a grid of Kurucz model atmospheres (Kurucz 1993) and
the radiative transfer code MOOG (Sneden 1973). We also anal-
ysed the same spectra using the ’spectroscopy made easy’ (SME)
code (Piskunov & Valenti 2017), which uses a different method
and a different grid of models (atlas12, Kurucz 2013) achiev-
ing results well within 1 sigma of those obtained employing
ARES+MOOG."
"It has been suggested that individual abundances of heavy el-
ements and specific elemental ratios end up controlling the struc-
ture and composition of the planets (e.g. Bond et al. 2010; Thi-
abaud et al. 2015; Unterborn et al. 2016; Santos et al. 2015). In
particular, Mg/Si and Fe/Si mineralogical ratios were proposed
as probes to constrain the internal structure of terrestrial plan-
ets (e.g. Dorn et al. 2015). Therefore, we specifically derived
the abundances of Mg and Si using the same tools and mod-
els as for the atmospheric parameter determination, as well as
using the classical curve-of-growth analysis method assuming
local thermodynamic equilibrium. For deriving the abundances,
we closely followed the methods described in Adibekyan et al.
(2012) and Adibekyan et al. (2015). The solar reference Mg and
Si abundances are taken from (Asplund et al. 2009). The Mg/Si
and Fe/Si abundance ratios were calculated as"
"A/B = NA/NB = 10
log �(A)/10log �(B) , (1)"
"where NA and NB represent the number of atoms of elements
A and B, respectively, scaled assuming a hydrogen content of
1012 atoms, while log �(A) and log �(B) are the respective abso-
lute elemental abundances (total number of atoms) expressed in
logarithmic scale."
"We employed the infrared flux method (IRFM; Blackwell
& Shallis 1977) to calculate the radius of the host star through
the determination of the stellar angular diameter θ and effective
temperature using known relationships between these proper-
ties, optical and infrared broadband fluxes, and synthetic pho-
tometry obtained from stellar atmospheric models (Castelli &
Kurucz 2003) over various standard bandpasses. The Gaia G,
GBP, and GRP, the 2MASS J, H, and K, and the WISE W1
and W2 fluxes and relative uncertainties were retrieved from
the most recent data releases (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018;
Skrutskie et al. 2006; Wright et al. 2010, respectively). We ap-
plied a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, setting
priors on the stellar parameters taken from the spectroscopic
analysis detailed above. Within this framework, accounting for
the reddening E(B − V), we compared the observed photome-
try with the synthetic one obtained from convolving stellar syn-
thetic spectral energy distributions from the atlas Catalogues
(Castelli & Kurucz 2003) with the throughput of the considered
photometric bands. From this analysis, we determined the stel-
lar radius and E(B − V) to be RIRFM,? = 0.877 ± 0.008 R� and
E(B − V)IRFM = 0.12 ± 0.09, respectively. These values are in
agreement with those provided in the literature (D20), but have a
precision on the stellar radius of twice that previously reported."
"The stellar mass M? and age t? were inferred from evolu-
tionary models. To obtain more robust results, we considered two
different sets of tracks and isochrones: one set generated from the"
"2 The latest version of the ARES code (ARES v2) can be downloaded
at http://www.astro.up.pt/∼sousasag/ares."
"PARSEC3 v1.2S code (Marigo et al. 2017) and another with the
CLES code (Code Liègeois d’Évolution Stellaire; Scuflaire et al.
2008). The two models differ for example in terms of solar mix-
ture, helium-to-metal enrichment ratio, adopted reaction rates,
and opacity and overshooting treatment. The PARSEC models
adopt the solar-scaled composition given by Caffau et al. (2011),
while the CLES models consider that given by Asplund et al.
(2009). In PARSEC, the helium content Y is assumed to increase
with Z according to a linear relation of the form Y = ∆Y"
"∆Z Z + Yp,
where ∆Y"
"∆Z = 1.78 has been inferred from solar calibration and
Yp = 0.2485 is the primordial helium abundance (Komatsu et al.
2011); instead, in CLES the helium content may vary regard-
less of the heavy elements abundances, or be fixed following
a metal enrichment linear law as above. The PARSEC models
have been computed considering the nuclear reaction rates given
by the JINA REACLIB database (Cyburt et al. 2010), while the
CLES models consider the compilation from Adelberger et al.
(2011). For hot stars, PARSEC models use the opacities based
on the Opacity Project (OP, Seaton 2005), while CLES models
consider the OPAL tables of opacities (Iglesias & Rogers 1996);
in the low-temperature regime, PARSEC complements its opac-
ity database with ÆSOPUS opacities (Marigo & Aringer 2009),
while CLES with the opacities taken from Ferguson et al. (2005).
Finally, the differences on the treatment of overshooting can be
identified by comparing the relative descriptions in Bressan et al.
(2012) for the PARSEC models and Scuflaire et al. (2008) for the
CLES models."
"To assess the discrepancies arising from the use of the two
different stellar evolutionary models, we analysed a wide sam-
ple of CHEOPS targets with the isochrone placement technique
presented in Bonfanti et al. (2015, 2016) considering both sets
of isochrones and tracks. We calculated that differences in age
and mass may amount to ∼20% and ∼4%, respectively. There-
fore, we considered these values as a reference estimate for the
internal precision of the isochrones."
"Then, we specifically analysed HD 108236 to retrieve its
mass M? and age t?. The adopted input parameters were the
Teff , [Fe/H], and stellar radius RIRFM,?. Two independent analy-
ses were carried out considering both PARSEC and CLES evo-
lutionary models. The first analysis used the Isochrone place-
ment technique and its interpolating capability applied to pre-
computed PARSEC grids of isochrones and tracks to derive the
set of stellar masses (M?,1 ± ∆M?,1) and ages (t?,1 ± ∆t?,1) that
best match the input parameters. The second analysis, instead,
was performed by directly fitting the input parameters to the
CLES stellar models to infer M?,2 ± ∆M?,2 and t?,2 ± ∆t?,2. To
account for model-related uncertainties, we added in quadrature
an uncertainty of 20% in age and of 4% in mass to the estimates
obtained from each set of models. The values obtained from each
of the two analyses are listed in Table 1."
"From these values we built the corresponding Gaussian prob-
ability density functions to then obtain the final estimates of both
mass and age. To avoid underestimating the final uncertainties,
for each parameter we summed the two Gaussian distributions
representing the outputs of the PARSEC and CLES analyses.
The median of the combined distribution was assumed as our
reference final value, and its corresponding error bars were in-
ferred from the 15.87th and 84.14th percentile of the combined
distribution, in order to provide the 1σ (68.3%) standard con-
fidence interval. At the end, we obtained M? = 0.869+0.050−0.048 M�"

employing different approaches: they started either from high-
resolution spectroscopy or broad-band photometry to obtain dif-
ferent pairs of (R?, M?). All obtained values agree with our es-
timates within 1σ, except for the M? value that they computed
from the mass-radius relation of Torres et al. (2010), which is
in any case ∼2σ away also from the other M? values obtained
by D20. By combining the observed spectral energy distribu-
tion and the MESA (Paxton et al. 2018) isochrones and stellar
tracks (MIST, Choi et al. 2016; Dotter 2016), D20 find an age
of t?,D20 = 5.8 ± 4.1 Gyr, which is consistent with our estimate
within 1σ."

3. Observations
3.1. CHEOPS
"CHEOPS (Benz et al. 2020) is an ESA small-class mission, ded-
icated to observing bright stars (V . 12 mag) that are already
known to host planets by means of ultra-high-precision photom-
etry. The precision of photometric signals is limited by stellar
photon noise of 150 ppm/min for a V = 9 magnitude star (Broeg
et al. 2013). On longer timescales, CHEOPS achieves a photo-
metric precision of 15.5 ppm in 6 hours of integration time for a
V ∼ 9 mag star (Benz et al. 2020)."
"The CHEOPS instrument is composed of an F/8 Ritchey-
Chretien on-axis telescope (30 cm effective diameter) equipped
with a single frame-transfer back-side illuminated charge-
coupled device (CCD) detector. The acquired images are defo-
cused to minimise pixel-to-pixel variation effects."
"The satellite was successfully launched from Kourou
(French Guiana) into a ∼700 km altitude solar synchronous orbit
on 18 December 2019. The orbit of the spacecraft is nadir-locked
(i.e. the Z-axis of the spacecraft is antiparallel to the nadir di-
rection, see Figure 1) to ensure a thermally stable environment
for the payload radiators. During its orbit, the spacecraft rotates
around its X-axis (the line of sight), and this determines the ro-
tation of the FoV. The angle of rotation around the X-axis of
the spacecraft is called roll angle, with its zero value occurring
when the Y-axis of the spacecraft is parallel to the X-Y plane
of the J2000 Earth-centred reference frame. This plane closely
approximates the Earth’s equatorial plane, coinciding with it on
1 January 2000. CHEOPS opened its cover on 29 January 2020
and, after passing the In-Orbit Commissioning (IOC) phase, rou-
tine observational operations started on 18 April 2020."
"Three observation runs, or visits, of HD 108236 were ob-
tained with CHEOPS (Figure 2). The first visit, of 18.33 h du-
ration, was obtained during the IOC phase using exposure times
of 42 s. The other two visits, with a total duration 18.63 h and
17.04 h, were obtained during routine operations of the satellite
using exposure times of 49 s. The observations were interrupted"

The observing log of the CHEOPS data is presented in Table 3.
We also note that the target location on the CCD has changed
from March to April. This relocation of the target on the CCD
has been done to avoid hot pixels. The project science office con-
stantly monitors the hot pixels status on the detector and if keep-
ing the pre-selected target location implies a significant loss in
the expected performances, then the location is changed."
"The raw data were automatically processed by the CHEOPS
Data Reduction Pipeline (DRP v12; Hoyer et al. 2020). The DRP
calibrates and corrects the images for instrumental and environ-
mental effects, and finally performs aperture photometry of the
target (Figure 3). As described in Hoyer et al. (2020), the DRP
uses the Gaia catalogue (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) to sim-
ulate the FoV of the observations so to estimate the level of con-
tamination in the photometric aperture. This is achieved by ro-
tating background stars around the spacecraft X-axis and/or by
the smear trails produced by bright stars in the CCD, in order
to mimic the rotating CHEOPS FoV. In particular, in v12 of the
DRP the smear contamination is automatically removed while
the background stars’ contamination within the aperture (notice-
ably there is a 4.8 mag star ∼342 arcsec from HD 108236) is pro-
vided as a product to be used for further detrending during the
data analysis. Finally, the DRP extracts the photometry using 3
fixed aperture sizes (radii of 22.5, 25 and 30 arcsec) and an extra
aperture, the size of which depends on the level of contamina-"

"tion of the FoV. In this work we used the LCs obtained with the
DEFAULT aperture of 25 arcsec, which results in the smallest root
mean square (RMS) in the resulting LCs."
"We carefully inspected the LCs, looking for possible system-
atics. It turned out that the stellar flux presents particular patterns
against the telescope roll angle in all three datasets, as shown in
Figure 4. These flux variations against roll angle are likely due to
an internal reflection from a very bright nearby star (HD 108257,
V = 4.8 mag), located 342 arcsec away (see Figure 5). This in-
ternal reflection produces a sort of slanted moving bar, which is
visible in several frames, as shown in Figure 6."

PSF, while the photometric aperture is represented by the red circle. The
horizontal (column number) and vertical (row number) axes correspond

scale is 1 arcsec per pixel."
"The specific pattern of flux versus roll angle produced by this
contamination depends on the location of the target on the CCD.
As reported in Table 3, the (x; y) coordinates of the target in the
first visit differ from those in the following two visits. In addi-
tion, the roll angle rotation rate is not constant with time, and it
depends on the target’s coordinates with respect to the anti-Sun
direction. By observing the same target at different epochs, the
rotation rate of the spacecraft around the X-axis also changes,
leading to variations in the rate at which the slanted bar moves.
Consistently with this, the flux versus roll angle pattern shown in
the top panel of Figure 4 (mid-March observations) differs from
that shown in the middle and bottom panels, which are simi-
lar (both observations were taken at the end of April). With this
in mind, we detrended the CHEOPS LCs versus roll angle (see
Section 4)."

3.2. TESS
"In addition to the three CHEOPS datasets, we included the TESS
data analysed by D20. HD 108236 was observed by TESS in sec-
tors 10 (26 March 2019 - 22 April 2019) and 11 (22 April 2019
- 21 May 2019). Therefore, combining the TESS and CHEOPS
data significantly increases the baseline, enabling us to improve
the transit ephemerides and the system parameters (see Section
5.2). We analysed the TESS and CHEOPS data separately, to
compare the performances, and together, to better constrain the
system parameters."
"We used the TESS data as processed by the Science Process-
ing Operations Center (SPOC; Jenkins et al. 2016) pipeline. In
particular, we considered the Pre-search Data Conditioned Sim-
ple Aperture Photometry (PDCSAP) flux values with their un-
certainties as they are corrected for instrumental variations and
represent the best estimate of the intrinsic flux variation of the
target."
4. Data analysis
"We carried out the LC analysis using allesfitter (Gün-
ther & Daylan 2020). Among its features, this framework al-
lows one to model exoplanetary transits using the ellc pack-
age (Maxted 2016), further considering multi-planetary systems,
TTVs, and Gaussian processes (GPs; Rasmussen & Williams
2005) for the treatment of correlated noise, implemented through
the celerite package (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2017). The pa-
rameters of interest are retrieved considering a Bayesian ap-
proach, which may use either the emcee package (Foreman-
Mackey et al. 2013) implementing a MCMC method (see e.g.
Ford 2005) to sample the posterior probability distribution, or
the Nested Sampling inference algorithm (see e.g. Feroz & Hob-
son 2008; Feroz et al. 2019). In our work, we used the Dy-
namic Nested Sampling algorithm to have a direct estimate of
the Bayesian evidence thanks to the dynesty package (Speagle
2020)."
"Since allesfitter is not able to account for the flux depen-
dence against roll angle seen in the CHEOPS data, we detrended
the flux dependence versus roll angle through a Matérn-3/2 GP
before inserting the CHEOPS LCs into allesfitter. The de-
trending was done using the celerite package, which gives
the GP model and its variance. The GP model was computed
using only the out-of-transit data points. Then, new enhanced"
"error bars have been associated with the data points through er-
ror propagation accounting for the observational errors and the
variance of the GP model."
"Throughout the analysis, we assumed Gaussian priors on
the following fitted parameters: the mean stellar density ρ? =
1.82 ± 0.12 g/cm3, derived from our stellar characterisation, and
the quadratic limb darkening (LD) coefficients (q1, q2), inferred
from the atlas9 models4. In particular, we derived the u1 and
u2 coefficients of the quadratic LD law using the code of Es-
pinoza & Jordán (2015), that performs a cubic spline interpo-
lation within the models according to the same procedure fol-
lowed by Claret & Bloemen (2011). After that, we converted
u1 and u2 to the quadratic LD coefficients q1 and q2 required
by allesfitter following the relations of Kipping (2013),
obtaining (q1, q2) = (0.34, 0.27) for the TESS bandpass, and
(q1, q2) = (0.46, 0.32) for the CHEOPS bandpass5. A 1-σ uncer-
tainty of 0.05 was attributed to all LD coefficients. We verified
that this uncertainty value is conservatively in agreement with
the priors estimated by Maxted (2018), who discussed the appli-
cation of the power-2 LD law to the LCs of transiting exoplanets."
"For each planet, the fitted parameters were: the ratio of plan-
etary radius over stellar radius Rp/R?, the sum of stellar and plan-
etary radius scaled to the orbital semi-major axis (Rp +R?)/a, the
cosine of the orbital inclination cos ip, the transit timing T0, the
orbital period P, and"
"√
e cosω and"
"√
e sinω, where e is the or-"
"bital eccentricity and ω is the argument of pericentre. The initial
priors used in our fits are listed in Table A.1."
"The CHEOPS LCs, both binned and unbinned, with super-
imposed best-fit transit models, are shown in Figures 7, 8, and
9. In each Figure presenting TESS or CHEOPS LCs, the binned
data are shown by combining 12 data points, independently of
the exposure times. In the case of the CHEOPS LCs, each re-
binned data point corresponds to 8.4 min in the case of the first
visit and 9.8 min in the case of the last two visits."

M0 ( i.e.M1 is to be preferred). Reference values ofB10 and cor-
responding levels of evidence against M0 are reported in Kass
& Raftery (§3.2; 1995). Here we just recall that very strong
evidence against the null hypothesis M0 (i.e. M1 is strongly
favoured) occurs when lnB10 > 5."
5. Results and discussion
5.1. Additional planets in the system
"The detected transit-like signal visible in Figure 9 at
T0,f,CH ∼2458970.5 BJD does not show any correlation with the
flux of field stars that contaminate the aperture photometry (es-
timated as explained in Hoyer et al. 2020), nor with background
light, nor with aperture size. In addition, the temporal stability of
the (x; y) coordinates of the PSF centroid suggests the absence
of any PSF jumps, hence no new hot pixels have appeared inside
the PSF area during the observation (see Figure 10). Further-
more, by analysing the raw data, the DRP team confirmed that
this feature cannot be ascribed to telegraphic pixels (i.e. pixels
that occasionally blink and twinkle), nor to cosmic rays or any
spacecraft instrumental metrics."
"Therefore, given the transit-like nature of the signal, we
looked for similar features, in terms of both transit depth
and duration, in the available TESS LCs. Indeed, we spot-
ted a similar signal in the second TESS LC (sector 11) at
T0,f,TE11 ∼ 2458616.04 BJD by visual inspection (Figure 11)."

tive to the flux of HD 108236). Third and fourth panels from top: x- and

ing the reference normalised flux computed considering the DEFAULT

vertical lines, respectively."
"Fig. 11. Portion of the TESS sector 11 LC. Data are binned on a
timescale of 24 min. The red solid line shows the transit model for
HD 108236 f. Neglecting the presence of HD 108236 f and performing
a four-planet fit, the RMS of the binned residuals would be 154 ppm.
Instead, a five-planet fit reduces the RMS of the binned residuals to 130
ppm."
"We applied both a four-planet and five-planet fit to these TESS
data and compared the RMS of the residuals binned on a 24
min timescale within the [2458615.9, 2458616.2] BJD window,
which contains the supposed transit. We obtained RMS values of
130 ppm and 154 ppm for the five-planet and four-planet scenar-
ios, respectively. The lowest RMS value in the five-planet case
shows how the transit model may justify the flux variability; as
a term of comparison the RMS of the binned residuals over the
entire sector 11 is 152 ppm."
"Then, we carefully inspected the TESS sector 10 LC as
well, looking for further undetected signals compatible with a
dF ∼ 400 ppm. We noticed that ∼ 29.5 days before the supposed
transit of HD 108236 f, HD 108236 e is transiting, but the as-
sumption of four planets keeps some additional flux variabil-
ity when the transit model is subtracted from the data points
(see Figure 12). We wondered whether the structures seen in the
signal could be ascribed to a further undetected transit, that is
whether the layout of the data points could be justified by a dou-
ble transit. By including the transit model of HD 108236 f, we
significantly improve the quality of the fit as shown in Figure 13.
Considering the temporal window [2458586.4, 2458586.7] BJD,
the RMS of the binned residuals on a 24 minutes timescale is
137 ppm for the five-planet scenario versus 168 ppm for the four-
planet scenario. As a term of comparison, the RMS of the binned
residuals over the entire sector 10 LC is 158 ppm. The presence
of HD 108236 f also affects the transit depth of HD 108236 e,
dFe. From the five-planet scenario we inferred dFe = 1038+30−28
ppm, while the four-planet scenario yields to a deeper transit
with dFe = 1056+37−36 ppm, as expected."
"The temporal difference between these two transits of
HD 108236 f in the two TESS sectors gives a candidate value
for the orbital period, which also agrees with the transit epoch of
the signal detected in the CHEOPS visit. Therefore, we propose
P = 29.54 days as a possible candidate value."

"Fig. 12. Portion of the TESS sector 10 LC. The solid red line represents
the model of the transit of HD 108236 e considering the four-planets
scenario: a residual variability in the data points remains unexplained.
Data are binned on a timescale of 24 min; the RMS of the binned resid-
uals over the transit window is 168 ppm."
"D20 investigated whether additional planets may be present
in the system and proposed a possible candidate with a period of
10.9113 days, with T0 = 2458570.6781 BJD and a transit depth
of 230 ppm. However, they cautioned that this is only a candidate
because the false alarm probability of 0.01 is influenced by the
detrending method and the detected features might be instrumen-
tal in origin. As the TESS dataset cannot give a definitive answer,
we looked for possible signals of this candidate in the CHEOPS
LCs. Propagating its ephemeris, we would expect a transit of
this candidate planet at T0 = 2458919.839 BJD, hence blended
with the transit of HD 108236 c. We ran a further analysis of the
CHEOPS LC, covering the transit of HD 108236 c considering
a scenario with six planets and compared the results with the
favoured scenario with five planets (null hypothesis), obtaining
lnB65 = −10.6 ⇒ lnB56 = 10.6 > 5, which means that there
is a strong evidence for not rejecting the null hypothesis. On the
one hand, the Bayes factor strongly disfavours the presence of
a planet at ∼10.9 days. On the other hand, the putative transit
would be shallow and blended with the transit of HD 108236 c.
Therefore, further LCs are needed to give a definitive answer."
5.2. Comparative photometric analysis
"We carried out the analysis considering the TESS and CHEOPS
datasets separately (’TESS-only’ and ’CHEOPS-only’ ap-
proaches) and combined (’TESS+CHEOPS’ approach). As the
CHEOPS-only approach involved the analysis of one single tran-
sit per planet, we imposed a normal prior on the orbital peri-
ods based on the results obtained from the TESS-only approach.
For each approach, we fitted the data considering both four and
five planets. The four-planet fit considered the four planets from
HD 108236 b to HD 108236 e already detected by D20, while the
five-planet fit also included the planet HD 108236 f with an or-
bital period of ∼ 29.5 days. Here we recall that, according to our
discussion in Section 5.1, there should be just two transits of"
"Fig. 13. Same as Figure 12, but considering the five-planet fit. The top
and middle panels show the transits of HD 108236 e and HD 108236 f
separately, while the bottom panel shows the results obtained with the
combined model. The RMS of the binned residuals over the transit win-
dow is 137 ppm, which is lower than 168 ppm retrieved in the four-
planet scenario, where HD 108236 f is absent."

proaches, where we tested the five-planet scenario against
the four-planet scenario, are reported in Table 4. The lnB54
Bayesian indicator (which is always greater than 5) strongly
favours the scenario with five transiting planets."
"Supported by the Bayesian evidence, we consider the five-
planet scenario to be the most appropriate description of the
data. Table 5 summarises the results obtained for this scenario.
At first, we performed all analyses considering the orbital ec-
centricity e as a free parameter, as also done by D20. Then, we
analysed the dynamical stability of our TESS+CHEOPS solu-
tion (see Section 5.3 for further details), finding that the lack of
a constraint on e leads to a severely unstable system. Therefore,
we repeated the TESS+CHEOPS analysis setting e . 0.1, which
is also supported by the dynamical stability analysis of D20 (see
their Figure 16). The last column of Table 5 presents our refer-
ence results, accounting for the constraint on e and considering
all available datasets. We emphasise that in Table 5 all reported"
"transit depths are intended to be dF ≡
("
")2
to make them com-"
"parable between CHEOPS and TESS, that is to say independent
of the instrumental bandpass and thus specific limb darkening."
"As a sanity check, we also carried out an independent joint
analysis of the TESS and CHEOPS LCs with the code pyaneti
(Barragán et al. 2019), which estimates the transit parameters
using a Bayesian approach. We imposed uniform priors for all
fitted parameters. We sampled for the mean stellar density ρ?
and recovered the scaled semi-major axis for each planet (a/R?)
using Kepler’s third law (Winn 2010). The joint modelling of
the transit LCs of the five planets provides a mean stellar den-
sity of ρ? = 2.11+0.18−0.20 g cm"
"−3, which agrees with the density of
1.82± 0.11 g cm−3 derived from the stellar mass and radius pre-
sented in Sect. 2. The transit parameter estimates are consistent
well within ∼ 1σ with those derived with allesfitter, sup-
porting our results."
"We further carried out an independent analysis of the
CHEOPS IOC LC using the pycheops6 package (Maxted et al.,
in prep), which is being developed specifically for the analysis
of CHEOPS data (see Lendl et al. 2020, for more details). From
this additional analysis, we obtained values (see Table 6) fully
compatible with allesfitter results, namely with differences
lying below 1.2σ."
"We comment here in detail on the results listed in Table 5.
The first column lists the results obtained by D20, which may
be directly compared to our TESS-only results, given that both
analyses use the same dataset and employ the same analysis tool.
However, D20 employed an MCMC technique implemented
through the emcee package, considered the presence of four
transiting planets, and adopted ρ?,D20 = 1.94 ± 0.16 g/cm3 as
prior. Instead, we employed the Dynamic Nested Sample tech-
nique implemented through the dynesty package, considered
five transiting planets, and imposed a sharper Gaussian prior on
the stellar density of ρ? = 1.82 ± 0.12 g/cm3. Furthermore, we"
6 https://github.com/pmaxted/pycheops
"assumed normal Gaussian priors on the LD coefficients (see Sec-
tion 4), while D20 set uniform priors on the LD coefficients.
Despite the differences, all the TESS-only results are consistent
within ∼1σ, but our results have in general smaller uncertainties,
most likely because of the tighter priors on the stellar density and
LD coefficients."
"The comparison of the results obtained considering TESS
and CHEOPS separately is important in order to assess the pho-
tometric precision of CHEOPS in comparison to that of TESS.
The relative uncertainties δ on the transit depth dF are reported
in Table 7. The values of δ are a function of the telescope ef-
fective diameter, the number of observed transits, the exposure
time, and the transit depth. As a matter of fact, on the one hand,
b, e, and ω are rather poorly constrained in the CHEOPS LCs
due to the availability of single transits with frequent gaps and
this affects our capability of reconstructing the transit model, es-
pecially in case of shallow transits. On the other hand, CHEOPS
guarantees a greater (relative to TESS) photometric precision for
shallower transits than for deeper transit as CHEOPS observa-
tions break through the TESS photometric noise floor (which
limits the photometric precision of TESS for shallow transit). In
the case of HD 108236, one CHEOPS transit observation leads
to approximately the same level of precision in δ as eight TESS
transits for dF ∼500 ppm, which corresponds to the detection
of a mini-Neptune with Rp ∼2 R⊕ around a solar-like star. For
deeper transit signals (∼1000 ppm), one CHEOPS transit ob-
servation leads to a precision on the transit depth higher than
that of two TESS transits, roughly by a factor of 1.3. Finally,
for shallower transits (∼250 ppm), one CHEOPS transit obser-
vation leads to about the same precision on the transit depth
obtained after about seven TESS transit observations. However,
these conclusions depend on the length and location of gaps in
the CHEOPS LCs."
"The comparison between the TESS+CHEOPS approach and
the analyses performed considering TESS and CHEOPS LCs
separately is not straightforward. One may generally expect that
the results coming from the combined analysis fall somewhere
in the middle of the range defined by the results of the sepa-
rate analyses, but this is not always the case. The main reason
is that the CHEOPS-only analysis is not always as robust as the
TESS-only analysis. In fact, in the former we consider just one
transit per planet, with the photometric signal of CHEOPS LCs
that is affected by frequent gaps. In particular, we are missing the
ingress and/or egress phase of each transit partially or totally (see
Table 7). These are the most delicate phases of the transit as they
best constrain the impact parameter b and hence the orbital incli-
nation ip. The loose constraint on b (due to the gaps in the LCs)
and the treatment of e and ω as free parameters (despite only
photometric data are available) increase the degrees of freedom
and hence the degeneracies within the multi-parametric transit
model. This justifies the discrepancies among a few parameter
values, like dF and ip of HD 108236 b or ip of HD 108236 d,
involving the CHEOPS-only approach."
"It is in the combined analysis where we can account for the
numerous transits from TESS (which give much more indications
about the transit shape, decreasing the degrees of freedom of
the fitted model) and, simultaneously, on the exquisite CHEOPS
photometry (which allows the refinement of all the fitted pa-
rameters as the robustness of the transit shape is guaranteed by
TESS). In particular, Table 8 shows the relative uncertainties on
planetary radii derived from the TESS-only approach compared
with those coming from the TESS+CHEOPS approach (e free,
so that the comparison is homogeneous). The improvement on"

"the radii precision can be quantified by factors ranging from 1.2
for HD 108236 d up to 2.6 for HD 108236 f."
"This system will be observed again by TESS in April 2021
during one sector of observations. Considering that the present
day TESS-only results are based upon two sectors of observa-
tions, the number of data points (hence of transits measurements)
are expected to be enhanced by a factor of 1.5 in April 2021. As
a result, once we can account on the entire set of TESS data, the
uncertainties on planetary radii are expected to be reduced by a
factor of"
"√
1.5 ≈ 1.2. As a consequence, the predicted uncer-"
"tainties on planetary radii coming from TESS-only data will be
comparable with those presented here for planets c and d, while
the contribution of the current CHEOPS observations will still
guarantee a better precision on the radii of planets b, e, and f
(see Table 8)."
"As mentioned earlier, we performed the TESS+CHEOPS
analysis considering two cases, one leaving e as a free param-
eter and one setting e . 0.1 as a prior condition. On the basis
of the outcome of the stability analysis, we take as reference re-
sults those obtained with e constrained to be smaller than 0.1
(last column of Table 5). These results are consistent with those
of D20, but are more precise, especially in terms of transit depth
and ephemerides. This is not surprising because, despite adding
just one transit per planet, CHEOPS has a larger aperture than
TESS and the TESS data span ∼2 months, while the addition
of the CHEOPS transits increases the temporal coverage to ∼13
months."
"To give an idea of the refinement obtained on the transit
ephemerides with the results presented here, for each planet in
the system we computed the precision on the transit timing for
the transit closest to the middle of the next CHEOPS observ-
ing window (1 May 2021, according to the CHEOPS Feasibility
Checker7) and compare them with those obtained by considering
the ephemerides given by D20. This comparison is presented in
Table 9. The longer temporal baseline has led to a significant
reduction of the uncertainties on the transit times, decreasing it
from over an hour to a few minutes in all cases."
"For each planet, we also computed the timescale after which
the 1σ-uncertainty on the transit timing becomes compara-
ble to the transit duration, to establish the epoch when we
would likely miss the full transit according to the present-day
ephemerides. Starting from CHEOPS last observations, the ref-
erence timescales for the ephemerides’ drifts vary from ∼29
years for planet f (358 orbits) up to ∼108 years for planet e (2013
orbits). Dragomir et al. (2020) evaluated that ∼ 98% of TESS
target stars re-observed by a follow-up mission nine months af-
ter TESS observations keep their ephemerides fresh (that is the
uncertainty on T0 is lower than 30 min) for at least two years.
In our case CHEOPS observations occur ∼ 1 year after TESS
observations, therefore our results may be comparable with the
ephemerides deterioration estimated by Dragomir et al. (2020).
Similarly to what described before, we computed the time to
be elapsed from CHEOPS last observations such that the er-
ror on T0 becomes greater than 30 min, and we found that
the ephemerides’ drifts vary from ∼ 4 to ∼ 12 years (see Ta-
ble 9), which is consistent with the predictions of Dragomir et al.
(2020)."

5.3. Dynamical analysis
"When determining orbital solutions in multi-planet systems it
is important to verify the dynamical stability of the fitted sys-
tems, to ensure that the fits are physically plausible. Here, we
describe the stability tests we performed for the fits presented in
Section 5.2."
"To test the stability of these fits, we used the MEGNO
(Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits) function-
ality of the Rebound N-body package (Rein & Liu 2012; Rein
& Tamayo 2016). MEGNO is a chaos indicator that can, in
short-duration integrations, reveal chaotic behaviour that can, on
longer timescales, lead to instability (Cincotta et al. 2003). The
MEGNO indicator Γ∼ 2 for non-chaotic orbits, while Γ diverges
with time for chaotic orbits. We calculated Γ for all the orbits
in the TESS+CHEOPS (e free) posteriors summarised in Ta-
ble 5. The stellar mass was taken to be 0.869 M�, and the planet
masses were taken from the atmospheric evolution analysis de-
scribed in Section 5.4 (see Table 10). As we lack the full three-
dimensional geometry of the orbits, orbital coplanarity was en-
forced. The systems were integrated with the whfast integrator
(Rein & Tamayo 2015) with a stepsize of 0.1 d, for 105 d or until
the collision of two bodies or the ejection of a planet. We take
0.5 AU as our ejection radius as a somehow arbitrary, but rea-
sonable trade-off accounting for instability; in fact this value im-
plies an already significant change in orbital elements of more
than three times the orbital separation for at least one planet.
This scenario would produce such an instability that will eject
the planet or lead to a collision, without needing to integrate the
systems until a planet is physically lost from the system at much
larger distances of ∼ 105 AU or until the collision takes place.
We classified systems as unstable if the MEGNO Γ > 3, or if a
collision or ejection occurred, and as stable otherwise."
"In this way, we tested the stability of 54 684 draws from the
TESS+CHEOPS (e free) posteriors. Only three had Γ < 3, all
others either having a higher MEGNO value, indicative of or-
bital chaos, or losing a planet within the 105 d integration du-
ration. This lack of stability can be attributed to the lack of a
constraint being placed on the orbital eccentricity in the LC fit-
ting, resulting in fairly high eccentricities being assigned to the
planets (particularly the outer two)."
"Noting this, and that D20 found that stable fits to the TESS
LCs had eccentricities . 0.1, we re-fit the LCs, this time im-
posing |"
"√
e cosω|, |"
"√
e sinω| < 0.3, and again tested the stabil-"
"ity of the new orbital solutions. The restriction on eccentricities
significantly increased the number of stable configurations, with
21 460 out of 57 323 systems drawn from the posterior having
Γ < 3. These runs were then directly integrated for 10 Myr to
verify their stability: 7 829 of the systems survived for this time.
For these systems, the median eccentricities of planets b to f are
respectively 0.0286, 0.0407, 0.0200, 0.0156, and 0.0234. These
results also agree with what is found by Van Eylen & Albrecht
(2015) and Van Eylen et al. (2019), who show that transiting
multi-planet systems typically have very low (though not always
zero) eccentricities."
"5.4. Planetary mass constraints through atmospheric
evolution"
"As reported by D20, only a few RV measurements are cur-
rently available for this system, thus D20 estimated the plan-
etary masses employing the mass-radius probabilistic model
of Chen & Kipping (2017), obtaining 5±2, 7±2, 10±2, and
13±2 M⊕ for planets HD 108236 b, HD 108236 c, HD 108236 d,"
"Article number, page 12 of 22"
Bonfanti et al.: CHEOPS observations of the HD 108236 planetary system
"and HD 108236 e, respectively. We also estimate the planetary
masses, but following a different approach, namely employing
constraints provided by the system parameters and the range of
possible atmospheric evolutionary tracks realising the measured
planetary radii. To this end, we use the algorithm described by
Kubyshkina et al. (2019a,b), but employ it in a slightly modified
way, as described below."
5.4.1. Model
"The framework mixes three ingredients: a model of the stellar
high-energy flux (X-ray and extreme ultra-violet radiation; here-
after XUV) evolution, a model relating planetary parameters and
atmospheric mass, and a model computing atmospheric mass-
loss rates. For late-type stars, the stellar XUV flux out of the
saturation regime depends on stellar mass and rotation period
(see e.g. Vilhu 1984; Wright et al. 2011), the latter of which is
time-dependent. To account for the different rotation histories of
the host stars, the framework models the rotation period Prot(τ)
as a power law in age τ, normalised such that the computed rota-
tion period at the present age Prot(t?) is consistent with the now
measured rotation period. Following Kubyshkina et al. (2019a),"
Prot(τ) =
"Prot(t?)

t?"
")0.566
τ ≥ 2 Gyr"
"Prot(t?)
("
")0.566 (
τ

")x
τ < 2 Gyr"
"where ages are expressed in Gyr and rotation periods in days.
Equation (7) mimics the power-law relation given by Mamajek
& Hillenbrand (2008) for τ ≥ 2 Gyr, while it adjusts the power
law through the x exponent in the young star regime as different
rotators follow different evolutionary paths."
"The stellar XUV luminosity is then derived from the rota-
tion period using scaling relations (Pizzolato et al. 2003; Sanz-
Forcada et al. 2011; Wright et al. 2011; McDonald et al. 2019).
To account for the evolution of the stellar bolometric luminos-
ity, and hence the planetary equilibrium temperature (Teq), the
framework uses the MIST grid. For estimating the planetary at-
mospheric mass fraction as a function of mass, radius, and Teq,
the original framework employs models described by Stökl et al.
(2015) and Johnstone et al. (2015b). The planetary mass-loss
rates are extracted from a large grid that has been constructed
using the hydrodynamic model described in Kubyshkina et al.
(2018). Starting at 5 Myr (the assumed age of the dispersal of
the protoplanetary disk), the framework extracts the mass-loss
rate from the grid at each time step, employing the stellar flux
and system parameters, and uses it to update the atmospheric
mass fraction and planetary radius. This procedure is then re-
peated until the age of the system is reached or the planetary
atmosphere is completely escaped."
"The standard free parameters of the framework are the x
index of the power law, controlling the stellar rotation period
(a proxy for the stellar XUV emission) within the first 2 Gyr,
and the initial planetary radius (i.e. the initial atmospheric mass
fraction at the time of the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk).
The free parameters are constrained by implementing the atmo-
spheric evolution algorithm in a Bayesian framework, employ-
ing the MCMC tool developed by Cubillos et al. (2017). In short,
the framework takes the observed system parameters (essentially
stellar Prot, t?, and M?, besides planetary masses and orbital
semi-major axes) with their uncertainties as input (i.e. priors).
Then it computes millions of planetary evolutionary tracks vary-
ing the input parameters according to the shape of the prior dis-
tributions, and varying the free parameters within ranges given"
"by the user, fitting the observed planetary radius at the age of
the system, further accounting for their uncertainties. The results
are posterior distributions of the free parameters, which are the
rotation period of the star when it was young and the initial at-
mospheric mass fraction of the considered planets."
"Here we reversed the usual way the tool works, that is we
asked the framework to provide posteriors for the planetary
masses by fixing the past rotation rate of the host star (hence
its activity level) to the statistically most likely value. In partic-
ular, we imposed a normal prior on stellar age, mass, and plan-
etary semi-major axes, according to the values derived from the
host star characterisation and from the LC analysis. To describe
the evolution of the activity of the host star, we fixed the stel-
lar rotation period at an age of 150 Myr to Prot,150 = 5.23 days.
This is the median value of the rotation period distribution given
by Johnstone et al. (2015a), which we inferred considering the
subset of stars having masses in the 0.2 M�-width interval cen-
tred around our nominal stellar mass value of M? = 0.869 M�.
Therefore, we run the framework considering as free parame-
ters the present day rotational period of the star, the initial atmo-
spheric mass fractions, and the planetary masses. The present-
day stellar rotation period is formally unknown (no rotational
modulation signal detected in the TESS LCs; D20), but, having
fixed Prot at the age of 150 Myr, it is constrained by the imposed
power law on the evolution of Prot."
5.4.2. Results
"Figure 14 shows the posterior distributions of the planetary
masses we obtained at the end of the run, while Table 10 com-
pares our results to those in D20 according to the probabilistic
mass-radius relation of Chen & Kipping (2017). Our results sug-
gest that HD 108236 b and HD 108236 c have an Earth-like den-
sity, while the three outer planets should host a low mean molec-
ular weight atmosphere. In general, there is a good agreement
between our results and those obtained by D20, except for the
mass of HD 108236 e, where our results indicate a significantly
lighter planet, though our posterior distribution is skewed such
that the 13±2 M⊕ value proposed by D20 falls inside our upper
error bar. However, we agree with D20 on the overall conclusion
that this planet is a mini-Neptune."
"However, these results have to be taken with caution because
they are based on models and may be affected by our assump-
tions. On the one hand, our results are significantly constrained
by the fact that the framework models all planets in the system
simultaneously, trying to find the solution that best fits them all.
On the other hand, one of the main assumptions of the frame-
work is that the analysed planets have (or had) a hydrogen-
dominated atmosphere and that the planetary orbital separation
does not change after the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Al-
though there is reason to believe the first assumption is adequate
for the vast majority of planets (Owen et al. 2020), the second
assumption is most likely true for tightly packed systems with
orbital resonances (Kubyshkina et al. 2019b), but this is not the
case of HD 108236. Indeed, both the D20 and our stability anal-
yses (Section 5.3) suggest that the planets may have exchanged
orbital momentum throughout their evolution, which would have
also changed the planetary orbits, in turn affecting the evolu-
tion of the planetary atmospheres. From the system parameters
listed in Tables 2 and 5, and from the planetary masses obtained
through the atmospheric evolution calculations (Table 10), we
estimated the semi-amplitude (K) of the RV curve expected for
each planet. The resulting values are listed in Table 10."

6. Conclusions
"We have presented the combined analysis of TESS and CHEOPS
LCs of the HD 108236 multi-planet system, along with the char-
acterisation of the host star. Our spectroscopic analysis con-
firmed that HD 108236 is a Sun-like star with Teff = 5660±61 K
and log g = 4.49 ± 0.11, though it is slightly metal poor with a
metallicity of [Fe/H]= −0.28 ± 0.04 dex. We estimated the stel-
lar radius to be R? = 0.877 ± 0.008 R�, and determined robust
values for stellar mass and age by employing two sets of stel-
lar isochrones and tracks, obtaining M? = 0.869+0.050−0.048 M� and
t? = 6.7+4.0−5.1 Gyr."
"Four planets were identified in the TESS LCs of HD 108236
by D20. We complemented this analysis by adding three
CHEOPS datasets, which were supposed to contain one further
transit for each of these planets. Inspecting one of the datasets,
we serendipitously discovered an unexpected transit-like feature
with a depth of ∼400 ppm that we ascribed to a fifth planet,
HD 108236 f. We derived the Bayesian evidence for a four-
and five-planet model, finding that the latter was significantly
favoured. The combined TESS and CHEOPS LC analysis led us
to derive a likely period for HD 108236 f of Pf = 29.54 days.
Within the context of searching for additional planets in the sys-
tem, we also investigated the presence in the CHEOPS LCs of
the tentative candidate with a period of 10.9113 days suggested
by D20, but we could not find strong evidence supporting it."
"Within the scenario comprising five planets, the combined
analysis of the TESS and CHEOPS LCs resulted in sys-
tem parameters in agreement with those of D20 for planets
HD 108236 b to HD 108236 e. However, our results are more
precise in terms of transit depths (due to the high quality of
the CHEOPS photometry), planetary radii (due to the improved
measured transit depths and stellar radius), and ephemerides
(due to the longer baseline covered by the data). We further ran a
dynamical stability analysis of the system, finding that stability
is maximised when the eccentricities of all planets are smaller
than about 0.1. Comparing the results obtained from the analysis
of the TESS and CHEOPS LCs separately, we found that, for a
V ∼ 9 mag solar-like star considering a transit signal with a depth
of ∼500 ppm (i.e. a ∼2 R⊕ mini-Neptune transiting a solar-like
star), one CHEOPS transit returns data with a quality compara-
ble to that obtained from about eight TESS transits."
"The refined ephemerides we obtained from the LC analy-
sis will allow more accurate planning of follow-up observations
of this system. HD 108236 will be visible with CHEOPS again,"
"with an efficiency higher than 50%, between March and June
2021, at which point the planetary transit timings will be pre-
dictable with uncertainties of just a few minutes. Instead, by em-
ploying the T0 and P values from D20, based on just ∼ 2 months
of TESS observations, the uncertainties on the transit timings
would have been of the order of a couple of hours. We also eval-
uated the timescales after which the uncertainties on the transit
timings become greater than 30 minutes, following the criterion
in Dragomir et al. (2020). We concluded that our ephemerides
remain fresh on timescales ranging between ∼ 4 years (planet f)
and ∼ 12 years (planet e) from the last CHEOPS observations."
"TESS will observe HD 108236 again during the extended
mission in April 2021 within one sector of observations. If
combined with the already available observations, and assum-
ing TESS will collect the exact same amount of transits for
each planet per sector, the entire TESS dataset will help re-
duce the uncertainties on the planetary radii by a factor of ∼ 1.2.
This would imply reaching the same level of precision as our
TESS+CHEOPS approach for planets c and d; however, the
results presented here with the contribution of CHEOPS data
would still guarantee a better precision on the radii of planets
b, e, and f by at least a factor of ∼ 1.2. Future CHEOPS observa-
tions will therefore lead to further improvements in the measure-
ment of the planetary radii, even more so compared to what was
obtained through the TESS extended mission data. Furthermore,
future CHEOPS data on this system will be important for look-
ing for and measuring the TTVs that provide key information
regarding the system dynamics as well as a measurement of the
planetary masses, independent of what given by the RV method."
"We finally used the derived system parameters and a plane-
tary atmospheric evolutionary framework to constrain the plane-
tary masses, finding that HD 108236 b and HD 108236 c should
have an Earth-like density, while the outer planets are likely to
host a low mean molecular weight atmosphere. The brightness
and age of the host star make this an ideal target for measur-
ing planetary masses using high-precision RV measurements.
The expected semi-amplitudes of the RV variations are within
reach of instruments such as HARPS (Mayor et al. 2003) and
ESPRESSO (Pepe et al. 2020) spectrographs. This will enable
us to check the impact of the modelling assumptions and to per-
form more detailed planetary atmospheric evolution modelling,
aimed at deriving the past and future evolution of the system."

"Table 5. HD 108236 system parameters obtained from analyses of the TESS and CHEOPS LCs, in comparison to what was found by Daylan et al.
(2020). The columns labelled as TESS-only, CHEOPS-only, and TESS+CHEOPS refer to the results obtained considering five transiting planets
in the system. All results have been obtained considering e as a free parameter, except for the last column for which e has been set to be smaller
than 0.1. The TESS+CHEOPS analysis with e < 0.1 gives our final adopted solution for the system."

given by Daylan et al. (2020) and obtained from our analysis (i.e. TESS+CHEOPS with prior constraint of e . 0.1). The improvement is due to the
longer temporal baseline of the data we used in our work. The last two columns give the timescales starting from the last CHEOPS observations
after which the uncertainty on T0 is expected to be ∼ 30 min (drift30) and comparable to the transit duration (driftW ). T0 values are given as
