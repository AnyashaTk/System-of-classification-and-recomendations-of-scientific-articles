"ABSTRACT
We report the discovery of an intrinsically faint, quintuply-imaged, dusty galaxy MACS0600-

ALMA Large program, and the redshift is secured via [C II] 158 `m emission described in
a companion paper. In addition, spectroscopic follow-up with GMOS/Gemini-North shows a
break in the galaxy‚Äôs spectrum, consistent with the Lyman break at that redshift. We use a
detailed mass model of the cluster and infer a magnification ` &30 for the most magnified
image of this galaxy, which provides an unprecedented opportunity to probe the physical

1 INTRODUCTION
"Understanding the process of cosmic reionisation, during which in-
tergalactic hydrogen transforms from a neutral to an ionised state in
less than a billion years, represents a major challenge in extragalac-
tic astronomy and cosmology. Although star-forming galaxies are
considered to be the primary ionising sources, those which can be
directly observed during the reionisation era appear to be insuffi-
cient in number given their likely ionisation output (e.g. Robertson
et al. 2015). As a consequence, it is popular to appeal to contribu-
tions from a larger number of sub-luminous sources, which can only
be partially probed via current deep surveys (e.g., Bouwens et al.
2015, Livermore et al. 2017, Bhatawdekar et al. 2019, Kikuchihara
et al. 2020 ). With current facilities, the only way to characterise
the physical properties of this sub-luminous population is to use
the magnification afforded by gravitational lensing (for a review
see Kneib & Natarajan 2011). Although several surveys have har-
nessed the lensing power of foreground clusters, such as the Cluster
Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH ;Postman
et al. 2012), the Hubble Frontier Fields (Lotz et al. 2017) and
most recently REionization LensIng Cluster Survey (RELICS ; Coe
et al. 2019), the effective surface area explored for the most highly-
magnified background sources remains small. As a consequence,
very few high-redshift sources (ùëß ‚â•6) with magnifications ` ‚â•10
have so far been found (e.g., Coe et al. 2013, Salmon et al. 2018)."
"Of particular interest in physical studies of galaxies in the
reionisation era is their dust content. Although dust can obscure the
ionising radiation and lead to underestimates of properties such as
star formation rate and ionising capability, dust masses have been
proposed as a potential way forward in estimating the earlier star
formation histories and hence ages of early galaxies (Laporte et al.
2017b, Katz et al. 2019). It is typically assumed that dust at early
times is largely produced in core-collapse supernovae with a pro-
duction rate similar to that observed in local events (<0.2 MÔøΩ per
event, e.g. Indebetouw et al. 2014). However, little is known about
dust production rates at early times and thus correlating dust prop-
erties of early galaxies over the full range of stellar masses with
stellar ages inferred independently from spectral energy distribu-
tions (SEDs) would be highly valuable. To date there are very few
convincing dust detections beyond ùëß '6 (e.g., Capak et al. 2015,
Watson et al. 2015; Bradaƒç et al. 2017; Laporte et al. 2017b; Mar-
rone et al. 2018; Hashimoto et al. 2019 ; Tamura et al. 2019) and
none for galaxies with UV magnitudeMuv > ‚àí18"
"The ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS - PI: K. Kohno) is
motivated by multiple goals including probing the dust properties
of strongly-lensed galaxies near the end of the epoch of reionisa-
tion. The programme has observed 33 clusters (5 from the Frontier
Fields survey, 12 from CLASH and 16 from RELICS) in ALMA
band-6 (_ ‚àº1.2mm) to reach a 5ùúé lensing-corrected rms of ‚â§ 0.1
mJy over 16 arcmin2 (or 0.01 mJy over the 0.5 arcmin2 for the high-
est magnification regions). In this paper, we report the discovery of
dust-emission from a multiply-imaged lensed system MACS0600-
z6 at ùëß =6.07 behind one of the ALCS clusters,MACSJ0600.1-2008
(Ebeling et al. 2001). In Section 2 we describe the relevant obser-
vational data and the photometry of the lensed source. Based on
three mass models described in Section 3, we identify five multiple
images for this system, infer a total magnification of ` & 30 for the
most magnified arc. Section 4 presents spectroscopic follow-upwith
Gemini-North of several images, and we discuss the physical prop-
erties of this system in Section 5. Throughout this paper we assume
H0 = 70km.s‚àí1.Mpc‚àí1, Œ©ùëö=0.3 and Œ©Œõ=0.7. All magnitudes are
in AB system (Oke & Gunn 1983)."

2 OBSERVATION AND DATA ANALYSIS
"The cluster MACSJ0600.1-2008 (ùëß=0.46) was observed as part
of the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ID: 2018.1.00035.L, P.I.
Kohno, K.) in band 6 frequency in January 2019 with a total ex-
posure time of 3.3 hrs. The data was reduced using the ALMA
pipeline (v. 5.6.1-8) with a natural weighting. A 2‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ uv-taper was
used to maximise the detection of faint sources. The final beam
size is 2.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ 21 √ó1.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ 99 and the rms on the reduced mosaic is 80
`Jy/beam. 13 sources with a signal-to-noise (SNR) ‚â•4 were iden-
tified including one at RA=06:00:09.143 and DEC=‚àí20:08:26.579
with an elongated half light radius of 1.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ 3. By extracting the flux
on a line-free image at 1.2mm using the CASA imfit task, the
peak flux is Speak1.2mm=366¬±62 `Jy.beam"
"‚àí1 and the integrated flux is
Sint1.2mm=484¬±135 `Jy on an emission line subtracted image."
"A search for an ultraviolet (UV) rest-frame counterpart for this
source was undertaken on deep HST images from the RELICS
survey with a search radius of 2‚Ä≤‚Ä≤. The data reduction of this
dataset is described in Coe et al. (2019). Photometric catalogues
were built using version 2.19.5 of SExtractor Bertin & Arnouts
(1996) in dual image mode on psf matched images. The extraction
parameters were defined to maximise the detection of faint objects
(DETECT_THRESH = 2ùúé ; ANALYSIS_THRESH = 2ùúé ; DE-
TECT_MINAREA= 5 px) on a detection picture composed by the
sum of all WFC3 images. The final catalogue contains 25200 de-
tections. To estimate the depth of each image, we masked the bright
sources and measured the rms in hundreds non-overlapping 0.4‚Äù
radius aperture. Table 1 summarises the data properties. Two over-
lapping sources were detected 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ 4 South of the ALMA detection
(Figure 1): a point source (referred to hereafter as ‚Äòforeground‚Äô) and
a background arc-like source (referred to as MACS0600-z6, whose
discovery multiple image is denoted MACS0600-arc, see below for
more details). The foreground source was identified in the public
RELICS catalogue (Salmon et al. 2020) and assigned a photometric
redshift of zphot=0.82+0.28‚àí0.40. The multiple image MACS0600-arc is
absent from that pipeline-generated catalogue, most likely because
of its faintness and elongated shape."
"Noting the overlapping foreground object, in order to extract
the photometry of MACS0600-arc we model each source with a
Sersic profile using GALFIT (Peng et al. 2002) on the WFC3-
NIR and IRAC images, which accounts for PSF difference between
HST, VLT and Spitzer. Error bars are measured on the resid-
ual image in a 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ 4 radius circle. We tested our method on the"

"ACS data where only the foreground source is detected and com-
pared the GALFIT photometry with that derived using the standard
MAG_AUTO photometry in single image mode with SExtractor
(Bertin & Arnouts 1996). In F606W, our extracted photometry
(mGALFITF606W = 26.55 ¬± 0.35) is in excellent agreement with the SEx-
tractor photometry (mSExtractorF606W = 26.72 ¬± 0.08). A similar conclu-
sion is seen for the F814W image."
"To increase the wavelength coverage, we searched for deep
public data at longer wavelength. Using the ESO archive, we found
a deep Ks exposure carried out with HAWKI/VLT (ID: 0100.A-
785, P.I. : A. Edge) reaching a 2ùúé depth in 1.2‚Äù radius aperture of
24.4. We also searched in the Spitzer archive for deep IRAC 3.6 and
4.5 `m exposures. This cluster was part of two observing programs
(ID: 90218, P.I. : E. Egami and ID: 12005, P.I. : M. Bradac), we
combined all exposures and measured the depth in a 1.2‚Äù radius
aperture distributed over the field of view. We present the final
photometry in Table 3."
"We determine the photometric redshift of the foreground
source from a template based SED-fitting method with Hyperz
(Bolzonella et al. 2000). We used the standard list of templates
including evolutionary SEDs with Chabrier IMF (Chabrier 2003)
and solar metallicity from Bruzual & Charlot (2003), empirical
SEDs built by Coleman et al. (1980) and two starburst galaxies
from Kinney et al. (1996). We then searched for a solution between
0 < ùëß < 8, with an extinction range 0.0 < Av < 3.0 mag assuming
a Calzetti reddening law (Calzetti et al. 2000). The colour of the
foreground source is similar to the colour of cluster members, we
therefore allow a redshift range of ùëß ‚àà [0.0:3.0]. The best SED-fit
for the foreground source is obtained at zphot = 0.57+0.14‚àí0.17 and mod-
est reddening (Av=1.5mag). Allowing a larger redshift range, the
MACS0600-arc data provides a solution at ùëßùëù‚Ñéùëúùë°ùëú=6.68+0.24‚àí0.67 with
an extinctionAv=0.5mag, broadly consistent with the spectroscopic
value (Figure 2)."
3 LENS MODELS AND MULTIPLE IMAGES
"The elongated shape of the prominent ùëß ‚àº 6 arc supports the
suggestion of a strongly lensed source. To determine the lensing
configuration and hence the intrinsic properties of this source and
the associated uncertainties, we have utilised several different lens
models from within the ALCS team. These models exploit spectro-
scopic observations of MACS0600 using the MUSE integral field
unit spectrograph (ID 0100.A-0792, PI: Edge) and the photometric
redshift catalogue fromRELICS.More details on the lensmodelling
of MACS0600 will be given in a separate paper (in preparation),
and here we provide only a brief summary. For convenience in this
section we drop the prefix MACS0600 in describing the multiple
images."
The three models used here are produced using GLAFIC
"Figure 2. Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of MACS0600-z6 showing
the best-fit from MAGPHYS and the best physical properties corrected for
magnification."
"(Oguri 2010), Lenstool (Jullo et al. 2007), and Light-Traces-Mass
(LTM; Zitrin et al. 2015). The first two models can be regarded as
parametric, in the sense that both the galaxies and their dark matter
halos are described using independent analytic forms (e.g., com-
binations of pseudo isothermal elliptical mass distributions) and
adopt empirical scaling relations for cluster members. The LTM
method is similar, but here the dark matter is assumed to follow the
light distribution and thus is modeled as a smoothed version of the
luminosity-weighted galaxy distribution. The parametric modeling
of MACS0600 typically included three to four dark matter halos
and, whereas for the LTM models, the masses of several bright
cluster members were modeled independently. All models are mini-
mized using available multiple image constraints to find the best-fit
solution and its associated errors. Four modellers (MO, JR, GC,
AZ) voted on the choice of multiply-imaged systems which, besides
the ùëß ‚àº 6 system, included nine other systems considered as secure.
Five of these have a spectroscopic redshift from MUSE (spanning
the redshift range ùëß ‚àº1.5 to ùëß ‚àº5.5). All three models indicate that
the source MACS0600-z6 is quintuply imaged with the discovery
arc (images z6.1 and z6.2) being a pair of multiple images that
merge across the critical curve; an additional counter image inside
the tangential critical curves (z6.3); a radial image (z6.4); and a"
"MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì10 (2015)"

"fifth image on the other side of the cluster to the west (z6.5). The
stamps of the 5 images are shown in Fig. 3, and the configuration
derived from the LTM model for example, including all five mul-
tiple images, is shown on a HST image of the cluster in Fig. 4. To
confirm the reliability of this system, we first check that the colors
are similar for the 4 images within the error bars. We only include
one of the fifth image candidates in this analysis (z6.5c) because
HST coverage is missing for the other two. Colors measured on
WFC3 images are similar with averaged values of F125W-F160W
= 0.32¬±0.15. Another relevant feature that should be conserved by
lensing is the surface brightness. We estimated the surface bright-
ness of the 4 images using the extracted magnitude from GALFIT
for the arc and z6.3a,b and from our SExtractor catalogues for the
remaining objects using the MAG_AUTO and the isophotal area.
All images have consistent surface brightness in the WFC3 images
(e.g. the averaged value on F160W is 21.9¬±0.3) reinforcing the
multiple images system hypothesis."
"In addition to the detection arc, two out of the three other pre-
dicted images, z6.3 and radial image z6.4, were easily identified
in both the HST and ALMA data. These images lie within < 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ 4
of their predicted locations and have photometric redshifts similar
to that estimated for MACS0600-arc. In the HST data, image z6.3
consists of a bright ""bulge"" referred to here as z6.3a and an ad-
ditional faint component z6.3b which, according to the three lens
models, is likely the multiply-imaged counterpart of the arc, and on
which the ALMA signal is centered. It is unclear whether image
z6.3a is truly part of the lensed source despite not being quintuply
imaged as well, and ‚Äì while we acknowledge the possibility that
z6.3a may be related ‚Äì we consider only z6.3b a genuine multi-
ple image of this system. In the ALMA data, z6.3b also shows a
faint dust detection with a S/N‚àº3.5 (fpeak = 226 ¬± 63`Jy.beam‚àí1
as measured with imfit). The 1.2mm flux ratio between 1.3b and
the arc is 0.62+0.33‚àí0.24 in excellent agreement with ratios observed in
the near infrared and with the predicted lens-model magnifications
(see below). [CII]158`m emission lines at ùëß = 6.07 are detected in
all images of this system that are covered by ALMA‚Äôs FOV: the arc,
z6.3b and z6.4, strengthening further the adopted lensing configura-
tion, again with line ratios that commensurate with the expectations
from the lens models. More extensive details on these detections
are given in a companion paper (Fujimoto et al., submitted)."
"While all models reassuringly agree on the positions of the five
multiple images, there is larger scatter (‚àº12‚Ä≤‚Ä≤) in the predicted loca-
tion of the fifth image, z6.5. The GLAFIC and LTMmodels predict
image z6.5 lies outside the region covered by WFC3 data, making
its identification more challenging, and two objects undetected on
the ACS images but seen on the HAWK-I data are considered as
potential candidates (z6.5a and z6.5b). The Lenstool model pre-
dicts the fifth image within the WFC3 field, and one clear dropout
is identified as a potential candidate using the ACS, WFC3 and
HAWK-I data (MACS0600-z6.5c)."
"Magnification factors ` for the five images were estimated
as follows. The two parametric models (Lenstool and GLAFIC)
extracted values by first planting a compact source in the expected
position, and adjusting its exact position with respect to the critical
curves to match the observed [CII] 158 `m line flux ratio. The LTM
magnification values were derived in a slightly different manner:
here the source was not planted in the source plane but formed there
by directly delensing the arc, and the magnification of the arc was
then extracted by comparing the model‚Äôs prediction for the three
other multiple image sizes with their absolute magnification values.
The magnification for the five images from the GLAFIC model is
` ‚àº 33 for the arc, ` ‚àº 35 for z6.3, ` ‚àº 5.7 for z6.4 and ` ‚àº 14"
"for z6.5. The Lenstool model yields ` ‚àº 22.1 for the arc, ` ‚àº 14
for z6.3, ` ‚àº 2.1 for z6.4 and ` ‚àº 2.9 for z6.5. The LTM model
magnifications are ` ‚àº 31.2 for the arc, ` ‚àº 13.5 for z6.3, ` ‚àº 2.1
for z6.4 and ` ‚àº 3.8 for z6.5. We note that the magnifications for
the arc are likely lower limits. If the magnification for the arc is
instead estimated by directly averaging the magnification next to
the critical curves, or alternatively by comparing the area of the
arc to its delensed size, values around ` ‚àº 150 ‚àí 200 are obtained,
although such estimates are typically more uncertain."
"We also take benefit from the detection of the dust continuum
in two of the multiple images (z6.3 and the arc) to estimate the
physical offset between the FIR continuum and the UV continuum.
The position of the UV continuum was estimated on the F160W
image using the centroid of the counterpart. In the image plan we
measured an observed offset of 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤24 and 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤35 respectively for
z6.3b and the arc. Accounting for the magnification, we estimate a
physical offset of <0.4 kpc."
4 SPECTROSCOPIC FOLLOW-UP
"The detection of an emission linewithin theALMAband 6 datacube
suggests a redshift ùëßùë†ùëùùëíùëê=6.07, assuming the line is [CII]158`m
(Fujimoto et al. submitted). However, with only one line detected,
a low/intermediate redshift interloper cannot be excluded. The rel-
atively shallow MUSE data used to constrain the mass models did
not show any features for the multiple-images of this system. There-
fore we conducted a spectroscopic follow-up campaign with the
Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS - Hook et al. 2004)
installed on Gemini-North on three images of the system, namely
MACS0600-arc, MACS0600-z6.3a and MACS0600-z6.4. Obser-
vations were done in service mode on the 18ùë°‚Ñé and 19ùë°‚Ñé October
2020 (ID : GN-2020B-Q-903 ; P.I. : A. Zitrin). We secured 4.5hrs
reaching a 1-sigma sensitivity of 8.9√ó10‚àí19 erg/s/cm2 over the
wavelength range 505nm to 980nm. We reduced the data using the
Gemini IRAF package, as recommended by the instrument team.
We follow the standard reduction procedure including bias subtrac-
tion, flat fielding, wavelength calibration from the illumination of
our mask by the CuAr lamp and flux calibration from the white
dwarf Wolf 1346."
"Interestingly, the continuum of the more compact and brightest
image (MACS0600-z6.3a) is visible on the Gemini spectra. We
extracted the spectrum in a 1.5√óseeing diameter aperture and a break
is clearly identified between 850nm and 900nm. To improve the
signal, we binned the spectra in the spectral direction with a binning
factor of 30 (see Figure 5).We determined the spectroscopic redshift
by fitting our observed spectra with a stacked spectra coming from
81 LBGs (Jones et al. 2012). We searched for the best-fit using a
ùúí2 minimization technique over a redshift range between ùëß =0 and
ùëß = 8. The best fit is found at ùëßùë†ùëùùëíùëê=6.19+0.06‚àí0.16, consistent with both
the photometric redshift and the [CII]158`m emission line detected
in the ALMA data. One can also argue that if the break seen in the
Gemini data is the Balmer Break at ùëß ‚àº1.1 instead of the Lyman
Break at ùëß ‚àº6, we would have detected the [OII]3727,3729 doublet,
which makes the high-redshift identification for this system robust.
Moreover, after a careful visual inspection of the 2D spectra, no
emission line is detected in any of the 3 images allowing us to place
a firm upper limit on the Ly-ùõº luminosity in this ùëß ‚àº6 system at
L(Ly-ùõº, 2ùúé) < 2.4√ó1042 erg/s, corresponding to a rest-frame EWof
<113√Ö /` and EW<3.6√Ö assuming a magnification factor of `=31."

5 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES
"We determine the intrinsic (lensing-corrected) physical properties
for those two images with a clear dust detection (MACS0600-arc
and MACS0600-z6.3b) usingMAGPHYS (da Cunha et al. 2008a),
which includes FIR models to fit the dust properties, while we use
BAGPIPES (Carnall et al. 2018) to provide constraints for the re-
maining images. For the BAGPIPES runs, we assume a constant
Star Formation History (SFH) with a stellar mass ranging from 106
to 1012 MÔøΩ , and an age ranging from 0.0 Gyr to the age of the Uni-
verse at ùëß = 6.07 . For each image we adopt the magnification from
the LTMmodel, based upon the spectroscopic redshift, although as
seen in the previous section the magnifications from the three mod-
els seem to agree fairly well. Reassuringly, we determine that all
images have similar properties. Excluding imageMACS0600-z6.3a,
which does not seem to contribute significantly to the flux compared
to MACS0600-z6.3b, the mean stellar mass is 2.9+11.5‚àí2.3 √ó10"
"9MÔøΩ ,
the mean SFR is 9.7+23.0‚àí6.6 MÔøΩ/yr and the mean dust mass (com-
puted only from images MACS0600-arc and MACS0600-z6.3b) is
4.8+4.5‚àí3.4 √ó10"
"6MÔøΩ , where error bars take into account uncertainties
on the magnification factor. The latter is obtained assuming a dust
temperature of 30K, a dust emissivity of ùõΩ=2.0 and the mean mag-
nification. Including Herschel/SPIRE 3ùúéupper limit(13.9mJy/` at
250`m), we can rule out Tùëëùë¢ùë†ùë° ‚â•85K (Sun et al. in prep). We mea-
sure the UV slopes of all images from the best SED-fit and find an
average ùõΩ=‚àí1.66¬±0.08. We follow the method described in Oesch
et al. (2010) to determine the size of this galaxy, taking into account
the SExtractor half light radius and the Hubble PSF. We apply this
method on z6.4 since this image is not blended with other sources.
After correcting for magnification, we find an intrinsic size of 0.‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ 10
corresponding to 0.54+0.26‚àí0.14 kpc at ùëß ‚àº6.07, in good agreement with
previous size estimates at these redshifts (Bouwens et al. 2017,
Kawamata et al. 2018). The individual properties of each image are
summarised in Table 2."

"Figure 6. Dust to stellar mass ratio as a function of the stellar mass. The red
dot shows the properties of MACS0600-z6, blue dots represent previously
observed galaxies with dust constraints (detections or upper limits) with a
spectroscopic redshift between ùëß ‚àº6 and 7 (Schaerer et al. 2015, Kanekar
et al. 2013,Ouchi et al. 2013,Marrone et al. 2018, Bradaƒç et al. 2017, Laporte
et al. 2017a, Knudsen et al. 2016, Smit et al. 2018). Black dots show lower
redshift galaxies at ùëß ‚àº1.5-3.5 (DudzeviƒçiuÃÑteÃá et al. 2020,Sklias et al. 2014).
The ratio for MACS0600-z6 is fairly high for its redshift, indicating either
that it is relatively old or that its dust production was unusually efficient. The
green circle shows the position of MAMBO-9, a sub-mm galaxy with an
extreme dust to stellar mass ratio at ùëß = 5.9 (Casey et al. 2019); the distinct
natures of these two galaxies (sub-mm vs LBG) makes a comparison of their
dust production efficiency difficult. The red dashed arrow shows the direction
in parameter space that the LBG would move when taking into account high
dust temperature (T=85K) and uncertainties on the magnification.."
"We can compare the above results forMACS0600-z6 to similar
spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at ùëß ‚àº6-7 (either a detection
or upper limit) in the literature (Schaerer et al. 2015, Kanekar et al.
2013, Ouchi et al. 2013, Marrone et al. 2018, Bradaƒç et al. 2017,
Knudsen et al. 2016, Smit et al. 2018). Most of these galaxies have
upper limits on their dust content, emphasising the importance of
MACS0600-z6. Despite its modest stellar mass, its dust to stellar"
"MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì10 (2015)"
Dusty lensed system at ùëß ‚â•6 7
"mass ratio is somewhat larger than that observed in other ùëß ‚àº6 galax-
ies (Figure 6). This implies either that MACS0600-z6 is already a
relatively mature system or that its dust production was unusually
efficient. We can provide an independent estimate of the stellar age
via the amplitude of the Balmer Break (see e.g. Scoville et al. 2016).
This requires comparing the fluxes in the F160W and 4.5`m bands,
since the 3.6`m band could be contaminated by strong [O III] emis-
sion (Labb√© et al. 2013). Following the methodology discussed in
Roberts-Borsani et al. (2020), we estimate an age of 200¬±100 Myr,
indicative of a formation redshift of ùëßform=7.2+0.8‚àí0.6, comparable to
values estimated for the other ùëß ‚àº6 galaxies cited above. This rel-
atively young age would suggest that most of the dust detected by
ALMA maybe produced by early core-collapse supernovae (SNe)
(Gall et al. 2011). Assuming a Chabrier (Chabrier 2003) IMF for the
production rate of SNe, for the measured dust mass and stellar age,
each SN would have produced 0.3+0.5‚àí0.2 MÔøΩ of dust. Although this
estimate is highly uncertain given the uncertain production rate of
SNe in early metal poor galaxies and possible dust destruction and
ejection processes in lowmass galaxies at high redshift, it is perhaps
somewhat larger than that derived locally (<0.2 MÔøΩ , see e.g. Cher-
chneff & Dwek 2010, Indebetouw et al. 2014, Gomez et al. 2012,
Gall et al. 2011). Recent chemical evolution models predict dust-
to-mass ratios similar to that observed for MACS0600-z6 could be
achieved in ‚â§200Myr (Calura et al. 2017). Even higher values have
also been observed recently in MAMBO-9 (Casey et al. 2019), an
intensely star-forming sub-mm galaxy whose properties are other-
wise quite distinct from those ofMACS0600-z6. Applying the same
method, MAMBO-9 may be even more efficient to produce dust,
but the different nature of these two objects makes the comparison
of their dust production efficiency difficult."
"The ratio between the IR and UV luminosity, often referred
to as IRX=log(ùêøùêº ùëÖ/LUV), can be compared to the UV continuum
slope ùõΩ to offer insight into the dust extinction law at early cos-
mic epochs. Bouwens et al. (2016) found that ùëß > 4 galaxies with
log[ùëÄ‚òÖ <9.75] (comparable to MACS0600-z6) may have extinc-
tion laws that deviate from both the Calzetti et al. (2000) and SMC
relations, in the sense of having lower IRXvalues. They argued that a
higher dust temperature may explain this difference. Although there
is some evidence for higher dust temperatures at ùëß ‚â•8 (Behrens
et al. 2018, Laporte et al. 2019, Bakx et al. 2020), there is cur-
rently no strong evidence for evolution at ùëß ‚àº6 (e.g., Schreiber et al.
2018;Faisst et al. 2020). Assuming a dust temperature of 35K to
estimate the IR luminosity of MACS0600-z6 and the other ùëß ‚àº6
galaxies, Figure 7 shows that most ùëß ‚àº6 galaxies follow the Calzetti
law."
6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
"Recent studies have suggesteded that the dust temperature may be
higher at high-redshift than what is measured at lower redshift. Ob-
taining an accurate measurement of the dust temperature in high-
redshift galaxies requires to constrain the red slope and the peak
of the FIR emission (see Figure 1 of da Cunha et al. 2008b). The
evolution of the dust temperature with redshift can be studied at
intermediate redshift combining data from Herschel and ALMA.
Schreiber et al. (2018) demonstrate that the dust temperature goes
from 25K at ùëß ‚â§1 up to 40K at ùëß ‚àº5. At ùëß ‚â•7 few sources have
been observed at multiple sub-mmwavelengths (Watson et al. 2015,
Knudsen et al. 2017, Tamura et al. 2019, Bakx et al. 2020, Laporte
et al. 2017b, Laporte et al. 2019). They all estimate a dust tem-
perature at ùëß ‚â•7 above the ""standard"" value of 30K observed at"
"Figure 7. The IR/UV luminosity ratio IRX as a function of the UV slope
ùõΩ. Black points represent galaxies at ùëß ‚â•7, blue points are ùëß ‚àº6 galaxies
and the red circle shows MACS0600-z6. All values are computed assuming
a dust temperature of 35K. The expected trend assuming the Calzetti et al.
(2000) and SMC laws are shown."
"low-redshift, but deeper data at _ ‚â•1mm are needed. Recent theo-
retical models suggest that the dust temperature in ùëß ‚â•5 galaxies is
ùëáùëëùë¢ùë†ùë°=45K for 0.1`m grain, and could reach as high temperature
as ùëáùëëùë¢ùë†ùë° ‚â•60K for smaller grains (Ferrara et al. 2017). In view of
this, we explore whether a higher dust temperature would change
our conclusions. For a temperature of 85K, the estimated dust mass
would decrease to ùëÄùëëùë¢ùë†ùë°=6.3+1.63.6 √ó10"
"6MÔøΩ , and its dust-to-stellar
mass ratio will be comparable to previous findings at high-redshift.
Further ALMA observations at longer wavelength (e.g. in band 5)
are needed to constrain the dust temperature and to refine our dust
mass estimates. Moreover, adopting a higher dust temperature to
study the IRX-ùõΩùë¢ùë£ relation confirms our conclusion on the dust law
preferred by our object, since an increase in dust temperature will
increase the dust luminosity without changing the UV luminosity,
and will therefore tend to higher IRX, consistent with the Calzetti
law."
"Such intrinsically faint sources (ùëÄùë¢ùë£=-19.9¬±0.15) emitting
light during the Epoch of Reionisation are considered to be domi-
nant contributors to the cosmic reionisation of hydrogen (e.g. Atek
et al. 2015, Bouwens et al. 2017). This strongly-lensed system has
therefore the capabilities of testing this hypothesis. Recent studies of
the Ly-ùõº emission line (either fromLBGor LAE) usingMUSE/VLT
(e.g. de La Vieuville et al. 2019, de La Vieuville et al. 2020) or the
Hyper Suprime-Cam/Subaru (e.g. Konno et al. 2018) show that the
luminosity of Ly-ùõº at ùëß ‚â•5.5 ranges from 1040 to 1043.8 erg/s.
The Ly-ùõº properties in MACS0600-z6 (L(2ùúé)<2.4√ó1042 erg/s and
EWùëÖùêπ <113 √Ö ) are therefore not particularly exceptional and
comparable in luminosity and Ly-ùõº EW to the bulk of the galaxy
population at ùëß ‚àº6."
"We report the discovery of a ùëß =6.07 dusty galaxy strongly
lensed by the cluster MACS0600.1-2007 comprising 5 multiple
images. We used three different mass models for the cluster, show-
ing good agreement between predicted magnification factors and
observed flux ratio between the five images of this galaxy. The"

"physical properties we deduced from a detailed SED analysis show
that this galaxy has a stellar mass of ‚àº 109MÔøΩ , a dust mass of ‚àº106
MÔøΩ respectively, a small star formation rate (<10MÔøΩ .yr‚àí1) and a
size (‚àº0.5 kpc) consistent with previous observations. We estimate
the dust production rate in this galaxy and conclude that it seems
higher than what has been observed in z ‚â§ 5 galaxies. Further sub-
mm observations, as provided by ALMA, are crucial to improve the
estimate of the dust content of this galaxy."

"Table 3. Photometry of the multiple images of this ùëß ‚â•6 system. Upper photometric limits on the ACS and WFC3 data were estimated in a 0.4‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ radius aperture, on HAWK-I data in a 0.8‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ radius aperture (taking
into account the seeing of the data), and in a 1.2‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ radius aperture for IRAC images. For the photometric extraction of z6.3a and z6.3b, we used GALFIT on ACS and WFC3 images assuming a Sersic profile for both.
On the IRAC data, where the separation is not clearly resolved, we used the flux ratio observed at 1.6`m to separate the contribution of each source.
‚òÖ spectroscopically confirmed at ùëß = 6.07 (see Fujimoto et al. submitted)
‚Ä† Candidates for the fifth image of this system. The absence of WFC3 data at the expected position makes difficult the clear identification of the image."
