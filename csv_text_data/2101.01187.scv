"ABSTRACT
The Galactic black hole transient GRS 1915+105 is famous for its markedly variable X-ray and radio behaviour, and for being the
archetypal galactic source of relativistic jets. It entered an X-ray outburst in 1992 and has been active ever since. Since 2018
GRS 1915+105 has declined into an extended low-flux X-ray plateau, occasionally interrupted by multi-wavelength flares. Here
we report the radio and X-ray properties of GRS 1915+105 collected in this new phase, and compare the recent data to historic
observations. We find that while the X-ray emission remained unprecedentedly low for most of the time following the decline in
2018, the radio emission shows a clear mode change half way through the extended X-ray plateau in 2019 June: from low flux
(∼ 3mJy) and limited variability, to marked flaring with fluxes two orders of magnitude larger. GRS 1915+105 appears to have
entered a low-luminosity canonical hard state, and then transitioned to an unusual accretion phase, characterised by heavy X-ray
absorption/obscuration. Hence, we argue that a local absorber hides from the observer the accretion processes feeding the variable
jet responsible for the radio flaring. The radio–X-ray correlation suggests that the current low X-ray flux state may be a signature
of a super-Eddington state akin to the X-ray binaries SS433 or V404 Cyg."
"Key words: accretion, accretion discs – black hole physics – X-rays: binaries – stars: jets"
1 INTRODUCTION
"In black hole (BH) X-ray binaries a stellar mass black hole accretes
via an accretion disc formed by matter stripped from a low-mass
companion star. BH X-ray binaries are typically transient systems,
i.e. they alternate between long states of quiescence, characterised
by a luminosity typically of the order of 𝐿 ∼ 1034 erg s−1 (see
Wĳnands et al. 2015), and relatively short outbursts, during which
their luminosity can reach ∼ 1039 erg s−1. During outbursts these
systems show clear repeating patterns of behaviour across various
accretion states, each associated with mechanical feedback in the
form of winds and relativistic jets (e.g., Fender et al. 2009, Ponti et al.
2012)."
"The hard states, characterised by highly variable X-ray emission
dominated by hard photons, are associated with steady radio jets
(Fender et al. 2004). In a few occasions, cold (i.e., consistent with
being not ionised) winds, which appear to co-exist with the radio
jets, have been observed in the optical band during the hard state
(Muñoz-Darias et al. 2016), casting doubts on the idea according
to which jets and winds are associated to different accretion states,"
"and therefore cannot co-exist. In the X-ray low-variability soft states,
X-ray spectra are dominated by thermal emission from a geometrically
thin, optically thick accretion disc, the radio emission is quenched1,
and X-ray (ionised) winds are seen (Ponti et al. 2014; Tetarenko et al.
2018). In between these two states lie the intermediate states, with
properties in between the hard and the soft state, and during which
short-lived, powerful relativistic radio ejections are observed (Fender
et al. 2009). Quasi-simultaneous X-ray and radio observations of BH
X-ray binaries have been fundamental to the study of the connection
between the accretion and the jet production mechanism, which led
to the establishment of a disc-jet coupling paradigm (Fender et al.
2004). Such a coupling gives rise in the hard state to a well-known
non-linear relation between the X-ray and the radio luminosity, known
as the radio–X-ray correlation (e.g., Gallo et al. 2003 and Corbel
et al. 2003), which also encompasses AGN when a mass scaling term"
"1 Any residual radio emission in the soft state has been so far associated with
ejecta launched before the transition to the soft state (see e.g. Bright et al.
2020)."

2012; Gültekin et al. 2019)."
"GRS 1915+105 is one of the most well studied Galactic BH X-ray
binaries, which firsts appeared as a bright transient in August 1992
and remained very bright in X-rays and in radio until recently (Negoro
et al. 2018). GRS 1915+05 was the first Galactic source observed to
display relativistic super-luminal radio ejections Mirabel & Rodríguez
(1994), and it is still considered the archetypal galactic source of
relativistic jets. This system, located at a radio parallax distance of
8.6+2.0−1.6 kpc, hosts a stellar mass black hole (12.4"
"+2.0
−1.8M� Reid et al."
"2014), believed to accrete erratically close to the Eddington limit.
Several characteristic X-ray variability patterns observed in the X-ray
light curve of GRS 1915+105 (Belloni et al. 2000) are believed to
reflect transitions from and to three accretion states: two soft states (A
and B), and a hard state, C, all slightly different from the canonical
states seen in other BH binaries (Belloni & Motta 2016). State A
and B are characterised by limited X-ray variability, and a substantial
contribution from an accretion disc with a variable temperature that
can reach 2 keV. State C shows high X-ray variability and no disc
contribution to the X-ray spectrum, and is known to be associated with
steady radio jets (Rushton et al. 2010). Such jets appear as flat-top
periods in the radio light curve, characterised by relatively high radio
flux densities (∼ 100 mJy beam−1), an optically thick radio spectrum,
and a flat low-flux X-ray light curve (Pooley & Fender 1997). In the
radio–X-ray plane, state C corresponds to a high-luminosity extension
of the radio–X-ray correlation (Gallo et al. 2003). Radio Plateaus are
generally preceded and followed by flaring periods due to the launch
of relativistic ejections (Rodríguez & Mirabel 1999), which have been
repeatedly resolved as extended radio jets on a range of scales from
∼1 mas to hundreds of arcseconds (Dhawan et al. 2000; Miller-Jones
et al. 2005; Rushton et al. 2007; Fender et al. 1999; Miller-Jones et al.
2007)."
"While GRS 1915+105 is in many ways unique, it shares many
properties with more conventional transient black-hole binaries (such
as GX 339–4, see, e.g., Done et al. 2004, Soleri et al. 2008), and also
with some quasars (Marscher et al. 2002; Chatterjee et al. 2009), which
display mass-scaled versions of GRS 1915+105’s correlated X-ray and
radio behaviour close to jet ejection events. Hence, comprehending the
coupling between inflow and outflow in GRS 1915+105 is important
not only for X-ray binary systems, but has broader relevance for
studies of active galactic nuclei, and potentially of all the jetted
systems powered by accreting compact objects (Fender et al. 2004)."
"In 2018 July (∼MJD 58300), after 26 years of extreme X-ray and
radio activity, GRS 1915+105 entered an unusually long period of
low-flux in the X-rays and radio (Negoro et al. 2018; Motta et al. 2019),
which made some to believe that quiescence was close. Around the
end of 2019 March (MJD 58600), GRS 1915+105 entered a sudden
further X-ray dimming (Homan et al. 2019; Rodriguez et al. 2019),
which reinforced the hypothesis that the 26-year long outburst of
GRS 1915+105 was nearing an end. However, only days later, on
2019 May 14th (MJD 58617), renewed flaring activity at different
wavelengths appeared to invalidate the quiescence hypothesis. After
approximately a month of marked multi-wavelength activity (Iwakiri
et al. 2019; Miller et al. 2019b; Neilsen et al. 2019; Jithesh et al.
2019; Vishal et al. 2019; Svinkin et al. 2019; Koljonen et al. 2019;
Balakrishnan et al. 2019; Trushkin et al. 2019; Motta et al. 2019),
GRS 1915+105 entered a new X-ray low-flux state. X-ray observations
with Swift, NuStar and Chandra taken during this second low phase
showed hard spectra characterised by heavy and occasionally partial
covering absorption with equivalent column densities 𝑁H>3 × 1023
cm−2, i.e. over an order of magnitude larger then the usual equivalent
column density in the direction of GRS 1915+105 (Miller et al. 2019a;"

"Koljonen & Tomsick 2020; Miller et al. 2020; Balakrishnan et al.
2020). The presence of intrinsic absorption in GRS 1915+105 has
never previously been reported, and have been observed only rarely
in other X-ray binaries. Two notable exceptions are the BH V404 Cyg
(see, e.g., Życki et al. 1999 and Motta et al. 2017a), which showed
clear signatures of heavy and variable intrinsic absorption during both
the outbursts monitored in the X-rays, and SS 433, which is believed
to be obscured by its own inflated accretion disc (Fabrika 2004). In
both these systems obscuration was the consequence of erratic (V404
Cyg) or sustained (SS 433) super-Eddington accretion, which in both
cases is associated with extreme activity of the radio jets (Spencer
1979; Miller-Jones et al. 2019)."
"In this paper we report on the behaviour of GRS 1915+105 based
on the long-term monitoring operated by a number of X-ray All-sky
monitors and radio facilities. We compare the recent (as in 2020)
evolution of the systems with its past behaviour, with the aim of
highlighting the peculiarities of the current, highly unusual state.
In Section 2 we describe our data reduction and analysis, in Sec. 3
we present our results, and in Sec. 4 we will discuss our findings.
Finally, in Sec. 5 we will summarise our main results and outline our
conclusions."
2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS
"In this section we describe the reduction and analysis of the data from
the radio and X-ray facilities used in this work. A log of the data
considered is given in Tab. 1."
2.1 Radio
2.1.1 Ryle and AMI-LA telescopes
"From 1995 May to 2006 June (MJD 49850 to 53900) the Ryle
telescope routinely observed GRS 1915+105 as part of an extensive
monitoring campaign on a number of bright radio transients. In
2006 the Ryle telescope was partly converted into the Arcminute
Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA) and observations of
GRS 1915+105 continued until 2016 January (MJD 57400), when
the array was switched off to allow the original analog correlator to
be upgraded with a digital one. Observations resumed in 2016 June
(MJD 57640) and continued until March 2020, when AMI-LA had to
be shut down due to the Covid-19 outbreak (MJD 58926)."
"Data from the Ryle telecope have been published by, e.g., Pooley
& Fender (1997), Klein-Wolt et al. (2002), and Rushton et al. (2010),
and we refer the reader to those works for details on the data reduction.
The AMI-LA observations were conducted at a central frequency
of 15.5 GHz with a 5 GHz bandwidth, divided into 8 channels for
imaging (for the digital correlator data there were originally 4096
narrow channels). We used 3C286 as the flux/bandpass calibrator, and
J1922+1530 as the interleaved phase calibrator. We reduced the data
with a custom pipeline that uses the AMI reduce_dc software, which"
"MNRAS 000, 1–10 (2020)"
"A radio-bright, X-ray obscured GRS 1915+105 3"
"automatically flags for radio frequency interference (RFI), antenna
shadowing, and hardware errors, performs Fourier transforms of the
lag-delay data into frequency channels (for the analog correlator
data), and then applies phase and amplitude calibrations (e.g., Perrott
et al. 2013). We carried out further flagging using the Common
Astronomical Software Applications (CASA) package (McMullin
et al. 2007), which was also used for the interactive cleaning. For
imaging we use natural weighting with a clean gain of 0.1. To measure
the source flux density we use the CASA task imfit. The synthesised
beam of the AMI-LA when observing at the declination of GRS
1915+105 is 40 arcsec ×30 arcsec. The target is unresolved in all
epochs."
"The data have been binned differently based on the brightness of
the target. When the target was relatively faint (flux density <10 mJy
beam−1) we report the average flux measured in each epoch, which
have a variable total duration of 1 to 7 hr. When the target was brighter,
we split each epoch into shorter segments (down to 6-minutes long),
depending on the source flux."
2.1.2 MeerKAT telescope
"As part of the ThunderKAT large survey project (Fender et al. 2016)
we observed GRS 1915+105 with the MeerKAT radio interferometer
38 times. Data were obtained at a central frequency of 1.28 GHz
across a 0.86 GHz bandwidth consisting of either 4096 channels or
32768 channels (in this second case data were binned for consistency
to 4096 channels before any further analysis). Observations covered
the period between 2018 December and 2020 November (MJD 58460
– 59168). We initially observed the target every several weeks. When
AMI-LA stopped operations, we switched to a weekly monitoring
of GRS 1915+105 with MeerKAT. The first MeerKAT observation
consisted of an observation with a total duration 90 min, of which 60
min is on-source, 20 minutes is on the flux and band-pass calibrator,
and 3 minutes on the phase calibrator. All other observations had
a total on-source integration time of 15 minutes, and a flux and
bandpass calibrator, and phase calibrator times of 10 and 4 minutes,
respectively. We used J1939−6342 as the flux and band-pass calibrator,
and J2011−0644 as the complex gain calibrator. Between 58 and
63 of the 64 available dishes were used in the observations, with a
maximum baseline of 7.698 km."
"The subsequent analysis has been conducted via a set of Python
scripts specifically tailored for the semi-automatic processing of
MeerKAT data (OxKAT2, Heywood 2020). We used CASA to flag the
first and final 100 channels from the observing band, autocorrelations
and zero amplitude visibilities. Then we further flagged the data to
remove RFI in the time and frequency domain. Flux density scaling,
bandpass calibration and complex gain calibration were all performed
within CASA using standard procedures. A spectral model for the
phase calibrator is derived starting from the flux and band-pass
calibrator, by temporarily binning the data into 8 equal spectral
windows. We then averaged the data in time (8 s) and frequency (8
channels) for imaging purposes, and we used WSClean (Offringa
et al. 2012) to image the entire MeerKAT square degree field."
"We measured the fluxes averaging data in each epoch, so that each
MeerKAT point (blue diamonds in Fig. 2, panel (a)) corresponds to a
15 minutes of on-target time, except the first point (MJD 58460), which
corresponds to a 60-min integration time. The target is unresolved
in all observations, and in this paper we will only consider the flux
densities measured in the MeerKAT images using the imfit task"

"in CASA. More in-depth analysis of the MeerKAT maps will be
presented in a dedicated paper (Motta et al. in prep)."
2.2 X-ray All-Sky monitors
"We extracted long-term light curves for GRS 1915+105 using the
public data available on the web pages of RXTE/ASM (ASM3)
and MAXI/GSC (MAXI4), and from the survey data collected with
the BAT telescope on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory
(Swift). We used the MAXI on-demand tool5 to extract the data
covering the 2–12 keV band in order to be able to directly compare the
light curves from MAXI and the ASM. We converted the ASM and
MAXI count rates into fluxes using an approximate counts-to-flux
conversion fraction, based on the mean count rates of the Crab, which
corresponds to 75 count s−1for the ASM and 3.74 count s−1for the
MAXI, respectively. We note that such a count rate to flux conversion
is not rigorous, but it is sufficient for our purposes. We account for any
bias introduced by the conversion assuming a conservative uncertainty
on the flux of 20 per cent. Owing to the larger energy interval covered
by BAT (nominally 15–150 keV), a count rate to flux conversion
would not be accurate when using the Swift/BAT transient monitor
results (Krimm et al. 2013). Hence, we processed the BAT survey data
retrieved from the HEASARC public archive by using the BatImager
code developed by Segreto et al. (2010), which is dedicated to the
processing of coded mask instrument data. BatImager performs
image reconstruction via cross-correlation and, for each detected
source, generates light curves and spectra. We processed BAT survey
data from MJD 53347 to MJD 59169, and extracted one spectrum
per day using the official BAT spectral redistribution matrix and a
logarithmic binned energy grid. Then, we fit the spectra from 15 keV
to 50 keV with a simple power-law and derived the observed flux.
Using the fluxes obtained as described, we calculated a X-ray colour
𝐶 = 𝐹hard/𝐹soft, where 𝐹hard is the flux coming from BAT, and 𝐹soft
is the flux coming from either the ASM or MAXI. Higher colour
means a harder spectrum."
"The ASM and MAXI data overlap with those from BAT data by
several years, and overlap to each other for about two years (i.e. from
MJD 55054 to 55859). This allows us to confirm that ASM and MAXI
provides consistent data (see 2, panel (b)). Variability on time-scales
significantly shorter than a day is known to occur during various
accretion states both in the X-rays (Belloni et al. 2000) and in radio
(Pooley & Fender 1997) in the flux from GRS 1915+105. However,
the aim of this work is to study the long term behaviour of this system.
Thus we focused on the variability occurring on time-scales longer
than a few days, rather than the details of a particular flare. Therefore,
we rebinned the ASM, MAXI and BAT light curves to the same 1-day
long time bins."
"We also extracted energy spectra in specific time intervals (see
Sec. 3.2) using the on-demand MAXI tool with the default extraction
parameters, and specifying the good time intervals to be used for the
extraction. The spectra were then fitted within xspec (v 12.11.0)."

3 RESULTS
3.1 Overall behaviour
"Figure 1 displays, from the top: the radio light curve taken at a central
frequency of 15.5 GHz (Ryle Telescope and AMI-LA data, light and
dark cyan points), the soft X-ray light curve (ASM data covering the
2–12 keV band), the hard X-ray light curve (BAT data covering the
15-50 keV band), and the X-ray colour. Figure 2 shows, from the
top: the radio light-curve from data taken at a central frequency of
15.5 GHz (AMI-LA, clear blue points) and 1.28 GHz (MeerKAT,
blue diamonds), the soft X-ray light curve (MAXI, covering the 2–12
keV band), and again the BAT light curve and the X-ray colour. Note
that the two figures are plotted using similar time scales, and overlap
by several years, but were kept separated to allow for the inspection
of both the ASM and MAXI data. In both figures, all panels except
the top ones are colour-coded so that redder corresponds to a softer
spectrum (displayed in panel (d) in both figures). Wherever the ASM
or MAXI data did not overlap with the BAT data, we left the points
black. Part of the radio and X-ray data presented in Fig. 1 have been
already published by, e.g., Pooley & Fender (1997), Fender et al.
(1999), Pooley et al. (2010), Klein-Wolt et al. (2002) and Rushton
et al. (2010)."
"All the light curves are characterised by periods of intense flaring,
interleaved by relatively short and quiet phases, both in the X-rays and
in radio. In Fig. 2 we can easily identify a time when both the radio
and the X-ray behaviour of GRS 1915+105 changed, i.e. around MJD"
"58300 (2018 July), when the source entered a first low-flux phase
approximately 11 months-long, to which we refer to as Plateau 1.
The average flux level observed during Plateau 1 is approximately
𝐹 ≈ 0.30 × 10−8 erg cm−2 s−1 and 𝐹 ≈ 0.15 × 10−8 erg cm−2 s−1 in
the MAXI and the BAT data, respectively, and is marked with a dotted
line in panels (b) and (c) in both Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 for comparison.
According to the X-ray colour plotted in panel (d) of Fig. 2, this decay
led the source from a relatively soft state (around MJD 58000, with
colour of ≈0.05) to a significantly harder state, characterised by an
X-ray colour of ≈1 (cyan in Fig. 2 and 3). The AMI-LA data show
that in the radio band Plateau 1 corresponds to relatively low flux
densities between 1 and 5 mJy beam−1, consistent with the lower
end of the radio flux densities observed over the 11 years of activity
covered by the Ryle telescope."
"On MJD 58613 GRS 1915+105 showed a fast decay to an even
lower X-ray flux – we refer to this phase as Pre-Flare Dip. The Pre-
Flare Dip can be easily discerned both in the MAXI and in the BAT
data, as shown in Fig. 3. Shortly afterwards, GRS 1915+105 entered
a multi-band flaring period – which we refer to as the Flaring Phase –
that in the X-rays lasted approximately 1 month. The Flaring Phase,
instead, appears as a few isolated points in both the MAXI and BAT
light curves around MJD 58600. The inspection of the orbit-by-orbit
BAT light curve (not displayed6) shows that the flares in this phase"

"Figure 2. AMI-LA and MeerKAT data (panel a), MAXI data (panel b), and BAT data (panel c), covering approximately 14 years. The colour-coding is the same
as in Fig. 1, with the difference that the spectral X-ray colour is calculated as the ratio between the BAT and the MAXI fluxes. The grey points in panel b are from
the ASM (the same as in Fig. 1, panel b) and are plotted to allow a comparison with the MAXI data. Similarly, the grey points in panel d correspond to the colours
shown in Fig. 1 for comparison."
"have a variable duration of a few hours up to a few days. Given the
coarse 1 day binning that we employed to compare the MAXI and
BAT data, the X-ray colour displayed in Fig. 2 is not sensitive to
the fast spectral changes occurring during this high-variability phase.
Thus, the colour does not provide any specific information on the
spectral properties of the flares, apart from the fact that they appear
to be predominantly hard, hence more pronounced in the BAT curve."
"GRS 1915+105 subsequently entered a new X-ray plateau (Plateau
2) around MJD 58700, which was occasionally interrupted by short
flares lasting approximately 1 day or less (see also Neilsen et al.
2020), again visible as isolated points in the BAT and MAXI light
curves. This second plateau lasted over 13 months. Interestingly, the
MeerKAT and AMI data show that the radio flaring did not cease
with the X-ray and multi-band flaring, but continued for several
months, until at least MJD 59100. In contrast, the X-ray flux level
continued to slowly decline from 𝐹 ≈ 0.08 × 10−8 erg cm−2 s−1 to
𝐹 ≈ 0.06 × 10−8 erg cm−2 s−1 in the MAXI data (red dashed and
red solid line in panel (b) in both Fig. 1 and Fig. 2), and from
𝐹 ≈ 0.08 × 10−8 erg cm−2 s−1 to 𝐹 ≈ 0.03 × 10−8 erg cm−2 s−1 in
the BAT data (red dashed and red solid line in panel (c) in the same
figures). The signal-to-noise ratio of both the data from MAXI and
BAT was very limited in this phase, due to the low count rates from
the source, but the X-ray colours measured in this phase suggest a
markedly hard spectral shape. The radio flaring sampled by AMI-
LA in this second plateau does not qualitatively differ from that"
"observed previously over almost three decades7. The radio emission
is characterised by flares of variable amplitude and duration, spanning
a flux range between 3 and 300 mJy beam−1 in the AMI-LA data,
and up to 900 mJy beam−1 in the MeerKAT data, and variability on
time scales from minutes to several hours."
"More recently, around ∼ MJD 59050, the MAXI light curve and the
evolution of the colour in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 shows that GRS 1915+105
returned to a flux comparable to that of Plateau 1, but with a much
softer spectrum characterised by an X-ray colour of approximately
0.05. This indicates that GRS 19105+105 has likely transitioned to a
significantly softer state, which, coherently with what was observed
in the past (see, e.g., data around MJD 53600 in Fig. 1), features a
diminished radio activity, with flux densities of approximately 10 mJy
beam−1 and limited variability. This last Soft Phase lasted until ≈MJD
59140, when both the soft and hard X-ray flux dropped to values
comparable to those observed during Plateau 2, and the radio flaring
resumed, qualitatively similar to what observed prior to the softening."
"At no point in the past has GRS 1915+105 reached fluxes as low as
those measured during Plateau 1 and 2 (see also Negoro et al. 2018),
despite the presence of several low-flux phases observed both in the
soft and in the hard X-rays, all in general associated with relatively low
radio flux and low colours, indicative of a relatively soft state (see also
Klein-Wolt et al. 2002 and Fender & Belloni 2004). The soft plateau"

3.2 Spectral analysis
"To further investigate the properties of the emission from
GRS 1915+105 over the phases we described, we extracted four
time-averaged MAXI energy spectra in specific phases of the evolu-
tion of the source, with variable exposure times chosen to avoid times
of variable emission, and to guarantee similar signal-to-noise ratios.
Figure 4 shows the spectra we obtained and their best fit: Spectrum
A (in red, extracted in the time interval between from MJD 58034
and 58035), extracted at the peak of a soft flare preceding Plateau 1;
Spectrum B, extracted during Plateau 1 (in blue, MJD 58450–58490);
Spectrum C, extracted during Plateau 2 in a time interval flare-free
(in green, MJD 58830–58850); Spectrum D, extracted during the Soft
Phase (in magenta, MJD 59095–59116). The the best fit parameters
are reported in Tab. 2."
"We fitted the four spectra with phenomenological models consti-
tuted by either a powerlaw, or a disc blackbody continuum, each
modified by interstellar absorption (tbfeo in xspec), and an ad-
ditional partially covering absorber (tbpcf in xspec, see Wilms
et al. 2000), so that the models used in xspec have the form: tbfeo
×tbpcf×(powerlaw) or tbfeo× tbpcf×(discbb). We fixed the
interstellar absorption parameter to 𝑁H = 5.0 × 1022 cm−2 (Miller
et al. 2016; Zoghbi et al. 2016). In order to compare the two soft
spectra (A and D) and the two hard spectra (B and C) directly, we fitted
spectra A and D, and B and C with the same underlying model, and
attempted to reproduce the different spectral shapes by applying addi-
tional absorption. Spectra A and D are well-fitted by a hot disc, with
characteristic temperature of ≈1.8 keV. The very small normalisation
of (𝐾bb ≈ 340) is indicative of small disc truncation radius. Spectrum
D requires a multiplicative constant 𝐾 ≈0.06, and additional uniform
absorption of (2.5±0.4) ×1022 cm−2. The observed fluxes in the 2-10
keV band from spectrum A and D are ∼ 3.6 × 10−8 erg cm−2 s−1 and
2 × 10−9 erg cm−2 s−1, respectively. Fitted individually, both spectra
return best fit parameters consistent with those reported above, and"
"MNRAS 000, 1–10 (2020)"
"A radio-bright, X-ray obscured GRS 1915+105 7"
"neither is better described by a power law continuum. We fitted spec-
trum B and C using a power law continuum, and we linked the power
law photon index and normalisation across the two spectra, obtaining
a photon index of 𝛤 = 1.90 ± 0.04. Spectrum C required additional
absorption of (220+50−30) × 10"
"22 cm−2, with a partial covering factor of
0.88 ± 0.02. The observed fluxes in the 2–10 keV band from spectra
B and C are ∼ 1.6 × 10−9 erg cm−2 s−1 and 3 × 10−10 erg cm−2 s−1,
respectively."
"We note that the above analysis is based on simple phenomenolo-
gical models with the aim to provide clues regarding the nature of the
accretion state(s) sampled by GRS 1915+105 after July 2018."
3.3 Radio–X-ray plane
"To better compare the current behaviour of GRS 1915+105 with its
past behaviour, as well as with other BH transients, we placed it
on the radio–X-ray plane. We measured the radio and X-ray fluxes
corresponding to Plateau 1, Plateau 2, and the Soft Phase taking
the mean in the three phases. Figure 5 shows the radio–X-ray points
(in grey) for a number of BH transients considered in Motta et al.
(2017a), plus MAXI J1820+070 from Bright et al. (2020). The error
bars account for both the scatter in the values, and the uncertainty on
the counts-to-flux conversion described above. GRS 1915+105 was
traditionally considered an outlier on the radio–X-ray correlation that
the vast majority of BH transients follow, as shown by the red dots
in the figure, which mark the position that GRS 1915+105 occupied
during its C state phases of its 27-years long outburst (points taken
from Rushton et al. 2010). While during Plateau 2 and during the Soft
Phase GRS 1915+105 still clearly lies away from the other sources
on the plane, during Plateau 1 GRS 1015+105 falls on the correlation,
incidentally approximately in the same position occupied by Cyg X–1."
4 DISCUSSION
"We have presented the results of a comparative radio and X-ray study
of GRS 1915+105, primarily focusing on the evolution of the source
from MJD 58300 (July 2018) to MJD 59200 (November 2020). We
are motivated by the fact that in 2018 the source underwent a flux
decline in the X-rays that might have been interpreted as a transition to
a canonical hard state, possibly preceding a long-expected quiescence
(Truss & Done 2006). Our data show that, despite the low X-ray
fluxes displayed lately, GRS 1915+105 is still very active in radio,
and during the last several months has been showing marked activity
that is qualitatively very similar to that observed in the past. This
provides evidence for two important facts: first, that the correlation
between radio and X-ray emission that for many years characterised
GRS 1915+105 (Fender & Belloni 2004) ceased to exist sometime in
June 2019; and second, that the X-ray behaviour alone–in the absence
of such radio–X-ray correlation–is very misleading, as it offers only a
partial view of the current state of the source. GRS 1915+105 has not
entered quiescence, and might not be approaching it either (see also
Neilsen et al. 2020 and Koljonen & Hovatta 2021 for a discussion
of this topic). Rather, the accretion processes that must be at work
to feed the jets responsible for the observed radio behaviour are for
some reason not directly visible to the observer."
"The low X-ray fluxes observed during Plateau 1, i.e. after the
exponential decline occurred in 2018 (see also Negoro et al. 2018)
appear as highly unusual for GRS 1915+105. Furthermore, the almost
total lack of variability in the X-ray emission, as opposed to marked
radio flaring observed after June 2019 that characterises Plateau 2
(referred to as the obscured phase by Miller et al. 2020) is certainly"
"unprecedented. Based on the data reported here, and on older data
published by other authors (e.g., Klein-Wolt et al. 2002) Plateau 2
is the longest, lowest flux, and hardest X-ray plateau ever observed
in GRS 1915+105, and the only one associated with marked radio
flaring. Any previous plateau was a plateau both in radio and in the
X-rays, and any Flaring Phase has occurred in both bands."
"Since the beginning of Plateau 2, absorption is a constant charac-
teristic of the energy spectra of GRS 1915+105. Our spectral analysis
results are fully consistent with those reported by previous works
(Koljonen & Tomsick 2020; Miller et al. 2020; Neilsen et al. 2020;
Balakrishnan et al. 2020; Koljonen & Hovatta 2021): an obscuring
in-homogeneous medium is required to explain the average spectrum
we extracted from Plateau 2. This agrees with the results from the
Chandra spectra, which were taken when GRS 1915+105 was ob-
served in a deep obscuration state (Miller et al. 2020). Absorption
also impacted the occasional flares captured by NICER during the
obscured state8, which still reached a high luminosity, indicating
that the intrinsic X-ray luminosity of GRS 1915+105 is likely not far
from the Eddington limit (Neilsen et al. 2020). The evolution of the
X-ray emission during one particular flare reported by Neilsen et al.
(2020), shows that the flares are characterised by harder-when-brighter
spectra, and require high density and variable in-homogeneous local
absorption, properties very reminiscent of the behaviour of V404
Cyg during a vast majority of the flares observed in 2015 (Motta et al.
2017b). Also reminiscent of V404 Cyg are the spectral properties
of the obscured state around the occasional flares observed. A high
equivalent column density absorber, which was almost completely
covering the emission from the central portion of the accretion flow,
was responsible for the spectrally hard and low flux emission observed
during a number of plateaus during the 2015 outbursts of V404 Cyg
(Motta et al. 2017a; Kajava et al. 2018)."
"The behaviour and properties of GRS 1915+105 during the ob-
scured state are consistent with those observed in all the systems
displaying phases of strong, variable local absorption: all tend to
show high-amplitude flares. Some noteworthy examples are V4641
Sgr (Revnivtsev et al. 2002), Swift J1858–0814 (Hare et al. 2020;
Muñoz-Darias et al. 2020), and even some Seyfert II Galaxies (Moran
et al. 2001), but perhaps the best example remains that of V404 Cyg.
In the case of V404 Cyg, the behaviour observed both during the
low-flux phases and during flares has been ascribed to the presence
of an inflated accretion disc. Such a thick disc was likely sustained by
radiation pressure induced by high accretion rate episodes, and was
fragmenting out in the clumpy outflow responsible for the local and
variable Compton-thick absorption which affected the spectra. Some-
thing similar might be happening in GRS 1915+105 in the obscured
state, even though the obscured state in this case is significantly more
extended than for V404 Cyg."
"Owing to the better energy resolution and signal-to-noise ratio
achieved with Chandra and NICER, respectively, observations of
GRS 1915+105 in the obscured state offered a deeper insight into
the properties of this state. Both Neilsen et al. (2020) and Miller
et al. (2020) showed that the absorber in GRS 1915+105, besides
being in-homogeneous, requires a multi-temperature profile, and it is
likely radially stratified. On the one hand, Miller et al. (2020) showed
that at least two types of media form this absorber: an inner bound
(failed) magnetic wind, and an outer, cooler component which could
be a thermally-driven outflow. In this scenario, the failed wind would
be responsible for the obscuration. On the other hand, Neilsen et al."

be seen in the 1-day averaged light curve."

"(2020), who analysed data taken at a different time, showed that their
results are consistent with the presence of radially stratified puffed-up
outer disc, which would hide the regions closer to the BH. It seems
therefore plausible that the absorber in GRS 1915+105 covers a large
portion of the accretion disc, from a few hundreds gravitational radii,
to the outer disc, at radii larger than tens of thousands 𝑅g. In this
respect GRS 1915+105 differs from V404 Cyg. In the latter both
neutral and ionised winds were being launched from the outer disc,
but a cold, optically thick and partially covering absorbing material
was launched from within a few hundreds of gravitational radii from
the black hole, and was clearly outflowing with a velocity of the order
0.05 c (Motta et al. 2017b)."
"Considering GRS 1915+105 in the context of the radio–X-ray
plane, we see that for the first time since its discovery, during Plateau
1 the system was consistently located on the correlation traced by
the majority of known BH transients. During both Plateau 2 and the
Soft Phase the position of GRS 1915+105 in the radio–X-ray plane
confirms that a large fraction of the X-ray flux is lost. If, for the sake
of the argument, we assume that the correlation holds during Plateau
2, we estimate that the obscuration of the inner accretion flow might
be causing a loss of approximately a factor ∼200 in X-ray luminosity,
consistent with the obscuration scenario. However, note that the radio–
X-ray correlation strictly holds only during the canonical hard state
(Fender & Belloni 2004), when a compact steady jet is detected, and
the radio and X-ray emission can be directly compared. The above
estimate is intended only as an indication of the overall behaviour of
the source, the emission being so heavily modified by absorption, we
have no means to confirm the X-ray state of the source."
"Based on our results, it seems that Plateau 1 was a truly dim state,
very similar to the canonical low-flux hard state typical of more
well-behaved BH transients, characterised by low X-ray and radio
flux, as well as low long-term variability in both bands. Such a state is
certainly unusual for GRS 1915+105, which has never been observed
before in a low-luminosity canonical hard state (but see Gallo et al.
2003). Instead, despite the fact that Plateau 2 has been dubbed ‘the
obscured state’, it is not really a state, but rather a condition directly
dependent on the presence of local absorption along our the line of
sight. The accretion processes that must be feeding the markedly
variable jet observed in radio must be happening beneath a complex
layer of material local to the source, which shields the inner part of the
accretion flow, and thus blocks a large portion of the X-ray emission.
Behind this Compton-thick curtain of material, GRS 1915+105 is
most likely evolving through various states and transitions, consistent
with what it had been doing for 25 years until June 2018. This
means that perhaps, as already proposed by Miller et al. (2020),
GRS 1915+105 did not really enter the outburst phase in 1992, when
it was discovered, but simply emerged from an obscured phase similar"
"to the one we are witnessing at the time of the observations presented
here."
"GRS 1915+105 is an important system for a number of reasons,
including being in many ways a small-scale AGN. As in the case
of many other Galactic BHs, its different states may correspond to
a number of AGN classes, but the specific multi-band behaviour of
GRS 1915+105 has clear counterparts in AGN (Miller et al. 2020). So,
how does this new observed state of GRS 1915+105–heavily absorbed
in X-rays and active in radio–compare to AGN? In AGN, different
absorbers on different scales affect the X-ray spectrum: from dust
lanes in the host galaxy, to the parsec-scale torus, to accretion-disc
scale clouds/winds (see Ramos Almeida & Ricci 2017, for a recent
review). Large column densities 𝑁H ∼ 4−9× 1023 cm−2, comparable
to those measured in the X-ray spectra of GRS 1915+105 in Plateau 2,
are inferred from hard X-ray observations of local radio galaxies (see
Ursini et al. 2018, and references therein) and young radio sources
(e.g., Mrk 668, Guainazzi et al. 2004). The radio jet activity of young
radio sources is also intermittent, possibly due to the interaction with
the X-ray absorbing dense circumnuclear medium. However, most of
the X-ray absorbers found in these sources are likely found on parsec
scales and beyond. Compton-thick absorbers on accretion disc–scales
are observed in some Changing-Look AGN (e.g., Risaliti et al. 2005),
but their time scales for variability, once scaled down to stellar mass
black holes, are much shorter than what is observed in GRS 1915+105.
Thus, a phenomenon similar to the one observed in GRS 1915+105
has not been identified in AGN, yet."
"Finally, while accreting super-massive BHs and stellar-mass black
holes are connected by the same fundamental physics (Merloni et al.
2003; Falcke et al. 2004), which governs their inner accretion flow,
their larger-scale structure differ quite appreciably. In particular,
accreting stellar mass BH have a companion star, the behaviour of
which can potentially greatly affect the long-term behaviour of the
accretion disc. Neilsen et al. (2020) speculated that if a vertically
extended outer accretion disc is responsible for the obscuration in
GRS 1915+105, its formation might have been triggered by changes
in the companion star, e.g. an increase in the mass supply into
the accretion disc, which necessarily would trigger a change in the
accretion flow from the outside-in. The fact that an equivalent of the
obscured state seen in GRS 1915+105 has not been seen in AGN
might support this hypothesis."
5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
"In 2018, the black hole binary GRS 1915+105, after 25 years of
high-luminosity X-ray activity, decayed to a prolonged low-flux X-ray
state. Due to this relatively sudden change in the X-ray behaviour of
GRS 1915+105, some were led to believe that its outburst, the longest"
"MNRAS 000, 1–10 (2020)"
"A radio-bright, X-ray obscured GRS 1915+105 9"
"ever observed from a black hole X-ray binary, was approaching its
end."
"We analysed the simultaneous X-ray and radio data collected over
almost 3 decades with various facilities, focusing on the most recent
evolution of the system. Our data show that at the beginning of the
dim X-ray state GRS 1915+105 was also relatively faint in radio.
Since June 2019 the system has been showing marked radio activity,
characterised by the signatures of relativistic jets, and X-ray spectra
affected by high and variable in-homogeneous absorption. Our results
show that more recently GRS 1915+105, while still affected by heavy
absorption, transitioned to a softer state, which was accompanied by
a decrease in the radio flaring that resumed when GRS 1915+105
moved back to a hard(er) state."
"We argue that GRS 1915+105 first transitioned to a low-luminosity
hard state, similar to the canonical hard state shown by many other
black hole X-ray binaries, and then entered a prolonged obscured
phase. In this phase the highly variable radio jets we have been
observing for months must be fed by the same sort of accretion
processes that have been seen often in the past in GRS 1915+105,
and are now happening behind a complex layer of absorbing material.
We therefore conclude that GRS 1915+105 is far from being in
quiescence, even though a substantial change in the accretion flow–
perhaps the launch of a powerful outflow and/or the thickening of
the outer disc–must have occurred at some point around June 2019.
The behaviour of GRS 1915+105 in the obscured state appears to
have no counterpart in its super-massive relatives, the AGN, where
the time-scales typical of similar radio-bright obscured phases (once
they are scaled up in mass) are either much longer, or much shorter
than in GRS 1915+105."
