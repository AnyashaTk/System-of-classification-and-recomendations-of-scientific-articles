"We consider the mimetic tachyon model in the lagrange multiplier approach. We study both the
linear and non-linear perturbations and find the perturbation and non-gaussianity parameters in
this setup. By adopting two types of the scale factor as the power-law (a = a0 t"
"n) and intermediate
(a = a0 exp(bt"
"β)) scale factors, we perform a numerical analysis on the model which is based on
Planck2018 TT, TE, EE+lowE+lensing +BAO +BK14 and Planck2018 TTT, EEE, TTE and EET
data sets. We show that the mimetic tachyon model with both the power-law and intermediate
scale factors, in some ranges of its parameter space is instabilities-free and observationally viable.
The power-law mimetic tachyon model with 26.3 < n < 33.0 and the intermediate mimetic tachyon
model with 0.116 < β < 0.130 are consistent with observational data and free of the ghost and
gradient instabilities.

I. INTRODUCTION
"Although a canonical scalar field, slowly rolling its
flat potential, gives a simple model of inflation which
solves some problems of the standard model of cosmol-
ogy, it predicts the scale invariant, adiabatic and almost
gaussian dominant modes of the primordial perturbations
(precisely, this model predicts small, still non-vanishing
primordial non-Gaussianity) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
However, some extended models of inflation, predict-
ing the non-Gaussian distributed perturbations, have at-
tracted a lot of attentions [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. One way to get a model with
non-Gaussian distributed perturbations, is to consider
the non-canonical scalar field such as DBI or tachyon
fields [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. In
this paper, we focus on the tachyon scalar field. It is
possible to consider this scalar field, which is associated
with D-branes in string theory [27, 28, 29], as responsi-
ble for both the early time inflation [30, 35] and late time
acceleration [30, 36, 37] ."
"On the other hand, in 2003 Chamseddine and
Mukhanov have proposed a new approach to the Gen-
eral Relativity in which a non-dynamical scalar field (φ)
relates the physical metric (gµν) to an auxiliary metric
(g̃µν) as follows [38]"
"gµν = −g̃αβ φ,α φ,β g̃µν . (1)"
"This proposal, called mimetic gravity, has this important
property that respects the conformal symmetry as an in-
ternal degree of freedom [38]. Also, the definition (1)
ensures that by performing a weyl transformation on the
auxiliary metric, the physical metric remains invariant."

"In the mimetic gravity, there is the following constraint"
"gµνφ,µφ,ν = −1 , (2)"
"obtained from equation (1). The contribution of the mat-
ter fields coupled to gµν in the action of the mimetic grav-
ity, leads to an extra term in the Einstein’s field equations
corresponding to a−3. This extra term in the field equa-
tions, which mimics the matter component, is considered
as a source of the dark matter [38]. The mimetic gravity
scenario can be studied in another approach by consid-
ering the lagrange multipliers in the action of the theory,
as proposed in Refs. [39, 40, 41]. In Ref. [42], the au-
thors have studied some models of the mimetic gravity
which are ghost-free. Also, considering a potential term
for the mimetic field leads to some interesting cosmologi-
cal results. This case has been discussed in [43]. Several
extension of the mimetic gravity have been studied by au-
thors, such as the braneworld mimetic scenario [44], non-
minimal coupling in the mimetic model [45, 46], f(G)
model of the mimetic gravity [47], Horndeski mimetic
gravity [39, 48], unimodular f(R) mimetic gravity [49],
f(R) theories in the mimetic model [50, 51, 52] and
Galileon mimetic gravity [53]. The (in)stability issue
in the mimetic gravity is an important subject that has
attracted a lot of attentions. In fact, the authors seek
for the mimetic models which are free of the ghost and
gradient instabilities [54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62,
63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68]. In this regard, the authors of
Ref. [69] have shown that by considering the direct cou-
pling between the curvature of the space-time and the
higher derivatives of the mimetic field, it is possible to
have an instabilities-free mimetic model in some ranges
of the parameter space. Also, in Ref. [70] the authors
have studied the Higher-derivatives Lagrangian model to
show the possibility of evading from instabilities. How-
ever, in Ref. [33] it has been shown that, considering a
DBI mimetic gravity model is one way to overcome the
ghost and gradient instabilities in the mimetic gravity."

"In this paper, we assume the tachyon field to be
the mimetic field, study the inflation and perturbations
in this model and compare the results with observa-
tional data. From planck2018 data, we have some con-
straints on the perturbation and non-gaussianity pa-
rameters by which we can explore the observational
viability of the inflation models. In fact, by as-
suming ΛCDM + r + dns"

"TE, EE+lowE+lensing+BAO+BK14 data gives the con-
straint on the scalar spectral index as ns = 0.9658 ±
0.0038 and the constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio as
r < 0.072, respectively [71, 72]. The constraint on the
tensor spectral index, implied by Planck2018 TT, TE,
EE +lowE+lensing+BK14+BAO+LIGO and Virgo2016
data is −0.62 < nT < 0.53 [71, 72]. Also, Planck2018
TTT, EEE, TTE and EET data gives the constraint
on the equilateral amplitude of the non-gaussianity as
fequil = −26 ± 47 [10]. By numerical studying of these
parameters in our inflation model and compare the re-
sults with released data, it is possible to constraint the
model’s parameters observationally."
"The paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we
study the mimetic tachyon model and obtain the main
equations of the model. In section 3, we consider both
the linear and non-linear perturbations and find pertur-
bation and non-linear parameters in the mimetic tachyon
model. In section 4, we reconstruct the model in terms
of the e-folds number. The power-law inflation in the
mimetic tachyon model is studied in section 5. In this
section, we show this model is free of instabilities. We
also find the perturbation and non-gaussianity parame-
ters in terms of the model’s parameter. We perform a
numerical analysis on the model and compare the results
with several observational data sets to obtain some con-
straints on the model’s parameter space. In section 6, we
study the intermediate inflation in the mimetic tachyon
model. In this section also, by performing a numerical
analysis, we explore the (in)stability issue and the obser-
vational viability of the model. In section 7, we present
a summary of the paper."

"Note that, in the Lagrangian formalism generally one
is not allowed to impose the constraints on the action"
"from the beginning. This is an important point in the
lagrangian formalism. We should first obtain the main
equations of motions and then impose the constraints, as
it has been done in paper [33]. In this regard, we show
that the mimetic tachyon action (3) leads to nonzero
sound speed providing the propagating curvature per-
turbation. The Einstein’s field equations in the mimetic
tachyon model are obtained by varying action (3) with

TACHYON MODEL"
"In this section, we study the perturbations in our
mimetic tachyon setup in both linear and non-linear level
which help us to explore the model and its viability, in

A. Linear perturbation

by"

perturbed metric, we have denoted the spatial curvature
perturbation by Ψ and the spatial symmetric and trace-

turbations, in the next subsection, we study the non-
linear perturbations to seek for the non-gaussian feature
of the primordial perturbations and more constraints on
the model’s parameters."
B. Non-linear Perturbations
"In studying the primordial perturbations, the linear
level of the perturbations gives us no information about
the non-gaussian feature. Therefore, we should go to the
non-linear level of the perturbations and use the three-

"The non-linearity parameter depends on the values of
the momenta k1, k2 and k3. Also, the different values of
the momenta lead to different shapes of the primordial
non-gaussianity. For every shape, there is a special con-
figuration of three momenta, leading to a maximal signal
of the amplitude of the non-gaussianity. In our model,
there is a maximal signal in the equilateral configuration
which has been shown in figure 1. Note that, to plot this
figure, we have introduced the parameters x2 ≡ k2k1 and
x3 ≡ k3k1 and we see that there is a peak at k1 = k2 = k3
(also, in Refs. [77, 78, 79] it has been shown that in the
k-inflation and higher order derivative models the signal
becomes maximal at the equilateral configuration). In
this regard, in the following, we focus on the equilateral
configuration in which we have k1 = k2 = k3 [77]. In this

"By using this non-linear parameter obtained in the equi-
lateral configuration, we can study the non-gaussian fea-
ture of the perturbations in our mimetic tachyon setup
numerically."
"Note that, to obtain the constraint on fequil, we follow
the Planck papers on the non-gaussianity [10, 80, 81]. As
has been said in the mentioned papers, it is possible to"
"use the definition of the amplitude of the non-gaussianity,
sound speed and the scalar spectral index in every model
to find some constraints on the model’s parameters from
the observational constraint on fequil. In this way, one
can explore the viability of the models. Following the
Planck papers, we use the observational constraints on
fequil to find the constraints on c2s and therefore model’s
parameters. Also, we use the constraints on r − ns to
find the constraints on the model’s parameters. In this
regard, we can present the prediction of our model for
non-gaussianity. In this regard, we show that it is possi-
ble to find some ranges of the model’s parameters which
give observationally viable inflation and primordial per-
turbation. To this end, we should find the potential and
the lagrange multiplier in our model which we do in the
next sections."

grange multiplier in our model. By using equation (7),

parameter with respect to the e-folds number. The la-

"To find the slow-roll parameters, following [82, 83], we
introduce a new scalar field ϕ, identified by the number
of e-folds N . Also, this new parameter parameterizes
the scalar field φ as φ = φ(ϕ). In this regard, we can"

"By using the equations obtained in this section, we can
express the perturbation and non-gaussianity parameters
in terms of the Hubble parameters and therefore e-folds

factors, we study the mimetic tachyon model numerically."
"V. POWER-LAW INFLATION IN THE
MIMETIC TACHYON MODEL"
"To study the power-law inflation in the mimetic
tachyon model, we use the following scale factor"

to the constraints 0 < c2s ≤ 1 and W > 0. The re-
sults are shown in figure 2. As figure shows, the mimetic
tachyon model in most ranges of its parameter space
is free of instabilities, making it an interesting mimetic
gravity model."
"We can also study the perturbation parameters nu-
merically to seek for the observational viability of the"

straints on the model’s parameters. By using equa-
tions (18) and (42), we can find the scalar spectral in-
dex in terms of the model’s parameters and study it
numerically. The left-upper panel of figure 3 shows
the ranges of the parameters α and n which lead to
ns = 0.9658 ± 0.0038, obtained from Planck2018 TT,
TE, EE+lowE+lensing +BAO +BK14 data. The right
upper panel of this figure shows that the ranges of the
model’s parameters leading to r < 0.072, obtained from
same data set. The lower panel of figure 3 demonstrates
the range of the parameters α and n which leads to
−0.62 < nT < 0.53, obtained from Planck2018 TT, TE,
EE +lowE+lensing+BK14+BAO+LIGO and Virgo2016
data. We have also studied the behavior of r − ns and
r − nT in the background of several data sets at 68%
and 95% CL. The results are shown in figure 4 and 5.
The constraints obtained from this numerical analysis are
summarized in table I."
"As mentioned before, the non-gaussian feature of the
primordial perturbations is important issue in studying
the inflation models. Here, we study the equilateral con-
figuration of the non-gaussianity in comparison with ob-
servational data. To numerical study of the equilateral
non-gaussianity, we use equation (31), where the sound
speed is given by equation (43). By using the combined
temperature and polarization data analysis at 68% CL,
planck2018 gives the constraint on the equilateral non-
gaussianity as fequil = −26 ± 47. From this constraint,
we have found the ranges of the model’s parameter space
leading to the observationally viable values of the non-
gaussianity in the equilateral configuration. The result is
shown in figure 6. This figure shows in some ranges of the
parameter space, we have observationally viable values of
the equilateral non-gaussianity. Also, from Planck2018
TTT, EEE, TTE and EET data at 68% CL, the con-
strain on the sound speed is as c2s ≥ 0.0035 (this is ob-"
"tained from the constraint fequil = −26± 47 released by
Planck2018). Table II, shows the viable ranges of param-
eter n for some sample values of α, corresponding to this
observationally viable range of the square of the sound
speed in the power-law mimetic tachyon model. Figure
7 shows the behavior of the equilateral configuration of
the non-gaussianity versus the sound speed in the back-
ground of the Planck2018 TTT, EEE, TTE and EET
data at 68%, 95% and 99.7% CL. This figure shows that
the equilateral non-gaussianity versus the sound speed in
this model is consistent with observational data. How-
ever, note that, every possible value of the sound speed
is not observationally viable. In fact, according to the
equation (22), the sound speed is related to the tensor-
to-scalar ratio. The observationally viable values of r,
set some constraints on the sound speed of the primor-
dial perturbation. Figure 8 shows the behavior of the
square of the sound speed versus the tenor-to-scalar ra-
tio in the power-law mimetic tachyon model. To plot
this figure, we have considered the Planck2018 TT, TE,
EE+lowE+lensing +BAO +BK14 data, used in figure 4.
From this data analysis, we have found that for r > 0.44,
the sound speed reach unity and therefore there would
be no non-gaussianity in the model. To obtain some con-
straints on the sound speed and the nonlinear param-
eter, we use the constraints on n, obtained in study-
ing r − ns behavior in comparison with observational
data. The results are shown in table III. According to
our analysis and considering both Planck2018 TT, TE,
EE+lowE+lensing +BAO +BK14 and Planck2018 TTT,
EEE, TTE and EET data sets at 68% CL, the power-
law mimetic tachyon model is observationally viable if
26.3 < n < 33.0 and 0.310 < α < 0.398. In these ranges,
the model is instabilities-free and also the perturbation
and non-gaussianity parameters are observationally vi-
able."

plot this figure also, we have considered the Planck2018

figure 11. From this numerical analysis, we have found
that the constraint on the sound speed in the interme-
diate mimetic tachyon model is as c2s < 0.668 at 68%

obtained some constraints on the sound speed and the
nonlinear parameter, summarized in table VI. Accord-
ing to our analysis and based on both Planck2018 TT,

mediate mimetic tachyon model is observationally viable

ranges, the model is free of ghost and gradient instabil-
ities and also the perturbation and non-gaussianity pa-
rameters are observationally viable."
VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
"In this paper we have studied the tachyon model in
the context of the mimetic gravity and lagrange multi-
plier approach. We have assumed that the scalar field in
the tachyon model is a mimetic field. In this regard, we
have obtained the Einstein’s field equations, correspond-
ing Friedmann equations and the equation of motion. Af-
ter that, we have studied both the linear and non-linear
perturbations in the mimetic tachyon model and found
perturbations and non-gaussianity parameters in terms
of the potential of the mimetic tachyon field and the la-
grange multiplier. Then, we have constructed the model
in terms of the Hubble parameter and e-folds number.
This reconstruction has prepared us to study the mimetic
tachyon model for two types of the inflation: power-law
and intermediate inflation."

to-scalar ratio in the intermediate mimetic tachyon model."
"we have obtained the slow-roll parameters, sound speed
and W in terms of n and α (the constant warp fac-
tor). By performing a numerical analysis on these pa-
rameters, we have shown that the power-law mimetic
tachyon model in some ranges of its parameter space
is free of gradient and ghost instabilities (correspond-
ing to 0 < c2s ≤ 1 and W, respectively). We have also
studied the perturbation parameters ns, r and nT nu-
merically and compared the results with Planck2018 TT,
TE, EE+lowE+lensing +BAO +BK14 and Planck2018
TT, TE, EE +lowE+lensing+BK14+BAO+LIGO and
Virgo2016 data sets. In this regard, we have obtained
some constraints on the parameters n and α, shown
in several figures and tables. We have also explored
the non-gaussian feature of the primordial perturba-
tion numerically, to find more information about the
observational viability of the model. To this end, we
have considered the equilateral configuration of the non-
gaussianity with k1 = k2 = k3. By using the obser-
vational constraint on the equilateral amplitude of the
non-gaussianity, we have obtained the ranges of the pa-
rameters n and α leading to the viable values of fequil.
Then, we have used the relation between the equilateral
non-gaussianity and the sound speed and also the relation
between the sound speed and the tensor-to-scalar ratio,
to find some more constraint on the model’s parameter
space. Our data analysis, based on both Planck2018 TT,
TE, EE+lowE+lensing +BAO +BK14 and Planck2018
TTT, EEE, TTE and EET data sets at 68% CL, shows
that the power-law mimetic tachyon model is observa-
tionally viable and free of instabilities, if 26.3 < n < 33.0
and 0.310 < α < 0.398."
