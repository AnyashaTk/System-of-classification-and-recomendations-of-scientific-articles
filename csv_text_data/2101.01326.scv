ABSTRACT
"We study star formation in the Center Ridge 1 (CR1) clump in the Vela C giant molecular cloud,"
selected as a high column density region that shows the lowest level of dust continuum polarization
"angle dispersion, likely indicating that the magnetic field is relatively strong. We observe the source"
"with the ALMA 7m-array at 1.05 mm and 1.3 mm wavelengths, which enable measurements of dust"
"temperature, core mass and astrochemical deuteration. A relatively modest number of eleven dense"
"cores are identified via their dust continuum emission, with masses spanning from 0.17 to 6.7 M�."
Overall CR1 has a relatively low compact dense gas fraction compared with other typical clouds with
"similar column densities, which may be a result of the strong magnetic field and/or the very early"
"evolutionary stage of this region. The deuteration ratios, Dfrac, of the cores, measured with N2H
+(3-"
"2) and N2D
+(3-2) lines, span from 0.011 to 0.85, with the latter being one of the highest values yet"
detected. The level of deuteration appears to decrease with evolution from prestellar to protostellar
"phase. A linear filament, running approximately parallel with the large scale magnetic field orientation,"
"is seen connecting the two most massive cores, each having CO bipolar outflows aligned orthogonally"
"to the filament. The filament contains the most deuterated core, likely to be prestellar and located"
midway between the protostars. The observations permit measurement of the full deuteration structure
"of the filament along its length, which we present. We also discuss the kinematics and dynamics of"
"this structure, as well as of the dense core population."
1. INTRODUCTION
Star formation is a complicated process with many
"open questions, including what sets its rate, overall effi-"
"ciency, and resulting mass distribution of stars, i.e., the"
stellar initial mass function (IMF). To help answer these
"questions, detailed studies of star-forming regions that"
can resolve individual self-gravitating cores are needed
and these regions should span as wide a range of en-
vironmental conditions as possible in order to explore
potential effects of these conditions. With this goal in

"mind, we present here a study of a dense star-forming"
clump in the Vela C giant molecular cloud (GMC) that
has been selected to have a low angular dispersion in
"sub-mm polarization position angles, which likely indi-"
cates that it has relatively strong magnetic fields.
The Vela molecular cloud complex is one of the near-
est giant molecular cloud complexes in the Galactic disk
(Murphy & May 1991). It is composed of four molecu-
"lar clouds, of which Vela C is the most massive and the"
host of the youngest stellar population (Yamaguchi et al.
"1999). Vela C is known to harbor low, intermediate and"
high-mass star formation (Massi et al. 2003; Netterfield
et al. 2009) and hence is an ideal laboratory to study
different modes of star formation. When contoured at
"AV = 7 mag, the Vela C cloud appears to segregate into"

2 Cheng et al."
"five distinct sub regions (North, Centre-Ridge, Centre-"
"Nest, South-Ridge, and South-Nest), each with distinct"
morphological characteristics (Hill et al. 2011). In the
"Centre-Ridge sub region there is a compact HII region,"
"RCW36, which is adjacent to a very prominent dust"
ridge that hosts the majority of dense cores in the cloud
"(Hill et al. 2011). Owing to its proximity, i.e., at a dis-"
"tance of 933±94 pc (Fissel et al. 2019), Vela C has been
an important target for magnetic field mapping stud-"
ies through sub-mm polarimetry and near-infrared stel-
lar polarimetry (Fissel et al. 2016; Kusune et al. 2016;
"Santos et al. 2017). In particular, the relative orien-"
tation between gas column density filamentary struc-
tures and the magnetic field changes progressively with
"increasing gas column density, from mostly parallel or"
having no preferred orientation at low column densities
to mostly perpendicular at the highest column densities
(Soler et al. 2017; Fissel et al. 2019). This suggests that
the magnetic field is strong enough to have influenced
the formation of the dense gas structures within Vela C.
The ongoing star formation in Vela C has been inves-
tigated in several studies via far-infrared (FIR) to mm
"continuum imaging (e.g., Netterfield et al. 2009; Gian-"
nini et al. 2012; Massi et al. 2019). Giannini et al. (2012)
identified 268 dense cores with Herschel FIR data. Massi
et al. (2019) found 549 cores based on sub-mm contin-
uum mapping using APEX and derived a prestellar core
mass function (CMF) that has a similar shape as the
"stellar IMF at the high mass end. However, these ob-"
servations are limited by their relatively low spatial res-
"olution, i.e., & 20′′ (0.09 pc), which is unable to resolve
down to the scale of dense cores (i.e., a few × 0.01 pc)
relevant to the formation of individual stars or small-N"
multiple systems.
In this paper we present an ALMA 7m-array study in
both Band 6 and Band 7 towards a dense clump in the
Center Ridge of Vela C (referred as CR1 clump here-
"after) and the observations achieve ∼5′′ resolution for
various molecular species (see Table 1). The CR1 clump"
is located to the north of a hot pocket of gas (RCW 36)
"around the OB cluster, but appears to not yet be im-"
pacted by it (Hill et al. 2011). The CR1 clump has been
selected for this study because it appears to be strongly
magnetized as evidenced by having a local minimum of
angular dispersion in sub-mm polarization position an-
"gles, as shown in Figure 1 (see also Figure 6 in Fissel"
"et al. 2016). Thus, the main goal of this paper is to study"
the dense core population leading to star formation in
this example of a strongly magnetized environment. The
CR1 clump is close to the #5 C18O clump identified in
"Yamaguchi et al. (1999) (see also Figure 1), for which"
Kusune et al. (2016) estimated a plane-of-the-sky (POS)
magnetic field strength of 120 µG based on near-IR stel-
lar polarimetry. According to the Chandrasekhar-Fermi
"method (Chandrasekhar & Fermi 1953), the POS mag-"
netic field strength Bpos can be expressed as
"Bpos = Q
√"
"4πρ
σv
σθ"
"where ρ is the mean density of the cloud, σv is the line-"
"of-sight velocity dispersion, σθ is the dispersion of the"
"polarization position angles, and Q ∼ 0.5 is a correction
factor for σθ . 25"
◦ (Ostriker et al. 2001). In Kusune
et al. (2016) the angular dispersion of polarization an-
gles in the #5 C18O clump is estimated to be 18◦. How-
"ever, it is difficult to probe the magnetic field structures"
in high extinction regions with near-IR polarimetry and
most polarization vectors are from the relative diffuse
part of the cloud. The angular dispersion of our mapped
region (or #5 C18O clump) appears much lower in the
"BLASTPol survey, i.e., ∼ 2◦ (see also Figure 1), lead-
ing to a higher Bpos estimation of ∼ 1 mG. Note that
it is likely that the small scale magnetic field variation"
"is not resolved in the BLASTPol survey (reso. ∼ 2.5′),
so future high resolution dust polarization observations"
are required to clarify the field strength in this region.
"Nevertheless, the selected region is likely to have a rel-"
atively strong magnetic field compared to surrounding
regions in Vela C.
Our Band 6 spectral set-up and analysis methods are
similar to our previous studies of the G286 protocluster
(Cheng et al. 2020) and Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs)
"(e.g., Tan et al. 2013; Kong et al. 2017), which have"
a goal of studying cores via their mm dust continuum
"emission and via emission lines from dense gas tracers,"
"especially N2D
+(3-2). The Band 7 spectral set-up is"
designed to obtain a sub-mm dust continuum measure-
"ment, as well as observation of N2H
+(3-2) that allows an"
"accurate estimate of the level of deuteration of N2H
+,"
"which is expected to be boosted in cold, dense condi-"
tions and thus may be a useful evolutionary indicator of
prestellar and early stage protostellar cores.
This paper is structured as follows: the observations
"and results are presented in section 2 and section 3, re-"
"spectively. We further discuss our results in section 4,"
and present our conclusions in section 5.

quency of the correlator sidebands to be the rest fre-
"quency of the N2D

resolution of 0.046 km s−1. The second baseband SPW1
"was set to 231.00 GHz, i.e., 1.30 mm, to observe the con-"
"tinuum with a total bandwidth of 1.875 GHz, which also"
covers CO(2-1) with a velocity resolution of 1.46 km s−1.

a velocity resolution of 0.038 km s−1. The central fre-
quencies of SPW1 and SPW2 were set to 278.88 GHz
"and 291.10 GHz, respectively, and each band had a"
bandwidth of 1.875 GHz to observe continuum emis-
"sion. SPW3 was split equally to observe two lines,"
"i.e., DCN(4-3), DCO+(4-3), with 58.59 MHz (61 km/s)"
bandwidth and resolution of 0.073 km/s.
The raw data were calibrated with the data reduction
pipeline using Casa 5.4.0. The continuum visibility data
were constructed with all line-free channels. We per-
formed imaging with the tclean task in Casa and during
cleaning we combined data for all four strips to gener-
ate a final mosaic map. The 7m-array data were imaged
using a Briggs weighting scheme with a robust parame-
"ter of 0.5, which yields a resolution of 7.00′′ × 4.29′′ for
Band 6, and 5.92′′ × 3.47′′ for Band 7. The 1σ noise
levels in the continuum image are 1.3 mJy beam−1 and"
"1.8 mJy beam−1 for Band 6 and Band 7, respectively."
The resolutions and sensitivities for spectral lines are
summarized in Table 1.
2.2. Auxiliary data
We have retrieved archival data to provide auxiliary
information at infrared wavelengths. The 3.5 and 4.5 µm
maps are from the Spitzer Heritage Archive hosted in
the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive. For 12 and
22 µm we use Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer WISE
archival data. Continuum images in the wavelengths of
"Herschel PACS (70 and 160 µm) and SPIRE (250, 350,"
and 500 µm) were obtained from the Herschel Science
"Archive. For this, Vela C was observed on 2010, May 18,"
as part of the HOBYS (Herschel imaging survey of OB
"young stellar objects, Motte et al. (2010)) guaranteed"
time key program.
We also obtained the total hydrogen column density
"NH (in units of hydrogen nuclei per cm
−2) and temper-"
"ature map (see Figure 1), which were first presented in"
Section 5 of Fissel et al. (2016). These maps are based
on dust spectral fits to four far-IR/sub-mm dust emis-
"sion maps: Herschel-SPIRE maps at 250, 350, and 500"
µm; and a Herschel-PACS map at 160 µm. These maps

3. RESULTS
3.1. Continuum
Figure 2 illustrates the Band 6 (1.3 mm) and Band 7
(1.05 mm) continuum of the Vela C CR1 clump. Over-
all there are about 10 clearly visible cores sparsely dis-
tributed over the field. The detections at 1.05 mm are
similar to those at 1.3 mm. The two brightest cores are
"located in the southern part of the field, with a linear"
filament or “bridging feature” connecting them. This
bridge is about 0.27 pc long and appears more promi-
"nent at 1.3 mm. As shown in Figure 1, the orientation of"
this bridging feature is close to the POS direction of the
"magnetic field derived in the BLASTPol survey, with an"
offset of ∼ 18 ◦.

Vela C CR1 region."
We used the dendrogram algorithm (Rosolowsky et al.
2008) implemented with astrodendro to carry out an au-
"tomated, systematic search for cores in the continuum"
images following the method used in Cheng et al. (2018)
and Liu et al. (2018). We defined the identified leaves
(the base element in the hierarchy of dendrogram that
has no further sub-structure) as cores. We set the min-
"imum flux density threshold to 4σ, the minimum signif-"
"icance for structures to 1σ, and the minimum area to"
half the size of the synthesized beam. We tried den-
drogram identification on the continuum maps of both
bands and found almost equivalent results. Hereafter
we define the positions and boundaries of cores based
"on the 1.3 mm data, which have slightly better signal"
"to noise ratios, as shown in Figure 3. The cores are"
"named as CR1c1, CR1c2, etc., with the numbering or-"
der from highest to lowest integrated flux. There is an
additional core (CR1c11) that is located at the bridging
feature and not identified as a core from the 1.3 mm
"data, but it does appear as an independent condensa-"
"tion in 1.05 mm continuum, and moment 0 maps of"
"some lines like N2D
+(3-2) and DCO+(3-2). So we also"
include CR1c11 in our sample and adopt a core bound-
"ary defined using the N2D
+ moment 0 map (by running"
dendrogram with the same set up). Then the regions
of CR1c1 and CR1c2 that overlap with CR1c11 are ex-
cluded from the definition of CR1c1 and CR1c2 when
deriving their properties.
We then estimated the masses of cores assuming the
1.3 mm emission comes from optically thin thermal dust
emission with a uniform temperature of 15 K follow-
ing the methods and assumptions used in the study of
"Cheng et al. (2018), with the only difference being that"
this previous study adopted a fiducial temperature of
20 K. Our reason to choose a slightly lower temperature

is the availability in Vela C of a relatively high resolution
temperature map (though not high enough to resolve in-
dividual cores themselves) that indicates temperatures
closer to 15 K. The estimated masses range from 0.17
to 6.7 M�. If temperatures of 10 K or 20 K were to be
"adopted, then the mass estimates would differ by fac-"
"tors of 1.85 and 0.677, respectively. In Figure 4 we plot"
the CMF of the detected sample. Given the small num-
"bers of detected cores, it is difficult to make meaningful"
comparison with the CMFs of other regions.
"The core radii are evaluated as Rc =
√
A/π, where A"
is the projected area of each core returned by the den-
"drogram algorithm. The median radius is 0.016 pc (i.e.,"
"3300 au), similar to the spatial resolution of 5100 au"
"that is achieved by the ∼ 5.5′′ angular resolution ob-
servations. This indicates that most cores are not well"
"resolved. Given masses and radii, the mass surface den-"
sities and volume number densities of the cores can be
estimated. These properties are summarized in Table 2.

both bands (after convolving 1.05 mm data to the an-

from 1.0 to 2.5 over the map. We use this ratio to give
"more constraints on the dust temperature. To do this,"

= 5 K to about 2.1 at Tdust = 20 K, and grows asymp-"
"totically to 2.2 at higher temperatures. For comparison,"
we also present the predicted f1.05mm/f1.30mm-Tdust re-
lation for the equivalent bare grain and thick ice mantle
models of Ossenkopf & Henning (1994). We see that
"for the models with ice mantles (thin/thick), which are"
expected to be the most relevant for prestellar and early
"stage protostellar cores, the choice of dust opacity model"
does not strongly affect the derived Tdust for a given flux
"ratio. More generally, our derived Tdust estimates are"
valid for dust opacity models that have a spectral index
β close to 1.8 in the millimeter wavelength regime.
"Given the observed values of f1.05mm/f1.30mm, we es-"
timate Tdust by looking for the corresponding values on
"the predicted relation, as shown in Figure 5. The uncer-"
tainties in f1.05mm/f1.30mm are also transferred into the
uncertainties in Tdust. Table 2 lists these derived tem-
peratures. The fluxes of cores are measured by integrat-
ing over the region defined by dendrogram and for flux
uncertainties we consider both the root-mean-square er-
"ror and a flux calibration uncertainty of about 5%, and"
combine them in quadrature.

ing to an unrealistic Tdust of 957.0"
"+∞
−949.6 K, so we only"
conservatively list the lower limit of 7.4 K. In general
the derived core temperatures appear to be relatively
low compared to canonical estimates of temperatures
"in molecular clouds, i.e., typically found to be in the"
"range ∼ 10 − 20 K. On the larger scales probed by the
Herschel sub-mm observations (see Figure 1), the CR1"
"clump is estimated to have dust temperatures of ∼ 12-
16 K. Still, we note that the centers of some prestellar
cores have been measured to have temperatures as low"
as about 6 K from NH3 observations (Crapsi et al. 2007).
We further note that there are several potential sources
of systematic uncertainties in the temperature estima-
tion from f1.05mm/f1.30mm. The effects of choice of dust
model have already been described in Figure 5. In ad-
"dition, since the core boundaries are defined based on"
"the 1.3 mm data, we expect that the estimated flux ra-"
tio f1.05mm/f1.30mm and correspondingly Tdust could be
systematically underestimated. Differences in recovered
flux fractions could also introduce systematic uncertain-
"ties, with a smaller flux recovery fraction generally ex-"
pected at 1.05 mm. Another potential source of un-
certainty is if the cores (or part of the cores) become
"optically thick, which would occur first at 1.05 mm."
"This would tend to lower the flux received at 1.05 mm,"
"again causing an underestimation of Tdust. For example,"
if a core is moderately optical thick at 1.05 mm with
"τ1.05mm = 1, then the resulting f1.05mm/f1.30mm will be"
"∼13% lower than the case assuming optical thin. How-
ever, most cores in our sample should be optically thin"
judging from the observed low brightness temperatures
TB . In Band 7 the median TB seen at the continuum
"peaks of different cores is about 0.02 K, i.e., even assum-"
"ing a very low Tdust of ∼5 K, it is still about a factor
of 250 lower. Such a big difference can not be explained"
"purely by a beam filling effect, since it requires a small"
"source size of . 20 AU (a factor of 250 smaller than
the spatial resolution, i.e., around 4.5′′, or ∼ 4200 AU
in Band 7). Thus it is more likely due to a small op-"
"tical depth, i.e., τ � 1 in the observed bands, at least
averaged on the core scale, although a small inner re-"
gion that is optically thick is still possible in some cores.
These results motivate future work on radiative transfer
models of protostellar cores to predict these Band 6 to
Band 7 flux ratios.

"range from 0.61 to 2.2, with a median of 1.4 for N2H
+,"
"0.77 for N2D
+ and 1.0 for DCO+."
3.3. Virial state of cores
To further examine the dynamical state of the dense
"cores, we calculate the virial parameter (Bertoldi & Mc-"
"Kee 1992), defined as"
"αvir ≡ 5σ2cRc/(GMc) = 2aEK/|EG|, (6)"
where σc is the intrinsic 1D velocity dispersion of the
core and Rc is the core radius. The dimensionless pa-
rameter a accounts for modifications that apply in the
case of non-homogeneous and non-spherical density dis-
tributions and we adopt a fiducial value of a = 5/4 fol-
"lowing McKee & Tan (2003), which corresponds to a ra-"
"dial density profile of ρ ∝ r−1.5. For a self-gravitating,
unmagnetized core without rotation, a virial parameter"
"above a critical value αvir,cr = 2a indicates that the core"
"is unbound and may expand, while one below αvir,cr sug-"
gests that the core is bound and may collapse.
"Following the procedures in Cheng et al. (2020), we"
calculate the virial parameters separately using each
"tracer, i.e., N2H
+, N2D"
"+, DCO+ and DCN. The intrin-"
sic velocity dispersion σc is derived from the observed
dispersion σobs following:
"σc =
(
σ2nth + σ"
")1/2
="
"(
σ2obs −"
"µobsmH
+"
")1/2
,"
where µ = 2.33 is the mean molecular weight assum-
ing nHe = 0.1nH and µobs is the molecular weight of
"different observed species. For the core masses, we use"
"the values from Table 2, i.e., derived based on millime-"
"ter continuum emission. For core radius, we attempt"
two methods. The first is to use the effective radius
calculated from the dendrogram-returned area in sub-
"section 3.1. For the second method, we adopt a decon-"
"volved size defined as Rc =
√"
"(A−Abeam)/π for cores
withA > 1.5Abeam, whereA andAbeam are the core area"
"and synthesized beam size, respectively. Figure 8(a) and"
(b) display the virial parameters measured with different
tracers versus core mass for the two methods described
"above. In Figure 8(c) and (d), we combine the measure-"
ments from different tracers by taking the linear average
of their nonthermal velocity dispersion in the virial pa-
rameter derivation. We note that this procedure may
"potentially introduce some bias, since cores can vary in"
the number and type of chemical species that have de-
tected line emission.
We see virial parameters ranging from 1 to 20 as mea-
sured by individual dense gas tracers. There is a trend
for more massive cores to have smaller virial parameters.
"The scatter is reduced for the deconvolved size method,"
suggesting some data points with virial parameter > 5
in panel (a) could arise from an overestimation of the
core radius. There are no significant systematic differ-
"ences between different tracers. For example, with the"
"deconvolved size method (panel (b)), the median values"
"are 1.56, 1.14 and 1.46 for N2H
+, N2D"
+ and DCO+.
The virial parameters estimated by averaging all the
available dense gas data for each core show a further
reduction in the scatter. For the second method with
"deconvolved sizes that focus on the larger cores, we ob-"
"tain a median value of 1.45, with 2 out of the 7 cores"
"exceeding the critical value of αvir,cr = 2.5. For com-"
"parison, the virial parameters of the cores appear to be"
"similar to those of the 76 cores in G286, which have a"
median value of 1.22 (Cheng et al. 2020). Thus we see
that most cores have a virial parameter that is consistent
with a value expected in virial equilibrium. Note that
the derivation of virial ratios relies on the assumption
"of temperature, which strongly affects the mass estima-"
tion. Here an uniform temperature of 15 K has been
"assumed. If we use a temperature of 20 K, then the"
median virial parameter rises to 2.58.
"Following similar discussions in Cheng et al. (2020),"
the absolute uncertainties in the derived virial parame-
"ters, including uncertainties in measured 1D line disper-"
"sion, mass and temperature, can be as high as a factor"
"of 2.5. Therefore, it is difficult to be more certain about"
whether the dense cores are actually closer to a super-
"virial or subvirial state. For example, CR1c11 has the"
"highest virial parameter of 4.8, but if a lower tempera-"
"ture of 10 K is adopted, then αvir = 2.3, i.e., below the"
"critical value of 2.5, so it is still likely to be gravitational"
"bound. However, we note that the uncertainty factor"
"includes systematic effects, some of which are not ex-"
"pected to vary that much from core to core, so the cores"
"with smallest virial parameters, like CR1c1, CR1c2 and"
"CR1c3, are more likely to be gravitationally bound and"
collapsing.

"N(N2D
+)/N(N2H"
+). The results are listed in Table 3.
"Figure 9 shows the N2H
+ and N2D"
+ column density
"measurements of the dense cores. The N2H
+ column"
"densities are in the range of 3 × 1011 - 3 × 1013cm−2,

and 0.85, with a median value of 0.16. This is similar to"
the value found by Crapsi et al. (2005) in their sample
of low-mass starless cores.
The uncertainties in the column density estimation
mainly result from the assumption of the excitation tem-
perature Tex. If temperatures of 7 K or 15 K were
"adopted, thenN(N2H

only by factors of 0.83 to 1.17 from the low to the high
temperature limits of this range. The uncertainties in

between the “expected” abundance of CO and the “ob-

In the abundance calculation we derive the column den-
"sity of hydrogen nuclei, NH from the mass surface den-"

µHmH = 1.4mH is the mean mass per H nucleus.
"To compute X

we adopt the abundance ratios of
n16O/n18O = 327 from Wilson & Rood (1994) and
"n12CO/nH2 = 2×10−4 from Lacy et al. (1994). Thus, our
assumed abundance ratio of C18O to H2 is 6.12 ×10−7.
The results are listed in Table 3. All the cores have fD
measured to be & 40. Note that the imperfect clean-
ing due to incomplete uv sampling may have affected"
"the C18O flux measurement, and CO depletion factor"
accordingly. As mentioned in subsection 3.2 the mo-
ment 0 map of C18O(2-1) in Figure 6 does have some
artificial ringing features and some cores are not clearly
associated with enhanced C18O emission. It is difficult
to quantify the uncertainties introduced from the clean-
14 Cheng et al.
"ing process, but it may have affected the CO depletion"
factor by factors of a few for specific cores.
3.5. CO Outflows
We examined the CO(2-1) data toward this region to
see if protostellar outflows are detectable. Figure 10(a)
illustrates the low velocity CO(2-1) emission integrated
over relative velocities ranging from 4 to 12 km s−1 (com-
"pared to vsys ≈ 7 km s−1) for blueshifted and redshifted
emission, and Figure 10 (b) illustrates the high veloc-"
ity CO(2-1) emission integrated over relative velocities
ranging from 12 to 20 km s−1. There is a clear bipolar
"outflow associated with CR1c1, which has an orientation"
roughly perpendicular with the filamentary bridging fea-
ture seen in the continuum. The outflow has a biconical
"shape with an half opening angle of ∼30◦. In the vicin-
ity of CR1c2 there appears to be some blueshifted and"
"redshifted CO emission, possibly resulting from a weak"
"outflow, which is also perpendicular to the bridging fil-"
ament. CR1c7 appears to host a relatively collimated
outflow in East-West orientation. The blueshifted lobes
has a knotty appearance with a bending feature extend-
ing to Northeast direction. There is also a tentative
detection of CO outflow from CR1c4 at relatively low
"velocities in the redshifted lobe, suggesting CR1c4 may"
also host a protostar.
We also examined the CO channel maps centered
"on CR1c3, CR1c5, CR1c6, CR1c8, CR1c9, CR1c10"
and CR1c11 and did not find evidence for outflows.
The strong CO emission from the molecular cloud and
"the spatial filtering, however, make these nondetections"
"questionable, and observations with higher signal-to-"
noise are required to properly establish the presence or
lack of CO outflows from these sources.
3.6. The bridging filament connecting cores CR1c1 and
In the continuum map there is an interesting linear
"filament in which CR1c1, CR1c2 and CR1c11 are lo-"
cated. CR1c1 and CR1c2 are located at the ends of this
filament and connected by extended emission seen in
1.3 mm continuum. CR1c11 lies in between CR1c1 and
CR1c2 and is further identified from the moment 0 maps
"of N2D
+, DCO+ and 1.05 mm continuum. These three"
cores exhibit signatures of different evolutionary stages:
both CR1c1 and CR1c2 are associated with outflows and
"have relatively larger values of f1.05mm/f1.30mm (1.83,"
"1.59, respectively), indicating that they already host a"
protostar that is actively accreting and heating up the
surroundings. CR1c11 shows no sign of star formation
activity and has a low value of f1.05mm/f1.30mm of 1.28.
"As discussed in subsection 3.3, CR1c11 could be grav-"
itationally bound if a lower temperature of . 10 K is
"assumed. If true, then CR1c11 may be a prestellar core."
The chemical properties including Dfrac are also consis-
tent with these differences in evolutionary stage.
We further divide the bridging filament into 20 strips
"to derive properties along its length, as shown in Fig-"
"ure 11. Each strip has a size of 7′′× 3.5′′. The col-
umn densities of N2H"
"+, N2D
+ are calculated following"
the procedures in subsection 3.2 and also shown in Fig-
ure 11. Note that in addition to the uncertainties dis-
"cussed in subsection 3.2, spatially filtering of interferom-"
eter observations may also lead to an underestimation
"of flux measurements along the bridge. For example, if"
there is a more diffuse cocoon component surrounding
the bridge we are probably not able to detect it with the
"current observations. The hydrogen column density NH
is calculated from the continuum emission assuming a"
uniform Tdust of 15 K as in subsection 3.1. We plot the
"derived column densities, as well as Dfrac in Figure 12."
The evolutionary differences are better illustrated in the
"Dfrac profile, which exhibits a plateau around Dfrac ≈
0.8 from 30′′ to 60′′, i.e., covering the bridging region"
between CR1c1 and CR1c2. It can also be seen that
"CR1c1, CR1c2 and CR1c11 have similar N(N2D
+), but"
"there is a lack of N2H
+ for CR1c11, thus leading to a"
"high Dfrac. Therefore, CR1c11 is expected to be in an"
early stage before the onset of star formation.
"To investigate the kinematic properties, we check the"
line spectra along the bridging filament. DCO+(3-2) is
"the best tracer for this purpose, since it is clearly de-"
tected throughout the bridge and has a better signal to
"noise ratio compared to N2D
+(3-2). We fit the DCO+"
spectra with the same routine as used in subsection 3.2.
Figure 12 illustrates the variation of centroid velocity
and velocity dispersion along the bridge. The DCO+ ve-
locity dispersion ranges from 0.15 to 0.45 km s−1. With
"gas temperatures of 10-20 K, the thermal line broaden-"
"ing is 0.05-0.07 km s−1 for DCO+, so the observed line"
width is dominated by the nonthermal component. The
thermal sound speed of molecular gas is 0.23 km s−1 at
"15 K, and so the Mach number ranges from 0.6 to 2. The"
filament appears mildly subsonic at the relative quies-
"cent part, i.e., at offsets from 30′′ to 50′′. Note that"
there could be multiple velocity components along the
filament that are unresolved in the current observation.
There is a clear peak in line dispersion at the position of
"CR1c1, possibly resulting from an increase in temper-"
"ature or enhanced nonthermal motions, such as infall"
and/or outflow due to star formation activity. The case
of CR1c2 and CR1c11 is less clear. We see an increase
"in σDCO+ from 50
′′ to 80′′ in offset, which is roughly in"
between CR1c2 and CR1c11.

"mechanisms like rotation. Summarizing the results, it is"
likely that the bridging feature is a remnant of a larger
filament. CR1c1 and CR1c2 have been accumulating gas
"material from this filament and have formed protostars,"
while CR1c11 has condensed from the gas reservoir more

ering the balance between gravity and internal pressure
support.
The 100′′ length of the filament corresponds to 0.45 pc
at an assumed distance of 0.93 kpc. Without direct ob-
"servational constraints, we further assume the filament"
axis is inclined by an angle i = 60◦ to the line of sight
(90◦ would be in the plane of the sky). If an inclination
"angle of 90 or 30◦ were to be adopted, then the length es-"
"timates would differ by factors of 1.15 and 0.577, respec-"
tively. Thus the actual length of the filament is assumed
"to be 0.52 pc. In Figure 12 we plot the ratio mf/mf,vir."
The masses are calculated from the 1.3 mm continuum

"and it is relatively small (∼ 0.2-0.6) in regions between
the two cores, suggesting that the filament may only"
be gravitationally bound around the positions of CR1c1
"and CR1c2. However, since the ALMA 7m-array ob-"
"servations only probe scales up to ∼ 19′′, they may be
missing some flux from the filament leading to an under-"
"estimation of the masses. Furthermore, if a temperature"
"of 10 K instead of 15 K is adopted, which is probably"
more realistic for the less evolved region between CR1c1
"and CR1c2, the estimated mass will be larger by a factor"
"of 1.85, thus bringing the mf/mvir,f ratio to ∼ 0.4-1.2.
Also given other systematic uncertainties in measuring"
"lengths of the structure, it is still likely that the major-"
"ity of the filament is in approximate virial equilibrium,"
even without accounting for surface pressure and mag-
netic support terms.

4. DISCUSSION
4.1. The dense gas fraction: a deficit in compact
substructures
An obvious feature in the continuum map of Vela C
CR1 clump is an overall deficit of compact substructures
at a few 0.01 pc scales. We have identified 11 cores from
"the 1.3 mm continuum, which add up to a total mass"
"of only 19.4 M�. Alternatively, if we sum up the fluxes"
above 4σ in the 1.3 mm map and convert to masses
"following the same assumptions as in subsection 3.1, it"
"yields 20.7 M�, suggesting the bulk of the ALMA 1.3"
mm emission is included in our identified dense cores.
"For comparison, the total clump mass in the field of"
view estimated from the Herschel column density map
"is about 2300 M�, leading to a dense gas fraction, fdg,"
"of only 0.84% (or 0.90%, using the total integrated flux)."
"Therefore, only a very small fraction of gas mass is cur-"
rently contained in compact prestellar and protostellar
cores. The estimation of dense core masses depends on
"dust opacity, gas-to-dust mass ratio, temperatures and"
"dust emission fluxes, as well as the distance to the re-"
gion. The major uncertainty of mass estimation arises
"from the assumption of temperature. For example, if"
"we assume a higher temperature of T = 20 K, the to-"
"tal mass will be a factor of 0.677 smaller, leading to a"
dense gas fraction of 0.57% or 0.61%. Note that for esti-
"mating fdg, some of these uncertainties cancel out, i.e.,"
"those due to distance and gas-to-dust mass ratio, so we"
expect the dense gas fraction in VelaC CR1 clump is
". 2%.
We compare the CR1 clump with another well studied"
"region, G286.21+0.17 (G286), which is a protocluster at"
a distance of 2.5 kpc (Cheng et al. 2018). G286 has a
total Herschel-estimated mass of around 2900 M� in a
"2.6’×1.7’ elliptical aperture (Cheng et al. 2020), leading
to an average column density, NH, of ∼ 4 × 1022cm−2,
similar to the Vela C CR1 clump (∼ 5 × 1022cm−2 ).
For the compact gas mass we adopt two methods. For"
method 1 we simply sum up the masses of cores listed in
"Cheng et al. (2020), which follows the same assumptions"
as in subsection 3.1. For method 2 we integrate the
fluxes for pixels above 4 σ using the 1.3 mm continuum
"image made with only the 12m-array, and then convert"
to masses following the same assumptions. The 12m-
array data of G286 have a maximum recoverable scale
"of 11′′, corresponding to 0.13 pc at the distance of 2.5"
"kpc, which is close to the 7m-array observation of Vela"
"C (sensitive to structures up to 29′′ , ∼ 0.13 pc, in Band
6). Methods 1 and 2 yield fdg of 7.3%, and 14.3% in"
"G286, respectively, so both estimations are an order of"
magnitude higher compared with the Vela C CR1 clump.
One possible explanation for these differences is that
the formation of dense substructures in the Vela C CR1
clump has been suppressed by its strong magnetic field.
"Alternatively, the CR1 clump could simply be in a very"
"early evolutionary stage of collapse, but with core forma-"
"tion not particularly influenced by the B-field. Follow-
up observations to constrain the dynamical and chemical"
"history of Vela C CR1, e.g., to measure infall speeds and"
"chemical ages, can help distinguish these possibilities."
There have been a number of other studies of dense
gas fractions in the literature. Direct comparison with
our results is generally more difficult given the vari-
ety of methods used to estimate masses for both the
large scale cloud and the dense (or compact) compo-
"nent. For example, Battersby et al. (2020) studied the"
dense gas fractions of the central molecular zone (CMZ)
and compared to similar studies of clouds in the Galac-
"tic disk, finding that fdg ∼ 0.1% to 2% in most CMZ
clouds (even though these clouds have relatively high"
"column densities), while typical star-forming Galactic"
"clouds have fdg ∼ 2% to 20%. The measured fdg of
Vela C CR1 clump appears similar to the CMZ clouds,"
18 Cheng et al.
and lower than typical Galactic disk clouds. But note
that the maximum recoverable scale of our observation
"(29′′, 0.13pc) is smaller than the scales probed with"
SMA observations in Battersby et al. (2020) for most
sources.

4.2. Implication of the deuteration analysis: tests of
astrochemical models
The study of deuterated molecules is an important
probe of the physical conditions in star-forming regions.
"Prior to the formation of a star, the cold (T <20 K) and"
"dense (nH > 10
5 cm−3) conditions within star-forming"
molecular cloud cores drive a cold-gas chemistry that
has been well studied in recent years. Many molec-
"ular species, including CO and its isotopologues, be-"
come depleted in the gas phase by freezing out onto
"dust grains. Unlike CO, N-bearing species, in particular"
"NH3 and N2H
+, better trace dense and cold gas (e.g.,"
Caselli et al. 1999; Bergin et al. 2002). This is due to
"the fact that CO, largely frozen out, is unable to ef-"
fectively destroy their molecular ion precursors. These
physical/chemical properties are commonly observed in
"prestellar cores, where the deuteration fraction (i.e.,"
"Dfrac) of non-depleted molecules, defined as the column"
density ratio of one species containing deuterium to its
"counterpart containing hydrogen, is orders of magnitude"
larger than the average interstellar [D/H] abundance ra-
"tio, which is ∼ 10−5 (Oliveira et al. 2003). Therefore,
deuterated species, like N2D"
+ are better suited to probe
the physical conditions of the earliest stages of star for-
"mation. The Dfrac(N2H
+) ratio has been found to be"
a good evolutionary indicator in both low- and high-
mass star formation (Friesen et al. 2010; Fontani et al.
"2011). In addition, N2D
+ is probably the best tracer"
"of prestellar cores, e.g., compared to Dfrac of HNC and"
NH3(Fontani et al. 2015).
"The Dfrac(N2H
+) in the Vela C CR1 clump is found"
to be in the range of 0.011-0.85. Our observed val-
ues are consistent with measurements made in other
"low-mass star-forming regions (e.g., Caselli et al. 2002;"
Crapsi et al. 2005; Daniel et al. 2007; Emprechtinger
"et al. 2009; Friesen et al. 2013). For 4 out of 11 cores,"
"no significant N2D
+ is detected and only an upper limit"
of the Dfrac is given. These cores also have relatively
"low N2H
+ column densities and the upper limit on Dfrac"
"(.0.5) is a rather loose constraint. The extreme value
of 0.85, measured towards CR1c11, is among the highest"
"levels of N2H
+ deuteration reported so far (e.g., Miet-"
"tinen et al. 2012), indicating the prestellar nature of"
CR1c11 in a very dense and cold condition. A caveat
"is that CR1c11 is defined based on the N2D
+ moment"
"0 map, which thus biases towards a higher Dfrac esti-"
"mation. We note that N2H
+ could have a greater de-"
"gree of missing flux compared with N2D
+, given the"
"properties of the observations in Band 6 and Band 7,"
"however, we do not expect significant flux losses on the"
scales of the observed cores. In Figure 14 we plot the
Dfrac ratio against other core properties to look for po-
"tential correlations. As discussed in subsection 3.1, the"
ratio f1.05mm/f1.30mm can be interpreted as a tempera-
"ture indicator, with higher f1.05mm/f1.30mm suggesting"
higher temperature. There appears to be a weak anti-
"correlation between f1.05mm/f1.30mm and Dfrac, which"
"is consistent with our expectation, since CO will be re-"
leased from dust grains at higher temperatures as cores
"evolve, thus leading to a lower deuteration level."
Given the current available information on core prop-
erties it is difficult to assign a precise evolutionary stage
"for each one, but we do see groups of cores in differ-"
ent evolutionary stages. CR1c1 is probably the most
"evolved source in CR1. This core has the lowest Dfrac
and drives a powerful, wide-angle CO outflow. CR1c2,"
CR1c4 and CR1c7 also have associated outflow detec-
"tions, indicating their protostellar nature. CR1c11 has"
the highest Dfrac and is likely a prestellar core that is on
"the verge of collapsing, although more sensitive observa-"
"tions, especially better temperature measurements, are"
required to confirm its nature as a gravitationally bound
core. A measurement of deuteration on the larger clump
scale using single dish observations would be important
for understanding the initial astrochemical conditions of
prestellar core formation.
The auxiliary infrared data provide extra constraints
on the evolutionary stages. Here we focus on two in-
Star Formation in a Strongly Magnetized Cloud 19
"frared wavelengths, i.e., 12 µm and 70 µm. A more"
complete investigation of other infrared wavelengths in
presented in Appendix B. The 12 µm emission usually
suggests thermal dust emission heated by protostars and
70 µm data could reveal deeply embedded protostars
that are undetected at shorter wavelengths. The detec-
"tion status is summarized in Table 3. As can be seen,"
"CR1c5 and CR1c11 are not detected at 70 µm, sug-"
"gesting that they are in a very early evolutionary stage,"
likely prestellar. The detection of CR1c10 is confused
by another adjacent bright source (see Appendix B).
All other cores should have formed a protostar. While
"CR1c3, CR1c7 and CR1c8 are detected at 70 µm, they"
are still very faint and not seen at 12 µ and hence they
should be in a relatively earlier stage compared with

5. SUMMARY
The Vela C cloud is one of the few regions with mag-
netic field mapped through both sub-mm emission po-
larimetry and near-infrared stellar absorption polarime-
"try, and hence an ideal laboratory to study how the"
magnetic field strength affects star formation process.
To investigate how star formation proceeds in a strong
"magnetic field environment, we have observed the Cen-"
ter Ridge 1 (CR1) clump in the Vela C with ALMA
in Band 6 and Band 7. This clump is a high column
density region that shows the lowest level of dust con-
tinuum polarization angle dispersion in the BLASTPol
"survey (Fissel et al. 2016), indicating the presence of"
a strong magnetic field. We identified 11 dense cores
"via their mm continuum emission, with masses span-"
"ning from 0.17 to 6.7 M�. Interestingly, CR1 exhibits"
a relatively low compact dense gas fraction compared
"with other typical clouds with similar column densities,"
which may be a result of the strong magnetic field in
this region and/or that it is in a very early evolutionary
stage of collapse.
"The N2H
+(3-2) and N2D"
+(3-2) lines in this observa-
tion also allow for a precise measurement of the deuter-
ation ratio. In our sample values of Dfrac span from
"0.011 to 0.85 for the dense core sample, with the latter"
being one of the highest values yet detected. A trend
of decreasing Dfrac from the final prestellar to proto-
stellar phases is inferred by comparison to other indica-
"tors, such as presence of outflows and infrared sources."
In addition we also report the detection of an bridging
"feature connecting the two most massive cores (CR1c1,"
CR1c2) in the region in both continuum and spectral
lines. This linear filament is approximately parallel to
"the large scale plane of sky magnetic field orientation,"
and roughly orthogonal to the axes of CO bipolar out-
flows associated with CR1c1 and CR1c2. The kinemat-
ics of this filament likely imply that infall is occurring
onto the cores.
The presented study uses analysis methods for core
identification and characterization from the ALMA
Band 6 data that are the same as employed in stud-
"ies of other star-forming regions, e.g., G286 by Cheng"
"et al. (2018, 2020) and IRDCs by Liu et al. (2018, 2020)."
Future work will aim to extend such studies to other
star-forming environments and thus allow a system-
atic investigation of many aspects of the star formation
process and their dependence on galactic environment.

"A. N2H
+(3-2) SPECTRAL FITTING OF OF CR1C1"
"Under the assumption of constant excitation temperature among the hyperfine components of N2H
+(3-2), the"
brightness temperature can be represented as:
TB(v) = [J(Tex)− J(Tbg)][1− exp(−τ(v))] (A1)
"where J(T ) ≡ hν/k
exp(hν/[kT ])−1 and Tbg = 2.73 K and the optical depths of the multiplets are"
"τ(v) = τtot

(v − vi − vsys)2

, (A2)"
"where Ri and vi are the relative intensity and velocity for the ith hyperfine component, respectively. Figure A.1 shows"
"the best-fit for the N2H
+(3-2) spectrum of CR1c1 and the returned best-fit parameters are displayed on the top right"
corner.
B. INFRARED COUNTERPARTS OF THE CORES IN VELA C CR1
"In order to determine the evolutionary stages of dense cores, we searched for infrared counterparts from near-IR to"
"far-IR bands. We retrieved the datasets in the archive including Spitzer 3.5, 4.5 µm, WISE 12, 22 µm and Herschel"

"Figure A.1. N2H

"underneath the spectrum, also in this velocity frame."
"The dashed red line shows the best-fit spectrum. The returned parameters from fitting (excitation temperature, opacity,
centroid velocity, velocity dispersion) are displayed at the top right corner. The opacity listed is the total opacity by summing"
up the opacities of all the hyperfine components. The peak opacity in the best-fit case is slightly smaller (τpeak = 4.64).
"70, 160, 250, 350, 500 µm maps. For each core we checked the infrared detection at the location and boundary defined"
by the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum to determine if there is a counterpart. Figure B.1 presents a zoom-in view of the
infrared images for each core from 3.6 µm to 250 µm. The detection status is summarized in Table B.1. Detections at
λ > 250 µm are not included here since the spatial resolution is poor and hence it is in general difficult to disentangle
the dense core from the surrounding material.
"As can be seen, CR1c11 is presumably in a very early evolutionary stage, since it is undetected in all infrared"
wavelengths. The detection of CR1c10 is confused by another adjacent bright source. CR1c5 is not seen at wavelengths
"up to 70 µm, but is detected weakly at 160 µm and 250 µm. CR1c3, CR1c7 and CR1c8, which are detected at 70 µm"
"but not shorter wavelengths, are slightly more evolved and should have formed protostars. The remaining sources, i.e.,"
"CR1c1, CR1c2, CR1c4, CR1c6 and CR1c9, are clearly seen in all infrared wavelengths and are thus expected to be of"
the latest protostellar evolutionary stages among the sample.
"For infrared bands that show a counterpart, we also attempt aperture photometry, with the aperture radius fixed to"
be the equivalent radius of the size measured from 1.3 mm continuum. If the aperture radius is greater than half of the
"beam FWHM at the corresponding infrared band, then a flux measurement and associated uncertainty are reported."
With this criterion only for CR1c1 are we able to measure the fluxes in all wavelengths. The aperture photometry
"is done following the method of Liu et al. (2020), i.e., we carry out a background subtraction using the median flux"
"density in an annular region extending from one to two aperture radii, to remove general background and foreground"
contamination. The error bars are set to be the larger of either 10% of the background-subtracted flux density or the
value of the estimated background flux density.

gray lines. Flux values are those from Table B.1. The fluxes in 1.05 mm and 1.3 mm are measured with the same background
subtraction method, with values of 0.298 Jy and 0.147 Jy, respectively."
"To better constrain the physical parameters of dense core, we used Zhang & Tan (2018) radiative transfer models"
(ZT models hereafter) to fit the near-IR to millimeter SEDs towards CR1c1. The ZT model is a continuum radiative
transfer model that describes the evolution of high- and intermediate-mass protostars with analytic and semi-analytic
"solutions based on the paradigm of the Turbulent Core model (see Zhang & Tan 2018, for more details). The main"
"free parameters in this model are the initial mass of the core Mc, the mass surface density of the clump that the core is"
"embedded in Σcl, the protostellar mass m∗, as well as other parameters that characterize the observational setup, i.e.,"
"the viewing angle i, and the level of foreground extinction AV . Properties of different components in a protostellar"
"core, including the protostar, disk, infall envelope, outflow, and their evolution, are also derived self-consistently from"
"given initial conditions. Figure B.2 shows an example of the SED fit for CR1c1, with the parameters for the best"
"five fitted models reported in Table B.2. The best fitted model indicates a source with a protostellar mass of 2 M�
accreting at a rate of 3×10−5 M� · yr−1 inside a core with an initial mass of 10 M� embedded in clumps with a mass
surface density of 0.3 g · cm−2. Note that the ZT models are designed for high-mass star formation and Mc = 10M�
is the minimum core mass explored. Thus there could be other viable protostellar properties, e.g., starting with lower"
"Mc, that have not been explored here."
