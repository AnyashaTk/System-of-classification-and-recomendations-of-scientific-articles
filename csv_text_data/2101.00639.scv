ABSTRACT
"We present VLT−FORS spectropolarimetric observations of the type II supernova (SN) 2012aw taken at seven epochs during the
photospheric phase, from 16 to 120 d after explosion. We corrected for interstellar polarization by postulating that the SN polarization
is naught near the rest wavelength of the strongest lines – this is later confirmed by our modeling. SN 2012aw exhibits intrinsic
polarization, with strong variations across lines, and with a magnitude that grows in the 7000 Å line-free region from 0.1 % at 16 d up
to 1.2 % at 120 d. This behavior is qualitatively similar to observations gathered for other type II SNe. A suitable rotation of Stokes
vectors places the bulk of the polarization in q, suggesting the ejecta of SN 2012aw is predominantly axisymmetric. Using an upgraded
version of our 2D polarized radiative transfer code, we modeled the wavelength- and time-dependent polarization of SN 2012aw. The
key observables may be explained by the presence of a confined region of enhanced 56Ni at ∼ 4000 km s−1, which boosts the electron
density in a cone having an opening angle of ∼ 50 deg and an observer’s inclination of ∼ 70 deg to the axis of symmetry. With this
fixed asymmetry in time, the observed evolution of the SN 2012aw polarization arises from the evolution of the ejecta optical depth,
ionization, and the relative importance of multiple versus single scattering. However, the polarization signatures exhibit numerous
degeneracies. Cancellation effects at early times imply that low polarization may even occur for ejecta with a large asymmetry. An
axisymmetric ejecta with a latitudinal-dependent explosion energy can also yield similar polarization signatures as asymmetry in the
56Ni distribution. In spite of these uncertainties, SN 2012aw provides additional evidence for the generic asymmetry of type II SN
ejecta, of which VLT−FORS spectropolarimetric observations are a decisive and exquisite probe."

1. Introduction
"Photometry and spectroscopy provide critical information on
type II supernova (SN). They characterize, for example, the
timescale over which the energy stored in the ejecta is released,
the color of the escaping radiation, the level of ionization of the
spectrum formation region, and the composition of the ejecta.
Such data do not, however, provide direct constraints on the ge-
ometry of the explosion. Lacking spatially resolved observations
for type II-Plateau (II-P) SNe, spectropolarimetry is the best
technique to provide constraints on the morphology of SN ejecta,
especially at early times (Shapiro & Sutherland 1982). The po-
larization is linear, caused by scattering with free electrons, and
is typically less than 1% in the continuum (Wang & Wheeler
2008). The current spectropolarimetric dataset of type II SNe
is limited to 10− 20 objects, mostly because of the scarcity of
nearby events. Indeed, high signal-to-noise ratio observations are
required to reveal such a low-level of polarization."
"SN 1987A is a hydrogen-rich, core collapse SN classified as
type II-peculiar. Unlike type II-P SNe, which arise from red-
supergiant (RSG) star explosions, the progenitor of SN 1987A
was a blue supergiant star. It is the first SN for which multiepoch
multiband polarimetric observations were obtained (Mendez
et al. 1988; Vidmachenko et al. 1988; Barrett 1988; Cropper
et al. 1988; Jeffery 1991b; Wang et al. 2002). The 0.5% contin-"
"uum polarization level observed in the optical during the first two
months is understood to arise from scattering with free electrons
in a prolate or oblate ejecta (Hoflich 1991; Jeffery 1991a). The
polarization angle shows variations in time and across lines, sug-
gesting some departures from axial symmetry. Overall, an asym-
metric distribution of 56Ni may also account for the observed
polarization (Chugai 1992)."
"Subsequently, spectropolarimetric observations have been
gathered for a number of nearby type II SNe, but now of the
plateau type, starting with SN 1999em (Leonard et al. 2001). For
SN 2004dj, Leonard et al. (2006) collected spectropolarimetric
observations throughout the photospheric and the nebular phase,
up to about a year after explosion. The intrinsic polarization of
the SN was revealed unambiguously by the strong variation in
polarization across lines. Furthermore, the continuum polariza-
tion evolved from being small during the photospheric phase to
being maximum at the onset of the nebular phase, subsequently
decreasing as the inverse of the time squared. Chugai (2006) pro-
posed that the polarization was associated with the excess exci-
tation and ionization originating from the presence of high ve-
locity 56Ni fingers or blobs. Although intimately associated with
ejecta asymmetry, Dessart & Hillier (2011) suggest that the po-
larization peak at the onset of the nebular phase is caused by a
radiative transfer effect as the ejecta turns optically thin, while"

"its subsequent evolution reflects the drop in ejecta optical depth.
Chornock et al. (2010) presented spectropolarimetric observa-
tions for a few more type II SNe, confirming the general trend
observed for SN 2004dj. It thus appears that type II SNe typically
show a temporal increase in continuum polarization through the
photospheric phase, reaching a maximum at the onset of the neb-
ular phase, and subsequently dropping."
"To supplement this dataset, we initiated a VLT−FORS spec-
tropolarimetric program in 2008. Over a number of years, we
gathered multiepoch high quality observations for SNe 2008bk,
2012aw, and 2013ej, as well as a more sparse dataset for a few
additional objects. Although this dataset has been presented in a
terse format previously (Leonard et al. 2012, 2015), we are now
in a position to present the observations in more detail, and with
modeling results. We start in this paper with SN 2012aw."
"In the next section, we summarize the results from the polar-
ization modeling of Dessart & Hillier (2011). Section 3 presents
the numerical approach used for the present study, which is also
presented in detail in Hillier & Dessart (in prep.). As in Dessart
& Hillier (2011), we adopt a 2D axisymmetric ejectum but we
now model the polarized spectrum for the whole optical range
rather than focus on isolated lines and the overlapping contin-
uum. In Section 4 we present the spectropolarimetric observa-
tions of SN 2012aw that we collected with VLT−FORS while
section 5 presents the results of our modeling of SN 2012aw
covering both the photospheric and the nebular phase. In Sec-
tion 6, we investigate the degeneracy of the polarization results
by investigating the impact of our assumptions (magnitude of the
asymmetry, adoption of the mirror symmetry with respect to the
equatorial plane, and nature of the asymmetry). We present our
conclusions in Section 7."
2. Summary of results from Dessart & Hillier (2011)
"Dessart & Hillier (2011) studied the linear polarization in 2D
axisymmetric Type II SN ejecta using a long-characteristic code
as well as a Monte Carlo code. They explored how the intrin-
sic continuum and line polarization change with wavelength,
bound-bound transition, albedo, SN age, or some properties of
the asymmetry. Below, we summarize their results since they are
relevant for the present study and the interpretation of polariza-
tion signatures in general."
"Even though electron scattering produces a gray opacity, the
absorption opacity varies between photoionization edges and
causes a variation of the albedo with wavelength. Consequently,
the continuum polarization in type II SNe may vary across the
optical range. In the modeling, we take this effect into account by
separating the different sources of opacity at each wavelength,
namely electron scattering on the one hand and on the other
hand the bound-bound and bound-free processes (see also Hillier
1994, 1996). Scattering in lines (i.e., bound-bound transitions),
and especially resonance lines, is assumed to be unpolarized.
In reality, line scattering has a polarizing effect but it is much
weaker than the polarizing effect caused by free electrons (Jef-
fery 1991a)."
"The residual polarized flux arises from a non-cancellation
of the local polarization integrated on the plane of the sky. A
net polarization can result from an asymmetric distribution of
scatterers, but it can also stem from an asymmetric distribution of
the flux (for example due to optical-depth effects; Hillier 1994;
Dessart & Hillier 2011; Vlasis et al. 2016; Bulla et al. 2015)."
"Even for large asphericity, a large polarization may not result
because of strong cancellation effects. This situation holds par-
ticularly at early times because of the confinement of the spectral"
"formation region, which favors a low residual polarization. The
integrated polarized flux is also inhibited by multiple scatterings
since these tend to randomize the scattering directions, making
the radiation field more isotropic. These effects suggest that SN
ejecta should produce a small (or at least a smaller) continuum
polarization at earlier times, whatever the level of asymmetry. At
nebular times, when the ejecta optical depth is below unity along
all sight lines, photons typically scatter once with free electrons.
Because of the weaker cancellation effects, this situation pro-
duces a greater residual polarization for a given asymmetric con-
figuration. Under optically thin conditions, the continuum polar-
ization scales linearly with continuum optical depth (Brown &
McLean 1977). Despite these advantages, the faintness of SNe
at nebular times presents a major challenge for spectropolarimet-
ric observations (Leonard et al. 2006)."
"The effects of optical depth can lead to complex polarization
signatures, distinct from what is obtained under optically thin
conditions. One such feature is a sign reversal of the polarization
(equivalent to a 90 deg change in the polarization angle) in the
continuum across the optical range (in part driven by the change
in albedo between the Balmer edge and the Paschen edge), as
well as sign reversals across line profiles and the adjacent contin-
uum. In observations, sign reversals (especially if they are weak)
may be hard to diagnose if the interstellar polarization is not
known accurately. Sign reversals have been seen in spectropo-
larimetric observations of some type II-P SNe (Chornock et al.
2010)."
"In optically thick lines such as Hα, the polarization is gener-
ally zero somewhere between the location of maximum absorp-
tion in the P-Cygni trough and the location of maximum flux
near line center (see for example Figs. 8 and 16 in Dessart &
Hillier 2011, in cases where the zero crossing is associated with
a sign reversal of the polarization). This location may thus be
useful for constraining the interstellar polarization, especially if
other lines can also be used for that purpose (for example the
Ca ii near-infrared triplet or Hβ). In contrast, weak lines may
not cause much reduction to the continuum polarization (for ex-
ample Hδ) and thus only induce an inflection in the continuum
polarization level. In the opposite regime of strong line overlap,
for example in regions of line blanketing, both the total flux and
the polarized flux are strongly reduced."
"For a fixed ejecta asymmetry, the continuum polarization is
expected to reach a maximum when the core is revealed. This
is understood as stemming from the progressive growth of the
extent of the spectrum formation region during the photospheric
phase and the drop in envelope optical depth (favoring single
instead of multiple scatterings). It may occur at fixed asymme-
try, if the asymmetry increases toward the inner ejecta regions,
and may even occur if the asymmetry is confined to the outer,
H-rich ejecta layers. Such a strong increase in continuum polar-
ization has been seen in a few type II SNe (Leonard et al. 2006;
Chornock et al. 2010), and this feature is also present in the SN
that we discuss in this paper. At nebular times, when the total
electron scattering optical depth of the ejecta is below unity, the
continuum polarization is expected to follow a 1/t2 evolution for
a fixed ionization (since the asymmetry and viewing angle do not
change with time; see also Brown & McLean 1977), following
the drop in ejecta optical depth. In SN ejecta, however, devia-
tions from this could arise if the asymmetry varies with depth
and if the ionization evolves in a complicated fashion – for ex-
ample following the growth of the γ-ray photon mean free path
with time."
"All of these conclusions apply to the new models presented
here using the upgraded long-characteristic code (Section 3.3;"

respond to the observed total flux for SN 2012aw obtained with
VLT−FORS in spectropolarimetric mode. The model is redshifted, red-
dened, and then normalized to the observed flux at 7000 Å. The V-band
brightness offset, calculated from the observed photometry (Bose et al.
2013; corrected for distance and extinction) and the model photometry,
is given for each epoch and is typically on the order of 0.1 mag. This
model is named x1p5 in Hillier & Dessart (2019) and is our best match
model for SN 2012aw."
"see also Hillier & Dessart, in prep.). However, they are now more
directly visible since the upgraded code delivers the full polar-
ized spectrum (across the optical or near-infrared range) rather
than just the polarization for a single isolated line and its adja-
cent continuum, as previously done in Dessart & Hillier (2011)."
3. Modeling approach
"The spectropolarimetric modeling we perform in this study re-
quires a few preparatory steps. All simulations are based on 1D
nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (nonLTE) time-dependent
radiative transfer simulations of RSG star explosion models per-
formed with CMFGEN, computed recently for a separate study on
the diversity of Type II SNe (Hillier & Dessart 2019). These
CMFGEN simulations are used as initial conditions for the 2D po-
larized radiative transfer modeling. We use an updated version
of the long-characteristic code described in Dessart & Hillier
(2011). The main improvements are the computation of the full
optical polarized flux as well as extra flexibility for setting up the
2D axisymmetric ejecta (see Hillier & Dessart, in prep.)."
"Here, a 2D axially-symmetric ejecta is built using various ap-
proaches. The first approach is to introduce a latitudinal scaling
to the density (i.e., mass density, ion density, atom density, and
electron density), opacity, and emissivity computed from a 1D
CMFGEN model. The second approach is to “stretch” these quan-
tities in radial space, by an amount that depends on latitude. One
limitation of these two approaches is that the adopted scaling or
radial offset may not reflect well the properties of axisymmetric
and asymmetric ejecta. In the third approach, we assign distinct"

strongly mixed, and to possess a 56Ni shell around 4000 km s−1. With
these modifications it deviates more strongly from the observations of
SN2012aw."
"1D CMFGEN models to a range of latitudes so all latitudes are
characterized by a physical, albeit 1D, model. One may use two
models (defining the properties of the 2D ejecta along the equa-
tor and the pole) or a larger set of models to introduce smaller
scale asymmetries covering a smaller opening angle."
"In this work, we used a combination of approaches. For the
first epoch of spectropolarimetric observations of SN 2012aw,
we explored the influence of a latitudinal scaling or a latitudinal
radial displacement of a 1D model (options 1 and 2 above). This
somewhat artificial approach is not followed further. Instead, the
bulk of the modeling is based on a mapping in latitude of two dis-
tinct 1D CMFGEN models to produce a large scale asymmetry of
the ejecta. This approach is also applied from early to late times
and thus allows one to see the evolution of the SN polarization
for a given asymmetric ejecta. Below, we review the properties
of the 1D CMFGEN models and the various 2D asymmetric (but
axisymmetric) ejecta that we build from these, before describing
in detail how the polarization calculations are performed. The
nomenclature as well as the distinguishing properties of the 1D
and 2D simulations performed in this study are summarized in
Table 1."
3.1. The reference 1D CMFGEN model
"SN 2012aw was studied by Hillier & Dessart (2019) as part of a
large investigation on the origin of the diversity of type II SNe,
in particular in terms of V-band decline rate and spectral diver-
sity during the photospheric phase. The reference model we use
for SN 2012aw is named here 1D-X1 (originally called x1p5 in
Hillier & Dessart 2019) and corresponds to a 15 M� zero age
main sequence star, exploded to yield an ejecta kinetic energy
of 1.2 × 1051 erg, an ejecta mass of 12.12 M�, and a 56Ni mass
of 0.056 M�. Figure 1 illustrates the agreement in the optical
range (the data are from our spectropolarimetric VLT−FORS"

fact that the model is within about 0.1 mag of the observed V
band magnitude throughout the high brightness phase (there is a
similar offset at nebular times; see Hillier & Dessart 2019). This
agreement suggests that a spherical ejecta model yields a satis-
factory match to the photometric and spectroscopic observations
of SN 2012aw. The deviations from spherical symmetry that we
introduce must therefore remain small enough not to deteriorate
the agreement between observations and the results for model
1D-X1."
3.2. 2D-axisymmetric ejecta models
"3.2.1. Application of a latitudinal scaling to the reference
model"
"In this approach, the density ρ at an ejecta location (r, β), where
r is the local radius and β is the polar angle (i.e., the angular
separation from the axis of symmetry), is given by"
"ρ(r, β) = ρ1d(r)B(1 + A cos
2 β) , (1)"
"with B set (in all cases) to 1/(1 + A/3) (chosen so that
∫ 1"
"0
B(1 +"
"A cos2 β) sin β dβ = 1). With this choice, prolate (oblate) den-
sity configurations correspond to a positive (negative but greater
than −1) A value. Other choices are possible. For example, by
varying the exponent on the cosine one can modulate the latitu-
dinal confinement of the asymmetry. This option is not explored
here. With this adopted density scaling, and at a given radius r,"
"opacities and emissivities scale with B2(1 + A cos2 β)2, while the
electron-scattering opacity scales with B(1 + A cos2 β)."
3.2.2. Application of a radial scaling to the reference model
"The second option is to apply a radial scaling of the 1D CMFGEN
model and use the same density, opacity, and emissivities as the
1D CMFGEN model on that scaled grid. For example, the den-
sity (as well as opacities and emissivities) at r along β corre-
sponds to its counterpart in the original 1D CMFGEN model at
r/B(1 + A cos2 β). If the density declines outward, positive (neg-
ative) A values correspond to prolate (oblate) density configura-
tions. For an ejecta characterized by a power-law density with
exponent nρ, the radial scaling causes a maximum density con-
trast between pole and equator of (1+A)nρ . For nρ = 12 (which is
representative of the outer layers of the ejecta in model 1D-X1),
this maximum density contrast corresponds to 14.6 for A = 0.25
and to 130.0 for A = 0.5 (these values are used in two models
presented in Section 5.2). In ejecta regions of constant density, a
radial scaling yields no latitudinal variation in density (in realis-
tic ejecta, the density gradient varies with depth so a stretching
may correspond to complicated variations in density with both
inclination and depth). In contrast, the latitudinal scaling (see
Eq. 1) always introduces a variation in density with latitude, and
this variation between pole and equator has the same magnitude
at any given depth."

These two models vary in the outer ejecta structure, the inner core struc-
ture, and the 56Ni mixing adopted (strong or weak, presence or absence
of a 56Ni-rich shell at a Lagrangian mass of 12 M�, corresponding to a
velocity of about 4000 km s−1 in the resulting ejecta). The two models
have the same mass-density profile outside of the inner ejecta (with the
exception of the regions beyond 10000 km s−1), but different electron-
density profiles because of the different 56Ni profiles."
"3.2.3. Combination of the reference 1D CMFGEN model with
another model"
"In this approach, we build the axisymmetric ejecta assigning dis-
tinct 1D CMFGEN models to the equatorial and to the polar direc-
tions, and interpolate between the models at intermediate lati-
tudes. The mapping of a given model over a range of latitudes
is flexible. Multiple models could also be used but here we use
only two to facilitate the interpretation. We define β1/2 as the
maximum polar angle over which the “polar” model applies."
"Hence, besides the reference model 1D-X1, we used an al-
ternate model 1D-X2b. This model deviates from model 1D-X1
both for the progenitor and for the ejecta. The core material
within the inner 5 M� is made completely homogeneous (this
implies strong mixing) and is also given a fixed density (con-
serving total mass and yields), thereby erasing the jump in den-
sity present in model 1D-X1 at the He-core edge. The progenitor
is enshrouded by a dense extended atmosphere prior to explo-
sion, which produces a lower maximum ejecta velocity as well
as the presence of a dense shell in the outer ejecta. The most im-
portant feature is however the presence of a 56Ni rich shell (in
1D), which we add “by hand” at a Lagrangian mass of 12 M�, so
that it is located around 4000 km s−1 in the resulting ejecta once
homologous expansion is established. In practice, this is done
in the radiation-hydrodynamics calculation with V1D (see Livne
1993 and Hillier & Dessart 2019 for discussion), at 1000 s after
the explosion trigger (and therefore in mass space since the ve-
locity profile has not settled at that time). Because there is very
little mass between 12 M� (or the ejecta location where the ve-
locity is about 4000 km s−1) and the outermost ejecta layers, an
excess in 56Ni (relative to model 1D-X1) is present throughout
the outer ejecta. However, the 56Ni mass fraction remains very
small, typically below 0.01, and the 56Ni is mixed beyond about
2000 km s−1 with a material rich in H and He (the material that
used to be in the H-rich envelope of the progenitor star). Model
1D-X2b corresponds to a (spherically-symmetric) ejecta with a

a 56Ni mass of 0.047 M�."
"Figure 2 compares the spectral properties of model 1D-X2b
with the observations of SN 2012aw in the optical range. Be-
cause of the adjustments made, the resulting SN radiation differs
sizably from that obtained for model 1D-X1, and thus deviates
from SN 2012aw. This was the goal, and is in line with the ear-
lier findings of Chugai (2006). In model 1D-X2b, the stronger
mixing and the presence of a 56Ni shell at 4000 km s−1 (added
to give a source of asymmetry in a 2D ejecta; see below) both
lead to a stronger and broader Hα line in the second half of the
plateau phase. The Hα mismatch suggests that there is no strong
56Ni mixing along all ejecta-centered directions, but that strong
56Ni mixing, if present, must be limited to a modest solid an-
gle. The lower 56Ni mass also causes an underestimate of the
optical brightness compared to SN 2012aw. As long as model
1D-X2b covers a small fraction of the whole 2D ejecta volume,
the global ejecta and radiation properties should primarily reflect
those of model 1D-X1. We compare the ejecta properties and the
bolometric light curves of the 1D models 1D-X1 and 1D-X2b in
Fig. 3."
"In most of the simulations we adopt mirror symmetry with
respect to the equatorial plane. Model 1D-X2b is assigned the
polar directions and model 1D-X1 is assigned the equatorial di-
rection. The properties at intermediate latitudes is flexible. In the
reference setup described in Section 5, model 1D-X2b represents
the ejecta for all polar angles between zero and 22.5 deg. Be-
yond 33.75 deg, we use model 1D-X1 instead. In between these"

2D-X1-X2b at 44 d after explosion. We use model 1D-X2b up to 25 − 30 deg, and model 1D-X1 beyond. The vertical corresponds to the axis of
symmetry, so polar angle β of zero and 180 deg, and the horizontal corresponds to the equatorial direction. This axisymmetric ejecta has mirror
symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane. The black label along the one o’clock direction gives the radial velocity in units of 1000 km s−1.
The ejecta asymmetry stems from the asymmetric distribution of 56Ni, as well as differences in the outer ejecta (through the presence of a dense
RSG progenitor atmosphere or not) and differences in the inner ejecta (complete mixing and smoothing of the He core material) – see Fig. 3 and
Section 3.2.3 for details."
"two angles, we linearly interpolate in cos β. This interpolation
applies to all relevant quantities for the 2D radiative transfer and
in particular the opacities and emissivities. We thus interpolate
between two physically consistent 1D CMFGEN models (also de-
rived from physically consistent radiation-hydrodynamics sim-
ulations of the explosion). This is superior to using one 1D
CMFGEN model and applying some density scaling or radial scal-
ing on its properties (see previous two sections). Figure 4 illus-
trates some of the properties of the resulting 2D ejecta. The left
panel shows the normalized electron density (in the log base 10)
at 44 d after explosion. With this setup, we can explore the con-
figuration for an enhanced 56Ni abundance confined to a narrow
range of latitudes. Such a configuration is known to yield a resid-
ual polarization (Chugai 2006)."
"This setup is not an exact representation of what may occur
in nature. Detailed 3D simulations of neutrino-driven explosions
suggest that the 56Ni material may be asymmetrically distributed
in a complicated structure of blobs, shells, fingers, elongated to-
ward large velocities, and made of essentially pure 56Ni (Wong-
wathanarat et al. 2015). This material is macroscopically mixed
in space during the dynamical phase of the explosion, so that
it may coexist at a given velocity with H-rich material but it is
not microscopically mixed with it. In our present approach, we
instead apply a macroscopic and a microscopic mixing so that
both 56Ni and H-rich material coexist at a given velocity. This
approach is perhaps not as problematic as it seems since, with
respect to the polarization of light, it is the influence of 56Ni on
the electron density that matters. As time passes, the γ-rays as-
sociated with the radioactive decay of 56Ni and 56Co are less effi-
ciently trapped locally, and the more so for the 56Ni advected out
to large velocities during the explosion. Thus, the volume influ-
enced by this decay heating extends beyond that occupied by the
56Ni-rich material. An illustration of this effect is presented in
Dessart et al. (2012), in particular their Figs. 1 and 2. Hence, the"
"configuration corresponding to an extended cocoon of enhanced
ionization (and thus electron density) around any pure 56Ni blob
is well captured by our setup."
3.3. Our approach for polarization modeling
"The simulations presented in this study were performed with
the long characteristic code LONG_POL first implemented to treat
continuum (Hillier 1994) and line (Hillier 1996) polarization in
the context of multiscattering axisymmetric envelopes of hot star
winds. This code was subsequently extended to treat the case of
Type II SN ejecta (Dessart & Hillier 2011) but limited to solving
for the polarized flux for an individual line and its overlapping
continuum."
"The code has since been improved in two important ways
(Hillier & Dessart 2020, in prep.). First, the code now computes
the full optical polarized spectrum and is thus no longer limited
to a single line. This implies that line overlap is automatically
treated, irrespective of the number of overlapping lines. Second,
the code is no longer limited to 2D ejecta produced by the lat-
itudinal density scaling or radial stretching of a precomputed
1D CMFGEN model. We can now also combine a set of precom-
puted 1D CMFGEN models, assigning a given model to a specific
range of latitudes. The benefit from this latter approach is the
improved physical consistency since the opacities and emissiv-
ities imported into LONG_POL are those from the precomputed
nonLTE 1D CMFGEN models. This is less artificial than prescrib-
ing an asymmetry through parametrized scalings. A remaining
weakness is that we still interpolate between 1D models at a
given latitude. Further, the opacities and emissivities (with the
exception of the electron-scattering emissivity) assigned to this
2D ejecta are not computed from a fully consistent 2D nonLTE
model. Practically, the 2D radiative transfer is performed as a
formal solution (i.e., with the opacities and emissivities fixed)."

"Note: All observations were obtained at the VLT using the 300 line/mm grism (“GRIS_300V”) along with the “GG435” order-
sorting filter to prevent second-order contamination. This resulted in a useable spectral range of 4350 Å− 9200 Å. All observations
were made through a 1′′.0 slit, which delivered a resolution of ∼ 12 Å, as derived from the FWHM of night-sky lines. The flux
standard used for all observations was BD+26◦2606 (Oke & Gunn 1983), observed on the same nights as the science observations.
All observations were made with the position angle of the spectrograph slit set to 0 deg, which often differed significantly from the
parallactic angle (Filippenko 1982); when coupled with the relatively narrow slit used, the potential for differential light loss – and,
hence, inaccurate relative flux calibration – is significant.

"In LONG_POL, the polarization is produced by electron scat-
tering and described by the Stokes parameters I, Q, U, and V
(Chandrasekhar 1960). The polarization is thus linear and V is
identically zero. We use the same nomenclature as in Dessart &
Hillier (2011) and define the corresponding flux-like polariza-
tion quantities FI , FQ, and FU output by the code (the calcula-
tions are done in Il, Ir, U and V space where Il = 0.5(I + Q),
Ir = 0.5(I − U); see Hillier 1994 for details) – the definitions
of these various quantities are given in Section 2 of Dessart &
Hillier (2011). The geometry of the axisymmetric ejecta is de-
scribed with a right-handed set of unit vectors (ξX , ξY , ξW ). The
origin is the center of the ejecta, the axis of symmetry lies along
ξW , ξY is in the plane of the sky, and the observer lies in the XW
plane (Hillier 1994, 1996). We adopt the same sign convention
as in Dessart & Hillier (2011). The flux FQ is positive (negative)
when the polarization is parallel (perpendicular) to the symme-
try axis. Because of the imposed axial symmetry and the adopted
orientation, FU is zero. Hence, the polarization fluxes that we
present from our simulations with LONG_POL will be limited to
FQ and to P = 100 × |FQ|/FI (and thus corresponding to a per-
centage), where FI is the total flux. To keep with the convention
in spectropolarimetric observations, the normalized Stokes pa-
rameters q and u are defined as q = FQ/FI and u = FU/FI . In
this study, we only discuss the flux-like polarized quantities ob-
tained with LONG_POL. We refer the reader to Dessart & Hillier
(2011) for a discussion of the maps of the polarization intensi-
ties on the plane of the sky for various asymmetric configura-
tions and wavelengths. In general, because of the very low level
of polarization from asymmetric SN ejecta, these polarization
intensity maps are difficult to analyze."
"For a LONG_POL calculation, we first construct the 2D ejecta
(see Section 3.2). The initial information in this 2D model con-
sists of radius, density, velocity, electron scattering opacity, ab-
sorptive opacity as well as emissivity for the selected range of"
"wavelengths. The 2D ejecta is mapped with about one hundred
radial points1 and nine polar angles between pole and equator
(equally-spaced; mirror symmetry with respect to the equatorial
plane is by default assumed). The radiation field I at each ejecta
location (r, β) is discretized in azimuth φ and latitude θ. We use
thirteen φ angles while the latitudinal rays are set according to
the impact parameter. Fourteen points (or rays) are used to cover
uniformly from the ejecta center to the innermost ejecta radius,
and the radial grid is used beyond that to define the impact pa-
rameter."
"In LONG_POL, most of the computing time is taken by a
nested β and φ angle loop (in which the 2D radiative transfer
equation is solved for). This section is parallelized with MPI and
LONG_POL is run with NβNφ processors (hence typically of order
a few hundred processors). Convergence is reached after 20− 30
iterations, although the total and polarized fluxes change little
after about ten iterations. This convergence is faster and bet-
ter for optically thin ejecta since the amount of scattering is in
that case much reduced. A fully converged model takes approx-
imately 24h with 200 processors (or 400 processors if mirror
symmetry is not adopted)."

thus equally spaced in optical depth scale. However, the two models
used may present a recombination front at a different radius. Because
the same radial grid is used along all latitudes, it must be augmented to
resolve any recombination front along any latitude.

S/N, becoming larger in the P-Cygni troughs and smaller in the peaks.) We overplot the adopted interstellar polarization based on a Serkowski
law (Serkowski et al. 1975; Cikota et al. 2017) derived by assuming that the intrinsic polarization is zero at the regions of the strong, consistent,
depolarization seen near the flux emission peaks of Hβ, Na iD, Hα, and the Ca ii near-infrared triplet at epoch 6 (thick black line; see Section 4.2

spurious polarization features being introduced by interpolating
the counts in fractional pixels at the edges of narrow extraction
apertures (see Leonard et al. 2001). We subtracted a linear inter-
polation of the median values of background windows on either
side of the object from the object’s spectrum; for consistency,
the “sky” background region was set for all extractions to be

exception was made for the final, seventh epoch, where poor see-
ing necessitated that a more remote sky region (± 8′′.75 : 3′′.75)
be used to assure minimal object light in the sky window. Each
spectrum was then wavelength and flux-calibrated, corrected for"

"We formed the normalized Stokes q and u parameters and
their statistical uncertainties for each complete sequence of ob-
servations according to the methods outlined by Miller et al.
(1988) and Cohen et al. (1997). For each observational sequence,
we derived results using both the optimal and standard extrac-
tions separately, and then compared them to each other. In gen-
eral, the two extraction algorithms yielded virtually identical re-
sults, and so the optimal extractions were preferred due to their
(slightly) higher signal-to-noise ratio and ability to discount mi-
nor cosmic ray strikes. However, in certain spectral regions that
contained particularly sharp spectral features that also affected
the “sky” region (e.g., regions of strong telluric absorption or,
more rarely, severe cosmic-ray strikes across the spatial profile
of the object on the CCD), the optimal extraction algorithm pro-
duced spurious features in the polarimetry that were not found
in the standard extraction results (and, were not consistent from
one observational set to the next on the same night). Presum-
ably, such features occur due to a breakdown of the assumption
of a “smoothly varying” spatial profile for the object, which un-
derlies the successful application of the optimal weighting algo-
rithm (Horne 1986). This occurred quite frequently at the telluric
“A-band” feature near 7600 Å; in one instance, it also occurred
in the vicinity of a particularly bad cosmic-ray strike. In these
limited regions (typically"
"∼
< 40 Å), the standard extraction’s po-"
"larimetric results were inserted; otherwise, the results derived
from the optimal algorithm were used."
"The fact that multiple, identically obtained, complete obser-
vational sequences were taken at nearly all epochs (see Table 2)
permitted us to perform valuable tests on the reduced data and
calculated uncertainties. To build confidence in our calculated
statistical uncertainties, we utilized the data for epoch 3, for"
"which 13 complete, independent, and identically obtained sets
were acquired, and subjected them to the following test. First,
we computed for each 5Å wavelength bin the 1σ spread of val-
ues from all 13 sequences for a Stokes parameter (we took the
normalized Stokes q); in principle, this should give a rough es-
timate of the 1σ uncertainty for each single set of data. (The
calculated mean uncertainty derived in this way across the en-
tire spectrum was ∼ 0.25% per bin.) We then compared this with
the statistical uncertainty computed through our algorithm for a
single observational sequence, and found the two estimates to
agree with high precision: The mean difference between the two
calculations was less than 0.01% across the spectrum. With con-
fidence in our calculated statistical uncertainties, then, we per-
formed a final check on the veracity of all statistically signifi-
cant features seen in the polarimetry at all epochs (except epoch
2, for which only one complete set was obtained; see Table 2) by
intercomparing the individual sequences’ results, carefully ex-
amining each one for spurious features not seen in the others."
"We then corrected all data for the small (
∼
< 0.1%) amount of"
"instrumental polarization known to exist at the VLT (Cikota et al.
2017). To correct for the wavelength dependence of the mea-
sured polarization angle induced by chromatism of the retarder
plates, we applied the chromatic zero angle correction provided
by the VLT website4 to all data. In addition, we checked the
absolute zero-point of the derived polarization angle in the sky
coordinate system on each night by observing polarized stan-
dard stars from the lists of Clemens et al. (1990; HD 127769)
and Cikota et al. (2017; Hiltner652; BD-144922; HDE316232;
and Vela1). With the exception of the final (seventh) epoch, all
polarized standard stars’ derived polarization angles (in the V-
band; nominal wavelength range of 5050− 5950 Å) agreed with
the cataloged values to within 0.6 deg. On the seventh epoch,

"the polarization angle derived for HD 127769 differed from the
value reported by Clemens et al. (1990) by 2.4 deg; the cause for
this discrepancy is not known, although we do note the unusu-
ally poor seeing (Table 2) and short exposure time for the star
(one second per waveplate position; more typical of other nights
was 3− 5 seconds) on this night. In all cases, including this final
epoch, we kept the nominal polarization angle derived directly
from the data, and did not apply any overall zero-point offset
based on our observations of polarized standard stars. To check
for instrumental polarization beyond that already accounted for
through application of the linear relations provided by Cikota
et al. (2017), we also observed the null polarization standard
HD 109055 (Clemens et al. 1990; Berdyugin et al. 1995) at every
epoch, and always found it to be null to within 0.05%."
"For each epoch, the normalized Stokes q and u parameters
derived from all complete observational sequences were com-
bined according to their statistical weights, with new uncertain-
ties calculated. We then removed the interstellar polarization de-
rived in Section 4.2, removed a redshift of 778 km s−1 (de Vau-
couleurs et al. 1991, via NED), rebinned to 5 Å bin−1, and cre-
ated a final, rest-frame dataset with a wavelength range of 4350
Å – 9150 Å. We also computed results binned to 15, 25, 50 and
100 Å bin−1 for presentation purposes. To generate the total flux
spectrum for each epoch, a final correction for telluric absorption
bands (Wade & Horne 1988) was made."
"To illustrate the continuum polarization as a function of time
we show in the left panel of Fig. 6 the normalized Stokes q
and u measurements for all seven epochs in three spectral re-
gions devoid of strong lines around 6000, 7000, and 8000 Å. All
measurements lie in a single quadrant of the (q, u) plane, and to
first order lie along a straight line. The biggest departure from
a straight line occurs for the data at 120 d. The offset is signif-
icant, although the data at this epoch also has the worst signal-
to-noise ratio. If SN 2012aw were axisymmetric all polarization
data would lie along a straight line in the (q, u) plane, and, in
the absence of interstellar polarization, would pass through the
origin. The presence of a dominant axis in the data sets indicates
that SN 2012aw must possess a strong degree of axial symmetry.
However, the scatter (and in some cases one could argue for an
epoch dependent offset) of the polarization observations about
the straight line indicate the structure cannot be simply axisym-
metric."
"A study of the polarization behavior for Hα (right panel of
Figure 6) yields a similar conclusion to that reached using the
continuum polarization. Again, all measurements lie in a single
quadrant of the (q, u) plane, and to first order lie along a straight
line. As for the continuum, it is the observations at 120 d that
show the largest offset. Because of the presence of a dominant
axis, we rotate the observations so that the bulk of the polariza-
tion lies in q (Section 4.3). This has the consequence that sign
reversals in q can easily be seen in the same plot, whereas such
reversals are not seen in P and imply a 90-deg change in the
angle of polarization."
4.2. Interstellar polarization
"Correcting for interstellar polarization is a delicate problem with
no perfect solution. In this study, we attempted two different
techniques that rely on quite different theoretical assumptions."
"Our first approach was to assume that the intrinsic polariza-
tion of the SN is zero at the first epoch; thus, all observed po-
larization should be due to the ISP. Theoretically, this may be
motivated by the fact that instabilities, born in the progenitor"
"core during the explosion or at the H/He interface after shock
passage, influence little the outer ejecta. Unfortunately, there is
clearly some variation in polarization across lines even at the ear-
liest epoch, incompatible with the expected smooth featureless
polarization from the interstellar medium. Nonetheless, we fit a
spline to the “continuum” regions (i.e., those away from strong
line features) as a first estimate of the ISP."
"For our second approach we considered the theoretical pre-
diction that during the optically thick, “photospheric” phase
of an SN II’s development (up through about day ∼ 115 for
SN 2012aw, when its light curve begins to drop off of the plateau;
Bose et al. 2013), broad, unblended emission features (e.g., Hα,
the Ca ii near-infrared triplet) may possess zero intrinsic SN
polarization (e.g., Trammell et al. 1993; Hoeflich et al. 1996;
Dessart & Hillier 2011). If complete depolarization of all SN
light (line and continuum) has occurred in such spectral re-
gions — a further assumption commonly employed to estimate
the total ISP in SN studies (e.g., Howell et al. 2001; Leonard
et al. 2006; Nagao et al. 2019) as well as polarization stud-
ies of emission-line stars (e.g., Meyer et al. 2002) — then any
measured polarization there is due solely to ISP. For multiepoch
data, this should present as fixed, unchanging levels of polariza-
tion (and, polarization angle) with time in these spectral regions,
since ISP does not change appreciably over the timescales in-
volved whereas intrinsic SN polarization may."
"Examination of Fig. 5 shows that the expectation is quite
well realized empirically for SN 2012aw, where sharp, consis-
tent, depolarizations are seen for several strong lines, including
Hα, Hβ, Na iD, and the Ca ii near-infrared triplet. That is, while
nearby regions of the spectrum vary by up to ∆P ∼ 1.5 % through
the observational sequence, these spectral regions remain consis-
tent to within ∆P ∼ 0.1 %. Motivated by this consistency, we fit a
Serkowski law (Serkowski et al. 1975) through the strong depo-
larizations seen in Hα, Hβ, Na iD, and the Ca ii near-infrared
triplet to the epoch 6 data (similar results were found using
epochs 3 to 7). Using these four spectral locations as a reference
for the interstellar polarization, we searched for the set of values
for λmax,ISP, qmax,ISP, and umax,ISP that produced the best fitting
curve given by a Serkowski law. Each qmax,ISP, and umax,ISP cor-
respond to θISP and pmax,ISP through"
"θISP = 0.5 arctan(umax,ISP/qmax,ISP) (2)"
"pmax,ISP = qmax,ISP cos(2θISP) + umax,ISP sin(2θISP). (3)"
"The wavelength dependence of the interstellar polarization is
then given by"
"pISP(λ) = pmax,ISP exp
(
− KISP ln"
"2(λmax,ISP/λ)
)
, (4)"
"where KISP = 1.13 + 0.000405λmax,ISP (Cikota et al. 2018), with
λmax,ISP given in Angstrom units. With this approach, the best
fitting values for SN 2012aw are λmax,ISP = 5535Å, qmax,ISP =
−0.12%, umax,ISP = −0.43%, or pmax,ISP = 0.45%, θISP = 127◦.
We then obtain"
qISP(λ) = pISP(λ) cos(2θISP) ; uISP(λ) = pISP(λ) sin(2θISP). (5)
"While both estimates of the ISP have weaknesses, we en-
couragingly found them to agree to better than ∼ 0.2% over
the full spectral range covered by our observations. We ulti-
mately adopted the ISP described by our second approach and
proceeded to correct all spectropolarimetric observations of SN"

Luc Dessart et al.: Modeling of the SN 2012aw spectropolarimetric obsvervations
"2012aw by it. However, given the difference between our es-
timates, we expressly recognize that a ∼ 0.2 % systematic un-
certainty in the absolute level of all calculated “intrinsic” po-
larizations exists in all that follows.5 Fortunately, since the ISP
is a smooth function of wavelength, this uncertainty in its ab-
solute value has no effect on interpretation of specific line fea-
tures, which is the main focus of this work. Further, as the de-
gree of continuum polarization ultimately seen in SN 2012aw
approaches ∼ 1.2 % in the latest epochs, the effects of a 0.2 %
uncertainty do not qualitatively alter our fundamental conclu-
sions regarding the overall polarization level when comparing to
our models."
"Adopting this interstellar polarization and focusing on the
spectral range between 6900 and 7200 Å (Fig. 5), SN 2012aw
yields a nonzero polarization even at the earliest times, al-
though interpretation of this is tempered by the fact that its
value, ∼ 0.2 %, is of order our systematic uncertainty in the ISP.
SN 2012aw then shows a strong temporal increase in polariza-
tion during the second half of the plateau phase, reaching a
maximum of about 1.2% as the SN starts plunging in bright-
ness and transitioning to the nebular phase. This has been seen
in SN 2004dj (Leonard et al. 2006), SNe 2006ov and 2007aa
(Chornock et al. 2010), SN 2008bk (Leonard et al. 2012), and
2013ej (Leonard et al. 2015). SN 2012aw could not be observed
at nebular times as it went behind the sun. It was too faint when
it later emerged."
4.3. Rotation of the Stokes fluxes
"For an axially symmetric ejecta the polarization (at all times and
at all wavelengths) lies on a diagonal line in the (q, u) plane
which passes through the origin. Since the slope of this line sim-
ply reflects the orientation of the ejecta symmetry axis on the
plane of the sky, one can rotate it so that all the polarization lies
in q. This then allows a direct comparison with our model cal-
culations in which all the polarization lies in q. In observations,
noise and departures from strict axial symmetry leave a residual
signal in u even after such a rotation has been applied."
"Hence, when we compare to our polarization results for ax-
isymmetric models, we apply a rotation of the observed Stokes
vectors by an angle θrot = 0.5 arctan(δu/δq), where δu and δq
are measured in the (q, u) plane. This is done to put most of the
observed polarization in q. The rotated fluxes are then given by"
qrot = q cos(2θrot) + u sin(2θrot) (6)
urot = −q sin(2θrot) + u cos(2θrot). (7)
"The data of SN 2012aw, corrected for interstellar polariza-
tion, yield an observed polarization angle of 118 deg in the plane
of the sky. However, we choose to rotate the Stokes vectors by
the angle orthogonal to this – that is, of 28 deg – in order to
produce a sign of the rotated Stokes vectors that agrees with the
models, for ease of comparison (rotating through an angle 90 deg
different simply changes the sign of the polarization). With this
rotation, the bulk of the polarization is now in q, and u is gener-
ally close to zero. This works with only modest success at early
times when the polarization level is low, but it seems suitable for
epochs four and later, as shown in the next section."
"5 Given this uncertainty in the ISP, one should not over-interpret, for
example, the presence of small sign flips in the data."
"5. Modeling results and comparisons to
observations of SN 2012aw"
"As discussed in Section 3.2, we used three different ways to in-
troduce the asymmetry in our 2D ejecta. In the first two sections
below, we describe the results for the first epoch adopting a lat-
itudinal density scaling (Section 3.2.1) or a latitudinal stretch-
ing (Section 3.2.2) of a 1D CMFGEN model. In the subsequent
section, we use the combination of two models (Section 3.2.3)
and compare to all observed epochs of SN 2012aw (Section 4).
For clarity, we call these models the scaled model, the stretched
model, and the hybrid model."
"Throughout this section, we present multipanel figures that
have the same structure. The top panel shows the total flux FI
for both the model and the observations (normalized to unity
at 7100 Å). The next two panels show the normalized, rotated
Stokes parameters qrot and urot (we plot the percentage value),
also corrected for interstellar polarization (see previous section).
Finally, the bottom panel shows the percentage polarization P
for both the observation (black) and the model (colors other than
black). The model results are sometimes shown for all inclina-
tions. The inclination of zero degree yields zero polarization.
The other inclinations are spaced uniformly every 11.25 deg, col-
ored from blue to red (colorblind rainbow colormap) as the in-
clination is increased."
"Compared with the simulations presented in Dessart &
Hillier (2011), the present simulations provide the total and po-
larized flux spectrum over the entire optical range. We explicitly
account for line overlap or blanketing and can directly compare
to the optical VLT−FORS spectropolarimetric data that we col-
lected for SN 2012aw."
5.1. Results with the latitudinal density scaling at early times
"Figure 7 compares the observations of SN 2012aw at the first
epoch (16.1 d after explosion) with models in which a latitudinal
density scaling has been applied to the 1D CMFGEN model 1D-
X1. The left panel shows the results for A = 0.5 and the right
panel for A = 4.0 (see Eq. 1), corresponding to a density con-
trast at a given radius of 1.5 and 5.0 between pole and equator
(prolate density configurations). The simulations assume mirror
symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane. For both mod-
els, the asymmetry introduces only a minor change with inclina-
tion for the total flux FI (top panel). The polarized flux FQ (or
equivalently q) is positive throughout most of the optical range,
which means that the electric vector is parallel to the symmetry
axis. This is an optical depth effect because in the optically-thin
regime, FQ would be negative in this case. Switching to an oblate
configuration would result in a sign change of the polarization
(rotation of the polarization angle by 90 deg). In absolute terms,
the polarized flux is here greater where the flux is greater. The
percentage polarization is also greater at shorter wavelengths,
albeit modestly. Theoretically, one may expect a greater polar-
ization at shorter wavelength because of the greater albedo to-
ward the Balmer edge (Dessart & Hillier 2011), especially at
this young SN age when the material in the spectrum formation
region is at least partially ionized. The polarization changes be-
tween lines and continuum, as well as within the lines. We see a
sign reversal of the polarization in Hα, and for many lines in the
case of a stronger asymmetry (right panel of Fig. 7). For a large
scaling (A = 4.0), the model P rises to a maximum of 0.6% in
the largely line-free region between Fe ii 5169 Å and Hα."

ing epoch differs in a number of ways from the model predic-"

"tions. It is greater at redder wavelengths, although at this epoch
the polarization is quite low, and only about 0.2% at 7000 Å,
thus significantly lower that the maximum value obtained with
the models discussed above (about 0.6%). Observations also re-
veal a sizable change in polarization across Hβ and Hα, but not
other lines (perhaps because the data are too noisy). While Hβ
and Hα in the models also show polarization, the structure does
not match the observations. In q the model shows an enhanced
polarization in the P Cygni absorption component (not seen in
the observations), and the polarization absorption trough is off-
set from that observed. In P, the models show a very compli-
cated structure which contrasts with the relatively smooth struc-
ture seen in the observations. The difficulty in interpreting this
epoch is exacerbated by the uncertainties in the interstellar po-
larization, the low level of polarization, and the significant signal
that remains in the rotated u parameter."
5.2. Results with the latitudinal stretching at early times
"For an asymmetric ejecta resulting from a radial stretching of the
1D CMFGEN model 1D-X1 (see section 3.2.2 for explanations),
the results are quite different from models with a latitudinal den-
sity scaling (Fig. 8). The changes to the total flux are greater than
for the models with the density scaling. The flux FI at 7100 Å
increases by 40% (90%) as we vary the inclination from 0 to
90 deg in model 2D-X1-STR0p25 (2D-X1-STR0p50; see Sec-"
"tion 3.2.2 for details on the nomenclature). Once we renormal-
ize the spectra at 7100 Å, the variation with inclination appears
mostly in lines in the form of a wavelength shift. This shift is
more noticeable in model 2D-X1-STR0p50. The polarization is
also overall lower. Varying the magnitude of the radial stretching
changes little the resulting polarization, despite the large den-
sity contrast between pole and equator (corresponding to val-
ues of 14.6 and 130.0 for models 2D-X1-STR0p25 and 2D-X1-
STR0p50 since the ejecta follow a power-law density with ex-
ponent twelve in the outer regions). In both cases, we see strong
sign reversals of the continuum polarization when the inclina-
tion is changed. There are also strong reversals of the polariza-
tion across line profiles for inclinations corresponding to low lat-
itudes (near equator-on views). Such signatures are likely due
to optical depth effects with a complicated cancellation of the
local polarization on the plane of the sky. These can occur at
early times because asymmetry impacts the distribution on the
plane of the sky of both the scatterers and the flux. Hence, for
the case of a latitudinal stretching, the model fails to reproduce
the greater polarization at longer wavelengths, is unable to re-
produce the level of polarization observed, and fails to match the
structure across Hα."

"5.3. Results with a bipolar explosion using a combination of
1D CMFGEN models"
"In this section, we use two distinct 1D CMFGENmodels to build an
asymmetric ejecta. The ejecta are symmetric with respect to the
equatorial plane so it corresponds to a bipolar explosion in which
a cone of opening angle 50 deg along the symmetry axis is char-
acterized by distinct properties relative to lower latitudes. In our
setup, the difference is the steeper density fall-off beyond about
10,000 km s−1 and the larger 56Ni content within the H-rich lay-"
"ers of the ejecta (see Fig. 3). In the context of polarization, the
main impact of the 56Ni enhancement is not the change in opac-
ity or abundance (both have a minor influence) but instead the
boost it induces to the density of free electrons (the mass density
below about 10,000 km s−1 hardly changes with angle, so the im-
pact is on the ionization). Hence, there is at least one source of
asymmetry at any given velocity, which implies that this setup
may produce a net polarization at any epoch. The initial condi-
tions used in this case are presented in detail in Section 3.2.3,
to which we refer the reader for additional information (see also
Fig. 3−4)."
"One way to characterize the asymmetry of our ejecta is by
comparing the photospheric radius along the pole and along the
equator. Although our hybrid model is made of the same com-
bination of 1D ejecta at all epochs computed, the gas properties
evolve and in a distinct way along the polar and the equatorial
directions. The 56Ni enhancement affects mostly the innermost
ejecta layers, so the asymmetry should be weak early on and
grow as the inner aspherical ejecta layers are revealed by the re-
ceding photosphere. Consequently, in our hybrid model, the ratio
of polar and equatorial photospheric radii evolves from 1.02, to
1.08, 1.22, 1.36, 1.59, 1.52 and 1.26 as the SN ages from 16.1,
to 46.0, 63.0, 71.9, 91.9, 107.9, and 120.0 d."
"Another method for illustrating the structure is with the
shape factor defined by Brown & McLean (1977) which (to-
gether with the optical depth and the inclination) fully describes
the continuum polarization properties of an axially-symmetric
ejecta illuminated by a point source. In this paper, we introduce"

"around 4000 km s−1 and within the opening angle β1/2 generates
a local enhancement in free-electron density. The contrast grows
in this region at all epochs and should boost the polarization level
as time passes. Another striking property is that the asymmetry,
as revealed by the shape factor, is really confined within the re-
gions beyond 2000 km s−1, which are H rich. In contrast, the
metal-rich core is moderately asymmetric."
"In Figs. 10− 11, we compare the multiepoch spectropolari-
metric observations of SN 2012aw with the results of the 2D po-
larized radiative transfer code based on this new axisymmetric
ejecta configuration (the figure layout is the same as that used in
Fig. 7). Figure 10 shows the results for the first four epochs (at
16.1, 46.0, 63.0, and 71.9 d after explosion), and Fig. 11 shows
the results for the last three epochs (91.9, 107.9, and 120.0 d af-
ter explosion) together with the predictions of the model at 160 d
(for which there is no data). The later epochs are better suited
for analyzing the SN polarization since the polarization level is
higher and the data has a higher signal to noise ratio. The vari-
ations across lines are better resolved. For this comparison, we
selected the inclination of 67.5 deg since it yielded a good match
to the observations at all epochs except the first one."
"At the first two epochs, the observed polarization is low,
about 0.1 − 0.3 %. This polarization level is roughly matched by
the hybrid model but the rise of the polarization at longer wave-
length (more obvious at the first epoch) is not predicted (as for
the previous calculations described in Sections 5.1 and 5.2). This
rise in the red toward the Paschen jump is hard to comprehend
as there are no obvious discontinuities in this region. If anything,
the albedo decreases smoothly so the polarization is expected to
drop as scattering weakens toward the red. This peculiar feature
may arise from a cancellation effect due to the competing influ-
ence of flux and optical depth (i.e., between the asymmetry of
the emission and of the scatterers as seen on the plane of the
sky)."
"At later epochs (63 to 107.9 d), the hybrid model cap-
tures the qualitative and the quantitative evolution observed in
SN 2012aw, both for the total flux (and thus photometry) and for
the polarized flux. This is obtained without any adjustment to the
ejecta structure so that the change in polarization arises from the
intrinsic evolution of the 2D ejecta as they expand and cool etc."
"Across the profile of a strong line, the polarization is ex-
pected to show a jump in the blue part of the P-Cygni profile
trough. This is observed in Na iD and the Ca ii near-infrared
triplet, but rarely in other lines. In contrast, the model shows this
as a narrow feature in most lines, including Hα. The difficulty of
observing this feature is aggravated by the rebinning of the data,
which was used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio per bin. The
feature originates from the deficit of unscattered (direct and thus
unpolarized) flux from the SN while the residual flux arises from
photons scattered back into the line of sight. In an asymmetric
ejecta, such scattered photons yield a net polarization. In the Ca ii
near-infrared triplet, the model shows the polarization jump fur-
ther to the blue than in the observations. Close inspection of the
total flux FI shows that the model overestimates the width of the
Ca ii near-infrared triplet line at late epochs (more so at epochs
5, 6 and 7), so the mismatch in q or P is probably rooted in the
slight overestimate by the model of the ejecta expansion rate."
"In strong lines, the polarization is zero or close to zero some-
where between the P-Cygni trough and the location of maxi-
mum flux. This feature of line depolarization was used earlier
to constrain the interstellar polarization toward the line of sight
to SN 2012aw. It is clearly observed at all epochs (more so for
epochs three to seven) in Hβ, Na iD, Hα, and the Ca ii near-
infrared triplet. It is also reproduced by the model. This results"
"from the depolarization of line photons. Recombination lines
emit photons isotropically and thus cannot produce a net polar-
ization. The large line optical depth also leads to absorption of
possibly polarized photons, thereby destroying the polarization
they carried. The line photons that scatter with free electrons
within the ejecta can however produce a residual polarization.
However, this is associated with a redshift (because of the large
bulk velocity of the scatterers) so this polarized flux appears in
the red wing of each line.7"
"As we move to the red wing of lines, the polarized flux is
large, and larger for stronger lines. This arises from line photons
scattered by free electrons. The effect yields an excess total flux
in the red wing of all lines. Because of the asymmetry of the dis-
tribution of free electrons, it also yields a clear polarized flux FQ,
whose strength scales with FI . However, P is at the same level
in the red wing of lines and in the adjacent continuum. This sug-
gests that line photons and continuum photons pick up the same
level of polarization when they last scatter in the ejecta (and that
statistically they bear the same level of polarization before that
last scattering). The observed polarization behavior across lines
is quite distinct in type Ia SNe (the metal-rich composition im-
plies a lower number of free electrons per unit mass and a re-
duced importance of electron scattering for the opacity), which
show a maximum polarization within the absorption trough of
the strongest lines and a low level of polarization elsewhere (see,
e.g., Wang et al. 2003)."
"In general there is good agreement between the observed and
theoretical line profiles, especially after the first two epochs. One
discrepancy is that the model profiles exhibit a larger variation
in polarization at the blue edge of the P Cygni absorption than
do the observations. Particularly striking is the agreement for the
polarization across the O i 7774 Å multiplet. In the flux spectrum,
O i 7774 Å is an inconspicuous spectral feature. However, in both
the observed and model polarization (after the first two epochs)
it is conspicuous, and is only slightly less prominent than the
feature due to Hα."
"In the continuum, the level of polarization increases with
wavelength in the optical range, although this effect, which is
matched by the model, is quite weak. At late times (epochs four
to seven), in the region of line blanketing shortward of 5000 Å,
the model predicts no clean (line free) continuum region so
strong line depolarization occurs. In the red part of the spectrum,
and in particular between Hα and O i 7774 Å, the continuum po-
larization shows a smooth and near-constant magnitude both in
the observations and in the model (the model shows fluctuations
associated with weak lines, such as the Ca ii 7300 Å doublet).
This is the spectral region where it is maximum at any given
epoch."
"Other discrepancies convey some important information on
the source of polarization and departures from what is adopted
in the hybrid model. Clearly visible at epochs 5 and 6 is the over-
estimate of the polarized flux associated with the scattered and
red-shifted Hα photons, appearing as a bump in q or P. In con-
trast, the observations suggest the same level of polarization for
these photons and the adjacent continuum-only photons further
to the red. This mismatch is, however, only so obvious in Hα and
not, for example, in Na iD. The origin of the discrepancy might
be an inadequate 56Ni distribution which causes a too extended"
"7 If the scattering was done by an external scatterer at rest, such as a
distant dust sheet, line photons could be associated with a residual polar-
ization even at line center since the scattering process would introduce
no velocity shift."

continuum polarization measurements of SN 2012aw displayed in this plot, due to the uncertainty in the ISP."
"boost to the electron density (for example, a more localized en-
hancement in 56Ni at large velocity may be more suitable)."
"Another important discrepancy, which could be related to the
point discussed in the previous paragraph, is the lack of model
polarization in the blue part (say < 5500 Å) of the spectrum at
the recombination epoch (epochs 3 and later). The observations
reveal a lower polarization than around 7000 or around 8000 Å,
but only by about half. The model shows low or zero polariza-
tion because the polarized photons from the inner asymmetric
ejecta are destroyed by interactions with lines (these regions are
strongly affected by line blanketing due to Fe ii and Ti ii). One
simple way of resolving this issue is to invoke a more distant,
that is a more external scattering source, for example in the form
a higher velocity 56Ni enhancement. In this context, this exter-
nal scatterer would yield a polarization that would scale with the
number of incoming photons. The polarization in the blue could
then be slightly smaller than at long wavelength because of the
residual influence of line opacity at large velocities in the ejecta."
"In the comparisons shown in Figs. 10 and 11, the observed
polarization (second and third panels from top) was rotated so
that the bulk of the polarization lies in the flux FQ. Doing this,
the flux FU is close to zero and shows only modest variations
with wavelength, in contrast to what is observed in FQ (this is
more easily seen at late epochs when the polarization in line-
free regions reaches 0.5 to 1.0%). At all epochs except the first
one, the flux FQ is negative at all wavelengths in both the model
and the observations. Together with the fact that FU is close to
zero and much smaller (in magnitude) than FQ, this property
suggests that the ejecta is primarily axisymmetric. This property"
"is also evident from the data distribution in the (q, u) plane shown
in Fig. 6."
"Figure 12 summarizes the evolution of the continuum polar-
ization (taken from the averaged value over the range 6900 to
7200 Å) as well as the V-band brightness for both SN 2012aw
and for the hybrid model discussed in this section. The model
matches well the light curve for the plateau duration and bright-
ness, and for the tail brightness. This occurs because the asym-
metry has little effect on the total observed flux – the hybrid
model displays the same light curve and spectral evolution as
the spherically symmetric model 1D-X1 (with the exception of
a slight overestimate of the Hα line strength and width). The hy-
brid model also matches the low level of polarization at early
times and its steep rise in the second half of the plateau. The
hybrid model then predicts that the continuum polarization will
drop at late times, essentially following the drop in optical depth.
Under optically-thin conditions, the polarization scales linearly
with τ (Brown & McLean 1977) and in SN τ drops as 1/t2 at
late times (assuming constant ionization). Such an evolution has
been observed over a sizeable timeline (Leonard et al. 2006) and
explained by polarization modeling (Dessart & Hillier 2011)."

tions for the aspherical (2D axisymmetric) ejecta. Here, we study
the sensitivity of our results to changes in the 2D ejecta structure

section, we describe the results when the half opening angle of
the cone is increased (Section 6.1), when we drop the assump-
tion of mirror symmetry (equivalent to comparing a bipolar and a
unipolar explosion; Section 6.2), and when the explosion energy
of the ejecta in the polar regions is increased (Section 6.3)."
6.1. Variation with cone opening angle in the hybrid model
"Figure 13 shows the influence of the half opening angle β1/2
on the radiative signatures for model 2D-X1-X2b at 107 d. In
this particular setup, model X2b extends from the pole up to
β1/2 of 11.25, 22.5, or 33.75 deg. For an inclination of 67.5 deg,
we find that the normalized polarized flux (middle panel of
Fig. 13) is qualitatively independent of β1/2, while quantitatively,
the percentage polarization increases with β1/2 (bottom panel of
Fig. 13). For lower inclinations, optical depth effects cause a sign
flip (rotation by 90 deg) of the polarization FQ for different val-
ues of β1/2. Such optical depth effects complicate the analysis
of the observed polarization during the photospheric phase. Fur-
thermore, the polarization increase with increasing β1/2 occurs
up to a half opening angle of about 60 deg, beyond which the
configuration is somewhat equivalent to swapping model X1 and
X2b for a half opening angle of π/2 − β1/2."
6.2. Unipolar versus bipolar explosion in the hybrid model
"Figure 14 shows the results for the hybrid model 2D-X1-X2b
with and without the assumption of mirror symmetry. The an-
gle β1/2 is 22.5 deg and the inclination is 67.5 deg with respect
to the symmetry axis. With mirror symmetry, the ejecta has a
bipolar morphology, with the properties of model X2b along the
poles. Without mirror symmetry, the ejecta is unipolar so that
model X2b only covers polar angles smaller than 22.5 deg. In
Fig. 14, we adopt an inclination of 67.5 deg. In this case, the"

"Fig. 14. Same as Fig. 13, but now showing the impact of the assumption
of mirror symmetry. With (without) mirror symmetry, the ejecta (or the
explosion) is bipolar (unipolar). [See Section 6.2 for discussion.]"
"model with mirror symmetry (i.e., bipolar explosion) shows a
percentage polarization in the 7000 Å region that is more than
twice greater than when mirror symmetry is ignored (i.e., unipo-
lar explosion). The offset differs from a factor of two because of
optical depth effects. For example, for an inclination of 10 deg,
the percentage polarization is the same in both cases because
the asymmetry from the receding part of the 2D ejecta is ob-
scured. For an inclination of 45 deg, the level of polarization is
very different (sign flip, different absolute polarization level) be-
tween the two cases, again because of optical depth effects. For
an inclination of 90 deg (edge on), the percentage polarization
in the 7000 Å region is exactly twice larger if mirror symme-
try is assumed rather than ignored. In the mirror-symmetry case,
each hemisphere contributes the same residual polarization and
the same flux at any wavelength. Without mirror symmetry, only
one hemisphere contributes, yielding exactly half the continuum
polarization level obtained with mirror symmetry. Finally, what-
ever the inclination, the total flux FI is essentially identical in
both cases."
6.3. Influence of explosion energy in the hybrid model
"Figure 15 compares the ejecta and radiative properties of the hy-
brid models 2D-X1-X2b and 2D-X1-X2B, which differ in that
the polar regions have an enhanced 56Ni mass fraction (for-
mer model) or an enhanced explosion energy (latter model). Al-
though these two asymmetric ejecta are produced by very dif-
ferent means, they yield very similar total and polarized fluxes.
The reason is that in the polar direction, the higher explosion en-
ergy leads to a greater density at large velocities. Although the
ionization is the same along all latitudes (because of the simi-
lar influence of the deeply embedded 56Ni), the electron density
varies with latitude, reflecting the variation in mass density (see
left panel of Fig. 15). This polar enhancement in electron den-
sity (not caused by an excess in 56Ni), produces the continuum"
"Article number, page 18 of 20"
Luc Dessart et al.: Modeling of the SN 2012aw spectropolarimetric obsvervations
"polarization in model 2D-X1-X2B. In contrast, the mass density
in model 2D-X1-X2b is essentially constant with latitude but the
greater 56Ni mass fraction along the pole yields a greater ioniza-
tion and thus a greater density of free electrons along the poles
than at lower latitudes. The results in Fig. 15 indicate that such
distinct physical processes (polar enhanced 56Ni mixing or polar
enhanced explosion energy) yield a very similar polarization sig-
nal. This emphasizes the degeneracy of polarization signatures."
7. Conclusion
"We have presented VLT−FORS spectropolarimetric observa-
tions of the type II SN 2012aw spanning seven epochs of the pho-
tospheric phase until the onset of the drop-off from the plateau.
Unfortunately, no spectropolarimetric observation of SN 2012aw
was made during the nebular phase. SN 2012aw presents po-
larization characteristics that are qualitatively and quantitatively
similar to what has been observed in type II SNe so far, such as
the emblematic SN 2004dj (Leonard et al. 2006). A generic prop-
erty of Type II SNe, corroborated here with 2012aw, is the rel-
atively low polarization early in the plateau phase (although see
the counter-example of SN 2013ej; Leonard et al. 2015; Mauer-
han et al. 2017, or SN 2017gmr; Nagao et al. 2019) and the
progressive rise to a maximum polarization of about 1 % as the
ejecta turns optically thin at the end of the high-brightness phase.
By rotation of the Stokes vectors, it is possible to place most
of the SN 2012aw polarization along a single, fixed polarization
axis, which implies that the ejecta of SN 2012aw has a dominant
axis and that the polarization arises from ejecta with an oblate or
prolate morphology."
"We have modeled the SN 2012aw linear polarization using
a long characteristic code that assumes axial symmetry (Hillier
1994, 1996; Dessart & Hillier 2011; Hillier & Dessart 2021).
The code provides the full optical total and polarized flux FQ
(for symmetry and geometry reasons, FU is zero) at any epoch
during the photospheric or nebular phase. At present, the favored
operation mode for the code is to build a 2D axially-symmetric
ejecta using two 1D CMFGEN models and assigning them a spe-
cific range of latitudes. Such a hybrid 2D model can thus mimic
an explosion with a higher energy or a higher 56Ni mass fraction
along specified latitudes."
"Our modeling results support the notion that the intrinsic po-
larization is negligible within strong lines somewhere between
the location of maximum absorption and the location of maxi-
mum line flux. We use this property to correct for the interstel-
lar polarization. With this choice, the intrinsic polarization of
SN 2012aw is small but non zero at the earliest epochs."
"The parameter space for producing 2D hybrid models is ex-
tended since we may use any 1D CMFGEN from the large set of
models that we have calculated for type II SNe. We also have
freedom when assigning a given model and a given latitude.
Having selected two models and a specific model-latitude as-
signment to produce a 2D ejecta, the same setup is used for
all epochs. No further adjustment is made to the setup during
a sequence of polarization calculations. In the present paper, we
focused on one hybrid model composed of model 1D-X1 (also
named x1p5 in Hillier & Dessart 2019) and of model 1D-X2b,
which deviates from model 1D-X1 by having enhanced 56Ni
mixing at large velocities. For an inclination of ∼ 70 deg, we
find that this hybrid model can reproduce the SN 2012aw po-
larization at all epochs except the first two, without any adjust-
ment. The model predicts the polarization is maximum in the line
free region between Hα and O i 7774 Å, and also reproduces the
variation in polarization across line profiles. The model predicts"
"negligible polarization in line blanketed regions, while the ob-
servations suggest a nonzero residual polarization. However, the
wavelength and time variation of the polarization is reproduced
by the model, reflecting the internal changes in the correspond-
ing ejecta (expansion, recession of the photosphere, cooling, re-
combination, reduction in density etc). As is well known (e.g.,
Jeffery 1991a), we also find that the polarization signatures are
degenerate so other configurations can also reproduce the obser-
vations.
