White dwarfs that accrete the debris of tidally disrupted asteroids1 provide the opportunity
"to measure the bulk composition of the building blocks, or fragments, of exoplanets2. This"
technique has established a diversity in compositions comparable to what is observed in the
"solar system3, suggesting that the formation of rocky planets is a generic process4. Whereas"
the relative abundances of lithophile and siderophile elements within the planetary debris can
"be used to investigate whether exoplanets undergo differentiation5, the composition studies"
carried out so far lack unambiguous tracers of planetary crusts6. Here we report the detec-
"tion of lithium in the atmospheres of four cool (< 5, 000 K) and old (cooling ages 5–10 Gyr)"
"metal-polluted white dwarfs, where one also displays photospheric potassium. The relative"
abundances of these two elements with respect to sodium and calcium strongly suggest that
all four white dwarfs have accreted fragments of planetary crusts. We detect an infrared
"excess in one of the systems, indicating that accretion from a circumstellar debris disk is on-"
"going. The main-sequence progenitor mass of this star was 4.8± 0.2 M�, demonstrating that"
"rocky, differentiated planets may form around short-lived B-type stars."
"The accurate astrometry of the Gaia mission7 enabled the identification of nearby, intrinsi-"
"cally faint white dwarfs against much more numerous luminous background stars8, and spectro-"
scopic observations of practically all 524 northern white dwarfs within 40 pc are now complete9.
"We have detected absorption of the lithium 6,708 Å doublet in the spectra of three cool (Teff <"
"5, 000 K) white dwarfs (Fig. 1) within this sample (LHS 2534, WD J231726.74+183052.75,"
"WD J182458.45+121316.82), revealing the presence of this lithophile element within their photo-"
spheres.
"The 6,708 Å doublet of neutral lithium is the only strong transition of this element at opti-"
"cal wavelengths, and because of the low ionization energy of lithium (5.4 eV), it becomes rapidly"
undetectable in hotter white dwarfs. Inspecting the published spectroscopy of cool white dwarfs
"at distances beyond 40 pc10, 11, we identified a fourth system (SDSS J133001.17+643523.69) ex-"
hibiting lithium absorption.
Spectroscopy of planetary bodies accreted into the pristine hydrogen or helium atmospheres
"of white dwarfs provides direct measurements of their bulk abundances2, similar to the analysis of"
meteorites to determine the composition of solar system planets12. All four stars with photospheric
"lithium also exhibit sodium and calcium lines (Fig. 1), enabling a comparative study of the volatile"
"and refractory content of their accreted planetesimals. The planetesimals, or fragments thereof, are"
most likely scattered via gravitational interactions with more massive bodies from several au into
the tidal disruption radius of the white dwarf13. An alternative way of delivering planetary material
"to the white dwarf is the Kozai-Lidov mechanism in wide binaries14, however, we do not detect"
wide companions for any of the four stars discussed here in Gaia DR2.
The observational data available for these objects were analyzed using a model atmosphere
code that has been specifically developed to correctly treat the complex physics in the high-density
atmospheres of white dwarfs15. We fitted the effective temperature (Teff) and the stellar radius
"using published broad-band photometry and parallax (see Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1), and"
"subsequently determined the photospheric abundances using spectroscopy (Extended Data Fig. 2),"
with the procedure repeated until convergence (Extended Data Fig. 3). The analysis of LHS 2534
required additional effort as the star exhibits a magnetic field of 2.10 MG (see Methods). We
"measured the atmospheric parameters and lithium, sodium and calcium abundances for all four"
"stars, and also detected magnesium, potassium, chromium and iron in LHS 2534. The effective"
"temperatures, Teff = 3, 350–4, 780 K, are among the lowest of any debris-accreting white dwarfs10,"
reflecting the selection effect imposed by the neutral lithium detection.
We compare the abundance ratios of log(Li/Na) vs. log(Ca/Na) of the four white dwarfs
"with those of the Sun12, the bulk Earth16, the continental crust17 and CI chondrites12 (Fig. 2a). All"
"four objects reside within a cluster, with log(Ca/Na) between −1 and 0, and log(Li/Na) between"
"−2.5 and −1. Because of the rapid burning of lithium in the young Sun, the solar abundance is"
several orders of magnitude below those of the four white dwarfs and solar system planetary com-
positions. The composition of the planetary debris within the four systems is noticeably enhanced
"in both lithium and depleted in calcium with respect to the solar system planetary benchmarks,"
and most closely resembles the abundances found in the continental crust. The unusually large
log(Li/Na) and low log(Ca/Na) ratios can be partially explained via differential diffusion of met-
"als out of the convection zones since the end of the accretion episode, caused by the different"
elemental sinking timescales.
"We computed sinking timescales for each detected element18 (see Methods, Extended Data"
"Fig. 4), and indicate the evolution of LHS 2534, WD J2317+1830, and WD J1824+1213due to dif-"
ferential evolution in Fig. 2a (note the increased step sizes for WD J2317+1830 and
"WD J1824+1213). For LHS 2534, depending on how long ago accretion stopped, the parent body"
abundances could be consistent with those of the continental crust (≈ 2 Myr) or CI chondrites
"(≈ 3.5 Myr). At ' 8 Myr, log(Ca/Na) approaches the bulk Earth value, but log(Li/Na) would"
be about an order of magnitude too low. This degeneracy is broken by the additional detection
"of potassium in LHS 2534. The relative abundances of the alkali metals lithium, sodium, and"
"potassium are entirely incompatible with either those of bulk Earth or CI chondrites, independent"
"of the accretion history (Fig. 2b). Instead, combined constraints from the lithium and potassium"
abundances are consistent with LHS 2534 having accreted a fragment of planetary crust around
2 Myr ago. Whereas the other three white dwarfs with photospheric lithium lack potassium de-
"tections, their close clustering near LHS 2534 in log(Li/Na) vs. log(Ca/Na) strongly suggests"
"that they, too, are contaminated by fragments of planetary crust. A similar analysis is possible for"
"WD J1824+1213 and SDSS J1330+6435, though only considering log(Li/Na) vs. log(Ca/Na)"
"as potassium is not detected. Their past trajectories point closely towards the bulk Earth, however"
"this origin requires many diffusion timescales to have elapsed, necessitating extremely massive"
parent bodies. It is therefore much more probable that smaller parent bodies were more recently
accreted19 with compositions corresponding to particularly Li-rich crust. WD J2317+1830 re-
quires a different analysis due to its very short diffusion timescales (see below).
"To investigate the compositional diversity among cool white dwarfs, we selected for compar-"
"ison three additional cool white dwarfs (5,000–5,800 K) with published high-quality optical spectra"
"that do not show the lithium 6,708 Å line19 (SDSS J0744+4649, SDSS J0916+2540,"
"SDSS J1535+1247, see Extended Data Fig. 5). We established upper-limits for their photospheric"
"lithium abundances, and measured calcium and sodium abundances following the same methodol-"
ogy as outlined above. All three stars are distinctly offset from the cluster of Li-rich white dwarfs
in the log(Li/Na) vs. log(Ca/Na) diagram (Fig. 2a). Their log(Ca/Na) ranges from broadly re-
sembling CI chondrites to a value exceeding that of bulk Earth. This corroborates our hypothesis
that the four white dwarfs with photospheric lithium are accreting planetary debris with a clearly
"distinct, crust-like, composition."
"Crust-like debris compositions have been suggested previously5, 19, based on the detection of"
"large calcium and aluminum abundances. However, both elements also have relatively high mass"
"fractions within the mantle of a differentiated planet, and whereas the interpretation of calcium and"
"aluminum-rich material as signatures of differentiation is certainly plausible6, it does not support"
"a definitive detection of crust fragments. In contrast, the mass fraction of the alkali metals lithium,"
potassium and sodium is one to two orders of magnitude higher in the Earth’s continental crust
"than in its mantle20, making them unambiguous tracers of planetary crusts."
"Given that the photospheric abundances reflect the composition of the entire convection zone,"
"in which the material remains homogeneously mixed, it is possible to estimate lower limits on the"
accreted planetary body masses. The properties of the outer convection zones (Extended Data
"Fig. 4) depend sensitively on the white dwarf mass and log(H/He) ratio, and vary only mildly as"
function of Teff within the narrow range spanned by the four stars. The masses of the individual
elements contained within the convection zones are reported in Extended Data Fig. 4. Scaling
the sodium mass contained within the convection zone by its mass fraction of 2.4 per cent in the
"continental crust of the Earth17, we estimate the minimum masses of the crust fragments accreted"
into these white dwarfs to be in the range 5 × 1017–3 × 1020 g. This compares to ' 4 × 1025 g
"for the Earth’s continental crust17, hence the observed level of atmospheric contamination requires"
only relatively small splinters of the crust of an Earth-like planet.
"WD J2317+1830 has a small outer convection zone, due to its large mass and mixed hydro-"
gen/helium atmosphere (Extended Data Fig. 4). The sinking timescales within WD J2317+1830
"are therefore on the order of thousands of years, much shorter than the millions of years typical"
of cool helium-atmosphere white dwarfs21. Because accretion episodes are expected to last for
105–106 years22 it is therefore likely that WD J2317+1830 is still in the process of accreting from
a circumstellar debris disk. This hypothesis is supported by the detection of an infrared excess
"(Fig. 3a), which is consistent (see Methods) with a flat, passive, optically thick disk of dust heated"
by the white dwarf1. The infrared excess is detected in the UKIRT K and WISE W1 and W2
"bands. For comparison, we selected 116 white dwarfs within 130 pc from the Gaia DR2 white"
"dwarf catalog8 and cross-matched them with WISE detections, with the further requirement of"
"W1 − W2 uncertainties < 0.05 mag. WD J2317+1830 is a clear outlier, presenting a 4-sigma"
excess in W1−W2 (Fig. 3b). The proper motions for WD J2317+1830 measured from the WISE
"observations obtained from 2010 to 201623 agree with those determined by Gaia7, corroborat-"
ing the association of the WISE fluxes with the white dwarf. This makes WD J2317+1830 the
"coolest, and oldest white dwarf with a debris disk detection24. The infrared excess of the disk is"
LIR/Lwd = 0.06.
"Assuming that WD J2317+1830 is in accretion-diffusion equilibrium21, the mass flow rates"
through the bottom of the convection zone are identical to the accretion rates from the debris
"disk, which we compute (see Methods) to be 760 g s−1, 92,000 g s−1, and 37,000 g s−1 for lithium,"
"sodium, and calcium. Adopting that sodium accounts for 2.4 per cent of the accreted mass (for con-"
"tinental crust abundances17) implies a total accretion rate of ' 3× 106 g s−1, broadly in agreement"
with the expected rate driven by the low Poynting-Robertson drag exercised by this cool white
dwarf on the dust25 and is consistent with the rates (105–1011 g s−1) observed for other accreting
"systems26. These estimates do not account for 3D effects within convective white dwarf envelopes,"
and recent work27 suggests that these effects may result in higher accretion rates than found from
the 1D calculations we used.
There are currently few undisputed detections of planets with host star masses
"≥ 3.1 M�28, 29. Using the empirical initial-to-final mass relation30, the high mass of"
"WD J2317+1830 provides a probable indication that main-sequence stars as heavy as 4.8±0.2 M�,"
"corresponding to B-type stars, form planetary systems and that they survive to white dwarf stage."
"Note that despite the relatively short main sequence lifetime of the progenitor, second genera-"
"tion planet formation can largely be ruled out, as Li-burning on the main sequence would result"
"in Li-poor planetesimals, unlike those observed here. WD J2317+1830 is also one of the oldest"
"systems known to have formed differentiated rocky planets, with a 9.5 ± 0.2 Gyr cooling age and"
9.7±0.2 Gyr total age. These mass and age measurements provide constraints for planet formation
models that are extremely difficult to achieve from observations of planets around main-sequence
"or giant stars29, and the detection of a debris disk at WD J2317+1830 demonstrate that plane-"
"tary systems, or what is left of them, can remain dynamically active for practically the age of the"
Galaxy.
Lithium enrichment of giant stars has been previously interpreted by the accretion of giant
planets engulfed during the red giant phase31 and lithium has been identified in the atmosphere of a
giant exoplanet via transmission spectroscopy32. The detection of lithium within white dwarf pho-
tospheres originating from the accretion of planetary crust fragments represents an important link
"to the overall evolution of planetary systems, providing the sensitivity to establish the composition"
of the crusts of differentiated rocky planets.

Methods
Identification and observations. Three of the stars with lithium detections were found among
our observations of white dwarfs within 40 pc9 while the fourth one was identified from its SDSS
spectrum11.
"LHS 2534 is a nearby white dwarf located 38 pc away, and represents the first discovered"
magnetic metal-contaminated white dwarf33. The Zeeman effect from the 2.1 MG magnetic field10
splits the photospheric lines into multiple components. For most transitions (where fine structure
"interactions are much weaker than that of the magnetic field), this results in three components sep-"
arated by 98.0 cm−1 (46.686 cm−1 MG−1 in general). On 2019 January 14 we obtained spectra of
"LHS 2534 using X-Shooter, an intermediate resolution echelle spectrograph mounted on the Very"
"Large Telescope (VLT) at Paranal. Two exposures of 1,250 s each were taken in the UVB and VIS"
"arms, with 1.0 and 0.9 arcsec slit widths used respectively. All data were reduced using the standard"
procedures within the REFLEX (http://www.eso.org/sci/software/reflex/) reduction tool developed
"by ESO. Telluric line removal was performed on the reduced spectra using MOLECFIT34, 35. The"
"X-Shooter spectra clearly reveal the Li I 6,708 Å line Zeeman-split into three components, where"
the depths of the π and σ components reach 0.14 and 0.10 of the continuum respectively.
We observed WD J2317+1830 on 2018 September 2 using the OSIRIS spectrograph on the
Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) during service mode observations as part of our International
Time Programme (ID ITP08). We used the R1000B grating with a 1 arcsec slit-width providing a
"resolving power of ' 1, 000 as measured from the sky-spectrum. Debiasing, flat-fielding, and ex-"
http://www.eso.org/sci/software/reflex/
"
traction of the 1D spectra were performed using packages from the Starlink collection of software."
Wavelength and flux calibration were performed using Molly (http://deneb.astro.warwick.ac.uk/phsaap/software/).
"As the service mode flux standards were observed with a wider slit-width (2.5 arcsec), the quality"
"of flux calibration and telluric removal were generally poor, though this did not affect the quality"
"of our subsequent fits, as the continuum is well defined. The two strongest features of the spectrum"
"are the Na I 5,893 Å doublet and the Li I 6,708 Å doublet (Fig. 1). The Ca I 4,227 Å line is also"
detected though it is much weaker.
"WD J1824+1213 was observed on 2018 August 7/8, again as part of our ITP, using the"

"and a relatively broad Ca i 4,227 Å line (Fig. 1)."

The detection of photospheric lithium in the SDSS spectrum of SDSS J1330+6435 raised the
possibility that other cool white dwarfs with lithium lines in their SDSS spectroscopy may have

"
hitherto gone unnoticed. We therefore carried out a search for lithium-bearing cool white dwarfs,"
"extracting the 37,259 white dwarf candidates with SDSS spectroscopy from the Gaia DR2 white"
"dwarf catalog8. We removed 7,396 objects that were classified by the authors as quasars on the"
base of their SDSS spectroscopy.
"We ran an automated search on the 29,863 remaining spectra, which simply put, involved"
"fitting a Gaussian profile at the expected wavelength of the Li I 6,708 Å line, and then measuring"
"the significance. More specifically, we clipped each spectrum to the range 6,610–6,810 Å, which"
"we then normalized via a fit with a first-order polynomial, excluding the region 6,690–6,730 Å."
"At the low resolution of the SDSS spectroscopy (R ' 2, 000), the Li I 6,708 Å doublet is not"
"resolved, and we therefore fitted it with a Gaussian with a width of σ = 5 Å, where the amplitude"
"of the Gaussian was the only free parameter. Given the width of the Gaussian, even large radial"
velocity shifts of 200 km s−1 are contained well within the fitted profile. We visually inspected all
spectra where the amplitude-parameter was measured to a significance of > 5σ in the direction of
"absorption, and where the reduced χ2 was less than 2.0."
This process easily recovered SDSS J1330+6435 with an amplitude of 7.3σ and a reduced
χ2 = 1.033. After removing multiple false positives (mostly magnetic hydrogen-atmosphere white
"dwarfs with B ' 7 MG where the σ+-component coincides with Li I 6,708 Å), we did not identify"
any additional white dwarfs with conclusive lithium absorption.
Atmospheric analysis. The spectra and available photometry were analyzed using the Koester
LTE model atmosphere code15. Some improvements to the code have been implemented since its
"use in previous publications, several of which are relevant to this work. Improvements to the equa-"
tions of state have been made to accommodate the very cool nature for these stars (WD J1824+1213
"in particular). Additionally, a unified profile for the Ca I 4,227 Å resonance line broadened by neu-"
tral helium is now used. Our calculations used the potentials and dipole moments provided by
Thierry Leininger and recently presented with similar profile calculations37.
For the photometric fitting we made use of a wide range of photometry (Extended Data
"Fig. 1). This included wherever available Pan-STARRS38, SDSS39, and SkyMapper40 in the optical."
"In the infrared we used 2MASS41, 42, UKIRT43–45, and WISE46. Note that for the latter, we have"
made use of the recent catWISE catalog23 which provides W1 and W2 detections for all four stars
discussed here.
"Prior to the photometric fit, we converted all magnitudes to the AB scale. However we"
"chose to exclude the Gaia photometry, because when using the provided AB zero-points, we found"
"consistent disagreement with other optical photometric surveys, i.e. SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and"
Skymapper (which were always found to be mutually in agreement). In addition to the main
"parameters of Teff and radius, the parallax is included as a dummy parameter, with the Gaia values"
serving as Gaussian priors. This has the desired effect of correctly folding the parallax uncertainty
"into our radius estimates, and to some extent into the Teff estimates. The hydrogen and metal"
"abundances were included in the models used in the photometric fits, though with their values"
"fixed (to become free parameters for the spectroscopic fitting, where the Teff and radius are fixed"
"instead). The model fluxes, Fν(λ), were scaled by the radius and parallax, and synthetic AB"
"magnitudes, m, were calculated from"
"〈Fν〉 =
∫"
"dλFν(λ)S(λ)/λ∫
dλS(λ)/λ"
"m = −2.5 log10(〈Fν〉/3, 631 Jy), (2)"
where S(λ) is the energy-counting filter response curve. The atmospheric parameters were then
fitted via χ2-minimization between the observed and synthetic magnitudes. For these nearby white
"dwarfs, the effects of interstellar reddening can be considered negligible. An important caveat"
"regards the photometric uncertainties, which for some of the deep surveys such as Pan-STARRS,"
"can be as small as a few mmag. These data tend to dominate the fit, and result in unrealistically"
small uncertainties (< 10 K on Teff). It is therefore important to note that these photometry may
"have a relative precision at the mmag level, in particular when derived from stacked multi-epoch"
"observations, however, the absolute fluxes have additional systematic uncertainties. To account for"
"this, we added a constant systematic uncertainty to all available photometry of a given object. The"
magnitude of this systematic uncertainty was varied until the best-fit had a reduced χ2 of one. We
"found values of' 0.04 mag were required for LHS 2534, WD J2317+1830, and WD J1824+1213."
"SDSS J1330+6435 is sufficiently faint (the photometric errors are sufficiently large), that this step"
was not necessary.
"For the spectroscopic fitting, we used fixed Teff and radius values derived from the pho-"
"tometric fit. The surface gravity, log g, was calculated from Teff and the radius using the white"
dwarf mass-radius relation47. For LHS 2534 and SDSS J1330+6435 where the atmospheric hy-
"drogen content is trace at most, we adopted the thin hydrogen mass-radius relation, whereas for"
"WD J2317+1830 and WD J1824+1213 which have mixed hydrogen/helium atmospheres, we used"
"thick hydrogen relation instead. The flux calibration of our spectroscopy is of variable quality,"
"therefore for WD J2317+1830 and WD J1824+1213 (where the continuum is well defined), at"
"each step in the least-squares fit, we performed a local normalization of the data, fitting a spline"
to the ratio of the observed spectrum and the model in order to re-scale the spectral fluxes. For
"LHS 2534 and SDSS J1330+6435, we instead re-calibrated the spectral fluxes against the avail-"
able optical photometry fitting the difference between observed and synthetic photometry with
2nd order polynomials.
These spectroscopic and photometric fits were then iteratively repeated until convergence
was found between the two solutions. The abundance errors obtained from the covariance matrix
"of the spectroscopic fits only considered the statistical uncertainty around a fixed Teff , and so were"
typically unrealistically too small (e.g. < 0.03 dex). Therefore the spectroscopic fits were repeated
"with the best fit Teff increased by 1σ, with the subsequent shift in abundances added in quadrature"
to the statistical uncertainties.
"Additional details for each object are summarized in the following sub-sections, including"
any departures from the general approach described above. The final results for all four white
dwarfs are compiled in Extended Data Fig. 2. The best fitting models to each of the stars are
shown in Extended Data Fig. 3.
"Analysis of LHS 2534. As the brightest of our four objects, LHS 2534 has a multitude of photom-"
"etry, covering its entire spectral energy distribution (SED). However, the main challenge to fitting"
"this object is its 2.1 MG magnetic field. Our models are intrinsically non-magnetic, therefore to"
"improve the accuracy of our fits within this limitation, we triplicated the majority of spectral lines,"
"reducing the log gf values by log10(3) for each component. Exceptions are the Ca II, and Mg II"
resonance lines for which we used pre-computed unified line profiles.
"With the higher resolution spectroscopic data, we immediately determined that the Zeeman"
"triplet located between 5,100–5,300 Å is in fact not from Mg I33, but rather Cr I as the central"
"component has a rest-frame (air) wavelength of 5,207 Å. However, we note that the σ+ component"
"of Mg I is possibly visible at 5,155 Å with its other components blended with Cr I. The magnesium"
"abundance is further constrained from the red wing of the 2,852 Å Mg I resonance line. Other"
"notable spectral features are K I lines (discussed below), Zeeman split lines from the Na I 8,191 Å"
"doublet, and a complex splitting pattern from the Ca II 8,600 Å triplet."
"As well as lithium, for LHS 2534 we also detected potassium from Zeeman split K I lines. We"
"did not detect this element for any of the other objects, however we note that for WD J1824+1213"
"our wavelength coverage does not extend red enough, and for SDSS J1330+6435 the spectrum is"
of too poor quality to infer the presence of K I lines. For WD J2317+1830 we were instead able
to obtain an upper-limit (see below). Therefore future observations may also reveal potassium in
"these stars. Confirming the six components observed around 7,680 Å (Supplementary Fig. 1) did"
indeed belong to K I was complicated by the fact that the interaction of the 2.1 MG magnetic field
is comparable to the fine-structure energy separation of the K I doublet. For much smaller fields the
"doublet components will be split into four and six sub-components, according to the anomalous"
"Zeeman effect. In higher fields where the spin-orbit interaction is disrupted, three components"
"separated by µBB would be observed instead. 2.10 MG falls into the intermediate regime, instead"

we determined the wavelengths of the six allowed transitions finding excellent agreement with the
"observed data (Supplementary Fig. 1), thus confirming the transitions belong to potassium."
We started our fits by adopting earlier published parameters10. Within the least squares fit
"to the spectrum, we found that we required a moderate hydrogen abundance, allowing for a better"
"match to the continuum slope redward of 5,000 Å, which was too steep for our initial hydrogen"
"abundance of log(H/He) = −5, and also a better match to the flux level blueward of 4,000 Å."
Some of the metal lines in our the spectrum are much narrower than we were able to reproduce in
"our models (the cores of the Na I 5,892 Å and the Na I 8,191 Å doublet, the lithium and potassium"
"lines, the Cr I lines, and the many Zeeman-split components of the Ca II 8,600 Å triplet), unless"
"the hydrogen abundance was raised to log(H/He) ' −1, though this came at the expense of sub-"
"stantially reducing the fit-quality to other spectral features, in particular the Ca I 4,227 Å resonance"
"line. Because the measurement of lithium and potassium abundances are crucial to our discussion,"
we instead optimized those elements to match the equivalent width. We discuss the narrowness of
lithium lines in particular below.
From our fit to the photometry we derived a Teff somewhat cooler than found in previous
"analyses10, 33, 48. However, those studies were performed before the release of Gaia DR2 astrom-"
"etry, which places an additional constraint on the radius (and therefore mass and log g). We note"
"that at the higher temperature of 5,200 K found in a previous analysis10, we are forced to consider"
"a log g of 8.22, whereas with our Teff of 4, 780 ± 50 K requires a more typical surface gravity of"
"7.97. Furthermore, at the higher temperature we also required a hydrogen abundance closer to"
"log(H/He) = −1, in order to suppress the level of flux bluewards of 4, 000 Å, though as noted"
"above, such a hydrogen abundance causes problems fitting other features of the spectrum. Because"
"we computed non-magnetic models, as with all cool metal-contaminated white dwarfs, we find"
"convection up to the photosphere. However, it has been found that magnetic fields can inhibit con-"
"vective processes49, which is likely the case for LHS 2534 since we derive a plasma β-parameter"
"value of ≈ 0.5 in the photosphere50, indicating that magnetic pressure dominates over thermal"
pressure. However calculating our models without convection results in only minor changes to the
"emergent spectrum. Furthermore we emphasize that with such marginally low plasma β value,"
convective velocities are damped by less than one order of magnitude. These convective veloci-
"ties are still large compared to microscopic diffusion velocities27, suggesting that metals are still"
"efficiently mixed, similarly to the non-magnetic case."
"Analysis of WD J2317+1830. For this white dwarf photometry is available from SDSS, Pan-"
"STARRS, UKIRT, and WISE. The UKIRT J magnitude is from the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey"
"(UHS)45, with the K band from the Wide-field nearby Galaxy-cluster survey (WINGS)43, 44. The"
"SDSS u-band is poorly fitted in Extended Data Fig. 3, though the detection flags indicate that the"
uncertainty is underestimated in this filter39. The combination of UKIRT and WISE photometry
reveal collision induced absorption (CIA) is present in the atmosphere of this star.
We found that it was not possible to fit all the near-infrared photometry simultaneously.
Instead we used only the optical and J-band photometry to constrain the Teff and radius. This
"produced a much more consistent fit with spectroscopy, where the width of the Na doublet and"
y−J color are both sensitive to the He/H ratio. Evidently from Extended Data Fig. 3 this results in
too little flux in the K and WISE bands. We noted that the W1−W2 color is far too flat compared
to the expected Rayleigh-Jeans tail. For two photometric measurements along a Rayleigh-Jeans
"tail, it is expected that"
"m2 −m1
log10(λ2/λ1)"
"' 5, (4)"
"where m1,2 are the two AB magnitudes, and λ1,2, their corresponding central wavelengths. For"
"example, for theW1/2 photometry of LHS 2534, equation (4) is evaluated to be 4.7±0.8, whereas"
for WD J2317+1830 the same quantity is 0.0±1.1 – more than 4σ smaller than the expected value
for a Rayleigh-Jeans slope. We highlight this excess in Fig. 3b where we show the W1 − W2
color against the GBP − GRP color for WD J2317+1830 and a cross-match of the Gaia white
"dwarf catalog8 and WISE photometry51, 52. Initially this cross-match contained 70,050 sources. We"
"further refined this be keeping only sources with white dwarf probabilities, Pwd > 0.75, reducing"
"the sample to 28,333. From a color-color diagram ofGRP−W1 vs. GBP−GRP it was clear that the"
cross match was contaminated by a larger number of sources with very red GRP −W1 (i.e. flux-
"contamination from nearby sources, white dwarfs with main sequence companions). We therefore"
"made a cut of GRP −W1 > 0.2 + 1.3(GBP − GRP), leaving only the main white dwarf locus,"
"containing 4,076 objects. Finally, we removed objects with W1 −W2 uncertainties > 0.05 mag,"
"leaving only the 116 objects shown in Fig. 3b, all of which are contained within 130 pc."
We considered the possibility that the perceived flux excess of WISE photometry result from
"contamination by another object located within the large WISE PSF. However, the catWISE23 pho-"
tometry collected over the period 2010 to 2016 shows that the source detected by WISE has a
"proper motion consistent with that measured by Gaia, strongly arguing against background con-"
"tamination. Furthermore the excess is also seen in the UKIRT K-band, which has a much better"
spatial resolution.
An possible explanation that could resolve the discrepancy between the observed SED and
"the model spectra would be a modification of the CIA absorption profiles, as they have been subject"
to limited observational tests. While simply increasing the strength of the absorption would extend
"the red-wing of the H2-He opacity into the W1 band, this would also result in excess absorption in"
"theK-band. However, the H2-He CIA opacity has been shown53 to be distorted at the high densities"
relevant to these stars (> 0.1 g cm−3). The opacity table used in this work has only temperature
dependence and so it is feasible that density-dependent shifts may explain our observations. Even
"so, a strong argument against this, comes from the fact that we were able to fit WD J1824+1213"
"accurately in all photometric passbands, despite this star having stronger CIA due to its lower Teff ."
A more natural explanation is that the infrared excess arises from a circumstellar dust disk
"irradiated by the white dwarf. Using the simple flat disk model1, we found that a reasonable fit"
"is obtained for an inner disk-temperature of ' 1, 500 K outer temperature of > 500 K and an"
inclination of ' 70 degrees (dashed curves in Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3). The fact that
"WD J2317+1830 has short diffusion timescales, which make it likely that we observe the star"
"actively accreting corroborates the detection of an infrared as the signature of a dusty debris disk,"
formed from the tidal disruption of a planetesimal.
"In addition to LHS 2534, the spectrum of WD J2317+1830 also covers the wavelength re-"
gion of the potassium doublet. Strong telluric absorption coincides with the wavelength of the blue
"component, making it impossible to extract a meaningful upper-limit from this line – even with"
"telluric removal (as in Fig.1), large residuals remain. The red component resides outside the region"
"covered by telluric absorption, and so we were able to use this line to establish an upper-limit of"
log(K/He) < −10.5. This results in an abundance ratio upper-limit of log(K/Na) < −0.5. Since
"this is higher than the measurement of LHS 2534 (Fig. 2b), the true value for WD J2317+1830"
could be several 0.1 dex below the upper-limit and be broadly consistent with the location of
LHS 2534 in Fig. 2b.
"Analysis of WD J1824+1213. For this object, optical photometry are available from Pan-STARRS,"
"though because of the 1, 200 mas yr−1 proper-motion, it appears as four separate detections, where"
"we list the weighted averages provided in Extended Data Fig. 1. Additionally, WD J1824+1213"
has a UKIRT J-band detection in the UHS45. WD J1824+1213 was found to be an ultra-cool
"white dwarf (Teff = 3, 350 ± 50 K) with a mixed H/He atmosphere similar to WD J2317+1830."
"This results in very strong CIA from H2-He, to the extent that its effect is measurable from only the"
"Pan-STARRS z− y color, though it is further constrained by the J-band. W1 and W2 magnitudes"
"were also found within the catWISE data, and agree well with our best fitting model, despite the"
very strong CIA. The most notable features in the spectral data are the near-saturated sodium and
"calcium lines, the latter of which shows a reasonable fit with our unified profile."
Analysis of SDSS J1330+6435. This stellar remnant has been recently modeled36 owing to its
extremely strong and broad sodium absorption. While the the unified sodium line profile used in
"that analysis is not currently implemented in our models, we were able to obtain an adequate fit to"
the data.
Using the SDSS and Pan-STARRS photometry we found a Teff and log g lower than that
"derived in the earlier analysis36. Regardless, our model synthetic photometry is mostly in good"
"agreement with the data, though we note that our model slightly under-predicts the flux in the W1"
band compared with the measurement.
"Two spectra available from SDSS, though the second spectrum (taken with the BOSS instru-"
"ment) is of very poor signal-to-noise ratio. Even so, we decided to co-add these spectra to improve"
"the spectroscopic uncertainties. From comparison with the photometry (Extended Data Fig. 1),"
"the flux calibration of both spectra was found to be poor, therefore re-calibration against the pho-"
tometry (as described above) was required for each spectrum before they could be co-added. We
"found co-adding provided a modest S/N boost of 10 per cent in the red, and 20 per cent in the blue"
(relative to the better of the two spectra).
The main challenge in fitting this spectrum was measuring the calcium abundance. The cal-
cium resonance line is modeled here using the aforementioned unified profile and yields a reason-
"able fit in Extended Data Fig. 3. However, we found that the calcium and magnesium abundances"
were highly anti-correlated – because the calcium resonance line is essentially saturated even at a
"low abundance, a similarly good fit to both the spectrum and u-band photometry can be achieved"
by lowering the calcium abundance and increasing the magnesium abundance. There is insufficient
"information that could constrain the Mg/Ca ratio, and so a higher quality spectrum will be needed"
to measure these abundances independently. Therefore our adopted calcium abundance (Extended
"Data Fig. 2) assumes for log(Mg/Ca) = 1.5 dex, which is the average value found in an earlier"
study54.
We note that the Na and Ca abundances that we determined are significantly lower than those
"in the previous analysis36. This difference arises from our lower Teff measurement, resulting in a"
changed excitation balance. Therefore we required much lower Na and Ca abundances to produce
"the same strength lines. Even so, we find our Ca/Na ratio is consistent with the previous analysis"
(log(Ca/Na) = −0.6 ± 0.4 vs. −0.3 ± 0.4 in the previous work). The remaining difference in
the Ca/Na ratio (while already within 1σ uncertainty) could be attributed to the anti-correlation
between Ca and Mg as described above.
"Given the highly pressure broadened Na doublet, it is clear that the atmosphere of SDSS J1330+6435"
"must be helium-dominated, though trace hydrogen could be present at some level. Our best fit was"
"performed assuming log(H/He) = −6 dex, though we were still able to establish an upper-limit."
"We found that up to −4 dex, the models looked close to identical, with a small amount of CIA"
"appearing at 2µm, but otherwise continuing to agree well with all available photometry, and spec-"
troscopy. However at −3 dex we found that CIA pushed down the infrared flux compared to the
"optical enough to be in disagreement with the WISE photometry. Furthermore, the Na doublet"
started to become narrower than observed in the spectrum. Therefore we adopt −4 dex as our
upper-limit for the hydrogen abundance.
Line widths of Lithium. In our initial attempts to derive abundances we found that the lithium
"lines were systematically much narrower than predicted by our models. On its own, these narrow"
"lines might suggest an interstellar origin55, however there are multiple arguments against this."
"Firstly, for LHS 2534 the lithium doublet is Zeeman split by the 2.1 MG magnetic field. Secondly"
all objects apart from SDSS J1330+6435 are located within 40 pc of the Sun (SDSS J1330+6435
"is located 87 ± 7 pc away) where interstellar absorption can be considered negligible. Finally, in"
all four objects the observed lithium lines – while much narrower than those in the models – are
still broader than the instrumental resolution. We determined this by first measuring the spectral
resolution at the location of the lithium-doublet by determining the widths of sky emission lines in
"the sky spectrum. In each object, we then fitted the lithium-doublet with a Voigt profile, with the"
"Gaussian-component, σ, fixed to the spectral resolution, and with the Lorentzian-component, γ, as"
"a free-parameter. The results are given in Supplementary Table 1, and include the radial velocities"
measured from the Voigt profiles (not corrected for gravitational redshift). We thus conclude that
in all four cases the lines must be photospheric in origin.
Instead we considered the possibility that the overly broad lines in our models arise from
inaccurate atomic data (uncertainties can often be as large as a factor 2–3 (0.3–0.5 dex). For
"lithium, we obtained atomic data from VALD56, 57, where the broadening constants log(Γrad),"
"log(Γstark/ne), log(ΓVdW/nH) were found to be 7.56,−5.78, and−7.57 respectively. These broad-"
"ening constants are nominally calculated for temperatures of 10,000 K and for a single perturber,"
"and so internal scaling is required for different temperatures, densities, and in the case of neutral"
"broadening, other perturbers such as He. In the cool, dense atmospheres of these four white dwarfs,"
"the dominant line-broadening process is from perturbations by neutral particles, i.e. hydrogen, he-"
"lium, H2. Indeed we found that the lithium line widths in all objects are sensitive to adjustments"
in the neutral-broadening constant. We therefore decided to empirically determine a correction to
"the neutral-broadening constant, log(ΓVdW/nH), from our observations."
"We decided to perform this measurement on a single object, comparing the other three stars"
for consistency. We chose WD J1824+1213 as the calibration object because its γ-measurement
has the highest relative precision (Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore WD J1824+1213 has the
"second highest γ/σ ratio – γ/σ is higher for SDSS J1330+6435, but the low signal-to-noise ratio"
and other challenges in fitting this object make it a poor choice of calibrator.
"We generated a grid of models with log(ΓVdW/nH), spanning −9.0 to −8.0 in steps of"
"0.1 dex, and log(Li/H) spanning −12.50 to −11.00 in 0.25 dex steps. Other atmospheric pa-"
"rameters (Teff , log g, other abundances), were set to the best fitting values in Extended Data"
Fig. 2. The optimal broadening constant was determined via a non-linear least-squares fit to
"the data, interpolating the models (convolved by the 1.9 Å instrumental broadening) at arbitrary"
"abundance/log(ΓVdW/nH). We found the best fitting value to be log(ΓVdW/nH) = −8.53 ± 0.06,"
or in other words a change of −0.96± 0.06 dex.
The best fitting models for all four white dwarfs with the revised broadening constant are
"displayed in red in Supplementary Fig. 2. For comparison, models with the original broadening"
"constant are shown in orange, although with abundances revised upwards by 0.3 dex for clarity."
"Naturally the improvement for WD J1824+1213 is exemplary, given that this object was used for"
"calibration, though the line width for WD J2317+1830 (which has a similar derived atmospheric"
H/He ratio) was also found to show good agreement when using the revised values. LHS 2534 and
"SDSS J1330+6435, which both have He-dominated atmospheres, show improvement compared"
"to the original broadening constant (where the lithium lines are completely washed out), though"
the lines remain far wider than observed in the data. The remaining discrepancy is particularly
"pronounced for LHS 2534, though other lines in the spectrum of this object are also found to be"
"narrower than expected. This includes the potassium lines (Supplementary Fig. 1), and 5,892 and"
"8,191 Å doublets of sodium. The Na I 5,892 Å lines are particularly noteworthy, because we were"
"able to accurately fit their wings (Extended Data Fig. 3), while narrow cores remain which we are"
unable to fit with our models. Since we have no trouble fitting these sodium lines in the other
"three objects, we take this as evidence that the 2.1 MG magnetic field has a strong effect on the"
"atmospheric structure, exacerbating the narrowness of weaker lines. Indeed we find that the gas"
"pressure in our models is 1010.5 dyn cm−2, whereas the magnetic pressure must be 1011.2 dyn cm−2"
"given the 2.10 MG magnetic field. Therefore, in addition to only adjusting the lithium lines, for"
"this object, it was also necessary to reduce the neutral broadening constants for Cr I and K I by the"
"same amount, to better estimate the photospheric abundances."
"While we clearly find improvement with the revised broadening constant, similar issues are"
"not encountered in other cool stellar atmospheres with lithium lines, for instance the Solar atmo-"
sphere and those of giant stars. However calculations of giant star atmosphere models with the
"reduced neutral broadening constant show no discernible difference in the line width (M. Steffen,"
"private communication, June 2020), indicating that other broadening processes dominate within"
those atmospheres.
"White dwarf masses and evolution. For two of the stars in our sample, WD J1824+1213 and"
"SDSS J1330+6435, we derive particularly small masses (0.28± 0.03 and 0.38± 0.06 M�, respec-"
"tively). These masses are presumed to be unrealistic, as the Galaxy is too young to produce such"
"low-mass white dwarfs, and are representative of the challenges common to modeling cool white"
"dwarfs58 with Teff < 5, 000 K. In fact, extremely low masses are commonly derived for white"
dwarfs with strong CIA absorption59 and imply missing opacity in the stellar models. Such diffi-
culties are often understood to arise from strongly wavelength-dependent opacities such as CIA53
and the red wing of Lyman α60.
"Our models include CIA opacities61–64 from H2-H, H2-He, H2-H2, H-He, and He-He-He."
We also include broadening65 of Lyα by H2. However we do not include the effects of pressure
"distortion in the H2-He opacity53. While we do not have access to these specific data, their inclusion"
in our models may go some of the way to explain these low masses. The expectation is therefore
"that these stars have higher true Teff than from our analysis, which would therefore allow for smaller"
"radii, needed to remain consistent with the photometry and parallaxes, which via the mass-radius"
"relation for white dwarfs, implies higher masses."
In the following we assume that the derived luminosities (Extended Data Fig. 2) of
WD J1824+1213 and SDSS J1330+6435 are correct since they provide an adequate fit to the pho-
"tometric SED, and additionally we assume that the mass is drawn from the distribution found for"
"warmer white dwarfs66, i.e. M = 0.614 ± 0.122 M�. For WD J1824+1213 we obtain Teff ="
"4, 050+260−240 K and τ = 9.41
+0.35
−0.95 Gyr for thick hydrogen layers which are appropriate for the large"
"total hydrogen mass in the star. For SDSS J1330+6435, again assuming M = 0.614 ± 0.122 M�"
"leads to Teff = 4, 160
+290
−270 K and τ = 7.54"
"+0.31
−0.60 Gyr for thin hydrogen layers. Clearly both white"
dwarfs have long cooling times but it is not possible to estimate the main-sequence lifetime owing
to the uncertainty on the mass.
"For WD J1824+1213 (the most extreme case of the low-mass/low-Teff systems), we refitted"
"the photometry and spectrum with the Teff fixed to 4,050 K (as described above), and with the radius"
"and atmospheric abundances as free parameters, to see if this may still provide an adequate solu-"
"tion, which could be the case if our low-mass solution was simply a local minimum. While the best"
"model for this restricted fit did (by design) result in a mass close to 0.6 Msun, we found the model"
"failed to accurately reproduce the shape of the SED in the both the optical and infrared, show-"
ing particular disagreement in the J-band of around 0.5 mag. Therefore we rule out the a second
"minimum in the parameter space at higher Teff , though this does not discount the possibility that"
improved atmospheric models may shift the best solution to higher temperatures and thus towards
"more reasonable masses. Even so, the consistency in the abundance ratios of WD J1824+1213"
"and SDSS J1330+6435 compared with LHS 2534 and WD J2317+1830 (Fig. 2), indicates that our"
conclusions on a crust origin for the accreted material is unaffected in these two low mass systems.
We note that forcing an increased Teff shifts the optimal abundances: log(H/He) was reduced
by about 0.3 dex with all metal abundances increased by 0.5–0.6 dex. The similarity in metal
"abundance shifts implies that the location of WD J1824+1213 in Fig. 2a, is largely unaffected by"
systematic uncertainty in the Teff .
For LHS 2534 we derive a mass of 0.55±0.02 M� corresponding cooling age of 5.8±0.2 Gyr.
We expect the magnetic field to have negligible influence on cooling age50. Such a white dwarf
"mass implies a very long main-sequence lifetime, possibly longer than the cooling time67. It is"
"possible that LHS 2534 is also impacted by the model systematics mentioned above, and therefore"
we refrain from estimating a total age.
"In contrast, our fit to WD J2317+1830 reveals a mass of 1.00 ± 0.02 M� and cooling age"
of 9.5 ± 0.2 Gyr making it the among most massive white dwarfs detected with signatures of a
planetary system29. The large mass implies a massive progenitor with a relatively small main-
"sequence lifetime, leading to a precise total age of 9.7± 0.2 Gyr using an empirical initial-to-final"
mass relation30 and main-sequence lifetimes68.
Kinematics and population membership. While we could only establish a reliable total age for
"one of the four analysed white dwarfs, kinematics can be useful to identify population"
"membership69–71. In Supplementary Table 2, we rely on the precise Gaia astrometry to derive"
"tangential velocities as well as motion in Galactic coordinates U , V and W . We had to assume"
zero radial velocity as this quantity is poorly constrained from our spectroscopic observations. In
"earlier studies of halo white dwarf candidates69, a 2σ halo membership required |U | > 94 km s−1"
"or V > 60 km s−1 or V < −130 km s−1. Using the same requirements, only WD J1824+1213 is a"
"halo white dwarf candidate, as previously identified71, although all our objects have relatively large"
"tangential velocities suggesting an old disk population72, consistent with the large cooling ages."
The chemical abundances in these old white dwarfs have the potential to provide constraints
"on planet formation around stars formed in the early history of the Galaxy, and hence possibly"
"under metal-poor conditions. However, early disk membership is not necessarily linked to progen-"
"itors of significant sub-solar metallicity73, 74, and further insight will require a larger sample of cool"
debris-accreting white dwarfs.
Sinking times. We used our new envelope code18 to determine convection zone sizes and sinking
timescales21 for each element considered in our sample. With only four objects we were able
to use the best fit atmospheric models discussed in the previous sections as boundary conditions
on the upper-envelope for self-consistency (as opposed to interpolating a grid of models). These
results are listed in Extended Data Fig. 4. Using these timescales it is possible to trace back the
"atmospheric abundance histories of a metal Z (with sinking timescale τ ) using,"
"log(Z/He)(t) = log(Z/He)(0) +
t"
"ln(10)τ
, (5)"
implying the relative abundances for two elements evolves as
"log(Z1/Z2)(t) = log(Z1/Z2)(0) +
t"
ln(10)
"[
τ−11 − τ"
"]
. (6)"
"The convection zone masses, combined with our abundance measurements (Extended Data"
"Fig. 2) allow us to determine the mass of each element mixed within the convection zones, pro-"
viding lower limits on the amounts of accreted material (Extended Data Fig. 4). In the case of
"WD J2317+1830, where accretion-diffusion equilibrium has been assumed, the elemental diffu-"
sion fluxes (equal to the elemental accretion rates) can be calculated by dividing the respective
convection zone masses by their corresponding diffusion timescales.
