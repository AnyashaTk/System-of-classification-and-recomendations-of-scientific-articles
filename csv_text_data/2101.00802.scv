"ABSTRACT
Understanding the geometry and kinematics of the broad line region (BLR) of active
galactic nuclei (AGN) is important to estimate black hole masses in AGN and study
the accretion process. The technique of reverberation mapping (RM) has provided
estimates of BLR size for more than 100 AGN now, however, the structure of the BLR
has been studied for only a handful number of objects. Towards this, we investigated
the geometry of the BLR for a large sample of 57 AGN using archival RM data. We
performed systematic modeling of the continuum and emission line light curves using
a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method based on Bayesian statistics implemented in
PBMAP (Parallel Bayesian code for reverberation− MAPping data) code to constrain
BLR geometrical parameters and recover velocity integrated transfer function. We
found that the recovered transfer functions have various shapes such as single-peaked,
double-peaked and top-hat suggesting that AGN have very different BLR geometries.
Our model lags are in general consistent with that estimated using the conventional
cross-correlation methods. The BLR sizes obtained from our modeling approach is
related to the luminosity with a slope of 0.583 ± 0.026 and 0.471 ± 0.084 based on
Hβ and Hα lines, respectively. We found a non-linear response of emission line fluxes
to the ionizing optical continuum for 93% objects. The estimated virial factors for
the AGN studied in this work range from 0.79 to 4.94 having a mean at 1.78 ± 1.77
consistent with the values found in the literature."

1 INTRODUCTION
"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be powered
by the accretion of matter on to super massive black hole
(SMBH; 106 − 1010 M�) located at the center of galaxies
(Lynden-Bell 1969; Salpeter 1964). This extreme physical
process is responsible for the radiation we receive from AGN
over a wide range of energies predominantly emitted in X-
ray, UV and optical wavelengths. The SMBH is surrounded
by the accretion disk and the optical/UV emission seen in
the spectral energy distribution of an AGN is attributed
to the thermal emission from the accretion disk. Farther"

"from the accretion disk on scales of about ∼ 0.01 parsec
(typical for the Seyfert galaxies category of AGN) lies the
broad line region (BLR) that produces the line emission. The
UV/optical continuum from the accretion disk photoionizes
the gas clouds in the BLR, and as these gas clouds are sit-
uated deep within the potential well of the black hole, the
emission lines from them are broadened by few thousands of
km/sec. The BLR is surrounded by the dusty torus which
is responsible for the different manifestations of the AGN
when viewed at different orientations (Antonucci 1993; Urry
& Padovani 1995). According to Barvainis (1987), the bump
or excess in the near infrared (NIR) continuum is thermally
produced by the hot dust grains heated by the UV/optical
radiation from the central region. For a typical UV luminos-"

"ity of 1042 − 1044 erg s−1, the inner extent of the torus is
around 0.01−0.1 pc or 10−100 light-days (Suganuma et al.
2006). Thus, the central region of AGN is highly compact,
and difficult to probe using any current imaging techniques.
However, recently, from interferometric observations carried
out in IR using the GRAVITY instrument on the European
Very Large Telescope (VLT), Gravity Collaboration et al.
(2018) were able to resolve the central region in 3C 273 on
scales of about 0.12 parsec. On much larger scales in AGN
are the clouds in the narrow line region that are responsible
for the narrow emission lines we see in the spectrum of AGN
with widths of few hundreds of km/sec."
"One of the defining characteristics of AGN is that they
show flux variations (Wagner & Witzel 1995; Ulrich et al.
1997). This is known since their discovery, though, the causes
of flux variations are not yet understood. In spite of that,
the flux variability characteristic of AGN provides a very
useful way to probe the spatially unresolved inner regions
in them. A technique that uses the variability of AGN to
probe their central regions is known as reverberation map-
ping (RM; Blandford & McKee 1982; Peterson 1993). This
method is based on the variation of the line-fluxes from the
BLR in response to the the continuum UV-optical flux vari-
ations from the accretion disk. The time delay (τ) measured
using the traditional cross-correlation techniques (Edelson &
Krolik 1988; Peterson 1993) between the continuum flux and
line flux variations is the average light travel time from the
accretion disk to the BLR, which in principle gives the aver-
age radius of the BLR. Having the BLR size (RBLR = τ/c,
where c is the velocity of light) and the width of the broad
emission line (∆V ), measurable from the spectrum, the mass
of the black hole (MBH) in an AGN can be estimated using
the virial relation,"
MBH = fBLR
"(
∆V 2RBLR"
"where G represents the gravitational constant and fBLR is
the virial factor that depends on the geometry and kine-
matics of BLR. The method of RM has been used to mea-
sure MBH in more than 100 AGN with most of the mea-
surements coming from the compilation1 of Bentz & Katz
(2015), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reveberation Mea-
surement project; SDSS−RM (Grier et al. 2017b) and the
Super-Eddington Accretion in Massive Black Holes project
(Du et al. 2014, 2016, 2018; Wang et al. 2014). The fBLR
in Equation 1 is calibrated considering both AGN and lo-
cal quiescent galaxies follow the same M − σ∗ relation (e.g.,
Onken et al. 2004; Woo et al. 2015), where σ∗ is the stel-
lar velocity dispersion. However, it is not clear whether a
constant fBLR can be used to estimate MBH for all AGN
considering the complex geometry and kinematics of indi-
vidual AGN. Ho & Kim (2014) performed a recalibration of
the virial factor and found that it depends on the bulge type
of the host galaxy, the fBLR for classical bulges and ellip-
tical bulge objects are twice larger than pseudo bulge ob-
jects. Pancoast et al. (2014) performed dynamical modeling
of BLR and found that fBLR correlates with the inclination
of the objects and has different values for different objects. In
addition to getting MBH values, RM observations involving"

"optical and IR photometric observatios as well as IR spectro-
scopic monitoring observations can be used to constrain the
inner edge of the dusty torus in AGN(Suganuma et al. 2006;
Koshida et al. 2014; Pozo Nuñez et al. 2014; Mandal et al.
2018; Landt et al. 2019; Mandal et al. 2020). Recently, from
high resolution radio observations using the Very Large Ar-
ray, Carilli et al. (2019) have imaged the torus in Cygnus A.
GRAVITY Collaboration et al. (2019) partially resolved the
size and structure of hot dust using VLTI/GRAVITY and
reported the increase of the physical radius with bolometric
luminosity in 8 Type 1 AGN."
"Most of the RM studies available in literature are
mainly focused on estimating BLR sizes and MBH which
are solely driven by the quality of the available RM data
both in terms of time resolution and signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR). This approach makes the geometry and kinematics
of the central engine of BLR remain unknown. However, for
sources with densely sampled and good SNR spectra, it is
in principle possible to calculate time delays as a function
of velocity across the emission line profile and better con-
strain the geometry and kinematics of the gas in the BLR
(e.g., Ulrich & Horne 1996; Bentz et al. 2010; Grier et al.
2013; Xiao et al. 2018). Also, modeling of RM data using
Bayesian approach has led to constrain the geometry and
dynamics of the BLR, estimate AGN parameters, as well as,
fBLR for individual objects (Pancoast et al. 2011; Brewer
et al. 2011; Pancoast et al. 2012, 2014; Li et al. 2018). A geo-
metrical modeling code, PBMAP (Parallel Bayesian code for
reverberation−MAPping data) developed by Li et al. (2013)
in addition to providing several parameters, e.g., BLR size,
inclination angle (θinc), opening angle (θopn), also includes
non-linear response of the line emission to the continuum
and allow for detrending the light curves (Welsh 1999; Den-
ney et al. 2010; Li et al. 2013, 2019). This technique was
applied to a sample of 40 objects using archival Hβ line and
continuum light curves by Li et al. (2013) and they were able
to recover velocity integrated transfer function. They found
that the BLR structure for Hβ line is mainly disk-like. Such
a flattened disk like BLR is also seen in the high resolution
observations of 3C 273 with the VLT (Gravity Collabora-
tion et al. 2018). Also, in Li et al. (2013) the observed line
fluxes were better reproduced using the non-linear response
of the line to the continuum that has not been considered
in previous RM studies. It is therefore important to extend
this approach to a large number of AGN to examine differ-
ences if any in the geometry of the BLR between different
AGN. Towards this, we carried out a systematic modeling
of the RM data available in the literature to investigate the
geometry of the BLR. For this we used the PBMAP code
to model the emission line and continuum light curves by
constraining several BLR parameters such as (a) the BLR
size, (b) θinc, (c) θopn and the non-linear response index. We
also calculated fBLR for a number of sources by constrain-
ing the geometry of the BLR. The paper is structured as
follows. In Section 2, we describe the sample selection. We
present our analysis in Section 3. Our results are given in
Section 4 followed by the summary in Section 5. For the cos-
mological parameters we assumed H0 = 73 km s"

BLR Modeling 3
2 THE SAMPLE
"The objective of this work is to constrain the geometry of
the BLR as well as other characteristic properties of AGN
by modeling the continuum and line light curves. This re-
quires spectrophotometric monitoring observations of AGN.
We therefore, collected data for all objects that are in the
black hole mass database by Bentz & Katz (2015) and the
SDSS-RM program (Shen et al. 2016; Grier et al. 2017b)
from the literature with the following two additional con-
straints (i) the objects must have continuum and line light
curves. The line light curves can be either of Mg II, Hβ or Hα
and (ii) BLR structure of the objects was not investigated
previously. With the above constraints we arrived at a sam-
ple of 57 objects. Of the 57 objects, 22 have data for both
Hβ and Hα lines, 3 have data for both Hβ and MgII lines, 25
have only Hβ, 4 have only Hα and 3 have data for only MgII
line with a total of 82 independent measurements. The data
for these objects were from Shen et al. (2016), Grier et al.
(2017b), Wang et al. (2014), Grier et al. (2012), Bentz et al.
(2014), Peterson et al. (2014), Rafter et al. (2013), Du et al.
(2014) and Shapovalova et al. (2013). For the objects taken
from Shen et al. (2016), the continuum light curves pertain
to the measurements at 5100 Å, while for the objects taken
from Grier et al. (2017b), the continuum light curves belong
to the photometric monitoring observations done in g and i
bands. The details of the objects selected for this study are
given in Table 1."
"For this work, we directly downloaded the continuum
and line light curves from the literature in their original form
i.e. magnitude or flux versus time, without any further spe-
cial treatment. Note that different authors followed different
methods for their data analysis. In some cases the presence
of constant flux component in the continuum light curves
from the host-galaxy were removed by the respective au-
thors (Bentz et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2014; Shen et al. 2016)
by difference imaging analysis of the images. However, in
some cases the removal of the host galaxy was not done e.g.,
the f5100 light curves from Grier et al. (2012); Rafter et al.
(2013); Du et al. (2014); Grier et al. (2017b) are not host
galaxy subtracted. We note that host galaxies contribute a
constant flux to the continuum light curves, however, this
can vary depending on the seeing variations between differ-
ent epochs of observations (Peterson 2001). Though this can
have some effect on the deduced amplitude of variations (Pe-
terson 2001), it does not affect the estimation of the model
parameters and the main conclusions of the paper. Simi-
larly, as our sample comes from different sources, not all
broad emission line light curves have their narrow compo-
nent subtracted. For example, Shen et al. (2016); Grier et al.
(2017b) subtracted the narrow component while Du et al.
(2014) used the total Hβ profile to generate the Hβ light
curves."
3 ANALYSIS
3.1 Variability
"We characterized the line and continuum variability of our
sample of sources using the Fvar parameter (Vaughan et al."
2003) and it is defined as
Fvar =
"√
(σ2 − ¯�2err)"
"x̄2
(2)"
"where x̄ is the average flux in the light curve. The sample
variance σ2 and the mean error ¯�2err are given as"
"N∑
i=1"
(xi − x̄)2 (3)
"¯�2err =
1"
"N∑
i=1"
"�

i (4)"
"where �i is the uncertainty in each flux measurement. The
uncertainty in Fvar is calculated as (Rani et al. 2017)"
err(Fvar) =
"√√√√(√ 1

"¯�2err
x̄2Fvar"
"(√

")2
(5)"
"The results of our variability analysis are given in Table 2
where we also mention the values of R, which is the ratio be-
tween the maximum and minimum fluxes in the light curves."
3.2 Reconstruction of Light Curve
"We used the PBMAP code developed by Li et al. (2013)
to perform the light curve modeling. A detailed description
of this code can be found in Li et al. (2013). However, we
describe briefly the methodology here. The data that are
needed for the code are the observed continuum and line
light curves. Using the irregularly sampled continuum light
curve, the code reconstructs the continuum light curve using
the damped random walk model (DRW; Kelly et al. 2009)
following a Bayesian approach. Many investigations in the
literature suggest that the optical flux variations in AGN
can be well explained by DRW (e.g., Koz lowski et al. 2010;
MacLeod et al. 2010; Zu et al. 2011)."
"The AGN continuum variability is modeled as a random
process in which the co-variance matrix S of the signal can
be expressed as"
"S(ti − tj) = σ2dexp
[
−
(
|ti − tj |
τd"
")α]
(6)"
"Here, ti and tj are the two epochs and the co-variance func-
tion depends on the time difference ti−tj , τd is the damping
timescale, σd is the standard deviation of variation and α is
the smoothening parameter which is fixed to unity in the
model calculation as it is shown to be sufficient for variabil-
ity (Kelly et al. 2009). Then using a model of BLR and the
reconstructed continuum light curve, the code reconstructs
the line light curve. In the code (a) the BLR is modeled as
an axisymmetric disk consisting of a large number of point-
like, discrete clouds of equal density, which re-radiate the
UV/optical continuum as emission lines, (b) the BLR clouds
subtend a solid angle denoted by the opening angle (θopn),
and the BLR is viewed at an inclination angle (θinc) and
(c) the central source that ionizes the BLR is point like,
thereby emitting isotropically. The model regenerates the
velocity integrated line light curve represented as below"

coefficient, wi is the weight of the cloud to the response
of the continuum, Ii depicts any possible anisotropic ef-
fects and deviations from the continuum, and γ presents
the non-linearity of the response. The weight wi is fixed
to unity and Ii is neglected in all calculations. A value of
γ=0 points to the linear response of BLR to the continuum
variations. The reduced χ2 value (χ2/dof) which is defined
in Li et al. (2013) is used to determine the quality of the
generated light curves. When the value of χ2/dof was large
(> 1.5), we applied detrending to the light curves before
subjecting them to model fits. The detrending was done by
removing a first-order polynomial fit to the light curve as
mentioned in Li et al. (2013). This led to improvement in
the results which has also been noticed by Li et al. (2013).
We found that for 6 objects, namely J0652+744, J1242+332,
J1416+539,J1418+539, J1421+525 and J2303+088 though
the χ2/dof is slightly larger after detrending, we obtained
better estimates of BLR size with smaller uncertainty. The
final fitting results are given in Table 3 for Hβ and in Table
4 for Hα and MgII."
4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
4.1 Flux variability
"AGN have been extensively studied for their variability and
it has been found that optical variability of AGN correlates
with many of their physical properties. Most of these stud-
ies concentrate on photometric monitoring, however, in such
studies, broad emission lines too can fall in the photometric
pass band. The best way to study line and continuum vari-
ability separately is through spectroscopic monitoring obser-
vations, however, it is time consuming. A data set suitable
for such a study is the one accumulated for RM studies.
Though, the line and continuum light curves accumulated
from RM observations and used in this work are primar-
ily used to understand the BLR, they are also a good data
set to investigate the variability of AGN. As we have both
continuum and line light curves, we characterized the line
and continuum variability of our sample using Fvar (Edelson
et al. 2002; Vaughan et al. 2003). The light curves for some
objects analyzed here, were corrected for the constant host
galaxy contamination to the continuum and the narrow-line
contamination to the line fluxes. For few sources the host
galaxy and the narrow line contribution to the continuum
and line fluxes were not removed. This will have some ef-
fect on the derived Fvar values reported here as the flux
contribution from host galaxy could lead to low values of
Fvar (Peterson 2001). However, this will not lead to biases
on the comparative analysis of the Fvar values between dif-
ferent emission lines and the continuum. The distribution"

"of the amplitude of variability, Fvar for both the continuum
and line (that includes MgII, Hβ and Hα) are given in Fig.
1. A two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test indicates"
"that the two distributions are indeed different with a statis-
tic of 0.317 and a p value of 4.0 × 10−4. We found mean
Fvar values of 0.057±0.001 and 0.106±0.012 for continuum
and line, respectively. We have a total of 50 measurements
for Hβ, 26 for Hα and 6 for MgII line. Separating the sam-
ple based on different lines, for Hβ sample, we found mean
Fvar values of 0.065±0.002 and 0.119±0.012 for continuum
and line, respectively. For Hα sample, the mean Fvar values
for continuum and line are 0.041± 0.001 and 0.076± 0.018,
while for MgII sample, we found mean Fvar of 0.057± 0.001
and 0.120± 0.002 for continuum and line, respectively. The
Fvar in line is thus found to exceed than that of the con-
tinuum. Such increased variations in emission lines relative
to the continuum support the deviation of BLR from the
linear response to the ionizing continuum (Rashed et al.
2015; Li et al. 2013). Though photoionization models predict
that MgII line should be less responsive to the continuum
than Balmer lines (Korista & Goad 2000, 2004), Woo (2008)
found Fvar in Mg II line higher than the continuum too, sim-
ilar to what is found in this work. For intermediate-redshift
quasars the MgII line may originate almost in the same re-
gion as Hβ, as can be seen in the cases of NGC 3783 and
NGC 4151, for which similar time lags were obtained using
Hβ and MgII lines (Reichert et al. 1994; Peterson et al. 2004;
Metzroth et al. 2006; Woo 2008). Therefore, it is possible to
detect a similar kind of line variability in both the Hβ and
MgII lines in these objects."

4.2 BLR characteristics
"Modeling of the BLR using a Bayesian approach was devel-
oped by Pancoast et al. (2011) and subsequently applied to
Arp 151 (Brewer et al. 2011) and Mrk 50 (Pancoast et al.
2012). In addition to Mrk 50 and Arp 151, more AGN were
subjected to BLR modeling (Pancoast et al. 2014; Grier et al.
2017a; Williams et al. 2018; Li et al. 2013). The BLR mod-
eling used in this work is based on Li et al. (2013), which
is an independent implementation of the approach of Pan-
coast et al. (2011), however, with the additional inclusion of
(a) non-linear response of emission lines to the continuum"
"variations and (b) option to carry out a detrending of the
light curves. Here, we analysed the data for 57 objects with
82 independent measurements for Hβ, Hα and MgII lines,
which is twice the number of AGN studied earlier (Li et al.
2013) for uncovering the characteristics of BLR. We show in
Fig. 2 few examples to illustrate our BLR model fits to their
observed continuum and line reverberation data. The model
reproduces the observed light curves for all the objects. In
these plots the data points with error bars are the observed
light curves and the thick solid lines are the reconstructed
light curves by the model. For the object J1412+534, few"
"MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2020)"
10 Mandal et al.
"points of the observed line light curve deviate from the re-
constructed light curve. These points are also found to de-
viate from the general trend of the observed line light curve
that results of larger χ2/dof value of 4.91 pointing to poor
fitting to the light curve. For the object J1421+525, there is
a discrepancy between the observed and modeled line light
curve. The χ2/dof of 8.14 obtained here could be due to
poor sampling and/or SNR of the emission line measure-
ments. The corresponding transfer functions for those four
objects are given in the right hand panel of Fig. 2. We found
the transfer functions to have different shapes. For exam-
ple in J1412+534 (top panel; α2000 = 14:12:14.20, δ2000 =
53:25:46.7), the transfer function is single peaked at τ =
τlag. For this object the BLR modeling gives θinc = 4.0 ±
2.8 deg and θopn = 6.0 ± 3.9 deg. The transfer function
for J1407+537 (α2000 = 14:07:59.07, δ2000 = 53:47:59.8) is
double peaked, for which we obtain θinc = 65.0 ± 22.1 deg
and θopn = 37.0 ± 26.5 deg. For J1417+517 (bottom panel;
α2000 = 14:17:06.68, δ2000 = 51:43:40.1), the transfer func-
tion has a top hat structure with derived θinc and θopn of
57.9 ± 21.6 deg and 51.8 ± 25.8 deg, respectively. We note
that the peak of the transfer function is not always a reli-
able indicator for the size of the BLR. For example, peak
can represent BLR size for a single peaked transfer function
but it is not a reliable indicator for a double peaked transfer
function or a transfer function with long tail. The first mo-
ment of transfer function, which represents the time lag in
CCF analysis, gives a better estimate of the average size of
the BLR (Gaskell & Sparke 1986; Gaskell & Peterson 1987;
Kovačević et al. 2014). We found a) for a thick disk, larger
θinc tends to produce a double-peaked transfer function, as
seen in the case of object J1407+537 (third panel of Fig.
2 from the top) with θinc = 65.0 ± 22.1 deg. As θinc in-
creases, the object appears more edge on and the radiation
coming both from the front and back surfaces makes a dou-
ble peak transfer function where the stronger peak appears
closer to the center. b) a larger opening angle θopn tends
to broaden the transfer functions toward top-hat as seen in
case of J1417+517 (bottom panel of Fig. 2) which has a θopn
of 51.8 ± 25.8 degree. As θopn increases the BLR tends to a
spherical geometry and the virial motion of the clouds con-
tributes to the transfer function making the transfer function
broaden towards a top-hat structure."
"We show in Fig. 3 the distribution of χ2/dof ob-
tained for the best fit model returned by PBMAP. The
fits are indeed bad (with χ2/dof > 4) for a few sources,
namely J141214.20+532546.7, J141941.11+533649.6 and
J142135.90+523138.9. These sources have poor quality (less
number of points and sparsely sampled) data and is the likely
cause for large χ2/dof. Though the overall distribution of
χ2/dof seems skewed to values larger than 1.0, in majority
of the sources, we obtained a low χ2/dof close to 1.0. For
about 60% of the light curves we obtained χ2/dof ≤ 1.2. The
poorer χ2/dof in some objects is due to them having contin-
uum and line light curves with SNR < 50. Also, systematic
errors due to calibration which are usually not included in
the reported uncertainties of the original data could affect
the χ2 value. Overall, the continuum and emission line light
curves generated by the model are in good agreement with
the observed data."
"Fig. 4 shows the distribution of the non-linearity pa-
rameter γ obtained from modeling, we found < γMgII >="
"1.78±0.86, < γHβ >= 1.18±1.03 and < γHα >= 0.76±0.99
for MgII, Hβ and Hα, respectively. This clearly indicates a
non-linear response of emission-lines from BLR to the ioniz-
ing optical continuum. Such non-linear response of line flux
to the ionizing continuum can be due to the anisotropic and
non axis-symmetric emission coming from different spectral
regions in AGN (Korista & Goad 2000, 2004; Gaskell et al.
2019). Note that the shorter wavelength UV continuum usu-
ally vary larger compared to the longer wavelength optical
continuum, therefore, depending on the continuum, the re-
sponse of a given emission line could be different (O’Brien
et al. 1995; Zhu et al. 2017)."
"4.3 Dependency of damping time scale on Luminosity at
5100 Å for Hβ line fitting"
"Kelly et al. (2009) modeled the light curves of 100 quasars
using DRW and found the time scale of variability to cor-
relate with luminosity. Recently, Lu et al. (2019) performed
DRW modeling of 73 AGN including high-accreting sources,
which are also studied here. They found that the damping
time scale is strongly correlated with luminosity with a slope
of 0.46± 0.09. However, MacLeod et al. (2010) using SDSS
stripe 82 data, did not find any strong correlation with lu-
minosity. In our fitting, emission line and continuum model
parameters are fitted simultaneously allowing us to study
this relation."
"We show in Fig. 5 the dependence of the derived rest
frame damping time scale on the observed host-galaxy cor-
rected continuum luminosity at 5100 Å. We found that the
damping time scale τd is positively correlated with the lu-
minosity at 5100 Å. From linear least squares fitting to the
data we found"

"with α = 0.54± 0.06 and β = −22.09± 2.67. The slope
of the correlation is similar to the value of α = 0.60 ± 0.06
found by Li et al. (2013), who performed BLR modeling, in
the same fashion like we did here, from an analysis of 50
AGN with Hβ lags. We note that the scatter in the relation
is much higher than Lu et al. (2019), mainly because they
modeled continuum light curves with only two main parame-
ters while we fitted both continuum and BLR model parame-
ters simultaneously. Moreover, their sample does not include
SDSS RM sample, which has relatively less time sampling
and variability. A carefully analysis suggests that the more
deviant points have lower variability and hence the model
parameters are not well constrained."
"To check the correlation between the damping time
scale and luminosity at 5100 Å, we estimated the Spear-
man rank correlation coefficient (rs) using Monte Carlo sim-
ulation where each point in the τd − λLλ plane is modified
by a random Gaussian deviate consistent with the mea-
sured uncertainty. From the distribution obtained for 10000
Monte Carlo iterations, the median value of rs is found to
be 0.218+0.065−0.066 with a probability (p) of no correlation of
0.016+0.079−0.015. The upper and lower errors are the values at
the 15.9 and 84.1 percentile of the distributions of those
10000 iterations. Koz lowski (2017a,b) suggested that deriv-
ing damping time from short duration light curves leads to"

to a power law relation (RBLR ∝ Lα) between the size of the

"The virial factor fBLR given in Equation 1 depends on fac-
tors such as the kinematics, geometry and inclination of the
BLR. One of the many factors provided by the Bayesian
based modeling approach carried out here is the capability
to estimate fBLR. For a disk like BLR, (see Collin et al. 2006;
Li et al. 2013; Rakshit et al. 2015) fBLR can be written as"
fBLR ≈ (sin2 θopn + sin2 θinc)−1 (14)
"where θinc is the inclination angle and θopn is the open-
ing angle of the disk. Following Li et al. (2013) we calculated
fBLR for only those objects with θopn < 40"
"◦. Our calculated
values of fBLR range from 0.79 to 4.94, with a mean value
of 1.78 ± 1.77. A distribution of fBLR is shown in Fig. 10.
Collin et al. (2006) found a value of < log(fBLR) > = 0.18.
Our average value of < log(fBLR) > = 0.17 closely matches
with that found by Collin et al. (2006). The large error bars
in our fBLR values are due to large uncertainties in both θinc
and θopn."
"It is also possible to get an estimate of fBLR for sources
that have stellar velocity dispersion measurements. For lo-
cal inactive galaxies a tight correlation is known to exist be-
tween MBH and bulge or spheroid stellar velocity dispersion
(σ∗). This correlation (Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; Gebhardt"

"For a total of seven sources in our sample, we could ob-
tain both the fBLR measurements, one based on the Bayesian
based BLR modeling approach and the other obtained from
the ratio of MBH based on Equation 15 to the virial product
obtained from RM. We found a good correlation between the
two virial factors (see Fig. 11). Considering the dispersion
of ∼ 0.4 dex in the MBH − σ∗ relation our 1D modeling ap-
proach is able to provide fBLR consistent with that obtained
from RM method and MBH and σ∗ relation. From linear least
squares fit to the data points in Fig. 11, we found a Spear-
man rank correlation coefficient of 0.29+0.39−0.54 and a p-value of
0.38+0.44−0.31. Removing the data point with fBLR > 10, also the
one with very large uncertainty, linear least squares fit gave
a linear correlation coefficient of 0.14+0.46−0.51 and a p value of
0.47+0.40−0.31. Though, the points are scattered around the dot-
ted line in Fig. 11, the derived fBLR(model) have large error
bars and this could be the reason for no tight correlation be-
tween the scale factors obtained by both the methods. Most
of the values of fBLR(model) are found to be lesser than 3,
which points to a BLR with a thick geometry and viewed at
an inclination angle. Given the fact that fBLR has a large
range, the MBH values obtained from single epoch measure-
ments adopting a single fBLR are bound to have large un-
certainties. Mej́ıa-Restrepo et al. (2018) by comparing MBH
obtained by accretion disk model fitting and virial methods
found that fBLR is correlated with the width of the broad
emission lines as fBLR ∝ FWHM−1."
"Also, the ratio of FWHM to the line dispersion of broad
Hβ line is suggested to be correlated with the inclination an-
gle (Collin et al. 2006; Goad et al. 2012). However, Pancoast

most of the MBH(model) values obtained using σHβ lie be-

The median SNR of the continuum and line light curves used
in this work is about 84 and 30, respectively. To access the
effects of SNR on the derived BLR parameters, we carried
out simulations. We firstly selected objects with continuum
light curves with SNR greater than 300. We arrived at a total
of 10 objects. We then degraded the SNR of the continuum
and line light curves of those 10 objects by multiplying a
factor of 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10 and 15 to the original flux errors"
"and adding a Gaussian random deviate of zero mean and
standard deviation given by the new flux errors. We then
applied the PBMAP code on the simulated light curves and
extracted the BLR parameters. Here, the ratio of the recov-
ered to the original BLR parameters are plotted against the
continuum SNR. It is evident from Fig. 14, that this ratio
is close to unity for most of the BLR parameters, except for
the radius of the BLR, where it is found to deviate by 10%
and 30%, when the SNR of the continuum are 130 and 100,"

"as shown by the vertical green and red lines, respectively.
Similarly, for the line light curves too, we found that the ra-
tio of the recovered to the original BLR parameters are close
to unity except for the BLR size, which deviates by 10% and
30%, when the SNR of the line are 25 and 15, respectively.
This is also in agreement with the continuum SNR cut-off
of 100 suggested by Collier et al. (2001) and Horne et al.
(2004) to extract BLR parameters from RM data and line
SNR cut-off of 15, considering an accuracy of 70% to the
original recovered parameters."
"For the 57 objects studied in this work, we have a total
of 82 different measurements of Hβ, Hα and MgII lines, out
of which ∼ 42% of objects have continuum and line SNR
greater than 100 and 15, respectively. Also, for all the objects
the BLR sizes obtained from model fits are consistent with
those obtained from conventional CCF analysis within the
errors. However, as the SNR is found to have a major effect
on the derived sizes of the BLR from the simulations, we note
that the values of the size of the BLR obtained for sources
with continuum and line light curves with SNR lesser than
100 and 15, respectively, needs to be used with caution. We
also carried out an analysis of the correlation of τd and the
BLR sizes obtained from model to the luminosity to only
those sources that have the continuum and line light curves
SNR greater than 100 and 15, respectively. Though the trend
of the correlation is similar to that of the full sample, the
significance of the correlation is not strong due to the low
number of sources."
"We show in Appendix B (see Fig. B1), sample light
curves and the recovered transfer functions for two sources.
One belongs to J1411+537 that has good quality light curves
with continuum and line SNR of about 386 and 60, respec-
tively. The other light curves belong to J1417+519, that
has SNR of about 9 and 3 for the continuum and line light
curves, respectively. From these light curves it is clear that
BLR parameters are well constrained only for sources with
good SNR data."
5 SUMMARY
"We analysed RM data collected from the literature for a
total of 57 AGN that includes 51 AGN with Hβ data, 26
AGN with Hα data and 6 AGN with MgII line data. The
main motivation is to constrain the structure and dynamics
of the BLR that emits MgII, Hβ and Hα. We summarize our
results below"
"(i) The estimated BLR sizes using our approach are in
general consistent with that calculated from conventional
CCF analysis."
"(ii) The best-fitted model Hβ BLR size is correlated with
L5100 having a slope of 0.58 ± 0.03. This is similar to what
is known in literature from CCF analysis. We also examined
the correlation of RBLR (Hα) with the continuum luminos-
ity at 5100 Å and found a slope of 0.47 ± 0.08 similar to
what is expected from photo-ionization calculations. How-
ever more Hα measurements are needed to better constrain
this correlation."
"(iii) We estimated virial factor using geometrical param-
eters and obtained a mean of 1.78 ± 1.77. The model virial
factor is consistent with the virial factor obtained by the ra-
tio of MBH from M − σ∗ relation to the virial product (VP)"
"obtained from RM. Using line light curves only it is not pos-
sible to constrain the virial factor fBLR (Li et al. 2013). For
that reason our measured fBLR have large uncertainties be-
cause of large errors present in both θinc and θopn obtained
from the model fitting."
"(iv) We found a close correspondence between the BLR
size found from model and that estimated from CCF anal-
ysis, however, some objects do show large deviation. The
objects that show large deviation from the RBLR(model) =
RBLR(CCF) line have poor quality light curves."
"(v) The mean value of the non linearity parameter γ is
found to be non zero for different lines indicating devia-
tion from linear response of the line emission to the optical
ionizing continuum. This may be due to a) the anomalous
behaviour of the BLR region because of the poor correlation
between optical continuum variability and the ionizing con-
tinuum variability (Edelson et al. 1996; Maoz et al. 2002;
Gaskell et al. 2019) and b) anisotropic line emission from
the partially optically thick BLR. This anisotropic effect is
not considered in the model used here."
"(vi) Variability analysis of the sample indicates that line
varies more than the continuum. The damping time scale
obtained from modeling is found to be positively correlated
with the continuum luminosity at 5100 Å."
"(vii) From the analysis of the simulated light curves, we
conclude that reliable estimation of BLR size as well as other
parameters via the modeling approach requires continuum
and line light curves with SNR greater than 100 and 15,
respectively."
"This work has considerably increased the number of ob-
jects investigated through geometrical modeling of the BLR.
Despite that, we were able to estimate fBLR for only about
a dozen objects. Analysis of high quality data sets for more
number of AGN are needed to find precise estimates of fBLR
which can then be used with the conventional RM techniques
to estimate more accurate MBH values."

"APPENDIX A: BLR LAG MEASUREMENT OF
J1420+526 FOR Hα LINE USING ICCF"
"Grier et al. (2017b) did not perform CCF analysis to mea-
sure the Hα lag for the object J1420+526. We estimated the
Hα lag for this object using Interpolated Cross-correlation
Function (ICCF) analysis method as shown in Fig. A1. The
lag and its uncertainty are estimated using a Monte Carlo
simulation based on the flux randomization (FR) and ran-
dom subset selection (RSS) described in Peterson et al.
(1998), Wandel et al. (1999) and Peterson et al. (2004). The
median of the centroid distribution is considered as final
lag while uncertainties were estimated within a 68% confi-
dence interval around the median value. We obtained the
rest frame Hα lag of 32.22+7.75−11.55 days from ICCF method.
The lag estimated based on modeling is 46.67 ± 9.8 days
which is consistent with CCF lag within error bars."
"APPENDIX B: EXAMPLES OF MODEL FIT LIGHT
CURVES AND TRANSFER FUNCTIONS"
"We show in Figure B1 light curves for two objects, namely
J1411+537 having high SNR in the continuum and line, and
J1411+537 having poor SNR in both the light curves. From
the figure it is evident that the geometrical model parame-
ters (θinc and θopn) are well-constrained for J1411+537 but
not constrained for J1411+537. This is due to the low SNR
of the continuum and line light curves in J1411+537."
