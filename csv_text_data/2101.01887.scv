ABSTRACT
Environmental effects are crucial to the understanding of the evolution of galaxies in dense environ-
"ments, such as galaxy clusters. Using the large field-of-view of SITELLE, the unique imaging fourier"
"transform spectrograph at CFHT, we are able to obtain 2D spectral information for a large and com-"
plete sample of cluster galaxies out to the infall region. We describe a pipeline developed to identify
emission line galaxies (ELGs) from the datacube using cross-correlation techniques. We present results
based on the spatial offsets between the emission-line regions and stellar continua in ELGs from two
"z∼0.25 galaxy clusters, Abell 2390 and Abell 2465. We find a preference in the offsets being pointed
away from the cluster center. Combining the two clusters, there is a 3σ excess for high-velocity galax-"
ies within the virial radius having the offsets to be pointed away from the cluster center. Assuming
"the offset being a proxy for the velocity vector of a galaxy, as expected from ram pressure stripping,"
this excess indicates that ram pressure stripping occurs most effectively during the first passage of an
"infalling galaxy, leading to the quenching of its star formation. We also find that, outside the virial"
"region, the continuum-normalized Hα line flux for infalling galaxies with large offsets are on average"
"lower than those with small or no measurable offset, further supporting ram pressure as a dominant"
quenching mechanism during the initial infall stages.

1. INTRODUCTION
It is an established consensus that the evolution of
"galaxies is affected by their environment, especially in"
"high density regions such as rich galaxy clusters (e.g.,"
"Ellingson et al. 2001, Lewis et al. 2002, Kauffmann et al."
"2004, Boselli & Gavazzi 2006, Poggianti et al. 2006,"
"Weinmann et al. 2009, Sobral et al. 2011, Muzzin et al."
"2012, Foltz et al. 2018, Pintos-Castro et al. 2019). In"
galaxy clusters the interplay between galaxies and the
host cluster is likely responsible for the quenching of star
"qliu@astro.utoronto.ca, hyee@astro.utoronto.ca"
"formation in galaxies, i.e., the suppression or cessation"
"of star formation, aside from their internal secular evolu-"
tions. Such external effects shape the observed correla-
tion between the star formation rate (SFR) and the envi-
"ronmental density (e.g., Balogh et al. 1998, Gómez et al."
"2003, Peng et al. 2010, Kawinwanichakij et al. 2017),"
which is closely related to the well-known morphology-
"density relation (e.g., Dressler 1980, Goto et al. 2003,"
Postman et al. 2005).
One of the breakthroughs of present-day observational
"techniques is 2D imaging spectroscopy, such as the In-"
"tegral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopy. Several recent, or"
"ongoing, IFU surveys such as CALIFA (Sánchez et al."

2 Liu et al."
"2012), MaNGA (Bundy et al. 2015) and SAMI (Green"
"et al. 2018), have been transforming the field of extra-"
"galactic studies. In particular, observations with 2D"
imaging spectroscopy have unveiled novel and important
insights about impacts of environments on galaxy evo-
"lution in high density regions (e.g., Brough et al. 2013,"
"Poggianti et al. 2017a, Schaefer et al. 2017, Coenda et al."
"2019, Cortese et al. 2019, Graham et al. 2019, Schaefer"
et al. 2019).
A new prospect is revealed by the state-of-the-
art imaging Fourier transform spectrograph (IFTS)
SITELLE (Drissen et al. 2019) on the Canada-France-
Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). Thanks to its incomparably
"wide field-of-view (FOV) of 11′ × 11′, SITELLE pro-
vides a unique opportunity to study environmental ef-"
fects on star formation in galaxy clusters in more details.
"Specifically, SITELLE allows us to simultaneously ac-"
"quire spatially-resolved spectral information for a large,"
complete and luminosity-limited sample of emission-line
galaxies (ELGs). Its spatial coverage extends out to the
"cluster infall region at z ∼ 0.25. This is unprecedented;
existing spatially-resolved data on galaxy clusters are"
limited in either field coverage or spectral resolution.
"With abundant information, both spectral and spatial,"
"encoded in emission lines, SITELLE offers an excellent"
opportunity to gain a better understanding of star for-
mation in galaxy clusters and investigate the mecha-
nisms responsible for the quenching of star formation in
high density environments.
Many possible external quenching mechanisms have
been investigated in the past two decades: gas strip-
"ping, starvation, harassment, thermal evaporation, pre-"
"processing, etc. (see Boselli & Gavazzi 2006 for a re-"
"view). Among all the competing quenching mechanisms,"
the dynamical interaction of the gas in the cluster galaxy
"with the intracluster medium (ICM), typically in the"
"form of ram pressure stripping (Gunn & Gott 1972), has"
been considered to be one of the most efficient physi-
cal mechanisms to quench star formation activities in
star-forming galaxies (SFGs) through the removal of
"cold gas. For example, Muzzin et al. (2014) concluded"
that ram pressure stripping is the most plausible mecha-
nism for satellite quenching by investigating the dynam-
"ics and quenching timescales of z∼1 cluster galaxies in
the GCLASS survey; Boselli et al. (2016) found rapid"
quenching timescales accompanied with HI deficiencies
"in the Virgo cluster by fitting photometric bands, which"
indicates ram pressure as the main source of quench-
ing in Virgo. Evidence of quenching by ram pressure
has been widely found in many other observational and
"simulation works (e.g., Abadi et al. 1999, Fujita & Na-"
"gashima 1999, Mayer et al. 2006, Boselli et al. 2008,"
"Bekki 2014, Bahé & McCarthy 2015, Jaffé et al. 2015,"
"Boselli et al. 2016, Fillingham et al. 2016, Jaffé et al."
"2016, Poggianti et al. 2017a, Yoon et al. 2017, Boselli"
"et al. 2019, Lotz et al. 2019, Owers et al. 2019, Wang"
et al. 2020).
One prominent observational feature of the ram pres-
sure effect is a disturbed gas morphology. The peculiar
disturbance of the HI gas distribution in cluster galax-
ies has been observed (Haynes et al. 1984; Chung et al.
"2007, Jaffé et al. 2015, Yoon et al. 2017) as an indi-"
cation of the action of ram pressure. Star formation
could subsequently occur in the disturbed gas and in-
"duce ionization, when it condenses or is compressed by"
"shock waves, leading to disturbed or asymmetric ionized"
gas distributions that are observable in UV/Hα/optical
bands (Koopmann & Kennedy 1999; Yoshida et al. 2008;
Smith et al. 2010; Jaffé et al. 2018). The most extreme
"cases are known as “jellyfish galaxies” (e.g., Ebeling"
"et al. 2014, Poggianti et al. 2017a, Jaffé et al. 2018),"
which are nearby SFGs exhibiting conspicuous extended
"ionized gas tails. Therefore, analyzing the properties of"
gas in cluster galaxies is promising for shedding light
on the mechanism of ram pressure stripping and placing
constraints on numeric simulations of their evolutions
"in dense environments. For example, many interesting"
results have been revealed by the MUSE GASP survey
(Poggianti et al. 2017a) about the properties of jellyfish
galaxies and the implications on their evolution histo-
This kind of analysis is well suited to 2D spectroscopic
observations using SITELLE. An ongoing project using
SITELLE targeting the Hα+[N ii] lines in clusters at
"z∼0.25 is being implemented to characterize the prop-
erties of ionized gas in cluster galaxies, including lumi-"
"nosity, morphology, kinematics, ionization states, etc.,"
and to study how these properties correlate with the lo-
cal environment or the cluster. SITELLE data have the
"capacity to perform a rich class of interesting science,"
though in this paper we limit our investigation to the
ionized gas morphologies. The goals of this paper are :
1) to describe the methodology of detection and identifi-
"cation of ELGs from the SITELLE datacubes, and 2) to"
present initial results from a small sample of two clusters
based on the spatial offset of ionized gas in search for
the evidence of ram pressure stripping. Our conclusions
"are tentative yet intriguing, but this work serves as a"
pilot study demonstrating the prospect of SITELLE in
studying ELGs in galaxy clusters. Although the spatial
resolution is not as high as MUSE to resolve the gas into
"filaments, we are able to study the ionized gas using a"
large and comprehensive sample out to the infall region.
SITELLE Cluster ELGs 3
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes
the SITELLE observation and the cluster targets ob-
"served, Abell 2390 and Abell 2465. Section 3 presents"
our pipeline used to automatically detect and identify
ELGs from the datacube. We describe the method of
measuring the centroids of emission-line light and stel-
lar continuum light and show the results based on these
centroids in Section 4. Section 5 discusses the impli-
cations of the results. We summarize our findings and
"conclusions in Section 6. Throughout the paper, we as-"
"sume a cosmology with H0 = 70 km s
−1 Mpc−1, Ωm ="
0.3 and ΩΛ = 0.7.
2. OBSERVATIONS
2.1. SITELLE
"Our project uses SITELLE (Drissen et al. 2019), the"
new imaging Fourier instrument at CFHT. With a broad
"working wavelength range from 3500 Å to 9000 Å,"
SITELLE is designed to focus on emission-line objects.
Band-limiting filters are used to increase spectral reso-
lution with finite scanning steps and to reduce the con-
tamination from strong sky-lines. The equivalent spec-
tral resolution R of IFTS is determined by the total
number of mirror steps of the Michelson-type interfer-
"ometer, which is chosen to resolve the Hα and [N ii] lines"
and to provide spatially-resolved kinematic information.
The primary science drivers for SITELLE include neb-
"ulae and supernova remnants in the Milky Way, H ii and"
"star-formation regions in nearby galaxies, and ELGs in"
galaxy clusters. The uniqueness of SITELLE in study-
"ing galaxy clusters is its unparalleled 11′ × 11′ FOV,
allowing for IFU-like 2D spectroscopy of a large and"
"complete, luminosity-limited ELG sample of a cluster."
"The SITELLE data product is a spectral datacube,"
"with an image at each wavelength step (“channel”), af-"
"ter being corrected, transformed and calibrated by the"
ORBS1 (Martin et al. 2015) pipeline. The pixel scale of
"SITELLE is 0.322′′/pix, with 2048×2064 pixels in total.
The optical-to-near-infrared night sky is densely oc-"
"cupied by OH molecular lines, leading to the difficulty"
of observing redshifted Hα lines. To reduce sky contam-
"ination, a narrow window (796 nm – 826 nm) that is"
less affected by sky-lines is selected for the design of the
"SITELLE C4 filter, which corresponds to the redshift"
"range of Hα-[N ii] lines at 0.21-0.25, allowing us to detect"
ELGs in that redshift range. The window corresponds
to the region where the observing efficiency of SITELLE
"(CCD quantum efficiency, modulation efficiency and op-"
tical transmission) is the highest (at around 800 nm).

"Detailed information about SITELLE, including the"
"instrumentation design, the advantages and drawbacks"
"of IFTS, science capabilities and commission perfor-"
"mance, can be found in Drissen et al. (2019)."
2.2. Target Clusters
The observations for the first two targets for the sur-
vey were carried out on SITELLE in 2017 and 2018 on
two well-studied galaxy clusters: Abell 2390 and Abell
"2465 (hereafter, A2390 and A2465)."
A2390 is a rich massive cool-core galaxy cluster
"(M200 ≈ 2× 1015 M�) at redshift of 0.228. It has been
widely studied in many previous studies for the under-"
"standing of galaxy evolution in dense environment (e.g.,"
"Yee et al. 1996, Abraham et al. 1996, Balogh & Morris"
"2000, Fritz et al. 2005). For example, Abraham et al.
(1996) found that the cluster is gradually formed by the"
accretion of infalling galaxies with truncation in their
star formation by investigating the properties (kinemat-
"ics, colors, morphologies, etc.) of a large sample of clus-"
ter galaxies using the CNOC data (Yee et al. 1996).
"Different from A2390, A2465 consists of two merg-"
"ing subclusters, a north-east (NE) clump A2465NE and"
"a south-west (SW) clump A2465SW, at a redshift of"
0.245 (Wegner 2011). Members of the subclusters have
been identified based on kinematic energies for the mea-
surements of properties for each subcluster in Wegner
(2011). The two subclusters have roughly equal virial
masses. A series of detailed multi-wavelength analyses
on A2465 can be found in Wegner (2011) and Wegner
"et al. (2015, 2017), where the authors found interesting"
results revealing its collision history and the evolution
"history of galaxies within it. The redshifts, positions,"

and physical properties of the two target clusters ob-
served by SITELLE are summarized in Table 1.
There are three pointings for A2390 and one for
A2465. The initial observational design was to use an
"observation time of 4 hr per pointing, including overhead"
"between steps, with ∼150 steps, producing a resolution
R ∼1300, sufficient to resolve the Hα-[N ii] lines. How-
ever, for A2390C, which was observed during a commis-"
"sioning run for the science verification for the C4 filter,"
"only a shorter exposure of 3 hours was obtained, re-"
sulting in fewer steps and a lower R. The number of
"steps was increased for the subsequent run for A2365C,"
"and future targets, to achieve better spectral resolution."
Observational information on the four fields including
"the total number of mirror steps, the exposure time,"
"the average wavelength interval, the average seeing, the"
"approximate spectral resolution, and the coordinates of"
field centers are listed in Table 2.
3. EMISSION-LINE GALAXY IDENTIFICATION
The IFTS spectral datacube is transformed from the
original interferometric cube acquired by SITELLE at
CFHT and calibrated with the data reduction software
ORBS (Martin et al. 2015). This section introduces the
procedures for detecting and identifying ELGs from the
SITELLE spectral datacube.
3.1. Sky-Line Subtraction
While the C4 filter is designed to minimize the num-
"ber of OH sky-lines in the spectral region, the sky con-"
tinuum and a few sky-lines still dominate the spectral
"range of the filter. Therefore, we first subtract the sky"
background in each channel. The background is evalu-
ated and subtracted in 2D using the photutils package.
"The background is locally estimated within a 128× 128
pix2 box using a mode estimator and then subtracted"
from the data of each channel. The spectral axis of the
datacube is clipped into 12100 – 12550 cm−1 and con-
verted into wavelength corresponding to 7970 Å – 8265
Å. The wavelength axis is then interpolated to be uni-
formly spaced in logarithmic scale. A stacked image is
also created by coadding of all the channels within this
spectral range for the initial source detection described
in Section 3.3.
3.2. Fringe Reduction using Low-pass Filtering
The interferometric nature of SITELLE and the pres-
ence of strong sky-lines in the C4 filter induce fringes
across the field in specific channels. The fringes are su-
perimposed on the uneven large-scale background that
has been subtracted in Section 3.1 . The level of con-
tamination from these fringes depends on the channel
"wavelength, the number of mirror steps, and the posi-"
"tion in the field. In general, channels around stronger"
sky-lines with fewer mirror steps (i.e. lower spectral res-
olution) present brighter fringes away from the field cen-
ter. The brightness and spatial pattern of these fringes
"differ from channel to channel, which makes it challeng-"
ing to model them from first principles. The brightness
of fringes vary across the field and could be compara-
"ble to/brighter than a large number of sources, affecting"
"the source detection, ELG identification, and potentially"
"their measurements. We adopt an empirical method to
reduce the influence of fringes by applying low-pass fil-"
tering (LPF) on each channel. Details of the LPF pro-
cedure and a figure illustrating the fringes and cleaning
are presented in Appendix A.
3.3. Source Detection and Spectral Extraction
Although the fringes have been alleviated by the LPF
"procedure, small-scale fringe residuals from the sky oc-"
casionally show up in some channels because of the finite
kernel size used. We apply a moving average procedure
to further mitigate fringe contamination (Appendix A)
and construct a new datacube for source detection. We
note that this smoothed datacube is used only for source
detection but not for analysis. The new datacube is col-
lapsed in the spectral axis into an image for the detection
of ELGs (referred to below as the “detection image”)
generated by using the maximum value in the spectral
6 Liu et al.
"axis at each spatial position, taking advantage of the"
2D spectroscopy. Using the maxima in wavelength en-
hances the possibility of detecting weak narrow peaks.
We compare the output candidate list obtained from the
detection image with the one from the mean image of
all channels and it proves that the detection image con-
structed in such way offers a more complete sample that
includes line emitters with weak or zero continuum.
The python software photutils is used to detect
and deblend sources. We adopt a detection signal-to-
"noise ratio (S/N) threshold of 2.5, a 5 pixel connec-"
"tion, a multi-thresholding level number of 64, and a"
local peak contrast of 0.01. The threshold is locally es-
timate based on a 2D background estimate using the
SExtractorBackground class as in Section 3.1. A seg-
mentation map is created in this process. An integrated
spectrum of each detected source is extracted from the
low-pass-filtered datacube using the corresponding seg-
mentation in the map. These spectra are used for source
"identification and redshift measurement. In total, the"
"detection algorithm locates ∼2000 sources in A2390C
field, ∼1500 sources in A2390E/W fields, and ∼1200
sources in A2465C field."
3.4. Removal of Continuum
For the purpose of automatically identifying ELGs us-
"ing templates that only contain emission lines, the con-"
tinua of sources must be subtracted to obtain the resid-
ual emission lines. This is accomplished using Gaussian
"Process (GP) regression, typically used for fitting curves"
in a non-parametric manner. The advantage of using GP
"regression is its flexibility, which allows for slight vari-"
ations in the continuum such as a mild gradient and is
able to smoothly tackle possible irregularity around the
filter edges. We use the GaussianProcessRegressor
realization in the python package scikit-learn. The
kernel is chosen to be a combination of a radial basis
function (RBF) kernel with a bandwidth of 100 Å (such
that it is wider than the width of Hα-[N ii] lines) which
"accounts for the continuum component, and a white ker-"
nel accounting for the noise. Possible emission that is
one σ above the median value of the spectrum is iter-
atively replaced with the median. In the case of a few
"bright sources, the sharp drops around the filter edges"
make them poorly fitted by smooth GP kernels and are
masked in the fitting. This procedure is applied on each
of the integrated spectra extracted in Section 3.3.
3.5. Construction of Line Template
We use the cross-correlation technique to identify
ELGs from detected sources. It is done by cross-
correlating the normalized residual spectra with a li-
brary of emission-line templates. While the obser-
vation is designed to capture the Hα-[N ii] lines in
"the galaxy cluster, emission lines other than Hα-[N ii]"
"(e.g., [O iii]λ5007 at z∼0.64, [O ii]λ3727 at z∼1.2)
from background sources may fall into the filter as"
well. To construct a robust ELG sample for cluster
"members, it is critical to distinguish these lines from"
the target Hα+[N ii] lines. Below we describe three
sets of emission-line templates used to perform cross-
correlation.
The primary set includes the Hα line and the
"[N ii]λλ6548,6584 lines, with a fixed line ratio between"
[N ii]λ6584 and [N ii]λ6548 of 3:1 (Acker et al. 1989).
The line ratio between Hα and [N ii]λ6584 varies from
1:1 to 8:1 uniformly in logarithmic scale. The second
"set consists of the [O iii]λλ4959,5007 doublet, with the"
line ratio of [O iii]λ5007 to [O iii]λ4959 varying from 2:1
"to 4:1. The Hβ line is not included in the template set,"
considering that in most cases it is located out of the
filter or at the filter’s blue edge in the presence of the
"[O iii] doublet. As a result, the inclusion of Hβ might re-"
duce the optimal S/N of a spectrum with only the [O iii]
"doublet in the cross-correlation process, and therefore"
it is removed from the template. The third set con-
"tains a single line, which represents several possible ori-"
"gins including an [O ii]λ3727 line at z∼1.2, an isolated
[O iii]λ5007 line with an undetected weak [O iii]λ4959"
"or with [O iii]λ4959 outside of the blue band limit, a Hα"
"line with undetected [N ii] (e.g., from metal-poor galax-"
"ies, or with low S/N), an isolated Hβ at z∼0.66 with the
[O iii]λ4959 outside of the red band limit, and possibly"
"a bright Lyα emitter at z∼5.5.
The template lines are broadened into Gaussian pro-"
files by convolution:

thy that the intrinsic line shape of SITELLE is a sinc-
gaussian resulting from an instrumental sinc line shape
with Gaussian broadening (Drissen et al. 2019). How-
"ever, in practice, introducing sinc-gaussian in a template"
adds another degree of freedom and sometimes uninten-
tionally magnifies the noise. This is possibly due to

the lower S/N in the data as the observation was ob-
tained in the verification run. In the C4 filter potential
sky-line residuals also make it noisier than observations
using bluer SITELLE filters. Consider the fact that us-
ing Gaussian templates in cross-correlation would not
practically reduce the efficiency of ELG identification
"and narrow-band centroids in this study, we opt to use"
"Gaussian line templates. Nevertheless, we caution the"
readers that when carrying out line fitting procedures
to obtain delicate information such as line kinematics
"and their uncertainties, the use of sinc-gauss functions"
is more ideal (see documents of ORCS2 and Martin et al.
2015) for SITELLE.
3.6. Cross-correlation with Template
"Cross-correlation, also known as matched filtering, is a"
technique widely used in signal processing that is applied
for the optimization of the S/N by cross-correlating the
observed signal with templates:
CCF (v ↔ δλ) = [F ? T ] (δλ)
"∫ λ2
λ1"
"F (λ)T (λ+ δλ) dλ ,
(2)"
where F (λ) is the input continuum-subtracted spectrum
"within the filter range (λ1, λ2), and CCF is the cross-"
"correlation function. By convention, CCF is in units of"
"velocity v, which is converted from wavelength differ-"
ence δλ. The residual spectra is normalized and linearly
interpolated with twice as many points as the original
spectra in log scale for a higher precision in peak match-
"ing. In essence, the cross-correlation procedure accom-"
"plishes two jobs: the detection of a potential signal, and"
the localization of its position (redshift). This is run on
all the extracted integrated spectra obtained above.
"The S/N of the CCF, (S/N)cc, is calculated as follows:"
"(S/N)cc =
CCFmax
σcc"
where CCFmax is the peak of the CCF and σcc is the
rms noise calculated in the region 5σline away from any
of the line centers. A wider signal range (8σline) is used
if the matched line ratio Hα/[N ii]λ6584 is lower than
3:1 in high S/N cases ((S/N)cc > 50) in order to better
match bright broad lines. Regions near the filter edges
"(∼20Å) are clipped when calculating (S/N)cc. (S/N)cc
gives an estimate of the credibility of emission, but it"
does not place constraints on the line width and ratio.
2 http://celeste.phy.ulaval.ca/orcs-doc
We further use a significance parameter R defined as:
"R = ξ · γ = CCFmax
CCF"
"(2)
max"
"· (S/N)cc
(S/N)cc,max"
"which multiplies the peak contrast ξ, defined as the ra-"
tio of the highest peak to the second highest peak of the
"CCF, by the credibility γ, defined as the ratio of the"
computed (S/N)cc and the highest (S/N)cc among all
templates. The best matched template is chosen as the
one with maximum R. The parameter R is motivated
by experiments suggesting that maxmizing R typically
returns better estimates for the line ratio and the line
"width σline than simply using (S/N)cc,max, while retain-"
ing the accuracy of the matched redshift. Examples of
CCF are shown in the right panels of Figure 3 with the
corresponding residual spectra shown in the left panels.
With the aid of visually inspecting a number of spectra
"and their CCF, we apply the following S/N criteria to"
select potential ELG candidates for detection:
"• (S/N)cc,Hα > 5 or (S/N)cc,OIII > 5 ,"
"• (S/N)cc,single > 3 ,"
"where (S/N)cc,Hα, (S/N)cc,OIII and (S/N)cc,single are"
the resultant (S/N)cc using the three template sets.
"We then calculate quick estimates of Wem, the equiv-"
alent width of the total emission using a 10 σline wide
"window, for the purpose of reducing false detections."
"An uncertainty of Wem, σ(Wem), is roughly obtained"
by perturbing spectra 250 times with the continuum
rms. We require the candidate to have Wem > 5Å and
Wem > σ(Wem) to be considered as a detection. We
further require the candidate to be located at least 20
pixels away from the field edge and its matched peak at
least 20 Å away from the filter edge.
"Through all the steps above, we achieve a list"
"of ELGs in each of the fields, with 88/80/72 from"
the A2390C/A2390E/A2390W field and 111 from the
A2465C field. Repeated detections in overlapping field
coverage of A2390 are cross-matched and cleaned when
"combining detections among fields. Finally, a visual"
check is done on all the candidates to screen out du-
bious detections and to confirm strong [O iii] emitters.
"In total, 194 ELGs are found in A2390 and 110 ELGs"
are found in A2465. ELGs identified in the A2390 and
"A2465C are marked in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respec-"
"tively, which includes line emitters in the background."
"In A2390, the central field has the most ELGs, while"
A2465C shows an excess close to the center of the
south-west subcluster. The prevalence of ELGs found
in A2465C suggest enhanced star formation occurring in
"the merging clusters, as observed and discussed in Weg-"

4. ANALYSIS OF SPATIAL OFFSET OF IONIZED
"With the acquired ELG list, a simple yet interesting"
analysis is to investigate the connection between the spa-
tial offset of ionized gas from its parent galaxy and the
cluster center in search for ram pressure stripping ef-
fects. We present in this section some initial results
based on the centroid offsets between emission-line re-
gions and stellar continua in the two clusters observed
by SITELLE.
In Section 4.1 we introduce the methodology of mea-
suring the centroids of ionized gas and stellar contin-
uum. We then measure the centroid offset and the dif-
ference angle between the emission-to-continuum vector
and the cluster-centric vector following the analysis of
Smith et al. (2010). We show the centroid analysis re-
sults of A2390 and A2465 in Section 4.2.

centroid of the ionized gas and the centroid of the stel-
lar continuum for each cluster galaxy as follow:
"For each galaxy, a thumbnail datacube centered on"
"the object is created. The continuum image, IC(x, y), is"
constructed by taking the mean value of channels in the
"continuum range at each position (x, y) after an itera-"
tive 3σ-clipping. The continuum range is defined as the
"region further than 15× (1 + zcc) Å away from the [N ii]
lines, but at least 20 Å away from the filter edges. The"
"emission image, IE(x, y), is constructed in a narrow-"
band likewise by taking the mean of the few channels
"within ± 5× (1 + zcc) Å around the matched Hα peak.
The continuum image is subtracted from it to obtain the"
final emission image.
"Another source detection is performed on IC(x, y) and"
"IE(x, y) using a detection S/N threshold of 2.5, with"
nearby sources masked using the segmentation map in
Section 3.3. The detection of emission or continuum
could fail for a portion of objects in the case of object
being : (1) a faint target with low S/N; (2) a background
source with weak or no detectable continuum; (3) a false
positive peak composed of noise; and (4) close to con-
taminants such as stars or diffraction spikes. For objects
with successful detections in both emission and contin-

"With the emission and continuum centroids, we then"
"measure the offset vector d, defined as the vector from"
the emission-line centroid to the continuum centroid:

and the difference angle between d and the cluster-
"centric vector r, a vector pointing from the galaxy to"
the brightest central galaxy (BCG):
"θd = ](d, r) , (8)"
Given that the offset is much smaller than the dis-
"tance to the BCG, the object center measured in the"
primary source detection is adopted as the galaxy cen-
ter. An illustration of the definitions of quantities in the
measurements is shown in Figure 5. The uncertainty
propagation is presented in Appendix B.1. To remove

"measurements with larger uncertainties, we require the"
measured offset to have ∆ d > 3σ∆d and exclude objects
near the field edges (distance < 100 pix). These criteria
"reject ∼38% of the sample on average in the four fields.
We obtain 117 ELGs in A2390 and 75 ELGs in A2465"
after the rejection.
Figure 6 shows the distributions of ∆d for A2390 and
A2465. The centroid offsets are in general relatively
small. An empirical assessment for the centroid mea-
surements is presented in Appendix B.2 showing that
these relatively small ∆d can be measured robustly. The
"distributions of ∆d extend from 0 to ∼5 kpc. Their peak
positions deviate from zero, suggesting the existence of"
some impact on the spatial distribution of ionized gas
"relative to the stellar continuum, which one would ex-"
"pect from ram pressure stripping. However, as discussed"
"in Section 5.1, the offset alone cannot be fully attributed"
to the impact of ram pressure as it may also be caused
by strong outflow or tidal force. It may also be affected
by large star-forming clumps and dust geometry in the
"disks. Therefore, in the next section we explore whether"
"such an offset has a connection with the host cluster, i.e.,"
it is caused by environmental factors. Internal mecha-
nisms such as outflows are expected to be uncorrelated
"with the cluster center. We note that, alternatively, one"
can measure the morphological centroids of the regions
without weighting by light. The measurements and re-
"sults are presented in Appendix C, where the two meth-"
ods produce similar results.
4.2. Distribution of Difference Angles in A2390 and
"In the search for evidence of ram pressure effects, it"
is of great interest to further investigate the correlation
between the emission spatial offset and the cluster cen-
"ter, i.e. the distribution of the difference angles, because"
the strength and direction of the ram pressure from the
ICM on the galaxy are expected to be closely linked to
the infalling galaxy’s orbit and position in the cluster.
Because small spatial offsets are prone to be affected by
"measurement uncertainties, we further limit our sample"
to ELGs with a cutoff in the measured offset. We choose
a physical length of 1 kpc that is higher than the peak
"values of distributions of ∆d to be the sample threshold,"
"which corresponds to ∼0.85 pix in A2390 and ∼0.8 pix
in A2465. The results are qualitatively the same with a"
slightly higher or lower threshold adopted. Examples of
∆d measurements are shown in Figure 4 where the con-
tours and centroids for Hα emission and continuum are
displayed. It is interesting to note that the ELGs with
∆d < 1kpc show Hα emission being largely symmetric
"with the continuum, while those with larger ∆d display"
a clear non-symmetry.
"Finally, we obtain 55 ELGs from A2390 and 24 ELGs"
"from A2465 out of the parent ELG samples. Hereafter,"
these ELGs with relatively large emission-to-continuum
offsets (∆d) are referred to as the selected ELGs.
4.2.1. Abell 2390
Figure 7 shows positions of the cluster ELGs in the
A2390 fields and Figure 8 presents their locations on the
phase space diagram. The phase space diagram plots
the distribution of the projected positions and velocities
"of galaxies, normalized by R200 and the cluster velocity"
"dispersion, respectively. This is often used as an in-"
dication of the cluster galaxy’s dynamical state in the
"cluster (e.g., Noble et al. 2013, Muzzin et al. 2014, Jaffé"
"et al. 2015, Rhee et al. 2017, Yoon et al. 2017). We"
use the phase space diagram to identify cluster mem-
"bers, i.e., galaxies bound to the gravitational field of the"
"host cluster, by excluding ELGs falling above the escape"
velocity boundary (black solid line in Figure 8).

"sample (∆d > 1 kpc), where the blue solid circles indi-"
"cate those with θd ≤ 90◦ and red solid circles indicate
those with θd > 90"
◦. The BCG itself is a strong ELG
"(Hutchings & Balogh 2000), which has been excluded in"
our analysis. The direction of the ionized gas offset rel-
ative to the stellar continuum (opposite to d) measured
with flux-weighted centroids is indicated by arrows. The
rest of the cluster ELGs with small offset detected (∆d >
1 kpc) are shown as gray solid circles. Non-cluster mem-
"bers are marked as open symbols, with the same color"
coding as the others. There are more cluster ELGs with
ionized gas offsets pointing away from the cluster center
than those pointing toward the cluster center in the NW
"and SE fields, while they are comparable in the central"
field. It is notable that there appears to be a small group
of cluster ELGs in the north-west of the cluster center
"having gas offset away from the cluster center. Indeed,"
two galaxy groups have been identified in that region
using the photometric redshift in Li et al. (2009).

the collision of the two clusters.
5. DISCUSSION
"In this section, we discuss the implications of the ob-"
"served spatial offsets of ionized gas, specifically on the"
non-uniform distribution of difference angles and the ex-
cess in region II on the cluster phase space diagram. We
then propose a scenario which qualitatively explains the
observation.
5.1. Ionized Gas Centroid Offset: Ram Pressure
Stripping in the Act
"It is natural to infer that under ram pressure, the gas"
offset in a galaxy moving through the ICM generally
follows the opposite direction to its velocity relative to
"the ICM, given the pressure follows (Gunn & Gott 1972):"
"Pram = ρICMv
2
gal , (9)"
where ρICM is the local ICM density and vgal is the rel-
"ative velocity. Due to the projection effect, it is hard to"
determine velocities in 3D and connect them to the 2D
"gas offsets. However, observations have revealed that"
recent infall gas-rich galaxies in clusters affected by ram
pressure are mostly on highly radial orbits (Chung et al.
"2007, Smith et al. 2010, Vulcani et al. 2017, Jaffé et al."
2018; see also Ebeling et al. 2014 where such effect is ob-
served on galaxies with tangential infall orbits.). This
suggests a connection between the projected offset of
ionized gas emission in these galaxies and their direc-
"tions to the cluster center. In fact, Smith et al. (2010)"
observed that ionized gas tails of gas-stripping galaxies
in the nearby Coma cluster predominantly point oppo-
site to the cluster center using UV+Hα data. Vulcani
et al. (2017) found that ram pressure stripped SFGs out
to 0.5 virial radius in intermediate redshift clusters pref-
erentially show radial Hα offsets away from the cluster
"center. Using the IllustrisTNG simulations, Yun et al."
(2019) investigated the directions of gas tails of jellyfish
galaxies in galaxy clusters in 3D. They found a nearly
flat distribution with slow drops in the 0◦ and 180◦ ends
for the angle between gas tail and direction to the host
"center. This is not unexpected, as, unlike in 2D, in"
3D only galaxies with purely radial orbits would show
gas tails aligned with the direction to the cluster center.
"However, they did observe a tight correlation between"
"the directions of gas tails and the 3D velocity vector,"
"which should also hold in 2D projection, allowing us to"
use the offset vector as a proxy for the galaxy’s 2D pro-
jected velocity vector.
"Besides ram pressure stripping, other physical pro-"
cesses might serve as potential explanations for the ion-
ized gas offset such as:
(1) Outflows: strong outflows driven by active galac-
tic nuclei (AGNs) or starbursts have been observed in
"many active galaxies, which could also lead to signifi-"
"cant gas offset (e.g., Comerford et al. 2017, Russell et al."
2019). They are considered as an important source of
ICM heating to explain the cooling problem in galaxy
"clusters (e.g., Brüggen et al. 2005). Indeed, the high-"
velocity Hα bump in the the north-west of the BCG
of A2390 is likely to be driven by an AGN. Because we
have included galaxies with nuclear activities in our ELG
"sample, it cannot be ruled out that a portion of the spa-"
tial offsets of ionized gas in our ELG sample are caused
"by outflows. In fact, recent studies based on simulations"
and observations found that galactic nuclear activities
can be triggered by ram pressure stripping due to en-
hanced accretion onto the central black hole (e.g. Pog-
"gianti et al. 2017b, Ramos-Mart́ınez et al. 2018, Ricarte"
"et al. 2020). However, there has been little evidence"
of preference in outflow directions in galaxy clusters.
Because outflow is an internal phenomenon controlled
"by the central black hole in the nuclei region, its sub-"
sequent interaction with the gas in the host galaxy is
likely independent of the global environment. There-
"fore, gas offsets induced by outflows are not expected to"
have a correlation with the cluster center as observed.
SITELLE Cluster ELGs 15
Further analysis on the kinematics and ionization con-
ditions can discriminate gas offsets caused by outflows
and that from ram pressure.
(2) Tidal disruption: tidal forces from nearby encoun-
ters may contribute to the observed disturbance of the
"gas. For some ELGs in our sample, we indeed observe"
neighboring objects that are possibly interacting with
"them. However, pure tidal stripping have similar grav-"
"itational effects on gas and stars, leaving no offset be-"
"tween them. On the other hand, results from simula-"
"tions (e.g., Mayer et al. 2006; Kapferer et al. 2008; Vija-"
yaraghavan & Ricker 2013) have demonstrated that ram
pressure stripping is in fact more efficient in the presence
of tidal interactions. This is because the gas pulled out
of the galactic potential is more likely to be stripped
away by the ICM wind and local density ρICM is in-
creased by compression due to merger shocks. A larger
sample is needed to construct a sample of mergers with
reference to non-mergers to investigate the difference in
their ionized gas distributions.
Other systematics such as the presence of AGNs and
dust cause dilution effects in our centroid measurements
that decreases the large ∆d sample size and increases the
"uncertainties, but are unlikely to change the observed"
"patterns. Therefore, we conclude that the non-uniform"
distribution of the spatial offset of the ionized gas with
respect to the stellar disk in our observation is primarily
"contributed by ram pressure stripping. In comparison,"
the long-term interplay between a galaxy and the host
"cluster, such as strangulation or thermal evaporation,"
"would typically leave behind an undisturbed, symmetric"
gas distribution.
5.2. The Distributions of Ionized Gas Offset in Phase
"As discussed above, we are able to use the offset vec-"
tor d as a proxy for the projected velocity of an infalling
"galaxy, in light of ram pressure stripping acting as the"
main driver producing the non-uniformity that we ob-
serve in distributions of θd. Combining with the infall
history of a typical gas-rich cluster galaxy in the phase
"space diagram, the distributions of ELGs with large ion-"
ized gas offset in phase space offer evidence of ram pres-
sure stripping as a quenching mechanism in the act.
"5.2.1. Infall History of a Cluster Galaxy on the Phase
Space Diagram"
The trajectory of an infalling galaxy can be traced
on the cluster phase space diagram. The dark dashed
curve in Figure 12 illustrates the typical infall history of
a cluster galaxy.

I with a high gas fraction. During its first infall into

"the potential well of the cluster, the orbit can be highly"
"radial (e.g. Vulcani et al. 2017, Jaffé et al. 2018). It"
will increase its velocity as it approaches the orbit peri-
"center, moving toward the upper left of the phase space"
diagram (region II). The local ICM density also increases
as the galaxy penetrates into the cluster core. Conse-
"quently, the ram pressure from head-on ICM winds in-"
creases dramatically. It compresses and strips the cold
"gas, while having little effect on the stellar components."
The SFR may temporarily rise due to the compression
"of gas (e.g., Fujita & Nagashima 1999, Poggianti et al."
"2017a, Vulcani et al. 2018). As star formation proceeds,"
"the neutral gas offset propagates to ionized gas, lead-"
ing to the difference in the spatial distribution of emis-
"sion and continuum. Post pericenter, it will then turn"
around with decreasing velocity and move out of the cen-
"tral region, referred to as the “backsplash” stage (e.g.,"
"Gill et al. 2005, Muriel & Coenda 2014). As a result,"
the backsplash region overlaps with the lower-velocity
part of the first infall region. The galaxy then enters
its subsequent infall but with a lower gas fraction. Such
process may happen multiple times until the radial ve-
16 Liu et al.
"locity is dissipated as the galaxy spirals in. Eventually,"
"the galaxy falls into the virialized region, with little or"
no gas reservoir left to maintain its star formation.
The fact that cluster galaxies follow typical paths in
the course of their sinking into the cluster potential leads
to their occupations of certain regions on the phase space
"diagram. However, the condition becomes more com-"
plex when orbit orientation and projection effects are
taken into account. The light dashed line in Figure 12
illustrates the path of an infalling galaxy with a low
"inclination angle orbit, hence, with low line-of-sight ve-"
locity. While it still takes a few turnarounds to achieve
"the virialization of the orbit, the galaxy is not able to"
move up to region II in the phase space diagram due
"to the viewing angle of the orbit. As a consequence,"
region III also contains galaxies in their first passage.
Another concern is that an infalling galaxy physically
outside the virial radius may be projected to be within
"R200 on the phase space diagram. For an extreme case,"
a galaxy following an orbit along the line of sight could
have strong emission-lines detected if there is ongoing
"star formation, but it would barely move in the radial"
"axis. However, in this case the gas offset is also pro-"
"jected, which makes it more likely to have a small ∆d"
and thus be excluded from the selected sample.
"5.2.2. Excess of Gas Offset Vectors toward the Cluster
Center near Orbit Pericenters at First Infall"
The number ratios of blue to red symbols in region
"II (6:2 in A2390, and 8:1 in A2465 combining two sub-"
clusters) suggest that first-infalling galaxies have a pref-
erence for their ionized gas offsets to point away from
the cluster center when they approach the orbit pericen-
ters. The probability to have such ratios by coincidence
"is 11% for A2390, 4% for A2465, and 1% combining the"
"two, assuming an equal opportunity (i.e. a binomial"
distribution with p=0.5) for the offset vector to point
toward/away from the center.
Such preference can be attributed to the impact of
the radial component of the ram pressure on the clus-
ter galaxy. The result is consistent with the other ob-
servational evidence and simulations that suggest ram
pressure stripping has substantial effects when gas-rich
galaxies cross the cluster virial radius and is most effec-
"tive in their first infall (e.g., Jaffé et al. 2016, 2018; Lotz"
"et al. 2019). Because of the efficient removal of cold gas,"
star formation has been mostly suppressed before the
incoming galaxies turn around and start their second
infalls. The typical quenching timescale for these galax-
ies is thus suggested to be shorter than the ram pressure
"stripping timescale (. 1.5 Gyr within the virial radius,
Roediger et al. 2011) and the dynamic timescale of first"
"infall (1∼2 Gyr, Jaffé et al. 2018). Indeed, using cosmo-"
"logical hydrodynamical simulations, Lotz et al. (2019)"
found most satellite galaxies are quenched within 1 Gyr
during the first infall.
Starvation/strangulation may also play an important
"role in quenching cluster galaxies (e.g., Haines et al."
"2013, Peng et al. 2015) in which a cutoff of gas supply"
into the galaxy leads to the long-term exhaustion of gas
and thus a drop in the SFR. Whether the effect is domi-
nant for the evolution of cluster galaxies has not reached
"a consensus (e.g., Boselli et al. 2014, Peng et al. 2015)."
"However, such process operates on a longer timescale"
"(>3 Gyr, Boselli et al. 2014) and does not leave sys-"
tematic imprint on the gas spatial distribution. There-
fore we conclude at least for cluster galaxies entering
"region II (which have fallen into the cluster < 1∼2 Gyr
ago), ram pressure stripping is the predominant quench-"
"ing mechanism, although it is likely that halting the gas"
supply also catalyzes the process. Combining with other
"information such as the SFR, and gas fraction, and gas"
"kinematics, etc., future analyses using large samples of"
clusters would be promising in distinguishing the con-
tributions of different quenching mechanisms.
Roughly equal numbers of blue (offset away from the
center) and red (offset toward the center) symbols are
observed in the lower-velocity regions (regions I and III).
If a galaxy showing an offset toward the center has al-
ready entered and left region II and returned to region
"I (Figure 12), ram pressure stripping is expected to re-"
move most of the gas and lower the level of star forma-
"tion. However, they may still have detectable emission"
"lines, which indicates the existence of ionized gas. Sev-"
eral origins may explain their detected line emission and
"gas offsets: (1) they have low orbit inclinations, i.e., be-"
ing more face-on (the light dashed trajectory in Figure
"12), which leaves a larger projected gas offset, and thus"
have higher chances to be included in the selected sample
during the “backsplash” stage. (2) They could be low-
velocity infalling galaxies with large impact parameters.
The lower incoming velocities cause the ram pressure
to be low near orbit pericenters. (3) They might con-
tain face-on high-velocity fly-bys that spend less time
"near the pericenters. For a fly-by, the gas is only par-"
tially stripped by ram pressure after the passage close to
"the cluster core, but the disturbance could be prominent"
due to its high velocity. (4) They contain contamination
"from outflows, which presumably do not have a direc-"
tional correlation with the cluster. Projection effects
make it challenging to disentangle the infalling histories
of low-velocity cluster members as galaxies with differ-
ent dynamics and initial conditions mix together. But
"we note that for the first three cases, the galaxy never"
"enters, or spends very little time, in the high-velocity"
SITELLE Cluster ELGs 17
"region on the 2D phase space diagram, and therefore"
would not affect our conclusions in region II.
"Finally, it is noteworthy that although the result of"
"A2465 is consistent with A2390, the infalling history"
discussed in Section 5.2.1 may not fully apply to A2465.
This is because most interpretations on the phase space
"diagram here assume a single, undisturbed, cluster,"
which may not be fully applicable to merging clusters
due to the possibly more complicated ICM condition
"and galaxy dynamics. In addition, a selection effect ex-"
"ists due to the filter bandwidth, which disables the sam-"
pling of receding objects in A2465 with velocity higher
than 1σv. Both may contribute the scarcity of ELGs
with high velocity (>1.5 σv) in Figure 11. Our cur-
"rent data of A2465 are also restricted within ∼1 Mpc.
As pointed by Vulcani et al. (2017), detailed knowledge"
about the dynamics of cluster mergers is needed for in-
"depth analysis, which is beyond the range of this work."
"Nevertheless, it is promising to gain more insightful and"
definitive results with the aid of further data and com-
parisons with simulations.
5.3. Additional Support for Quenching by Ram
Pressure Stripping
To find additional evidence of ram pressure stripping
"affecting the star formation in cluster galaxies, we in-"
vestigate the line flux. Here we only look into A2390
for two reasons:(1) our current A2465 data do not have
"coverage in the outer region, and (2) A2390 is more of a"
typical rich cluster compared with the merging double
cluster A2465. The Hα emission-line flux FHα is ob-
tained from the residual spectra yielded in Section 3.4
"by a trapezoidal integral of ±5σline around the peak
of the Hα line, where σline is the best-matched tem-"
plate line width. To normalize the emission-line flux by
"galaxy mass, we divide it by the mean continuum times"
a fixed wavelength range of 250Å. The normalized line
"flux FHα,n can be used as a proxy for the specific star"
"formation rate (sSFR), defined as the SFR per stellar"
"mass, under the circumstance where the ionization is"
caused by star formation. For a composite ionization
"of star formation and AGN, FHα,n should be treated"
"as upper limits of star formation. FHα,n also has a de-"
pendency on the mass-to-light ratio (and thus the star
"formation history) of the galaxy, but the dependency is"
"minor, and we use it here as a first-order estimate."
The continuum-normalized line flux is plotted in Fig-
ure 13 versus the distance to the cluster center. ELGs
"with larger ∆ d are shown by solid colored symbols,"
whereas those with smaller or undetected ∆ d are repre-
"sented by gray-filled symbols. Blue, green, orange colors"

WHAN diagram (Cid Fernandes et al. 2011) using line
ratios obtained from cross-correlation. We label them
"in Figure 13 but do not exclude them from the sample,"
given that those with LINER features present simulta-
neous ionization from star formation in the disk and
18 Liu et al.
Seyferts are rare. AGNs in our fields will be investi-
gated in detail in future work.
Several interesting patterns are revealed in Figure 13.
"In the outer region (region I), ELGs with smaller ∆ d"
"have higher FHα,n on average (∼0.2 dex) than those
with larger ∆ d. The significance is above 3σ. This is"
also true for samples in region II - larger ∆ d objects
"have lower FHα,n, although the significance (at 1.9σ) is"
not high considering the uncertainties. Region III ap-
"pears to have statistically consistent average FHα,n for"
"large and small ∆ d objects. Furthermore, comparing"
"objects within R200 (region II & III, green & orange"
"symbols) with objects outside R200 (region I, blue sym-"
"bols), they have on average lower FHα,n (∼0.2/0.3 dex
for large/small ∆ d objects), although a small fraction"
of objects within R200 appear to show strong lines.
The lower average line flux for large ∆ d objects in
region I could be the result of them undergoing ram
"pressure stripping, with the star formation being sup-"
pressed due to gas removal. Some of these could have
already passed through the pericenter of their infall or-
"bit, moving out to the backsplash stage. Others may be"
"in their first infall, where ram pressure stripping has just"
"been turned on not long ago. On the other hand, ob-"
jects with smaller ∆ d are likely incoming galaxies that
"have not experienced significant, if any, ram pressure"
stripping. They might be farther away from the clus-
"ter but projected to be closer in 2D, or with smaller"
impact parameters and thus less affected by the ICM
"winds. Again, we note that galaxies with small ∆ d"
"could also have suffered from ram pressure stripping,"
but with their small ∆ d being the result of projection
"effect. However, the lower emission line flux observed in"
larger ∆ d ELGs clearly serves as additional evidence of
ram pressure stripping being responsible for quenching.
"As discussed, the large ∆ d objects in region II are"
likely experiencing strong ram pressure stripping. This
effect can consistently explain the difference in line flux
"compared with small ∆ d objects. However, the com-"
position of the small ∆ d objects is actually complex: it
may contain galaxies (1) in their first passages where gas
removal through ram pressure stripping is in progress;
"(2) in the backsplash stage, having survived from the"
dramatic gas removal; and (3) with prominent gas offset
"in 3D, but projected to be small. This may explain the"
"larger scatter in FHα,n for small ∆ d objects. In the first"
"case, the galaxies have higher line fluxes as they are in"
the beginning stage of having their star formation under-
"going suppression, while in the latter two cases, the level"
of star formation is expected to be comparable or lower.
"In the last case, some galaxies that appear within R200
might actually fall outside it in 3D due to projection"
and thus would have a smaller amount of star formation
suppression. It would be interesting to discriminate and
study them using other tracers such as gas fractions.
"In region III, large and small ∆ d objects have con-"
sistent line fluxes. This suggests that either the offset
is unassociated with ram pressure stripping (e.g. from
"outflows), or the offsets have different origins but the"
galaxies are projected to be there. Galaxies in region
III suffer from all kinds of projection effects discussed
"above, making them hard to interpret in the phase space"
alone.
The few objects inside R200 observed with exception-
"ally high FHα,n suggest that a small fraction of cluster"
galaxies suffered from ram pressure stripping could have
"enhanced star formation, or nuclei activities, due to gas"
compression by shocks. The enhancement is suggested
to have short timescales because the fraction of such ob-
jects is low. Such enhancement has been reported by
"many previous studies (e.g. Fujita & Nagashima 1999,"
"Kronberger et al. 2008, Bekki 2014). More recently,"
Vulcani et al. (2018) found enhanced SFR in a statisti-
cally significant sample of jellyfish galaxies from GASP.
"However, there is a difference in sample construction"
given the low occurrence of jellyfish galaxies per clus-
"ter, whereas our sample mostly consists of mild cases of"
galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping.
"Finally, the lower average line flux in regions inte-"
rior to R200 serves as an indication of environmental
"quenching, suggesting that the sSFR is dependent on"
the cluster-centric radius. One of the most competi-
"tive mechanisms is ram pressure stripping, as discussed"
"above, while other quenching mechanisms (starvation,"
"thermal evaporation, etc.) could take charge when ram"
pressure stripping is not efficient enough.
6. SUMMARY
An ongoing survey using the IFTS SITELLE at CFHT
"targeting the Hα-[N ii] lines in clusters at z∼0.25 is be-
ing carried out to study properties of ELGs (morphol-"
"ogy, kinematics, abundance, SFR, etc.) and quench-"
ing mechanisms in dense environments. We have devel-
oped a pipeline using the cross-correlation technique to
detect and identify ELGs from the datacube acquired
"by SITELLE. So far, we have obtained a list of ELG"
"samples in two galaxy clusters, Abell 2390 and Abell"
"2465, with 194 ELGs from three fields of A2390 and 110"
ELGs from the central field of A2465. The spatially-
resolved spectroscopy allows us to separate the emission-
line distribution from the ionized gas and the continuum
distribution from the stellar populations. We conduct
a centroid analysis by comparing the centroids of the
emission-line and continuum distributions for the ELGs.
SITELLE Cluster ELGs 19
We measure the centroid offset ∆ d and the difference
angle θd between the emission-to-continuum offset vec-
tor d and the cluster-centric vector to investigate the
correlation between spatial offsets of ionized gas in clus-
ter galaxies and their positions in the galaxy cluster.
"Based on the distributions of ∆ d and θd, we find (1)"
ELGs in A2390 and A2465 have ∆ d extending from 0
to around 4 kpc with the peak of the offset distribution
"deviating from zero, implying some systematic impact"
causing the spatial offset of ionized gas. (2) Looking into
ELGs with larger emission-line spatial offsets (∆ d > 1
"kpc), the distributions of θd in A2390 and A2465 clearly"
deviate from a uniform distribution. The peak of θd to-
ward 0◦ in our result is consistent with previous work
that ionized gas preferentially points away from the clus-
"ter center (e.g. Smith et al. 2010, Vulcani et al. 2017),"
although we also observe a hint of a minor peak in the
"180◦, possibly caused by backsplash or projection ef-"
fects. The p-values from KS tests reject the uniform
hypothesis at 95% confidence. This serves as an evi-
dence of ram pressure stripping playing an important
role in shaping and removing the gas reservoirs of clus-
"ter galaxies, because other mechanisms such as outflows"
and tidal stripping are expected to have no directional
relation to the cluster center while ram pressure strip-
ping impacts radially in the course of the infall of cluster
galaxies.
We further investigate their distributions on the
"position-velocity phase space diagram, using the offset"
vector d as a proxy for the 2D projected velocity vector.
We divide the phase space diagram into three regions
according to the infall history of a cluster galaxy: (I)
"the outskirts region outside the virial radius, (II) the"
"high-velocity region inside the virial radius, and (III)"
the low-velocity region inside the virial radius. We look
"into the ratio of ELGs with large ∆ d having θd < 90
◦"
"and θd > 90
◦ (i.e. with emission offset vectors point-"
"ing away and toward the cluster center, respectively)."
"Combining the statistics from both clusters, we find a"
"3σ excess of galaxies in region II with θd < 90
◦, i.e.,"
galaxies approaching or close to the orbit pericenters in
their first infalls. The preference suggests star formation
in these galaxies is mostly suppressed before they turn
around and start their second infalls. This is consis-
tent with conclusions from some numerical studies and
observations of individual gas-stripped cluster galaxies
that galaxies are quenched at first infall under ram pres-
sure stripping after they penetrate into the ICM halo.
"In addition, we find that the continuum-normalized line"
"flux of ELGs with large ∆ d in region I (and region II,"
"but with a lower significance), where galaxies are at the"
"beginning of their first infalls or undergoing backsplash,"
is lower on average than those with small ∆ d. This sup-
ports the scenario that ram pressure stripping is a dom-
inant mechanism in the suppression of star formation.
"No significant difference, however, is found in region III,"
where projection effects may mix galaxies with different
dynamic states together.
Our study is the first analysis of such types of observa-
tions and demonstrates the uniqueness and promise of
"panoramic, wide-field 2D spectroscopy on galaxy clus-"
ters using SITELLE. Data from a larger sample of clus-
ters and further detailed analysis will shed more light on
the environmental effects and star formation quenching
mechanisms operating on cluster galaxies.

APPENDIX
A. REDUCTION OF INTERFEROMETRIC
FRINGES
Below we describe the low-pass filtering (LPF) tech-
nique used to remove fringes on the SITELLE datacube.
A source detection with an S/N threshold of 3 is first
run on the stack image using the python photometric
package photutils to pick out possible sources. These
sources are masked before the LPF procedure to avoid
"them being over-subtracted. Next, LPF is performed on"
each channel by convolving the image with an elliptical
gaussian kernel elongated in the x-axis to construct a
low-frequency components image and then subtracting
it from the original image. The method is based on the
fact that the fringes are high-frequency components that
are relatively continuous along the x-axis but may radi-
"cally change its brightness in the y-axis. In practice, we"
adopt a kernel size with FWHM of 28 pix in the x-axis
and 7 pix in the y-axis. The kernel size is determined
by experimenting with different sizes to reach a trade-off
between reducing the high-frequency fringes and avoid-
ing over-subtraction of faint candidates that are possibly
missed in the initial detection.
"After iterating through all the channels, a source de-"
"tection is run again on the low-pass-filtered datacube,"
again with all of the detected sources masked. The
convolve-subtract-detect-mask process is repeated until
the change in the number of detected sources is smaller
than 5% in order to capture as many faint sources as pos-
sible. The efficacy of the LPF is clear by comparing the
upper two panels of Figure 14 showing the same cutout
of a channel that suffered from fringes before and af-
"ter LPF, where contamination from fringes occurring in"
the left panel has been mitigated as shown in the right
panel. Two sample spectra extracted in the A2390E
"field, which are ELGs identified using procedures in Sec-"
"tion 3.6, are shown in Figure 15 to demonstrate the effect"
of the LPF on the extracted spectra. The LPF process-
ing can greatly reduce additional noise caused by fringes
in channels between 7980 Å and 8030 Å where strong
"sky-lines are located, thus facilitating the detection and"
identification of faint emission-line candidates.
"Because of the finite kernel size used, in some chan-"
nels there exist fringe residuals whose spatial variation
is smaller than the kernel. This can be observed in
the upper-right panel of Figure 14. To further clean
"the residuals and facilitate candidate detection, we ap-"
ply a moving average processing to construct a new de-
tection datacube: the low-pass-filtered datacube is con-

datacube in the presence of interferometric fringes. Upper
left: image of a single channel showing fringes after subtract-
ing the large-scale background. The brightness of the fringes
does not follow a regular pattern. Upper right: image of the
same channel processed with the LPF process. Fringes have
been mitigated, although some residuals remain in the im-
age. Lower left: image of the same channel but each pixel is
manipulated by a moving average using a 3x3x5 box. Lower
right: image of the same channel applying both LPF and
moving average processing. The background residuals are
largely suppressed. For direct visual comparison, the four
panels share the same contrast. The image contrast is in
arcsinh stretch to visually augment the small difference in
the background."
volved with a 3x3x5 averaging kernel (2D spatial + 1D
"spectral), i.e., for a single spaxel its value is taking the"
mean of contiguous pixels in 2D and in the adjacent
four channels. This takes advantage of the feature of
the fringe pattern that it moves across the field as the
"scanning/wavelength proceeds/increases. As a result,"
residuals in nearby channels are expected to be more
or less cancel out. The moving average processing also
reduces the sky noise. Note this new datacube is only
"used for source detection, not for centroid measurement"
in Section 4.1.

B.2. An Empirical Assessment for Seeing-limited
Centroid Measurements
The measured centroid offsets in emission and contin-
uum are in general small relative to the seeing and there-
"fore suffer from smearing effects. However, it should be"
noted that the centroid of an object can be measured to
"a considerably higher precision than the seeing, depend-"
ing on the S/N of the object. We perform several exper-
iments with a control sample to demonstrate the robust-
ness and effectiveness of the centroid measurements.
The control sample is constructed using unsatu-
rated stars cross-matched with PAN-STARRS (Cham-
bers et al. 2016) and is matched with the ELG sample
in terms of S/N as follows: we randomly draw a star
from the crossmatch and choose a medium wide win-
dow in its spectrum with channels in it to represent the
pseudo-emission. The rest of the channels are used as
the continuum. Edges and channels in the presence of
strong sky-lines are excluded. The pseudo-emission and
continuum images are constructed from these channels
with which centroids are measured in the same approach
as Section 4.1 except that the continuum is not sub-
tracted from the emission. This process is repeated for
500 times field by field to build a parent sample for each
field. We then resample the measurements by their pho-
tometric S/N for N = 100 times according to the dis-
tribution of S/N of the ELGs on the emission image.
The sample size N is chosen to match the average sam-
ple size of ELGs detected in each field for the statistical
tests below. We construct 10 different control samples
to account for sample variation.
"With the control samples, we test whether there is sys-"
tematic bias in the centroid measurement and quantify
the uncertainties from random noise. Because the mea-
"surements are based on stars, the centroids should have"
no intrinsic offset unless there is any systematic bias.
We first perform a Hotelling’s T 2 test on the location
"of the distribution of centroid difference x = (∆x, ∆y)"
"with the null hypothesis H0: x = x0 = (0, 0). The t

"small systematic bias, and σ0 are at least two times"
smaller than the adopted threshold. The contamina-
tion level can also be revealed by the fraction of mea-
surements of offset below the threshold (black dashed

within the threshold. The average f0 is 93%/90%/93%"

and random uncertainties in the process of measurement
are small and do not impact our conclusions.
C. RESULTS USING MORPHOLOGICAL
CENTROIDS
"In the main text, the emission and continuum cen-"
troids are measured in a light-weighted procedure. Al-
"ternatively, we can measure the morphological centroids"
of the output segmentation of emission and continuum
by simply giving equal weights to all the pixels within
the border:
"(x̄m, ȳm) ="
")
, (C6)"
where N is the number of summed pixels. This is moti-
vated by attempting to give higher weights to the weaker
"but more spatially distorted ionized gas, e.g. gas tails"
SITELLE Cluster ELGs 25
"at the outskirts of the ELG. We use σ2x̄m = σ
2
ȳm"
"an empirical error. The propagation to ∆dm and θd,m is"
the same as in Appendix B.1. Because the morphologi-
cal centroids are sensitive to the way how segmentation
"is performed and they do not have well-defined errors,"
our preference is to use the light-weighted centroids for
"our analysis; however, the morphological centroids pro-"
duce essentially the same conclusions.
We can measure the difference vector d using the mor-
"phological centroids, and accordingly measure the cen-"
"troid offset ∆dm and difference angle θd,m in the same"
manner as in Section 4.1. We show the distributions
of ∆dm in Figure 17. The distributions of centroid off-
sets are similar but slightly more skewed to larger values
in both clusters. This is as expected as morphological
centroids put more stress on the faint outskirts.
Another selected sample is generated following the
same criteria in Section 4.1 except for requiring ∆ dm >
"3σ∆dm , with 49 ELGs obtained for A2390 and 28 ELGs"
"obtained for A2465. The distributions of θd,m are shown"
"in Figure 18. Similar to the ones in Figure 9, they also"
visually deviated strongly from a uniform distribution.
The difference lies in that the major peak being shifted
"to a higher value (30◦− 60◦) in A2390, which can be in-
ferred as a result of more influence from the tangential"
"component of the ram pressure. Furthermore, the minor"
peak toward 180◦ in A2465 is no longer significant. The
K-S test on A2465 rejects the uniformity at 1% confi-
"dence level (p = 0.009), although it cannot reject the"
"uniformity of θd,m in A2390 (p = 0.15). Finally we in-"
spect their distribution in phase space diagram and their
"continuum normalized emission-line flux, which are con-"
sistent with the results using light-weighted centroids.
"Overall, the results of morphological centroids also"
support the scenario where ram pressure stripping takes
effect during the infall of gas-rich cluster galaxies and
shuts down their star formation through removal of gas.
