"ABSTRACT
Investigating how the cutoff energy 𝐸cut varies with X-ray flux and photon index Γ in individual AGNs opens a new window
to probe the yet unclear coronal physics. So far 𝐸cut variations have only been detected in several AGNs but different patterns
have been reported. Here we report new detections of 𝐸cut variations in two Seyfert galaxies with multiple NuSTAR exposures.
While in NGC 3227 𝐸cut monotonically increases with Γ, the 𝐸cut–Γ relation exhibits a Λ shape in SWIFT J2127.4+5654 (𝐸cut
increasing with Γ at Γ . 2.05, but reversely decreasing at Γ & 2.05), indicating more than a single underlying mechanism is
involved. Meanwhile both galaxies show softer spectra while they brighten in X-ray, a common phenomenon in Seyfert galaxies.
Plotting all 7 AGNs with 𝐸cut variations ever reported with NuSTAR observations in the 𝐸cut–Γ diagram, we find they could be
unified with the Λ pattern. Although the sample is small and SWIFT J2127.4+5654 is the only source with Γ varying across the
break point thus the only one exhibiting the complete Λ pattern in a single source, the discoveries shed new light on the coronal
physics in AGNs. Possible underlying physical mechanisms are discussed."

1 INTRODUCTION
"In the standard disc-corona paradigm the hard X-ray emission of
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is produced in a hot and compact
region, the so called corona (e.g. Haardt & Maraschi 1991; Haardt
et al. 1994), through the inverse Compton scattering of the seed
photons from the accretion disk. This process could produce the
observed power law continuum with a high-energy cutoff. Such a
cutoff has been detected in a number of AGNs (Zdziarski et al.
2000; Molina et al. 2013), particularly with the high-quality hard
X-ray spectra of NuSTAR (e.g., Matt et al. 2015; Tortosa et al. 2018;
Molina et al. 2019; Kang et al. 2020), providing key constraints on
the yet unclear coronal physics (e.g. Fabian et al. 2015).
The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR Harrison"
"et al. 2013) also enables the detection of 𝐸cut (or coronal temperature
𝑇𝑒) variations in individual AGNs with multiple exposures, includ-
ing 3C 382 (Ballantyne et al. 2014), NGC 5548 (Ursini et al. 2015),
Mrk 335 (Keek & Ballantyne 2016), NGC 4593 (Ursini et al. 2016;
Middei et al. 2019a), MCG–5–23–16 (Zoghbi et al. 2017), and 4C
74.26 (Zhang et al. 2018). Zhang et al. (2018) also revisited the first
five sources mentioned above using the spectra ratio technique they
developed. They confirmed the claimed 𝐸cut variations in 3 of them,
but disproved those in NGC 4593 and MCG–5–23–16. Despite the
limited number of sources, these studies have opened a new win-
dow to probe the coronal physics. Remarkably, Zhang et al. (2018)
found that all the 4 AGNs with 𝐸cut variations confirmed tend to
have larger 𝐸cut (thus hotter corona) when they brighten and soften
in X-ray. In other words, they show a “hotter-when-brighter” behav-"
"★ ericofk@mail.ustc.edu.cn
† jxw@ustc.edu.cn"
"ior along with the conventional “softer-when-brighter” pattern (e.g.,
Markowitz et al. 2003; Sobolewska & Papadakis 2009). Possible un-
derlying mechanisms have been discussed in Zhang et al. (2018) and
Wu et al. (2020), including geometrical changes of the corona and
pair production. Do Seyfert galaxies universally follow this “hotter-
when-softer/brighter” pattern? A possible counter-example is the
narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy (NLS1) Ark 564, for which Barua et al.
(2020) found cooler corona (though statistically marginal) during the
softer and brighter phases within a 200 ks NuSTAR observation.
In this letter we report new detections of 𝐸cut variations in two"
"Seyfert galaxies, NGC 3227 and SWIFT J2127.4+5654, and a Λ
shaped 𝐸cut–Γ relation for the first time. §2 presents the NuSTAR ob-
servations and data reduction. In §3 we describe the spectral models
and deliver the fitting results. In §4 we discuss the spectral variabil-
ities and the underlying mechanisms for AGNs with reported 𝐸cut
variations."
2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION
"NGC 3227 is a radio-quiet Seyfert 1.5 galaxy (Véron-Cetty & Véron
2006) at z = 0.00391. In Tab. 1 we list the seven archival NuS-
TAR observations of NGC 3227. NGC 3227 shows highly variable
X-ray emission and its absorption feature have been extensively in-
vestigated in literature. As an example, based on the NuSTAR and
XMM-Newton observations, Turner et al. (2018) found a rapid oc-
cultation event in NGC 3227 between two exposures of NuSTAR
(60202002010 and 60202002012), with several absorber zones in-"

"volved.However, as further shown in §3, our study on the high-energy
cutoff in this work is barely influenced by these complex absorbers.
Meanwhile, SWIFT J2127.4+5654, a radio-quiet NLS1 (Mal-"
"izia et al. 2008) at z = 0.0144, has been observed by NuSTAR in
two campaigns, with four exposures in 2012 and five in 2018. We
dropped the observation 60402008002 (not listed inTab. 1) of SWIFT
J2127.4+5654, which has an issue flag = 1, indicating possible con-
tamination from solar activity or other unexpected issues. Marinucci
et al. (2014) performed a joint spectral fitting of the four 2012 obser-
vations with (quasi-)simultaneous XMM-Newton data and an aver-
age 𝐸cut = 108+11−10 keV was reported. Besides, using XMM-Newton
data only, Sanfrutos et al. (2013) reported a partial covering absorber
in SWIFT J2127.4+5654 with 𝑁H = 2 × 1022𝑐𝑚−2 and a covering
fraction ∼ 0.43, whereas we find it has negligible effect in NuSTAR
spectra.
NuSTAR data reduction is performed using the NuSTAR Data"
"Analysis Software (NuSTARDAS) within the HEAsoft package (ver-
sion 6.26). With CALDB version 20190513, the calibrated and
cleaned event files are produced with nupipeline. We first extract the
light curves using nuproducts, adopting a circular source region with
a radius of 60′′ centered on each source, and an annulus from 120′′
to 200′′ for background extraction. The light curves from FPMA and
FPMB, with the livetime, PSF/EXPOSURE and vignetting correc-
tions applied, are then combined using lcmath. The 3 – 10 keV and
10 – 78 keV light curves, along with the 10 – 78 keV/ 3 – 10 keV
hardness ratios, are plotted in Fig. 1. Both sources show clear varia-
tions in flux (count rate) and spectra shape (hardness ratio), not only
between but also within the individual exposures. In the plot of hard-
ness ratio (HR) versus count rate (Fig. 2) both sources clearly exhibit
the “softer-when-brighter” pattern. However different individual ex-
posures appear to follow different “softer-when-brighter” tracks. For
instance, Obs. ID 60202002014 (No. 7) of NGC 3227 clearly deviate
from other exposures in Fig. 2. See also exposures No. 1 and No. 2,
No. 5 and No. 6 of SWIFT J2127.4+5654. Such variations could be
due to the physical or structural changes in the coronawhichmay lead
to different “softer-when-brighter"" tracks (e.g., Sarma et al. 2015),
stopping us from merging data from different exposures according
to the count rate or hardness ratio. In this work we focus on the anal-
yses of spectra integrated over individual exposures and investigate
the 𝐸cut variations between these exposures. Though rapid hardness
ratio variations within individual exposures are seen, due to limited
photon counts we are yet unable to explore more rapid 𝐸cut variations
in two sources."
"Source spectra are extracted from the same circular regions as the
light curves, using the nuproducts. As for background extraction,
we use NUSKYBGD developed by Wik et al. (2014) to handle the
spatially variable background of NuSTAR observations (see also
Kang et al. 2020, for an example). NuSTAR observations generally
do not suffer from pile-up2. Meanwhile, we find the low-energy
effective area issue for FPMA (Madsen et al. 2020) to be insignificant
in all the observations and no low energy excess in FPMA spectra is
found (see Fig. A1). As a final step, the source spectra are rebinned
to achieve a minimum of 50 counts bin−1 using grppha.
We notice there are (quasi-)simultaneous XMM-Newton obser-"
"vations for both sources (six of NGC 3227 and three of SWIFT
J2127.4+5654). However, we find slightly different photon indices
between most XMM-Newton and NuSTAR exposures for both
sources. Such discrepancy, likely due to the inter-instrument cali-
bration, is widely found in literature (e.g. Cappi et al. 2016; Ponti
et al. 2018; Middei et al. 2019b). Additionally, the fact that XMM-
Newton and NuSTAR exposures are not perfectly simultaneous may
also have played a role due to the intrinsic spectral variation. How-
ever requiring perfect simultaneity would yield significant loss of the
valuable NuSTAR exposure time. Since 𝐸cut measurement is sensi-
tive to the photon index (e.g., Molina et al. 2019; Kang et al. 2020)
and not all NuSTAR exposures have corresponding XMM-Newton
observations, in this work we do not include those XMM-Newton
exposures but provide uniform spectral fitting to NuSTAR spectra
alone."
3 SPECTRAL FITTING
"Zhang et al. (2018) developed the spectral ratio technique, analo-
gous to the difference-imaging technique in astronomy, to assist the
study of 𝐸cut variations. Briefly, if the 𝐸cut is invariable within two
observations, the ratio of two spectra (primarily exponentially cutoff
power law) is supposed to be a straight line in log-log space in the
spectra ratio plot. So we can notice potential 𝐸cut variations directly
by looking for deviations from the straight line at the high energy
end (see Zhang et al. 2018, for details). We applied this technique to
AGNs with multiple archival NuSTAR exposures and took notice of
NGC 3227 and SWIFT J2127.4+5654, of which the spectral ratios
indicate clear and prominent 𝐸cut variations as shown in Fig. 3. In
this section, we perform spectral fitting to quantify the 𝐸cut variations
in both sources.
Spectral fitting is performed in the 3–78 keV band within XSPEC"
"(Arnaud 1996), using 𝜒2 statistics and the relative element abun-
dances given by Anders & Grevesse (1989). All errors along with
the upper/lower limits reported throughout the letter are calculated
using Δ𝜒2 = 2.71 criterion (90% confidence range). For each obser-
vation, the spectra obtained by the two NuSTAR modules (FPMA
and FPMB) are fitted simultaneously, with a cross-normalization
difference typically less than 5% (Madsen et al. 2015).
We employ pexrav (Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995) to describe"
"the exponentially cutoff power law plus the reflection component.
For simplicity, the solar element abundance for the reflector and an
inclination of 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖 = 0.45 are adopted (as default of this model)3."

3 These two parameters are poorly constrained with NuSTAR spectra if
allowed free to vary, thus are commonly fixed at the default values in many
studies on NuSTAR spectra (e.g. Zhang et al. 2018; Molina et al. 2019;
Panagiotou&Walter 2020).Through joint fittingXMM-Newton andNuSTAR
spectra of SWIFT J2127.4+5654, Marinucci et al. (2014) reported an iron"

are over-plotted, illustrating the 𝐸cut variations have been properly accounted in the spectral models."

photon index Γ and lower (higher) cutoff energy 𝐸cut. However adopting
different values of AFe or inclination angle would not alter the main results
of this work."
"with the Galactic absorption ignored due to its negligible impact on
NuSTAR spectra. Replacing the 𝑧𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑏𝑠 component with 𝑧𝑥𝑖𝑝𝑐 𝑓 to
account for the partial covering reported in both sources (Turner et al.
2018; Sanfrutos et al. 2013) does not affect our 𝐸cut measurements,
as such absorbers have negligible influence on NuSTAR spectra."
"As for the Fe K emission lines, several lines have been previously
found in both sources with XMM-Newton spectra (e.g. Markowitz
et al. 2009;Marinucci et al. 2014), whereas some of them are insignif-
icant in NuSTAR spectra, likely due to the limited spectral resolution"
"MNRAS 000, 1–8 (2020)"
The High Energy Cutoff Variations L5
"(∼ 0.4 keV at 6 keV). We use a statistical standard to model possible
lines as follows. We add a zgauss component at 6.4 keV (rest frame)
with its width fixed at 19 eV (the mean Fe K𝛼 line width in AGNs
measured with Chandra HETG, Shu et al. 2010) to describe a neutral
and narrow Fe K𝛼 line. Since the Fe K𝛼 line could be relativistically
broadened, we allow the width to vary freely. If a free width can sig-
nificantly improve the fit (Δ𝜒2 > 5), the corresponding fitting results
are adopted (see Tab. 2). Furthermore, we find no other potential
lines in all the observations with this criterion. To sum up, our final
model in XSPEC form is 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡 × 𝑧𝑝ℎ𝑎𝑏𝑠 × (𝑝𝑒𝑥𝑟𝑎𝑣 + 𝑧𝑔𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑠).
The spectra and the best-fit models are shown in Fig. A1.
Besides, we adopt different models to check the results. Firstly we"
"replace the 𝑝𝑒𝑥𝑟𝑎𝑣 component with 𝑝𝑒𝑥𝑟𝑖𝑣 (Magdziarz & Zdziarski
1995) to take account of potential ionized reflection. As shown in
Tab. 2, the results of the two models (𝑝𝑒𝑥𝑟𝑎𝑣 and 𝑝𝑒𝑥𝑟𝑖𝑣) are very
close. Furthermore, we employ relxill (Dauser et al. 2010; García
et al. 2014) which models the spectra with a cutoff power law and
relativistic ionized reflection from the accretion disc. For SWIFT
J2127.4+5654 we fix its spin 𝑎 = 0.58 referring to Marinucci et al.
(2014), while for NGC 3227 𝑎 is tied among the observations dur-
ing fitting, with 𝑙𝑜𝑔b and 𝐴Fe tied among observations for both
sources. In this way, we derive 𝑎 = −0.36+0.31−0.22, 𝑙𝑜𝑔b = 2.65"
"+0.07
−0.16"
"and 𝐴Fe = 2.78+0.61−0.58 for NGC 3227, and 𝑙𝑜𝑔b = 2.80
+0.05
−0.04,"
"𝐴Fe = 1.20+0.42−0.25 for SWIFT J2127.4+5654. We let photon index
Γ, reflection fraction and 𝐸cut vary freely, and set other parameters
including inclination and disk radii as default. As shown in Tab.
2, while the 𝐸cut results from two models are generally consistent
within statistical uncertainties, the relxillmodel yields systematically
smaller 𝐸cut for NGC 3227 and larger 𝐸cut for SWIFT J2127.4+5654
compared with the 𝑝𝑒𝑥𝑟𝑎𝑣 model. Nevertheless, the yielded 𝐸cut
variation trends from two models, as the focus of this work, are
similar. Moreover, we adopt comptonized models 𝑥𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑣𝑒𝑟𝐶𝑝 and
𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑥𝑖𝑙𝑙𝐶𝑝 (Dauser et al. 2010; García et al. 2014, for the normal
and relativistic reflection components respectively) to directly mea-
sure the coronal temperature 𝑇e. The derived coronal temperatures
𝑘𝑇relxillCp and 𝑘𝑇xillverCp (see Tab. 2) for SWIFT J2127.4+5654 are
generally consistent with 1/3 of the measured 𝐸pexrav (e.g. Petrucci
et al. 2001), but systematically smaller than 1/3 of the best-fit 𝐸pexrav
for NGC 3227.
From Tab. 2 we can see that 𝑝𝑒𝑥𝑟𝑎𝑣 and 𝑝𝑒𝑥𝑟𝑖𝑣 yield similarly"
"smaller reduced 𝜒2 compared with other models, while 𝑝𝑒𝑥𝑟𝑖𝑣 has
one more free parameter than 𝑝𝑒𝑥𝑟𝑎𝑣. As 𝑝𝑒𝑥𝑟𝑎𝑣 is widely adopted
in literature to measure 𝐸cut in literature (e.g. Zhang et al. 2018;
Molina et al. 2019; Panagiotou & Walter 2020), to directly compare
with those studies, hereafter we simply adopt the best-fit results
from 𝑝𝑒𝑥𝑟𝑎𝑣. Utilizing results from the other models however would
not alter the conclusions of this work. Further note that in 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑥𝑖𝑙𝑙,
𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑥𝑖𝑙𝑙𝐶𝑝 and 𝑥𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑣𝑒𝑟𝐶𝑝, the reflection component and the Fe lines
are coupled under certain assumptions, which may bias the 𝐸cut (or
𝑇e) measurements in some sources (e.g., Zhang et al. 2018; Kang
et al. 2020).
We plot the 𝐸cut vs. Γ contours in Fig. 4 to illustrate the 𝐸cut"
"variation patterns in two sources. A clear positive correlation between
𝐸cut and Γ is seen in NGC 3227. However the 𝐸cut–Γ plot of SWIFT
J2127.4+5654 exhibits a distinct Λ shape: 𝐸cut increases with Γ at Γ
. 2.05, but reversely decreases at Γ & 2.05. Though considering the
degeneracy between 𝐸cut and Γ, the rising part of the Λ shape is less
significant comparing with the declining part, the overall variation
trend in SWIFT J2127.4+5654 clearly deviates from a monotonous
function. Meanwhile, the common “softer-when-brighter” trend in
Seyfert galaxies is clear in both sources (Fig. 4)."
"To quantifying the significance of the Λ shape, we perform Spear-
man rank-order correlation analyses on the rising (obs. No. 1, 2, 3,
4, 7) and descending (obs. No. 2, 3, 5, 6, 8) branches of the Λ shape.
We find a positive correlation between 𝐸cut and Γ (𝜌 = 0.87 with
a p-value = 0.054) for the rising branch, and a negative correlation
for the descending branch (a 𝜌 = −0.90 with a p-value = 0.037).
We also perform linear regression to measure the slopes of the two
branches of the Λ shape (𝛽 = 220 for the left and 𝛽 = −240 for the
right). However, the Spearman’s correlation could be unreliablewhen
the sample size is small (e.g., n < 10), and random fluctuation can
produce strong correlation/anti-correlation in small samples. Mean-
while, the measurement errors and the degeneracy of the parameters
should also be taken into account.We perform simulations to address
these issues. Assuming there is no intrinsic 𝐸cut variation in SWIFT
J2127.4+5654, we jointly fit all eight observations and derive a 𝐸cut
of 80 keV. Starting from 𝐸cut = 80 keV and other best-fit spectral pa-
rameters (derived with 𝐸cut tied) for each observation, we create one
artificial spectrum for each exposure using 𝑓 𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑖𝑡. We then perform
spectral fitting to those faked spectra to measure the simulated 𝐸cut
and Γ and perform Spearman rank and linear regression analyses.
We repeat the process 1000 times, and find only 26 runs out of them
show stronger Spearman’s correlation and steeper linear regression
slope (compared with the observed values) for the left side of the Λ
shape, while only 2 runs out of 1000 for the right one. This indicate
the rising and descending of the Λ pattern have statistical confidence
level of 97.4% and 99.8% respectively, showing statistical fluctua-
tions of the parameters and the degeneracy between Γ and 𝐸cut are
unlikely able to reproduce the observed Λ pattern."
4 DISCUSSION
"In Fig. 5 we plot 𝐸cut – Γ for both our sources together with those
introduced in §1. For Ark 564 we convert the corona temperature
𝑘𝑇e given by Barua et al. (2020) into 𝐸cut, assuming an optically
thick corona and 𝑘𝑇𝑒 ∼ 𝐸cut/3 (Petrucci et al. 2001). For the other
four sources we simply take measurements from Zhang et al. (2018).
Though all of them follow the common “softer-when-brighter” trend
(see Fig. 4 and Zhang et al. 2018; Barua et al. 2020), they show
different 𝐸cut–Γ variation patterns. Interestingly, it appears that all
seven sources could be unified with the Λ shaped pattern seen in
SWIFT J2127.4+5654, e.g., “hotter-when-softer/brighter” at Γ .
2.05, but “cooler-when-softer/brighter” at Γ & 2.05, though SWIFT
J2127.4+5654 is the only source with Γ varying across the break
point, thus the only one showing the complete Λ pattern in a single
source.
The common “softer-when-brighter” trend in Seyfert galaxies"
"was generally attributed to presumbly cooler corona during brighter
phases due to more effective cooling by more seed photons. How-
ever, such scenario clearly contradicts the discovery of “hotter-when-
brighter” pattern detected in AGNs (e.g. Keek & Ballantyne 2016;
Zhang et al. 2018). Geometry changes of the corona are required to
reproduce the “softer-when-brighter” trend (e.g. Keek & Ballantyne
2016; Zhang et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2020). Specifically, the corona
could be heated to a higher temperature and simultaneously driven
to inflate during X-ray brighter phases (Wu et al. 2020), leading to
a smaller opacity and thus softer spectra, and reproducing the ob-
served “hotter-when-softer/brighter” pattern (the rising part of the
Λ pattern). The inflation could be primarily vertical, as there are
evidences that suggest the corona is vertically outflowing (e.g. Liu
et al. 2014) and the corona could reach higher heights during brighter
phases (Wilkins & Gallo 2015; Alston et al. 2020). Note in case of"

"outflowing corona, if the outflowing velocity is higher during X-ray
brighter phases, higher 𝐸cut is also expected due to stronger Doppler
shift.
As theX-ray flux brightening, spectrum softening and corona infla-"
"tion continue, more seed photons from the disk could be intercepted,
leading to higher cooling efficiency. Moreover, the cooling efficiency
could be further boosted if the steeperX-ray spectrum is accompanied
by a stronger soft X-ray excess component from the presumed warm
corona (e.g. Petrucci et al. 2013) which could also contribute as seed
photons. The latter mechanism may be essential, that the Compton
cooling effect begins to dominate beyond a certain Γ, yielding the
declining part of theΛ pattern (“cooler-when-brighter”). However, as
SWIFT J2127.4+5654 is yet the only individual source showing a Λ
pattern, it is unclear whether the break point of Γ ∼ 2.05 is universal,
and if yes, why so.
Meanwhile, pair production may also play a key role. As shown"
"in Fabian et al. (2015), the coronae in many AGNs lie close to the
electron–positron pair runaway line in the compactness–temperature
diagram, suggesting the corona temperature is controlled by pair
production. An inflated corona with a smaller compactness means a
higher temperature limit by the run away pair-production. Moreover,
Ghisellini & Haardt (1994) showed that, in a pair-dominated corona
with a certain compactness, the temperature positively correlates
with Γ for electron temperature 𝑘𝑇𝑒 < 𝑚𝑒𝑐2. Therefore positive
correlations between X-ray flux and 𝐸cut and between Γ and 𝐸cut are
expected in pair-dominated corona.
It is known that the NLS1Ark 564 lies well below the thermal pair-"
"production limit (Kara et al. 2017), meanwhile 3C 382, 4C 74.26,
NGC 5548 and Mrk 335 lie close to the limit (e.g. Zhang et al.
2018). Following Fabian et al. (2015) we calculate the compactness,
𝑙 = 4𝜋(𝑚𝑝/𝑚𝑒) (𝑟𝑔/𝑟) (𝐿/𝐿edd), and dimensionless temperature,
Θ = 𝑘𝑇𝑒/𝑚𝑒𝑐2, for the two sources reported in this work, where
𝑘𝑇𝑒 ≈ 𝐸cut/2 4. We adopt 𝑟 = 10 𝑟𝑔 and the 0.1–200 keV luminosity,
𝑀 = 1.4 × 107𝑀� for NGC 3227 (Graham 2008), and 𝑀 = 1.5 ×
107𝑀� for SWIFT J2127.4+5654 (Malizia et al. 2008). Comparing
the results with the runaway pair production boundary in Stern et al.
(1995), we find while NGC 3227 lies close to or on the boundary,"
"4 We adopt 𝑘𝑇𝑒 ≈ 𝐸cut/2 to stay consistent with Fabian et al. (2015) and
Zhang et al. (2018). Directly adopting the 𝑘𝑇relxillCp or 𝑘𝑇xillverCp we derived,
or assuming 𝑘𝑇𝑒 ≈ 𝐸cut/3 will not alter the main results presented here."

discrepancy issue, caused by XMM-Newton data as discussed in §2. A single
best-fit direct line is over-plotted to demonstrate the overall variation trend
of each source, except that for SWIFT J2127.4+5654 we plot two lines to

(right) of which 𝐸cut positively (negatively) correlates with Γ."
"the NLS1 SWIFT J2127.4+5654 also lie clearly below the boundary
(though closer to the boundary compared with Ark 564, Fig. 6).
It is remarkable to note that there also likely exists a link be-"
"tween 𝐸cut variation patterns and pair-dominance: pair-dominated
coronae (those lying close to or on the pair limit in the 𝑙–Θ di-
agram) only exhibit “hotter-when-softer/brighter” trend, while a
“cooler-when-softer/brighter” or Λ shape is only possible in coro-
nae which are not pair-dominated. In this case the pair production
could counter against the higher cooling efficiency of an expanded
and less compact corona in many AGNs. Consequently the “cooler-
when-softer/brighter” trend or the Λ pattern only exists in sources"

coronae lying well below the pair limit (such as in Ark 564) could
also be pair dominated if containing both thermal and non-thermal
particles. However, if the possible link aforementioned does exist,
it suggests the pair production in the cool coronae of Ark 564 and
SWIFT J2127.4+5654 is indeed weak.
Though the sample discussed above is small, the discoveries pre-"

Future observations of 𝐸cut variations in a larger sample of AGNs

potential link between 𝐸cut variation pattern and pair production, and
independently probe the coronal physics."
