Abstract
"Theoretical models and experimental observations sug-
gest that gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and high-energy neu-
trino bursts travelling through the interstellar space may
reach the Earth at different speeds. We propose and
study in details the mechanism i), which always exists,
where GRB are slowed down due to the dispersion of light
in the interstellar medium. In addition to the standard
media such as electrons and photons as CMB, we consider
the medium with invisible axions. The amount of GRB
delays in different media are calculated in details utilizing
a novel technique in QFT by using the hitherto known or
estimated densities of particles in the space without intro-
ducing any arbitrary parameter. Previously, the GRB de-
lays have been interpreted as a sign of Lorentz invariance
violation by modifying the dispersion relation of Special
Relativity, which relates the energy, the momentum and
the mass of a particle, based on different mechanisms ii),
such as a stringy spacetime foam, coming from a quan-
tum gravity effect and using an adjustable parameter.
Obviously, all the above-mentioned mechanisms i) and ii)
are induced Lorentz invariance violations but not an in-
trinsic one. The amount of GRB delay due to the two
aforementioned interpretations can be distinguished by
observing the time of arrival of light with different fre-
quencies. Namely, dispersion of light i) predicts that the
higher energy GRB arrive the Earth earlier, while in the
other interpretations ii), they arrive later. We notice that
the needed amount for delay due to the dispersion of light
shall have the potential power to shed additional light
on the microstructure of interstellar media with respect
to the densities of constituent particles and the origins
of their sources. Finally, we indicate the ways to detect
the intrinsic Lorentz invariance violation and to interpret
them theoretically."

1 Introduction
"The propagation of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) in the in-
terstellar medium is a topic that has attracted consid-
erable interest. GRB are highly energetic and diverse
events, which are thought to be produced by violent stel-
lar processes, in particular the supernovas and mergers
of binary neutron stars. Those events may also produce
high-energy cosmic rays and consequently bursts of high-
energy neutrinos [1, 2]. However, coincident GRB and
neutrino bursts have not been observed. The possibility
that the neutrino burst could be shifted in time with re-
spect to the GRB is under active study. The time window
τ = tGRB− tν between the arrival times of a GRB, tGRB,
and a neutrino burst, tν , could vary between seconds or
several days. References about this can be found in the re-
port [3] in connection with the ANTARES neutrino tele-
scope. Experimental data taken between 2007 and 2012
were analyzed; gamma-ray energies analyzed were up to
100 TeV. Assuming that a GRB and the corresponding
neutrino burst are produced at the same time, a signifi-
cant delay τ would indicate that the electromagnetic and
neutrino signals have travelled at different speeds. Note,
however, that the recent experimental studies show only
faint neutrino signals associated with GRB [3, 4], and
hence the observed delays may be inaccurate."
"Theoretical interpretations of the GRB delay phenom-
ena have proved to be challenging. Violation of Lorentz
invariance at very high energies in the form of modifying
the dispersion relation has been considered as a poten-
tial interpretation of the delay of high-energy GRB [5–
8]. This approach is motivated by various approaches to
quantum gravity, as quantum-gravitational fluctuations
may lead to a nontrivial refractive index [9]. The stringy
spacetime foam is a realization of such an effect [10].
Those are examples of induced violation of Lorentz in-
variance."
"We consider a mechanism within the standard physics.
Namely, in the presence of media which interact with"

photons, the dispersion of light always occurs what in-
duces changes in the speed of light from its value c in
the vacuum. Along this line we study the dispersion of
light in several interstellar media and assess the produced
GRB delay when photons and neutrinos are assumed to
be emitted from the same source and simultaneously. Nei-
ther an electron-positron plasma nor a photon medium
can account for significant GRB delays, taking the ob-
served or the assumed densities of electrons and photons
are too low to slowdown the high-energy photons suffi-
ciently. By a plasma here it is meant a medium where the
wave-length of the incoming light is much smaller than
the free path of the constituent particles of the medium.
Therefore, we study the properties of an axionic medium.
Axions are pseudoscalar particles that may both provide
a solution to the strong CP problem and as well be a
candidate for cold dark matter (CDM). They are not
electrically charged but can still interact with photons.
Axion electrodynamics has been studied actively and it
is connected to topological insulators [11–14]. While the
original axion model was ruled out by observations, a new
version of the axion, which is called the invisible axion,
is consistent with laboratory experiments and astrophys-
ical observations [15]. Therefore, an axion medium is a
plausible cosmic medium that would have an effect on
the propagation of light from distant galaxies. We derive
the dispersion relation in an axion medium and assess its
effect on the GRB delay."
"Our approach is based on the quantum field theory
and the optical theorem. We derive the value of of the
plasma frequency ωp, i.e., the term contributing to the
change in the speed of light. To our knowledge such a
derivation and the result has not been given before. Then
the corresponding dispersion relation in this medium and
the produced GRB delay are derived.Our estimates show
that the interaction between GRB and axions is too weak
for producing a significant delay between the gamma-ray
and neutrino signals."
"To make our physical picture clear: we assume that the
photons and neutrinos are emitted from the same source
at the same time, and calculate the value of τ in all plau-
sible media in the interstellar space and for a few selected
values of the incoming GRB frequency. The dispersive ef-
fect indicates that the refractive index will be less than
unity, corresponding to the phase velocity being superlu-
minal, while the group velocity is subluminal. We neglect
the dissipation effect as this is expected to be weak. At
the highest photon frequencies where the permittivity is
very close to unity, the photon group velocity is slightly
lower than c, so that for these frequencies the delay nec-
essarily has to be the least."
"Notice that the interaction of neutrinos with any in-
terstellar medium is extremely weak and hence the dis-
persion of neutrinos is negligible. Secondly, while the
neutrinos are massive and oscillating, the effect on the
speed of high-energy neutrinos is very small. Consider"
"a GRB with photon energy 1 TeV and neutrinos with
the same energy, E = 1 TeV. The dispersion relation
E2 = p2c2 + m2c4 gives the speed of the neutrinos as"
"vν =
dE
dp"
"≈ c(1− dν), where dν = m
2c4"
"2E2
. Averaging over 3"
"neutrinos, 〈m2c4〉 = (1/3)(0.1 eV)2, where the masses are
estimated with the heaviest neutrino mass. The speed
of neutrinos is given by dν = 1.7 × 10−27. Thus the de-
lay compared to a signal travelling at the speed c would
be measured in nanoseconds even for signals from fur-
thest galaxies: τ = D × dν/c . 10−9 s, using a maximal
travelling distance D = 1.4 × 1026 m (effective distance
to farthest galaxies around z = 10). That is a negli-
gible time delay compared to the GRB delays searched
in experiments. Some theories of neutrino production in
GRB actually predict neutrinos with even higher energy
of order 102–107 TeV [1], which means vν might be even
closer to c. These arguments justify to take vν = c in our
estimates.
The time delay generated by dispersion of light in a"
"medium in its form is essentially different from those
caused by the induced Lorentz invariance violations due
to quantum gravity effects and in particular a spacetime
foam: in the latter cases, the speed of light becomes less
for higher energy photon and thus the time delays com-
pared with neutrino bursts grows, a distinguishable effect
opposite to the effect of light dispersion in all the media.
We shall not consider those (induced) Lorentz invariance
breakings in detail here, although some remarks will be
given in Sec. 4. We mention though that by assuming a
spacetime foam as the cosmic medium, it has been found
[9, 17] that the delay time is longest for the more ener-
getic photons. This points to an important observation:
if one considers one single GRB, the dispersive theory
predicts the highest frequencies to move faster, while in
the Lorentz violation theory these frequencies will move
slower. An experimental test of these theories is thus
possible.
Finally, we will mention some remarks and remind of"
"some intrinsic Lorentz invariance violation effects.
The Minkowski metric is defined with the signature"
"(ηµν) = diag(+1,−1,−1,−1)."

2.1 Dispersion relation and plasma fre-
quency
"A plasma can support both longitudinal and transverse
waves. We are interested in transverse waves. Dispersion
relation for light in a plasma is [18]"
"ω2 = c2k2 + ω2p, (1)"
"where ωp is the plasma frequency, which is due to the
plasma oscillations called Langmuir waves, derived from"
the classical Maxwell equations. The angular frequency is
"also given as ω = v(k̂) ·k = c|k|

", where n is the refraction"
"index and v = c

k̂ is the phase velocity, where k̂ = k"
"Thus the refraction index is related to the plasma fre-
quency as"
"n2 = 1−

"In an isotropic medium, ω = ω(|k|) and ωp = ωp(|k|),
group velocity is parallel to phase velocity, vg = vgk̂,
with the magnitude given as"
"vg =
∂ω(|k|)
∂|k| = c"
"c|k|+ 1

"∂|k|

"Since superluminal propagation of energy and informa-
tion is forbidden, we demand that the plasma frequency

"We should note that a superluminal group velocity does
not imply violation of special relativity, since in such a
case the signal velocity is not equal to group velocity
[21]. We still consider only cases with vg ≤ 1 so that
the group velocity can be taken as the signal velocity. If
the plasma frequency is independent of k, which is the
case in a usual plasma with charged particles, and the
photon momentum is large compared to the plasma fre-
quency, c2k2 ≫ ω2p, we obtain that group velocity is only
slightly lower than c,"

obtained from classical electrodynamics [18–20] as (in SI
units)"

"where N is the number density of electrons, e2 is the
square of the electric charge of the electron, ǫ0 is the
permittivity of vacuum, and the mass of the electron is
me = 9.11× 10−31 kg = 0.511 MeV/c2. The same result
(6) is obtained from quantum field theory, which is shown
in Appendix A. The lightest charged particles have the
greatest effect on the dispersion of light. The number
density of electrons N is left unspecified for now.
From (6) we get the plasma frequency ωp = 56"

obtain the group velocity (5) of the gamma-ray as

"Assume now that D(z) is the effective distance trav-
elled by the photons taking into account the expansion of
the Universe. It is defined as [3]"
"D(z) =

"where z is the redshift, H0 the present Hubble parameter,
and Ωm and ΩΛ are the standard symbols for the relative
matter and dark energy densities. (For an alternative to
this method, see [22].) In principle, the photon transit
time is"
"t =
D(z)"
"vGRB
. (9)"
"In order to evaluate this, one ought to include the z-
dependence of vGRB due to the varying density of the
plasma. However, we shall ignore the z-dependence of N
and vGRB for now, since we are only dealing with some
estimates. The time delay between two signals travelling
at the speeds (5) and c is obtained as"
"τ =

"As a first estimate, we may consider galaxy filaments,
which are the greatest structures in the universe. The size
of the largest filaments is measured in gigaparsecs. While
we do not know the electron density in the largest known
filaments, we can estimate it with the known electron
density of closer filaments. Hence we use the electron
density of galaxy filaments around z = 0.1 [23]: Ne ="
"(4.7± 0.2)× 10−4h1/2100 cm−3 ≈ 4× 102 m−3. The effective
distance is chosen as D = 3 Gpc = 9×1025 m. The delay
produced by electrons for a GRB propagating through
such a structure is estimated as"
"τ =
0.8× 10−25 s"
"Ē2
, (12)"
"which is negligible for high-energy photons, in particular
for GRB photons with Ē ≥ 1.
We conclude that the dispersive properties of an elec-"
"tron gas are not significant enough to account for measur-
able GRB time delays. In fact, even the delay of neutrinos
caused by the masses of the neutrinos is much longer than
the delay due to dispersion of light in the cosmic electron
medium."
2.3 Photon medium
"Dispersion of light in photon medium also produces a
GRB delay that is far too small to explain the observed
delay. Light-on-light scattering has been studied in par-
ticle accelerator experiments in great detail. While di-
rect observation of light-on-light scattering is difficult to
achieve in particle accelerators [24], evidence for it is in-
creasing and it also used for the search of axion particles
[25, 26]. When dealing with strong fields this process has
attracted considerable interest and new types of experi-
ments have been proposed; cf., for instance, Refs. [27, 28]."
"We obtain from light-on-light scattering [29–33] (see
Appendix A.3)"
"ω2p = const.×
Nγe"
"ω
, (13)"
"where Nγ is the number density of photons and ω =
√
s/2"
"in terms of the invariant s. According to the Planck data
on the CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) radiation,
which constitute the majority of photons in the Universe,
we have the number density of photons Nγ = (4–5) ×
108 m−3. The GRB delay produced by CMB is estimated
as"
"τCMB =
4× 10−41 GeV3"
"s3/2
× D"
"4× 10−23
Ē3/2"
"× D
c
. (14)"
"For GRB originating from the farthest galaxies the delay
produced by the interaction with CMB is τCMB = 2 ×
10−5 s/Ē3/2; e.g. for a gamma-ray energy E = 100 GeV
the delay is τCMB = 2 × 10−8 s. This is a very short
delay but still much longer than the delay produced by
electrons (12)."
"The extra-galactic background light (EBL) is the sec-
ond, after the CMB, most abundant part of the pho-
ton medium in the Universe. With the data as given
in [34, 35], we obtain the photon number density NEBL =
104 m−3, and with a typical EBL photon energy of 1 eV,
we obtain the delay τEBL = 10"
"−32/Ē−3/2 × (D/c). Thus,
the number of CMB photons is several orders of mag-
nitude larger than the number of EBL photons and the
same is with τCMB compared with τEBL."
"For high-energy light propagating in the Universe,
there also appears the electromagnetic cascades due to
the electron-positron pair production, what adds an addi-
tional contribution to the ordinary electromagnetic back-
ground. However, this process goes through a higher or-
der in the electromagnetic coupling constant and its con-
tribution to the delay τ can be neglected."
"Thus the dispersion on background photons does not
produce a significant GRB delay."
3 Axions and their effect on the
propagation of gamma-rays
"Since the GRB delay produced by a charged plasma was
found to be proportional to the inverse of the particle
mass, τ ∝ m−1, it becomes natural to look for particles of
much lower mass than the electron. As mentioned above,
we will consider a model where the dark matter consists
of axions. However, since an electrically charged axion
is not consistent with experiments and observations, the
plasma frequency formula for charged plasma (6) is no
longer valid. Nevertheless, with the vivid activity in ax-
ion electrodynamics [11–14] with its connection to topo-
logical insulators (for experiment, see CERN Axion Solar
Telescope), the assumption of an axionic plasma with its
coupling to photons seems quite appropriate. The char-
acteristic axion mass for the QCD axion experiments is
about ma = 10"
"−5eV/c2 [15]. However, the axion mass
may be much smaller: a satisfactory agreement with con-
straints has been reported when the axion mass lies in
the interval 10−18 eV < ma < 10"
"−28 eV [16].
The effective coupling between the axion and two pho-"
"tons is given by the interaction Lagrangian [15, 36]"

axion field. The electromagnetic field strength tensor is

"If the interaction Lagrangian is written in terms of the
electric E and the magnetic field B, we would have
Laγγ = −ga(x)E · B. Here we adopt a system of
units with Heaviside–Lorentz electromagnetic units and
~ = c = 1.
First we note that the optical properties of axion"
"backgrounds have been explored in [37, 38] and refer-
ences therein by means of classical axion electrodynam-
ics. The issues concerning GRB have not been consid-
ered. The group velocity of light in the presence of
the axion field and without charged plasma is given as
vg = 1 + g"
"2(∂µa)
2/8k20 [37]. If the vector ∂µa is time-"
"like, (∂µa)
2 > 1, the group velocity is not the velocity"
"at which information propagates, and in such cases one
should instead use true signal velocity [21]. In order to
apply the aforementioned formula for vg to the problem of"
"GRB delay one would need to obtain the value of (∂µa)
2"
"along the route of GRB, or relate (∂µa)
2 to the density"
"of axions. We shall not do that here. Instead we use an
approach that is based on quantum field theory."
"We assume the same dispersion equation (1) as before,
for the axionic matter. A quantum field theoretical cal-
culation of the plasma frequency is given next. The cal-
culation holds for high-energy photons, when the photon
energy is much higher than the mass of the axion ma. A
calculation like this has to our knowledge not been given
before, neither in classical electrodynamics nor in quan-
tum field theory."

The energy density of GH is 0.45 GeV/cm3 and the radius
of GH is 5× 1020 m [39]. The delay of GRB propagating

"As a second example, we consider a massive galaxy

"τ =
0.7× 10−48 s"

"The delay is negligible for high-energy photons, as it also
is in the case of GH.
We may also comment on the importance of the mag-"
"netic field. For an electron-positron plasma, there is no
magnetic contribution. By extending to the case of chiral
media, the magnetic field comes into play giving an en-
hancement of g and a reduction of Na. It is known that
for a chiral medium, there is a magnetic contribution to
the Casimir effect [40, 41]."

of light in photon medium due to ax-
ion exchange

via axion exchange, in addition to the usual photon-by-
photon interaction due to fermion-antifermion loops (box
diagrams)."

4 Remarks on Lorentz invariance
violation
"The high energy tests of (an intrinsic) Lorentz invari-
ance violation (LIV), as proposed by [42] with specific
examples for them, have attracted considerable interest
in connection with GRB; see e.g. [5–8, 10, 43–47]. We
shall now compare the present light dispersion approach
to the assumption of Lorentz invariance violation. Typi-
cally, in the LIV approach motivated by quantum gravity"
"effects the dispersion relation contains higher-powers of
energy,"
"1 + ξ
E"
"EQG
+O"
"= p2c2 +m2c4, (64)"
"where EQG is an effective energy scale for quantum grav-
ity, commonly taken to be of order 1016 GeV, and ξ is an
arbitrary parameter. The expression for the group veloc-
ity takes the following form to leading order in E/EQG,"
vg = c
"1− ξ E
EQG"
. (65)
"Then it is assumed that ξ > 0 so that vg as the signal
speed of radiation is subluminal. Thus, the higher energy
of GRB, the greater slowdown of it.
Comparison with the dispersion relation (5) above"
"leads to an interesting observation: the energy depen-
dencies of the resulting GRB time delays are qualitatively
different, which can be used to distinguish the two inter-
pretations including their amounts experimentally. In the
case of LIV, the time delay behaves as τ ∝ E. Disper-
sion in electron and axion media produces a time delay
as τ ∝ E−2. Thus, if gamma-rays with the highest ener-
gies arrive first, the conventional dispersive plasma the-
ory with an electron-like coupling is supported, while if
the highest-energy gamma-rays arrive later, the Lorentz
invariance breaking dispersion relation is supported. It
would be quite important to test out this issue experi-
mentally. An observation of advance of the highest en-
ergy photons would imply that the LIV model would have
to be reconsidered. In order to perform such a test, the
spectrum of GRB needs to be recorded with as high tem-
poral resolution as possible.
Since the LIV modification of the dispersion relation"
"should effect particles of all kinds, and particularly both
photons and neutrinos, it is difficult to explain the delays
between GRB and neutrino bursts coming from the same
source. In this interpretation such a delay could only be
possible if the energy of neutrinos differs from the energy
of photons by several orders of magnitude [7], which is
hard to believe. However, if one would argue that in
LIV the dispersions relations for photon and neutrino are
different due to different quantum gravity effects on them,
then by all means the whole effect should not be called
LIV but the induced LIV.
It is noteworthy that it is not known experimentally"
"whether the gamma-ray bursts arrive earlier, or later,
than the neutrino bursts — the IceCube in Antarctica
has detected some cosmic neutrinos, but they cannot be
associated with any astrophysical object [48] (for a recent
experiment at this detector, see [4]).
Finally, we would like to mention that an intrinsic vio-"
"lation of the Lorentz symmetry can be detected in several
ways in precision experiments in different processes as has
been in full details described in [42]. LIV can also occur"
"in a way that differs from the hitherto used approach to
LIV by changing the Special Relativity dispersion rela-
tion. For instance, the Lorentz group could be broken to
certain proper subgroups of the Poincaré group, to the so-
called Very Special Relativity [52]. It also can occur that
the dispersion relation does not change but the Lorentz
symmetry is broken— an example is the noncommutative
field theory [49, 50], where we have the residual twisted
Poincaré symmetry [51]."
5 Conclusions
"We have considered the propagation of gamma-ray pho-
tons in the interstellar space — a problem of considerable
interest by itself and analyzed in details the dispersion of
light travelling through the interstellar space behaving as
a plasma medium."
"Dispersive properties of normal matter and background
radiation, CMB, are insufficient to produce a significant
GRB delay, when using some indicative densities of the
constituent particles."
"Then we have taken into account the effect of dark mat-
ter by assuming that dark matter consists of very light
and cold particles, the hypothetical axions, with their
theoretically expected coupling to photons. We find that
for the hitherto realistic density of dark matter (revealed
by its gravitational effect), the produced GRB delay is
also very small."
"The derived basic formulas for the time delay τ are
given in Eq. (12) for an electron-positron plasma, in
Eq. (14) for a photon plasma as CMBmedium, in Eq. (47)
for a Galactic Halo and in (48) for a massive galaxy fil-
ament. The numerical values in those Eqs. are for the
realistic values of the particle densities according to dif-
ferent estimates, or the ones considered to be more or less
reasonable. The derivations of the light dispersion rela-
tion in all the different media in QFT are presented in
the Appendix A and its subsections."
"As seen from the Eqs. (12), (14), (47) and (48), the
smallest delay for the high energy gamma-rays comes
from dispersion in an axion plasma, and slightly larger
delay for an electron-positron plasma."
"The largest delay comes from the dispersion of light in a
medium such as filled with CMB. In addition, the delay
time as a function of the incoming photon energy in a
medium filled with light radiation is 1/E3/2, while in an
electron or axion medium it is 1/E2. Thus, at higher and
higher energies the dispersion in light medium dominates
over the other two media. The latter, is a quite important
issue, since the value for the delay, which is proportional
to the density of particles, given in Eq. (14) is estimated
with the average density in CMB in only the observed
part of the Universe, (being typically τ ∼ 2×10−8 s for a
100 GeV gamma-ray burst from farthest galaxies), while
in other parts of the Universe the density of photons can"
be by far larger.
"The very high energies and long travel distances
of GRB have initiated to consider different models
of Lorentz violation by modifying (the mass-energy-
momentum) dispersion relations. Such an approach typ-
ically leads to a signal velocity as in Eq. (65), which de-
creases as a function of energy. We also see that such
breaking of Special Relativity would lead to the simulta-
neous breaking of General Relativity, in which case many
other results should be reconsidered and revalued. Thus,
we believe that before invoking the drastic assumption of
breaking of the Special Relativity to interpret GRB de-
lays, one should also consider all possible ways to explain
the phenomenon within the standard physics, a special
case of which, namely the dispersion of light in the inter-
stellar space, what always exists, has been presented in
the present work."
"As always, the decisive evidence will finally be given by
experiment: in the case of the interpretation in terms of
dispersion of light, the higher-energy gamma-rays arrive
the Earth earlier and the lower-energy ones later, while
in the typical LIV models hitherto presented based on
quantum gravity effects such as in a stringy foam models
for the space, it occurs the opposite."
"We should emphasize that all the models considered till
now can only be called as an induced LIV and not simply
as LIV, which could imply intrinsic LIV. The wording
of simply LIV has been used for brevity in some recent
literature instead of the induced LIV."
"Concerning the experimental observation of an intrin-
sic (genuine) violation of the Lorentz invariance and its
theoretical interpretation, we have already mentioned at
the very end of Sect. 4 above, and referred to the seminal
works in [42] and [52]. But we would like to recall that
all the symmetries and laws derived from them are based
on the existence of some group of symmetries, no mat-
ter whether they are global or local (gauge), internal or
spacetime (external) symmetries and their breaking de-
scribed by a residual or subgroup of the original groups of
symmetries or an acceptable deformation of those groups,
i.e. ones with their motivation not based on the presence
of a medium such as gravity or curvature, but not break-
ing the Lorentz group in an arbitrary way. The same
should be also in the case of the breaking of the Lorentz
symmetry. The work in [52] is a good example, where the
natural requirements for the residual group of symmetry,
i.e. the broken ones, have been chosen to be a subgroup of
the Poincaré group, and such that both the translational
and CPT invariance remain preserved."
"Several experiments, e.g. the recent Refs. [53–55], will
analyze the energy-dependent delay in the arriving time
of photons and will be able to resolve this issue. In the
dispersive approach, the delay of an electromagnetic sig-
nal increases at lower photon energies. Therefore signals
with radio frequencies would be a possible way to test the
approach. Since the mass of axion is very low, possibly"
"as low as ma ∼ 10−18 eV, and our derivations hold for
photons with energy much higher than the axion mass,
our results may be applicable to many radio signals as
well."
"The observation of gravitational waves (GW) and a
short GRB from the merger of two neutron stars in NGC
4993 [56, 57] shows that gamma-ray photons do not expe-
rience long delays, since the GRB was observed only 1.7
seconds after the GW. Electromagnetic signals with lower
frequencies were recorded by several teams starting eleven
hours after the GW and ending weeks later, ranging from
x-rays to radio frequencies [57]. Optical and infrared ob-
servations showed a towards-red evolution during 10 days.
That is consistent with emissions from a cooling debris of
the merger. We remark two things. Firstly, the GRB
delays caused by dispersion of gamma-rays in the cos-
mic medium, as derived in this work, are much shorter
than the observed delay between GW 170817 and GRB
170817A signals, assuming that the GW are not effected
by the medium. That is expected, since the gamma-rays
are thought to be produced after the gravitational waves.
Secondly, for the dispersive approach the dependency of
the time delay on photon frequency (i.e. higher frequen-
cies are delayed less than lower frequencies) is consistent
with the observations of the merger. The same might not
be the case with LIV models which exhibit an opposite
relation between the time delay and the photon frequency."
"In our estimates we have considered only the average
axion densities at great distances, particularly at the level
of galaxy filaments and in the dark matter halo of a typ-
ical galaxy. Any finer details of axion distribution have
been neglected in these estimates. The same concerns
the density of photons, such as in CMB, taken to be as
in only the observed part of the Universe. Therefore, it
would be enlightening to study the effects of different ax-
ion distributions, as well as the densities of the photons in
the larger distances in greater detail. In this way, future
studies of GRB delays produced by dispersion of light in
media can also shed additional light on the microstruc-
ture of the Universe."
Note added:
"After the completion of our work we were informed about
two previous works [58] and [59] on the propagation of
light in an axion or photon plasmas, respectively, in quite
different aspects and using different methods of calcula-
tion but without addressing the issue of GRB delay."
"The work in [58] gives a comprehensive account of dis-
persion of light in a relativistic plasma theory, includ-
ing also some numerical evaluation of the results. Their
model is somewhat different from ours, since it involves
nonminimal gravitational interaction for the pseudoscalar
(axion) field, and the axion field varying linearly with re-
spect to time. A main objective of their work was to
show that the phase velocity of transverse electromag-
netic waves can also be less than c, providing the pos-"
"sibility of resonant plasma/waves interactions. Within
the permitted space of parameters for the propagating
electromagnetic waves, the squared plasma frequency, ω2p,
and consequently the effective photon mass squared, m2γ ,
are positive (see Fig. 3).
The work [59] has considered the conversion of high-"
"energy gamma-rays to axions and a dominant disper-
sion of light in a photon medium corresponding to CMB
effect. Using the nonlinear Euler-Heisenberg electrody-
namics Lagrangian they obtain a negative value for the
squared effective photon mass, m2γ < 0. That would cor-
respond to a superluminal group velocity for GRB. We
believe that this result is incorrect, possibly due to ob-
scure way of calculating the plasma frequency ω2p and
obtaining a negative value for it. Using the same way of
calculation for an axion medium, they would also obtain
a negative value of ω2p."

frequency can be derived from quantum field theory. In
order to show how it works, we first consider the case of
electrons and photons with standard quantum electrody-
namics. Then we consider the axion with its interaction
to the electromagnetic field (15). We use a system of
units with Heaviside–Lorentz electromagnetic units and

follows from the inteference between incident and scat-

the real part describes dispersion and the imaginary

can see from (A.2) that the imaginary part of f(0) is pro-
portional to the cross section, which is proportional to
the square of the amplitude and thus higher in the order
of the small coupling constant than in the correspond-
ing formula in (A.8), which is of the lower order in the
coupling constant, being proportional to the amplitude
itself.
Inserting (2) into (A.1) we obtain a relation between"

"When the photon frequency is large compared to the
plasma frequency, ω2 ≫ ω2p, we obtain"
"ω2p = −4πN Re f(0). (A.4)
The scattering amplitude f(θ) is defined as a part of"
"the quantum mechanical wave function at large distance
r from the scatterer,"

"where C is a normalization factor. The differential cross
section is given in terms of the scattering amplitude as"
"dσ(θ) = |f(θ)|2dΩ. (A.6)
The closest thing to the scattering amplitude f in quan-
tum field theory is the so-called T -matrix defined as the
scattering part of the S-matrix"
"〈ψf |S|ψi〉 = 〈ψf |ψi〉+ 〈ψf |iT |ψi〉 . (A.7)
The T -matrix, i.e. the Green’s function, is related to the
Feynman invariant scattering amplitude M. In order to
compute f(0) in quantum field theory, we shall use the
differential cross section. We calculate in quantum field
theory the differential cross section dσ(θ) and from (A.6)
the forward scattering amplitude follows as"
"|f(0)| =

. (A.8)
"After the preliminaries presented above, we shall now
proceed with the derivation of the plasma frequency for
electron-positron plasma in standard quantum electrody-
namics, as well as for a photon medium. Calculation of
the plasma frequency for an electron-positron plasma is
given here in order to show that our results coincide with
the classical ones which have been derived before from
the classical Maxwell equations."

"The photons and electron are not polarized, and hence
we average over initial spin states and sum over final spin
states. In the squared Feynman amplitude, we use the

"We now choose the rest frame of the initial electron,
p = (me,0), and specialize to the case when the momenta
of the initial and final photons are parallel. When k and
k′ are parallel, we have k · k′ = k0k′0 −k ·k′ = |k||k′|(1−
cos θ) = 0, where θ = 0 is the angle between k and k′. We
obtain from conservation of four-momentum that (p+k−
k′)2 = p′2, where the left-hand side ism2e+2p·k−2p·k′ =
m2e + 2me(k0 − k′0) and the right-hand side is m2e. This
implies k′0 = k0. Since energy is conserved, we also have
p′0 = p0. For θ = 0 the squared Feynman amplitude
(A.10) becomes"
