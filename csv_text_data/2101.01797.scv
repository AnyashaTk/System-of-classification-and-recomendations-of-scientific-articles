"We calculate the response of a lead-based detector, such as the Helium and Lead Observatory
(HALO) or its planned upgrade HALO-1kt to a galactic core-collapse supernova. We pay particular
attention to the time dependence of the reaction rates. All reaction rates decrease as the neutrino
luminosity exponentially drops during the cooling period but the ratio of one-neutron (1n) to two-
neutron (2n) event rates in HALO is independent of this overall decrease. Nevertheless, we find that
this ratio still changes with time due to the changing character of neutrino flavor transformations
with the evolving conditions in the supernova. In the case of inverted hierarchy, this is caused by the
fact that the spectral splits become less and less sharp with the decreasing luminosity. In the case
of normal hierarchy, it is caused by the passage of the shock wave through the Mikheyev-Smirnov-
Wolfenstein resonance region. However, in both cases, we find that the change in the ratio of 1n to
2n event rates is limited to a few percent."

I. INTRODUCTION
"Based on statistical and observational studies, some-
where between 0.5−3 supernova explosions should happen
in our galaxy per century [1, 2]. The latest supernova
exploded about 120 years ago [3] but it was not optically
detected because it was buried in dust near the galactic
center. However, with today’s neutrino detection capabil-
ities, the next galactic core-collapse supernova will leave
thousands of events in the neutrino detectors [4, 5] even
if it explodes near the center of the galaxy. The question
of what we can learn about the core-collapse supernovae
and about neutrinos themselves from such a signal is a
prevailing one. A recent review can be found in Ref. [6]."
"In this paper we are interested in calculating the re-
sponse of a lead-based detector such as HALO or HALO-
1kt to a galactic core-collapse supernova.1 Neutrinos and
antineutrinos of all flavors are emitted from a supernova
[7, 8]. These neutrinos undergo flavor evolution after they
thermally decouple from the proto-neutron star at the
center. Besides the ordinary vacuum oscillations, this
involves collective neutrino oscillations which happen due
to coherent neutrino-neutrino scattering in the inner re-
gions [9–12], and Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW)
resonances due to coherent scattering on background elec-
trons [13–15] in the outer regions. HALO can detect these
neutrinos through charged-current (CC) reactions"

"on 79 tons of 20882Pb target [16]. HALO-1kt will use 1
kiloton of lead target and will have significantly increased
efficiency. All neutrino and antineutrino flavors can par-
ticipate in NC reactions as indicated by the (−) overset
in Eq. (2). As a result, these reactions are insensitive to
flavor transformations. But the CC reactions can only
be participated by electron neutrinos. Since 208Pb is a
neutron-rich nucleus, reactions with electron antineutri-
nos are suppressed by Pauli blocking. As a result, HALO
is primarily sensitive to the flavor transformations of elec-
tron neutrinos inside the supernova. Currently, neutrino-
lead cross sections are not experimentally known. But
theoretical calculations are carried out by several groups
[17–22]. Estimates of expected event rates at HALO are
based on such calculations [23–26]."
"The first detailed study of the HALO event rates which
took neutrino flavor evolution into account was Ref. [24].
The primarily interest of this study was to extract infor-
mation about the neutrino energy spectra emitted during
the cooling period of the supernova from the HALO signal.
To be able to scan the large parameter space, the authors
adopted an approach which is based on modifying the
neutrino energy spectra manually to mimic the dynamical
flavor evolution. In particular, based on the results from
earlier flavor evolution studies they assumed that sharp
spectral swaps [27–33] occur in fixed parts of the neu-
trino energy spectra due to collective neutrino oscillations.
They also ignored the effects of the shock wave. This
practical approach allowed them to write down analytical
expressions for the neutrino spectra reaching Earth for a
large variety of initial conditions, and show that HALO
signal can be used to extract information about the spec-"

"tral pinching parameters. A similar approach was adopted
in Ref. [25] which was concerned with determining the
neutrino mass hierarchy by combining the electron neu-
trino signal from a lead or iron detector and the electron
antineutrino signal from a water-Cherenkov detector. A
complementary study was carried out more recently in Ref.
[26], in which the authors used time dependent neutrino
luminosities and initial energy distributions taken from
a proto-neutron star simulation [34]. Since this simula-
tion produced very similar fluxes for different flavors, and
their primary purpose was to compare lead vs iron-based
detectors in terms of total number of events, the authors
ignored the collective neutrino oscillations and the effects
shock wave."
"This paper aims to estimate the event rates in HALO
during a galactic supernova based on a fully dynami-
cal and time dependent calculation of neutrino flavor
evolution. Here, being dynamical refers to the explicit
solutions of flavor evolution equations starting from the
surface of the proto-neutron star and ending on the sur-
face of the supernova. Collective oscillations and MSW
resonances naturally appear in these dynamical solutions.
The time dependence mentioned above refers to the fact
that we include (i) the decreasing neutrino luminosity of
the proto-neutron star during the cooling period and (ii)
the propagating shock wave in the mantle."
"During the cooling period, neutrino luminosities are
expected to drop roughly as Lναe"
"−t/τ [35, 36]. Here, t
denotes the post-bounce time, τ is the relevant time scale,
να with α = e, µ, τ denotes the neutrino flavor, and Lνα
is the initial να luminosity. This will lead to exponen-
tially decreasing reaction rates in all detectors. However,
there is a more subtle effect: with decreasing neutrino
luminosity, collective neutrino oscillations change their
character, especially in the case of inverted hierarchy (IH).
Our calculations for IH indicate that initially, when the
neutrino luminosity is large, the spectral swaps are sharp.
In other words, completely adiabatic or diabatic transi-
tions occur across the whole spectrum, depending on the
energy. As the neutrino luminosity drops, we see partially
adiabatic transitions in the part of the spectrum above
35 MeV. This is the part of the spectrum to which a lead-
based detector is most sensitive, i.e., most of the neutrons
produced in the detector will originate from neutrinos in
this energy region [26]. Therefore, it is reasonable to ask
whether this effect can lead to a time dependence beyond
the exponential drop in reaction rates in the case of IH. In
the case of normal hierarchy (NH), collective oscillations
affect only the very low energy part of the spectrum. For
this reason, one does not expect to see a similar effect for
NH."
"The second source of time dependence in the HALO
signal is the propagating shock wave. This effect can
be expected to appear when the shock wave reaches the
MSW resonance region. There are two MSW resonances:
The low resonance occurs in the outermost layers of the
mantle and is experienced by neutrinos in both NH and
IH. However, one does not expect to see its effect in"
"reaction rates because the shock wave reaches there at
very late times when the neutrino luminosity drops to
a few percent of its initial value. The high resonance
occurs at relatively higher densities and is experienced by
neutrinos only in the case of NH. The shock wave reaches
this region relatively earlier, while there is still a sizable
neutrino luminosity. Therefore, in principle, it is possible
to see the effects of the shock wave in reaction rates in
the case of NH."
"The impact of the supernova shock waves on neutrino
flavor evolution has been examined in several works over
the years [37–44]. The combined effect of the collective
neutrino oscillations and the shock wave modification
of MSW resonances was first considered in Ref. [43].
In this work, an interesting interplay between the two
features was pointed out for electron antineutrinos which
feel both effects in the case of IH. This has observational
consequences for water-Cherenkov and liquid scintillator
experiments. However, no such interplay is to be expected
in the HALO signal: HALO is sensitive to the flavor
evolution of electron neutrinos only, and they are affected
either by collective oscillations in the case of IH, or by the
shock wave modification of MSW resonances in the case
of NH. This separation of effects is one of the motivations
of the present study."
"Another motivation is the fact that HALO has an
adequate timing mechanism to look for dynamical effects
in a supernova. It has a time resolution of about 200
µs, which is the time required for the emitted neutrons
to thermalize before being captured at the 3 He counters
[45, 46]. In addition, all events are time stamped by a
GPS-based system [46], allowing a comparison with other
neutrino observatories."
"Our treatment covers neither the dynamical aspects of
neutrino flavor evolution nor the time dependent features
of the supernova neutrino signal fully. As for the dynami-
cal flavor evolution, we leave out the multiangle nature
of the collective neutrino oscillations: we treat the depen-
dence of the neutrino-neutrino interactions on the angle
between the neutrinos [47] in an effective way using the
so-called neutrino bulb model [27]. The multiangle effects
are expected to delay the onset of collective oscillations
but leave its general features intact for the type of initial
spectra that we consider [48]. We also do not take the
time evolution of the proto-neutron star itself into account
as is done, for example, in Ref. [26]. In reality, the radius
of the proto-neutron star, and the energy distributions of
the emitted neutrinos slightly change during the cooling
period. See, for example, Refs. [35, 36]. Our purpose
in leaving out this important feature is to isolate and
examine the other time dependent features mentioned
above."
"We start in Section II with a general description of the
neutrino flavor evolution equations in the supernova. In
Section III, we provide a semi-analytical view of flavor evo-
lution with an emphasis on the sharpness of spectral splits
in terms of a simple jumping probability p between the
matter eigenstates in the collective oscillation region. We"

"present flavor evolution examples and show the departure
from the sharp spectral splits in the high energy region.
The discussion in this section is useful in interpreting
our results in the case of IH. In Section IV, we calculate
the expected reaction rates per kiloton of lead target for
four different neutrino energy distribution models as a
function of time. In particular we present the results for
the time dependence of the ratio of 1n to 2n events. We
present our conclusions in Section V."
II. SUPERNOVA NEUTRINOS
"We assume that the supernova is spherically symmetric,
and that neutrinos of all flavors and energies thermally
decouple at a single sharp surface close to the surface
of the proto-neutron star. After that, neutrinos freely
stream uniformly in all directions. This is known as the
neutrino bulb model, which was developed in Ref. [27]. We
also adopt the single-angle approximation in describing
the neutrino flavor evolution. Both of these approaches
are summarized below."
"Let us consider all neutrinos with energy between E
and E + dE which are emitted from the surface of the
proto-neutron star during a post-bounce time interval
between t and t + dt. Not all of these neutrinos travel
radially because emission can happen in any angle from
the surface of the proto-neutron star. (See Fig. 1.) But,
in the single angle approximation, it is assumed that these
neutrinos reach a given distance (say r) from the center
of the supernova at the same time. In other words, small
differences in their paths are omitted. Furthermore, the
single angle approximation and the spherical symmetry
assumption together imply that any two neutrinos in this
group evolve in the same way regardless of their direction,"
"provided that they are initially emitted in the same fla-
vor. Therefore, these neutrinos form an ensemble which
evolves with distance r. Here we choose to work with
unnormalized density operators, i.e., we want to define an
infinitesimal density operator ρ̂t(E, r)dtdE whose trace
is equal to the total number of neutrinos with energy
between E and E + dE, emitted from the proto-neutron
star between t and t + dt. These neutrinos occupy the
shaded region between r and r + dr shown in Fig. 1 at a
later time. Here, we use the natural units so that dr = dt."
"On the surface of the proto-neutron star where r = R,
this density operator is given by"
"ρ̂t(E,R) =
∑"
"α=e,µ,τ"
"Lναe
−t/τ"
"〈Eνα〉
fνα(E)|να〉〈να|. (3)"
"The above equation is easy to understand: Lναe
−t/τ is"
"the total energy emitted per unit time in terms of να’s.
Dividing this by their average energy 〈Eνα〉, we find the
number of να’s emitted per unit time. Finally, multipli-
cation with their normalized energy distribution fνα(E)
yields the number of those να’s per unit energy inter-
val. For antineutrinos, we define an analogous expression
ˆ̄ρt(E,R) which is the same as in Eq. (3) except that neu-
trino quantities are replaced with antineutrino quantities
labeled by ν̄α, e.g., Lν̄α , 〈Eν̄α〉, etc . . ."
"The neutrino luminosities used in Eq. (3) can be
found from the total binding energy EB emitted by
the supernova. Since almost all of this energy is emit-
ted in terms of neutrinos during the cooling period,
divided equally between all neutrino and antineutrino
flavors, neutrino luminosities can be calculated from

to the upper limit2 of the binding energy released by the
SN1987A as calculated from the observed ν̄e signal [51].
This leads to the initial neutrino luminosities given by
Lνα = Lν̄α = 3.18×1052 erg/s, which drops exponentially
after that."
"Unlike the luminosities, the energy distributions of dif-
ferent neutrino and antineutrino flavors are not the same
because they are subject to different interactions inside
the proto-neutron star. Here we adopt the fit function

This is because most of the non-trivial flavor evolution
(collective effects and the MSW resonances) occurs before
105 km, and it takes only a fraction of a second for the
neutrinos to reach there. For this reason, we use the

profile by superimposing a parametric shock wave on the
progenitor profile as described in Ref. [38]. The resulting
post-bounce density profiles for t = 1, 3, 5, 7 s are also
shown in Fig. 2."
"The last term in Eq. (6) represents the NC forward
and exchange scatterings of neutrinos from each other [9,
10, 47, 57, 58]. The energy integral contains all neutrinos
at radius r. This may be confusing because it appears to
imply that every neutrino in the ensemble with energy
E meets and interacts with every other neutrino in the
whole system. However, this is not the case. According
to the neutrino bulb model, a test neutrino interacts only
with those neutrinos which cross its path. But due to the
assumption of spherical symmetry and the single angle
approximation, the evolution of the ones that it meets is"
"the same as those that it does not. As a result, one can
use the density operator of the whole system by simply
multiplying it with a geometrical factor which yields its
relevant fraction. This geometrical factor is 1"

integral represents the antineutrinos in an analogous way
to neutrinos. Antineutrino density operators undergo the
same evolution except that their Hamiltonian should be
obtained from Eq. (6) by interchanging neutrino and
antineutrino degrees of freedom and reversing the sign of
the CC interaction term. We do not consider any charge-
parity violations here because it would have no affect on
the HALO signal.3"
III. FLAVOR EVOLUTION
A. Collective Oscillations
"It is helpful to describe the neutrino flavor evolution
in the matter basis, which instantaneously diagonalizes
the Hamiltonian. Since the Hamiltonian changes with
distance, so does the matter basis. We find it useful to
denote the matter basis at distance r from the center of
the supernova with |ri〉 where i = 1, 2, 3 orders the matter
eigenvalues from the lightest to the heaviest. In other
words, we write the Hamiltonian given in Eq. (6) as"
H(r) =
"3∑
i=1"
"Ei(r) |ri〉〈ri|, (9)"
"where E1(r) < E2(r) < E3(r) is satisfied. For simplicity, we
drop the time and energy dependence of the Hamiltonian
and the density operator from our notation in the rest of
the paper. Since the Hamiltonian depends on the post-
bounce time and the energy of the neutrino, so do its
eigenvalues and eigenstates on the right hand side of Eq.
(9). But this dependence is similarly suppressed in our
notation."
"For the models that we consider, we have"
"|R1〉 ≈ sin θ23|νµ〉+ cos θ23|ντ 〉,
|R2〉 ≈ cos θ23|νµ〉 − sin θ23|ντ 〉,
|R3〉 ≈ |νe〉,"
"3 This statement is true as long as νµ, ντ , ν̄µ, ν̄τ have the same
emission spectra [59–63], and as long as the neutrino magnetic
moment is small [64]."

with medium thickness shows the second matter eigenstate
which decouples from the dynamics. This is for a 45 MeV
neutrino in IH for models I and III at 3 s and 5s. For other
models, energies, and times the results are similar."
"on the surface of the proto-neutron star where r = R.
Since the luminosities are equal and the νµ and ντ energy
distributions are the same, the initial density operator

"Here the flavor components ραα(R) are defined in Eq. (3).
For the models that we consider, collective oscillations
mix the first and third matter eigenstates while the second
mass eigenstate decouples from the dynamics. Examples
of this behavior are shown in Fig. 3. This behavior is
expected based on the results of earlier studies, such as
those in Refs. [33]. This tells us that 12 and 23 elements
of the evolution operator in the matter basis are zero

p and the phase δ(r) depend on the neutrino energy and
the post-bounce time. But p depends on the distance only
for a short period during the collective oscillations. Once
the collective oscillations end at about 500 km, p is inde-
pendent of distance (see Fig. 3). However the phase δ(r)

"Eq. (13) is true for both NH and IH, but with different
crossing probabilities. In the case of NH, the collective
oscillations create a spectral swap in the low energy part
of the spectrum below a split energy ENH. In the case
of IH, they create a spectral swap between a low and a
high split energy, denoted, respectively, by EIH and E"

ENH was lower than all the reaction threshold energies,
which are listed in Table I. But the IH swap occurs in the
region to which HALO is most sensitive. For the models
I-III, the low split energy EIH is around 7-9 MeV. This
is close to, but lower than, the CC1n reaction threshold,
which is 9.76 MeV. In order to see the effects of an IH
low split energy which is higher than this threshold, we
set up the fourth model with higher average energies. In
model IV, we find EIH = 14 MeV, which is higher than
the CC1n reaction threshold but lower than the CC2n
reaction threshold. The high split energy E′"

steadily"
"increases as we go from model I to model IV. For model
I, it is 35 MeV, and for model IV, it is 60 MeV. It also
increases slightly with time within each model."
"In the IH case, spectral splits are not sharp in the high
energy region of the spectrum. At high energies, the
jumping probability p takes values between 0 and 1 as
shown in Fig. 4. In this figure, we show the jumping
probability p for models I-IV as a function of energy at
even times. In earlier times, the spectral swap is closer to
being sharp with p ≈ 0.1 in the high energy region. But
at later times, the splits become less and less sharp."

"As the neutrinos move through the star, the projections
of matter eigenstates on flavor eigenstates (i.e, 〈να|ri〉)
change slowly. As a result, ραα(r) has a smooth variation
described by the first three terms of the equation above.
However, the last term gives rise to fast oscillations if
p is different from 0 or 1. An example of this behavior
is shown in Fig. 5 where we plot ραα(r) for a neutrino
with 45 MeV energy in IH for models I and III at t = 3 s
and t = 5s. Notice that the amplitude of the oscillations
grows in each case as the neutrino propagates. This is
due to the 〈να|r1〉〈r3|να〉 term in the last line of Eq. (16).
In the inner regions where the electron density is high,
|νe〉 is practically the heaviest matter eigenstate. In other
words, we have 〈νe|r3〉 ≈ 1, 〈νe|r1〉 ≈ 0, and 〈νµ,τ |r3〉 ≈ 0.
As a result, the oscillation amplitudes do not grow until
the density drops and νe starts to have a projection on
lighter matter eigenstates. These oscillations are akin to
the phase effects first discussed in Ref. [41]."
B. MSW Resonances
"Neutrino-neutrino interactions become negligible af-
ter a few hundred kilometers from the center. In our
simulations, we manually turn off the neutrino-neutrino
interaction term at 1000 km, after which the Hamiltonian
contains only the vacuum oscillations and the effects of
the other background particles. The evolution of neutri-
nos under these conditions is well understood in terms"
"FIG. 5. The oscillations of the diagonal elements of the density
operator in flavor basis due to the partial adiabaticity of
collective oscillations. These examples show a 45 MeV neutrino
in IH for models I and III at 3 s and 5 s. For other models,
energies, and times, the behavior is similar."
"FIG. 6. The evolution of 30 MeV (left panels) and 70 MeV
(right panels) neutrinos in the case of NH for model I at 3 s, 5
s, and 7 s. At earlier times, neutrinos go through one adiabatic
high resonance. At later times, they go through three high
resonances, and the adiabaticity is temporarily broken for each
energy."
"of the MSW resonances [13, 14]. As long as the density
profile changes slowly in comparison to the neutrino oscil-
lation wavelengths, the flavor evolution is adiabatic, i.e.,
the dynamical evolution of each matter eigenstate follows
its own slow change with the background density [15].
At the resonant densities, the flavor content of matter
eigenstates change very fast and the adiabaticity is easiest
to break."
"In the case of NH, neutrinos first go through the high"
"resonance. The horizontal lines in Fig. 2 show the high
resonance densities for 30 MeV and 70 MeV neutrinos
for illustration. A resonance occurs where they cross
the supernova density profile. At earlier times, neutrinos
experience only one high resonance, but at later times
multiple high resonances occur due to the low density
region between the front shock and the reverse shock.
The resulting flavor evolutions are shown in Fig. 6 for 30
MeV (left panels) and 70 MeV (right panels) neutrinos
at t = 3 s, (upper panels) t = 5 s (middle panels), and
t = 7 s (lower panels) for model I in the case of NH. The
neutrinos are not affected by collective oscillations in the
inner regions. At t = 3 s, both neutrinos experience only
one adiabatic high resonance transformation around 105"
"km. At t = 5 s, the 30 MeV neutrino goes through three
resonances. The effects of the first and second resonances
mostly cancel each other. In other words, after the second
resonance, ραα(r) come close to their pre-resonance values.
However, the adiabaticity is broken as evidenced by the
presence of the oscillations.4 At t = 5 s, the density is
close but not yet equal to the resonance value for 70 MeV
neutrino in between the front and the reverse shock. This
creates the small bumps in middle right panel. But, other
than that, this neutrino goes through its regular adiabatic
high resonance as it did at t = 3 s. At t = 7 s, 30 MeV
neutrino still goes through three resonances but the first
two resonances now completely cancel each other. The
adiabaticity is also restored. For this neutrino, ραα values
on the surface of the star are almost the same at t = 3
s and at t = 7 s. The 70 MeV neutrino also starts to go
through three resonances at t = 7 s and its adiabaticity
temporarily is broken."
"This example illustrates the general behavior that we
observe in all of our calculations in NH. The arrival of
the shock wave to high MSW resonance region has only
a limited effect on the neutrino survival probabilities.
Instead of one high resonance, neutrinos go through three
high resonances but, the first two resonances mostly cancel
each other. Also the adiabaticity is initially violated but
later restored. See Ref. [40] for a more in-depth discussion
of the effects of the shock wave on the MSW resonances."
"The low MSW resonance lies closer to the surface of
the star, and it is experienced by neutrinos in both NH
and IH. Fig. 2 shows the low resonance density value for
a 45 MeV neutrino for illustration. In IH, its effect can
be seen in Fig. 5 at around 5× 105 km where ρee starts
to increase. We do not see the effect of low resonance in
Fig. 6 because in NH it mainly causes transformations
between νµ and ντ , which already evolved similarly up to
that point. The low resonance is always adiabatic. The
shock wave arrives at this region later than the 9 s mark,
by which time the neutrino luminosity is already low, and
we stop our calculations."
"4 The argument is similar to the one presented above: When the
adiabaticity is partially (but not completely) broken, an oscillation
term appears an in the last line of Eq. (16)."
C. Approximate Degeneracy Between NH and IH
"A degeneracy was reported in Ref. [24] between the
total event counts in NH and IH cases. We find this to
be approximately true. The source of this approximate
degeneracy is easy to understand in light of the above
discussion."
"Since the low resonance is always adiabatic, Eq. (13)
is valid through the surface of the star for IH with only
the definitions of the matter eigenstates changing with
distance. For NH, this is also the case if we assume
that the first and the second high resonances perfectly
cancel each other at later times and ignore the temporary
violations of adiabaticity. Once the neutrinos reach the
vacuum, we have"
"|r1〉 = |ν1〉 |r2〉 = |ν2〉 |r3〉 = |ν3〉 for NH,
|r1〉 = |ν3〉 |r2〉 = |ν1〉 |r3〉 = |ν2〉 for IH."
"Substituting this into Eq. (13), we find that their density
operator is given by"
"ρ̂(r) = ((1− p) ρµµ(R) + p ρee(R)) |ν1〉〈ν1|
+ ρµµ(R)|ν2〉〈ν2| (18)

After the neutrinos leave the star, they travel a long"

should take neutrino decoherence into account, which is
the fact that the mass eigenstates traveling with different
speeds open up a gap between them. For r > rcoh, the
gap becomes larger than their wavepacket size, and they
cease to overlap. After that, the off-diagonal terms of the"

For supernova neutrinos, the coherence length is of the
order of a fraction of a parsec. By the time the neutrinos

sensitive in the energy region which is typically swapped

degeneracy is broken by several factors. This includes the
departure from sharp spectral splits, and the reactions
caused by neutrinos with energy higher than E′"
IV. REACTION RATES
"The flux of neutrinos of type να with energy between
E and E + dE at Earth is given by5 (1/4πd2)ραα(d)dE.
Therefore, the number of a particular kind of reaction per
unit time per target nucleus is equal to"
"λ(t) =
1"
"∫ ∞
Eth"
ραα(d)σ(E)dE. (23)
"Here σ(E) and Eth denote the cross section and the thresh-
old energy of the reaction, respectively. ραα(d) depends
on the post-bounce time t and the neutrino energy E
implicitly. If there are N target nuclei in the detector,
the rate of this particular reaction is given by Nλ(t). For
a detector of mass M , this is equal to"

"In calculating the reaction rates, we use the cross sec-
tions provided in Ref. [18] with necessary interpolations"
"5 This flux involves neutrinos going in all directions, not just the
radial ones. To obtain the flux of only those neutrinos traveling
radially, one should further divide this flux with another factor
of π as shown in Ref. [27]."
"FIG. 7. Calculated reaction rates as functions of post-bounce time for models I-IV. Upper panels show the rates of CC1n, CC2n,
NC1n, and NC2n reactions as indicated in the first panel. Lower panels show the ratio of 1n to 2n reaction rates. The left
panels correspond to NH, and the right panels correspond to IH."
"to our energy bins. The threshold energies of the reactions
are calculated from measured masses and given in Table
I. The density matrix elements ραα(d) are calculated by
numerically evolving Eq. (5) through the relevant density
profile at each second."
"In HALO, the outgoing electron is not detected [65].
For this reason, CC and NC reactions cannot be distin-
guished from each other. But 1n and 2n events can be
discriminated. Neither the detection nor the discrimina-
tion of 1n and 2n events is 100% efficient. But in our
calculations, we assume perfect efficiency."
"Fig. 7 shows the time dependent reaction rates that
we calculate using Eq. (24) per 1 kt detector mass for a
supernova which is 10 kpc away from the Earth. The left
panels correspond to NH and the right panels correspond
to IH. The upper panels show the individual rates of
CC1n, CC2n, NC1n, and NC2n reactions. These reaction
rates are also shown in Table II for NH and in Table III
for IH. Note that the reaction rates we show in the tables
are rounded to integer numbers whereas those plotted in
Fig. 7 are not. The lower panels of Fig. 7 show the ratio
of the total rate of 1n reactions to the total rate of 2n
reactions, i.e.,"
"η(t) =
λCC1n(t) + λNC1n(t)"
"λCC2n + λNC2n(t)
. (25)"
"Here, indices are used to refer to the rates of individual
reactions. This ratio is independent from the detector
size and from the distance of the supernova. If the effects
of the shock wave and the changing character of collective
oscillations are not considered, η would be independent of
time. But even when these effects are taken into account,
our results show that η depends only very weakly on
time. For the models that we consider, we find that η
changes by no more than a few percent with time for both
NH and IH. The most substantial change is observed in
model I in the case of IH where η drops from 10.3 to
9.9, which is about a 4% change. This tells us that the
time dependent features that we consider here, i.e., the
loss of sharpness in spectral splits with the decreasing
neutrino luminosity, and the passage of the shock wave
from the MSW resonance region, are likely to be lost
within the error bars unless the statistics of the experiment
is significantly improved."
"As discussed above, there is a near degeneracy between
NH and IH scenarios. In most cases, NH and IH results
differ at most by a few events per second. But we find
that, in each case, η is slightly larger for IH."
"As we go from model I to model IV, all reaction rates
increase. This is expected because 〈Eνx〉 increases from
model I to model IV. The energetic νµ - ντ neutrinos are"

"converted to νe by collective oscillations in the case of IH
and by the high resonances in the case of NH. But we also
see that η decreases as we go from model I to model IV.

extent with 〈Eνx〉."
V. CONCLUSIONS
"In this paper, we calculated the event rates in a lead-
based detector due to a galactic core-collapse supernova.
We paid particular attention to the time dependence of
the reaction rates due to the flavor evolution of neutri-
nos through time dependent conditions in the supernova.
In particular, we focused on the changing character of
collective neutrino oscillations due to the decreasing neu-
trino luminosity, and the propagation of the shock wave
through the MSW region."
"For this purpose, we formed a one-dimensional super-
nova model by superimposing a parametric shock wave on
a progenitor density distribution which models SN1987A.
We considered four different models in this setting. These
models have the same neutrino luminosities (which is
consistent with SN1987A) but the initial neutrino energy
distributions are different. In models I-III, we kept the
νe and ν̄e distributions fixed while shifting νx distribu-
tions to higher energies. In model IV we used higher
average energies for all flavors, which are far-fetched but
not completely ruled out [53, 66]."
"For all models, we find that the sharpness of spectral
splits decrease with time in the IH case. Since neutrinos
do not go through high MSW resonance, this is the only
source of time dependence in IH. However, we find that
the resulting effect on reaction rates is limited because loss
of sharpness becomes noticeable only when the neutrino
luminosity drops considerably."
"In the case of NH, neutrinos are not affected by collec-
tive oscillations but go though the high MSW resonance.
In this case, the passage of the shock wave through the
high MSW region is the only source of time dependence.
Initially neutrinos experience only one high resonance
but after the shock wave passes through this region, they
start going through three high resonances. We find that
the effects of the first two resonances mostly cancel each
other, and the adiabaticity is only temporarily lost. For
this reason, the resulting effect on the reaction rates is
also limited."
"All reaction rates decrease roughly exponentially as
the neutrino luminosity drops. The ratio of 1n to 2n
event rates is the best parameter to work with because
it is independent of this overall decrease. We find that
this ratio changes slightly with time due to the above-
mentioned effects. In the case of IH, it slightly decreases
with time. In the case of NH, it is initially constant, but
later it changes as the shock wave passes through the high
MSW resonance region. This effect is similar to the one
observed in Ref. [43] for the electron antineutrino signal
in water-Cherenkov detectors in the case of IH. However,
in all the models that we looked at, the change is limited
to a few percent. Therefore, it is likely to be lost within
the error bars, or within the time dependence resulting
the evolution of the proto-neutron star itself."
"The evolution of the proto-neutron star is something
that we intentionally left out in this paper. Our purpose
was to isolate the time dependence resulting from the"
"dynamical flavor evolution of neutrinos outside the proto-
neutron star. We also left out the multiangle nature of
the collective neutrino oscillations. The multiangle effects
delay the appearance of collective effects. They may also
introduce angular decoherence and cause spectral splits
to be less sharp, or even wash them out completely. For
the type of initial spectra that we consider, in which νe
and νµ−ντ distributions cross each other only once, these
effects appear to be minimal [48]. But in fact, the nature
of the multiangle collective oscillations remains to be fully
understood. See, e.g. Refs. [12, 67, 68]. At this point,
we believe that their inclusion is not likely to change the"
main results of this paper.
