ABSTRACT
"Surveys of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) have yielded a fairly complete
catalog of 154 known stars. We have conducted a comprehensive, multiwavelength study of the interstel-
lar/circumstellar environments of WR stars, using the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey (MCELS) im-
ages in the Hα, [O III] , and [S II] lines; Spitzer Space Telescope 8 and 24 µm images; Blanco 4m Telescope Hα
CCD images; and Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) + Parkes Telescope H I data cube of the LMC.
We have also examined whether the WR stars are in OB associations, classified the H II environments of WR
stars, and used this information to qualitatively assess the WR stars’ evolutionary stages. The 30 Dor giant H II
region has active star formation and hosts young massive clusters, thus we have made statistical analyses for 30
Dor and the rest of the LMC both separately and altogether. Due to the presence of massive young clusters, the
WR population in 30 Dor is quite different from that from elsewhere in the LMC. We find small bubbles (<50
pc diameter) around ∼12% of WR stars in the LMC, most of which are WN stars and not in OB associations.
The scarcity of small WR bubbles is discussed. Spectroscopic analyses of abundances are needed to determine
whether the small WR bubbles contain interstellar medium or circumstellar medium. Implications of the statis-
tics of interstellar environments and OB associations around WR stars are discussed. Multiwavelength images
of each LMC WR star are presented."

1. INTRODUCTION
"Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are often surrounded by beautiful
ring-shaped nebulae in Hα images. Since the discovery of
the first three WR ring nebulae, NGC 2359, NGC 6888, and
S308 (Johnson & Hogg 1965), systematic surveys of WR
nebulae have been conducted in our Galaxy (e.g., Chu 1981;
Heckathorn et al. 1982; Chu et al. 1983; Miller & Chu 1993;
Marston et al. 1994a,b; Stock & Barlow 2010) and the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC; e.g., Chu & Lasker 1980; Dopita et
al. 1994). It is found that ring nebulae around WR stars can
have a variety of morphologies and sizes, possibly indicat-
ing different formation mechanisms and evolutionary stages.
To carry out a comprehensive investigation of ring nebulae
around WR stars, it is beneficial to compile a complete in-
ventory of WR stars in a galaxy and use deep nebular line
images to search for associated nebulae."
"It is difficult to achieve completeness in the catalog of WR
stars in our Galaxy because of the heavy extinction along the
Galactic plane. Even the distances of the Galactic WR stars
were uncertain before the Gaia data became available (Gaia
Collaboration et al. 2018). It would thus be difficult to per-"
"form statistical and quantitative analyses on the WR nebulae
in our Galaxy. The LMC, on the other hand, is at a known
50 kpc distance (Pietrzyński et al. 2019) with little internal
and foreground extinction; thus, it is possible to achieve a
more complete inventory of WR stars and carry out a thor-
ough multiwavelength search for associated nebulae."
"An initial search of WR stars in the LMC by Westerlund
& Smith (1964) found 58 objects, and subsequent searches
have increased the number of known LMC WR stars to 80 by
Fehrenbach et al. (1976); 100 by Breysacher (1981); 135 by
Breysacher et al. (1999); and more recently 154 by Neugent
et al. (2018). The latest LMC WR star catalog is likely fairly
complete."
"The search for WR nebulae in the LMC began with Chu &
Lasker (1980) using photographic plates taken with the 0.61
m Curtis Schmidt Telescope. Later, Dopita et al. (1994) used
the Australian National University 2.3 m Telescope with a
spectrograph in the imaging mode, as well as an imager, to
conduct a deeper survey on WR nebulae. Stock & Barlow
(2010) used digitized Hα photographic plates taken with the
1.2 m UK Schmidt Telescope to search for WR nebulae in"

"the LMC. The former two surveys used Hα and [O III] im-
ages, while the latter used only Hα images. Meanwhile, the
Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey (MCELS) has been
conducted with the Curtis Schmidt Telescope and a CCD
camera, providing Hα, [O III], and [S II] images for the en-
tire LMC (Smith, & MCELS Team 1999); furthermore, the
Spitzer Space Telescope has surveyed the LMC (Meixner et
al. 2006) in infrared passbands, and the Australian Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA) has surveyed the H I in the LMC
with high resolution (Kim et al. 2003). Using these new sur-
veys of neutral and ionized gas and the nearly complete cat-
alog of WR stars in the LMC, we are able to, for the first
time, probe the multiphase interstellar environment of WR
stars and investigate interactions between the stars and their
ambient medium."
"This paper reports our survey and analysis of WR nebulae
in the LMC. Section 2 expands upon the expected coevolu-
tion of a WR star and its environment, Section 3 describes
the data and methodology used to conduct this investigation,
Section 4 presents the results, Section 5 discusses the impli-
cations of our results, and Section 6 summarizes this work."
"2. COEVOLUTION OF WR STARS AND THEIR
AMBIENT MEDIUM"
"When WR nebulae were first discovered, neither the evolu-
tionary history of WR stars nor the formation mechanisms of
the nebulae were clearly understood. Over the years, stellar
evolution models have shown that WR stars are just evolved
massive stars, of which some are well beyond the main se-
quence (MS) and some are still burning hydrogen (Langer
2012). The massive stars’ winds during different evolution-
ary stages have become better known. Hydrodynamic simu-
lations of interactions between massive stars’ winds and their
ambient medium have been made (e.g., Garcia-Segura et al.
1996a,b), and their results can be used to guide our search
for WR nebulae. In this section, we first summarize our early
perception of WR nebulae based on data with inadequate res-
olutions and our incomplete knowledge of stellar evolution
and stellar wind interaction. The misunderstandings should
be superseded by our current understanding based on numer-
ical simulations made with improved knowledge of stellar
evolution and its associated stellar wind properties."
2.1. Previous Perception
"WR stars are massive stars characterized by broad emis-
sion lines in their spectra, indicating the presence of fast stel-
lar winds. Among massive stars, WR stars’ winds have the
highest mechanical luminosities. The powerful WR winds
sweep up the ambient medium to form shell structures that
appear as “arcs” or “rings” in Hα images and are called “ring
nebulae.”"
"WR nebula surveys used only morphological information
in Hα images to identify ring nebulae. More often than not, a"
"WR star is projected near a curved nebular filament, and the
physical relationship between the WR star and the nebular
feature is tantalizing but not confidently established. Despite
the uncertainty, such objects were still identified as WR ring
nebulae. Sometimes, a round H II region with a WR star in
its central region is also identified as a ring nebula. Thus,
WR nebulae became a heterogeneous class of objects."
"To investigate the nature of WR ring nebulae, Chu (1981)
incorporated internal kinematic properties of the WR nebulae
and classified WR ring nebulae into three categories, based
on the kinematics and morphologies of the nebulae:"
"• W-type nebulae are wind-blown bubbles whose dy-
namic ages are smaller than the lifetime of a WR phase
to ensure that the WR winds are responsible for the for-
mation of the bubbles. Such a ring nebula shows a fine
filamentary shell around the central star, which is usu-
ally projected near the center or toward the brightest
part of the nebula."
"• E-type nebulae consist of stellar ejecta. The E-type
nebulae were introduced to have chaotic and irregu-
lar expansions and clumpy morphologies. However,
it was later realized that the chaotic expansion re-
ported for M1-67 and RCW 58 (Chu & Treffers 1981;
Chu 1982a) was an artifact caused by the large en-
trance apertures of the Fabry-Perot scanning obser-
vations, whereas long-slit high-dispersion spectra ac-
tually show uniform expansion pattern despite the
large density fluctuations (Solf & Carsenty 1982; Chu
1988). Chemical abundance observations of the E-type
WR nebulae show enrichment of nitrogen (e.g., Este-
ban et al. 1991), confirming that they consist of ejected
stellar material, which is called circumstellar medium
(CSM)."
"• R-type nebulae are characterized as “radiatively ex-
cited H II regions,"" consisting of interstellar medium
(ISM). Ra denotes amorphous H II regions, while Rs
denotes shell nebulae whose dynamic ages are much
larger than the lifetime of the WR phase."
"When deeper and higher-resolution images are available,
it becomes clear that the above classification is too primitive.
A more sophisticated approach is needed. The perception of
WR nebulae in this subsection should be superseded by the
understanding outlined in the next subsection."
2.2. Current Understanding
"The current knowledge of WR nebulae derives from a bet-
ter understanding of stellar evolution. We now know that WR
stars evolve from MS O stars through either the luminous
blue variable (LBV) or red supergiant (RSG) phase (Langer
2012). Garcia-Segura et al. (1996a,b) showed for the first"
"time a hydrodynamic model of the gaseous environment co-
evolving with the central star from the MS phase to the WR
phase. Similar hydrodynamic calculations have been carried
out by Dwarkadas (2007), Toalá & Arthur (2011), and van
Marle & Keppens (2012), all of which have produced quali-
tatively similar results, as described below."
"The WR stars that evolve from the MS through the LBV
phase are the most massive, e.g., & 60 M�, while those that
evolve from MS via the RSG phase are less massive, e.g., ∼
35 M�. In the MS phase, massive stars lose mass at rates of
∼ 10−6 M� yr−1 in the form of fast stellar winds with termi-
nal velocities of ∼2000–3000 km s−1 (Prinja et al. 1990; Puls
et al. 1996). During this stage, the MS stellar wind sweeps
up the ambient ISM to form an interstellar bubble (Weaver et
al. 1977). As a massive star evolves off the MS and into the
LBV or RSG phase, the mass loss takes place in the form of
copious slow winds, of which the wind velocities are ∼10–
50 km s−1 and mass-loss rates ∼ 10−4 M� yr−1 (van Loon
et al. 2005). The stellar material lost in this wind expands
slowly away from the star, forming a small circumstellar neb-
ula (consisting of CSM) inside the cavity of the interstellar
bubble formed previously when the star was in the MS stage."
"When the star enters a WR phase, the stellar wind velocity
and mass-loss rate increase considerably, with terminal ve-
locities of ∼1000–3000 km s−1 and mass-loss rates of ∼ 10−5
M� yr−1 (Nugis & Lamers 2000). This fast WR wind sweeps
up the slowly expanding CSM into a shell, called a circum-
stellar bubble. Therefore, we expect to see a nested shell
structure consisting of a small circumstellar bubble within a
larger interstellar bubble around the WR star."
"If a WR star has a high velocity with respect to the ambi-
ent ISM, either ejected from a cluster or kicked by the super-
nova explosion of a binary companion, it is a runaway star.
For a WR star moving in the ISM, an interstellar bow shock
will form in the direction of the star’s trajectory. However,
if a WR star is surrounded by CSM, which travels together
with the WR star, a circumstellar bubble can still form, but
the leading edge will be compressed by the ISM and become
sharper, denser, and brighter, as seen in the circumstellar bub-
ble around the LBV star S119 (Danforth & Chu 2001)."
"We have also come to understand that whether a WR star is
an isolated single star or located in a cluster environment as
a member of an OB association affects the evolution of shell
nebulae around the WR star. In the presence of other mas-
sive stars, the stellar winds and supernova explosions from
all stars collectively form a large shell, called a superbubble
(McCray & Kafatos 1987). The formation of a circumstel-
lar WR bubble inside a superbubble is trickier than inside a
small interstellar bubble because of possible impacts of stel-
lar winds and supernova explosions from neighboring mas-
sive stars."
"The largest interstellar structures in a galaxy are supergiant
shells (SGSs) whose sizes can approach 1000 pc. The for-
mation of such large shells require multiple generations of
star formation to provide the energy. If a WR star is in the
low-density interior of an SGS, it may not have a detectable
interstellar bubble, although its circumstellar bubble should
still be present."
"With the known characteristics of the different stages in
the evolution of WR stars, we expect to see circumstellar
bubbles, interstellar bubbles, superbubbles, and SGSs around
WR stars. However, to discern between circumstellar bub-
bles and interstellar bubbles, observations of nebular abun-
dances are needed, but they are not available to us. Thus,
we can only use morphological information to search for
small bubbles centered on individual WR stars, superbubbles
around WR stars and their host OB associations, and SGSs
on the largest scales."
3. DATA AND METHODOLOGY
"We have used multiwavelength images to examine the ion-
ized and neutral gaseous environments of the LMC WR stars.
We used optical emission-line images to examine the distri-
bution and excitation of ionized gas, the H I 21 cm line data
cube to investigate the distribution and kinematics of neutral
atomic gas, 8 µm images to identify the partially dissociated
regions, and 24 µm images to locate emission from heated
dust."
3.1. Data Used
"MCELS1 is an emission-line survey of the Magellanic
Clouds (Smith, & MCELS Team 1999). The survey used
the Curtis Schmidt Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American
Observatory (CTIO) and a CCD camera to take images in the
Hα, [O III] λ5007, and [S II] λλ6716, 6731 bands, as well
as two continuum bands centered at λ6850 and λ5130. In
this paper, we only used the emission-line images without
continuum subtraction. The Hα images show the overall dis-
tribution of ionized gas; the [O III] images, compared with
the Hα images, reveal the excitation of ionized gas; and the
[S II] images diagnose shocks and ionization fronts."
"A higher-resolution Hα survey of the Magellanic Clouds
has been conducted with the MOSAIC II camera on the
Blanco 4m Telescope at CTIO; this survey has been called
MCELS2 (PI: You-Hua Chu). The MOSAIC II camera,
which is a mosaic of eight SITe 4096 × 2048 CCDs, has
a pixel size of 0.′′27 × 0.′′27 and a field-of-view of 36′ × 36′.
An Hα filter with 80 Å width was used to record images. In
celebration of the 30-year anniversary of the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST), a public release of HST Hα image of NGC
2020 became available, and this image is used for WR 71."
"The H I data cube was constructed by Kim et al. (2003)
using the ATCA survey data in conjunction with single-dish"
"observations from the Parkes Telescope. This data cube cov-
ers 11.1◦×12.4◦ of the sky with an angular resolution of 1.′0
and a pixel size of 20′′. The heliocentric velocity coverage,
−33 to +627 km s−1, is centered at ∼300 km s−1, the bulk ra-
dial velocity of the LMC. We use the zeroth moment map to
present the H I column densities and position-velocity plots
to show the kinematic structures of H I gas."
"The Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Array Camera
(IRAC; Fazio et al. 2004) 8 µm images are used to identify
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) associated with
partially dissociated regions, and the Multiband Imaging
Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS; Rieke et al. 2004) 24 µm im-
ages to reveal emission from heated dust. The Spitzer im-
ages of the LMC were from the Legacy Program Surveying
the Agents of a Galaxy’s Evolution (SAGE; Meixner et al.
2006)."
3.2. Methodology
"We have used our understanding of the coevolution of WR
stars in their ambient medium, as detailed in Section 2.2, to
guide our search for nebular shells around WR stars. More
specifically, to identify wind-blown bubbles, we search for
small shells less than ∼50 pc in diameter with the WR star
in a preferred location indicating that wind-ISM/CSM inter-
action is responsible for forming the shell. For example, the
WR star should be either near the center of a uniform shell
or closer to the brighter part of a nonuniform shell; if the
structure is a bow-shock-like arc, then the WR star should be
near the arc’s center of curvature. We identify superbubbles
by their large shell sizes, much larger than 50 pc in diameter,
or by a central cluster or OB association. For example, the
shell around the R136 cluster measures 37.5 pc × 21 pc in
size yet we denote it as a superbubble because of its promi-
nent central cluster. On still a larger scale, we identify SGSs
that are greater than ∼500 pc in diameter to contextualize the
extended star formation history in the WR star’s large-scale
environment."
"To search for nebular shells around WR stars, we first ex-
amined the MCELS1 Hα images to obtain a census of ion-
ized gas around the WR stars. We noted the nebular mor-
phology, specifically filaments, arcs, and shell structure in the
vicinity of the star. We measured and recorded the dimen-
sions of shell-like features centered on or surrounding the
star. In cases where there were no shells, we also noted any
emission nebulae around the star. We further used MCELS2
Hα images for a high-resolution view of the filamentary
structures in the WR nebula."
"To corroborate our findings on the WR nebulae from the
Hα images, we examined MCELS1 [O III] and [S II] images
to gain insight into the nebular excitation and physical condi-
tions. For early WR stars, i.e., high stellar effective temper-
atures, we expect to see high [O III] λ5007/Hα ratios; thus,"
"bubbles of stars with early spectral types stand out against the
ambient medium in the [O III] images better than in the Hα
images. Conversely, for late WR stars, the [O III] λ5007/Hα
ratios are low, and the nebulae are usually not detected in
[O III] images."
"Beyond examining optical images of ionized gas around
WR stars, we also extracted the H I zeroth moment map and
position-velocity plots for north-south and east-west strips of
20′′ width in order to show the H I column density distri-
bution and the kinematics of the H I gas, respectively. A
low-intensity region in the zeroth moment map indicates a
depression in the H I column density. A bow-shaped veloc-
ity split in a position-velocity plot implies an expanding shell
structure."
"The dust emissions highlighted by Spitzer’s IRAC 8 µm
and MIPS 24 µm images were used to gain a more compre-
hensive understanding of the physical conditions of the WR
star’s interstellar and circumstellar environments. Some very
late-type WR stars with dusty envelopes are also very bright
in the 24 µm band."
"To see whether a WR star is a member of an OB association
(Lucke & Hodge 1970), we compared the WR star’s location
with the boundaries of OB associations provided in the find-
ing charts in P. Lucke’s Ph.D. thesis. WR stars not within
the boundaries of an OB association but are within 100 pc
to an OB association are also noted, with single parentheses
for within 50 pc and double parentheses for 50–100 pc from
the center of the OB association. Our results are more quan-
titative and complete than the compilation by Neugent et al.
(2018), who have missed a few associations, such as WR 38
and 39 in LH45, WR 43 in LH 50, WR 53 in LH 62, and WR
55 in LH 61. We record this information in case the WR star
is a runaway star from the OB association."
"We also identify the H II regions around the WR stars in
the Davies et al. (1976) and Henize (1956) H II region cata-
logs. We further classify their H II regions in three morpho-
logical classes. Class 1 refers to a bright, amorphous H II
region without filamentary or shell structures. Class 2 in-
dicates that the H II region has a large shell structure, e.g.,
a superbubble, and it is further divided into two subclasses,
with 2a referring to a highly nonuniform shell with the ion-
izing stars/cluster closer to the brightest rim of the shell and
2b referring to a relatively uniform shell around the ionizing
stars/cluster. Lastly, Class 3 indicates a very low-density en-
vironment of the WR star. It is further divided into three sub-
classes: with 3a indicating faint but detectable diffuse emis-
sion in the vicinity of the star, 3b indicating the low-density
interior of a large shell, and 3c reflecting no detectable dif-
fuse emission in a large-scale diffuse field."

"In the statistical analysis of WR stars and their associated
nebular environments, the 30 Doradus (30 Dor) region needs
special consideration because of its extreme properties. 30
Dor is an archetypical giant H II region where star forma-
tion is characterized as “starburst” and internal gas dynam-
ics is violent. Early low-resolution radio images of 30 Dor
show three peaks in 30 Dor (Le Marne 1968): the brightest
peak, 30 Dor A (N157A), corresponds to roughly the 100 pc
radius region centered on the R136 cluster, or OB associa-
tion LH 100; the second brightest peak, 30 Dor B (N157B),
corresponds to the H II region around LH 99 and contains a
supernova remnant with a pulsar wind nebula (Wang et al.
2001); and the third peak, 30 Dor C (N157C), corresponds
to the superbubble around LH 90. These three components
are encompassed in DEM L263 (Davies et al. 1976) or N157
(Henize 1956), and within this region exist 43 known WR
stars, almost 30% of the whole WR population in the LMC.
In the following statistical analyses, we will treat 30 Dor and
the rest of the LMC separately, as well as together for the
entire LMC. These results will be compared and discussed in
the next section."
"Of all the variously sized shells encompassing the WR
stars, small bubbles are the most relevant to each individual
star as the WR wind may be directly responsible for forming
the bubble. Thus, we have compiled all small bubbles from
Table 1 into Table 2 to examine the statistics of the bubble
sizes and WR spectral types. The small bubble around WR
97 in 30 Dor is listed in Table 2 but separated by a horizontal
line at the bottom. The Hα images of the 18 small bubbles
are shown in Figure 3. We have compiled all superbubbles
outside and inside 30 Dor from Table 1 into Tables 3 and 4,
respectively, to probe the relationship between WR stars, OB
associations, and superbubbles. Images of example super-
bubbles are shown in Figure 4."
"As a reference for the tendency of WR stars’ locations in
OB associations, we have compiled in Table 5 numbers of
WR stars for different spectral types and for the entire LMC,
the LMC excluding 30 Dor, and 30 Dor, respectively. To
obtain the statistical significance, we combine spectral types
into subgroups: WN2-4 (early WN), WN5-6 (mid WN),"
"WN7-L (late WN), WC4, WC5-6, WO3-4, and “other” for
the small number of remaining objects. The LMC WR star
catalog of Neugent et al. (2018) has 154 entries, but two en-
tries contain double WR stars and thus the total number of
stars in Table 5 is 156. The percentage of WR stars that are
in LH OB associations is given in parentheses after the num-
bers of WR stars in OB associations. It is quite clear that
the WR population in the LMC is dominated by WN stars,
∼80%, inside or ouside 30 Dor alike. Within the WN popu-
lation, there exist more early-type than late-type objects for
the entire LMC; however, the WN population differs signifi-
cantly inside and outside 30 Dor. While outside 30 Dor 73%
of WN stars are of WN2-4 types and 9% are WN5-6, in-
side 30 Dor, only 19% of WN stars are WN2-4 and 62% are
WN5-6. Overall, ∼50% of the WR stars are in OB asso-
ciations; however, WN5-6 and WC stars are more likely to
be in OB associations than WN2-4 and WN7-L. Outside 30
Dor, WC stars have the highest percentage to be in OB asso-
ciations, while inside 30 Dor, WN5-6 stars have the highest
percentage to be in OB associations."
"Table 6 presents the statistics of the WR star population
in the LMC and the fraction of each spectral type with bub-
bles/superbubbles. In this table, column 1 gives the spectral
type grouping, column 2 presents the number (and percent-
age) of WR stars with bubbles, column 3 presents the num-
ber of WR stars with bubbles in OB associations, column 4
presents the number (and percentage) of WR stars in super-
bubbles, and column 5 presents the number of WR stars with
superbubbles in OB associations for all WR stars in the LMC;
columns 6-9 present the same information as columns 2-5 for
all WR stars in the LMC excluding 30 Dor, respectively; col-
umn 10 presents the number (and percentage) of WR stars in
superbubbles in 30 Dor and column 11 presents the number
of 30 Dor WR stars in superbubbles in OB associations."
"In 30 Dor, few small bubbles are identified: WR 97
is surrounded by a small bubble-like structure, while WR
118/119/120 are projected on the southern rim of a triangular
shell structure that could be connected to the central super-
bubble around the R136 cluster, and thus, the bubble nature
of the triangular shell is highly uncertain. Several large shell
structures in 30 Dor can be identified as superbubbles (Chu
& Kennicutt 1994), and WR stars projected within superbub-
bles in 30 Dor are compiled in Table 4, along with the dimen-
sions of the superbubble and host OB associations. Owing to
the scarcity of small WR bubbles in 30 Dor, we only give
statistics of WR stars in superbubbles in 30 Dor in Table 6."
"We define the H II morphology classes to represent the evo-
lutionary stages of the ISM surrounding the WR stars. Thus,
the correlation between the spectral types and the H II mor-
phology classes may be used to diagnose the WR star’s pro-
gression in its evolution. We have tallied the numbers of WR
stars for different spectral types in H II regions of different"
"morphological classes in Table 7. The results are reported
separately for 30 Dor and the LMC excluding 30 Dor, as well
as the entire LMC."
5. DISCUSSION
"Below we first examine the WR star population in the
LMC, using their stellar and interstellar environments to as-
sess their properties, then correlate their bubbles and super-
bubbles with their spectral types to further probe the nature
of the WR spectral types. Finally, we note the impact of WR
nebulae on the supernova remnants that are formed after the
supernova explosions."
"5.1. WR Star Population in the LMC
5.1.1. 30 Dor versus the Rest of the LMC"
"The distribution of WR stars in the LMC is by no means
uniform. Most conspicuously, about 30% of the WR stars in
the LMC are concentrated in the 30 Dor giant H II region. As
shown in Table 5, the largest difference in the WR star popu-
lation inside 30 Dor and outside 30 Dor is in the number ra-
tio of WN2-4 to WN5-6 stars, roughly 1:3 in 30 Dor and 8:1
in the rest of the LMC. This reversal in the number ratio of
WN2-4 to WN5-6 stars is caused by 30 Dor’s young age and
massive clusters, where the most massive bins of the initial
mass function can be stochastically populated. The evolution
of massive stars has been reviewed by Langer (2012), whose
Figure 10 shows that the most massive stars evolve into late-
type WN stars even during the core hydrogen-burning stage.
The large number of WN5-6 stars in 30 Dor coexist with
the numerous very massive O2-3 stars (Crowther et al. 2010,
2016), highly suggestive that these WN stars are very mas-
sive hydrogen-burning stars, which have been shown to be
very luminous and still have hydrogen on their surface (de
Koter et al. 1997; Massey & Hunter 1998)."
5.1.2. WR Stars and OB Associations
"The starburst in 30 Dor has produced massive star clusters
or OB associations, namely, LH 100 (R136 cluster) in 30 Dor
A (Hunter et al. 1995; Massey & Hunter 1998), LH 99 in 30
Dor B (Chu 1997), and LH 90 in 30 Dor C (Lortet & Testor
1984; Testor et al. 1993). It is thus not surprising that 70%
of the WR stars in 30 Dor are in OB associations. Among
different types of WR stars in 30 Dor, WN5-6 has a higher
percentage of being in OB associations than WN2-4, WN7-
L, and WC. The R136 cluster is mostly responsible for this
high percentage of WN5-6 stars in OB associations in 30 Dor,
and these WN5-6 stars are most likely massive hydrogen-
burning stars."
"In contrast, only 45% of WR stars outside 30 Dor are in
OB associations (see Table 5). Interestingly, about 87% of
the WC stars outside 30 Dor are in OB associations. In 30
Dor, four out of seven WC stars are in OB associations, cor-
responding to 57%; however, this is small number statistics."
"Furthermore, two WC stars in 30 Dor are within 50 pc from
OB associations and could be associated; thus, we do not
think the percentage of WC stars in OB associations differs
much between 30 Dor and outside 30 Dor."
5.1.3. WR Stars and Surrounding Ionized ISM
"Massive stars inject energy into the ambient ISM via UV
radiation and fast stellar winds during their lifetime and su-
pernova explosions at the end. The energy feedback is ex-
pected to produce an amorphous H II region when the mas-
sive stars are very young. Gradually, the fast stellar winds of
massive stars sweep up the H II region into a shell structure
called a bubble (for an isolated massive star) or superbubble
(for OB association). Eventually, the shell structure dissi-
pates into the ISM, leaving behind a low-density ISM. These
three stages correspond to the three morphological classes of
H II environments defined in Section 3.2, with class 1 being
the youngest and class 3 being the most evolved stage."
"Table 7 shows that in 30 Dor, 15% (7/46) of WR stars are
superposed on dense ionized gas (class 1), over 72% (33/46)
of WR stars are associated with superbubbles or shell-like
structures (class 2), and 13% (6/46) of WR stars in the out-
skirts of 30 Dor are superposed on diffuse nebulosity with
low surface brightness (class 3). Among the 33 WR stars in
class 2 H II regions, 29 are inside superbubbles, 3 are pro-
jected on the southern rim of the superbubble Shell 5, and 1
is inside a faint shell structure. Twenty-eight of the 29 WR
stars in superbubbles are in the two major OB associations
(LH 90 and LH 100) that are both surrounded by superbub-
bles."
"Outside 30 Dor, 5% (6/110) WR stars are associated with
H II class 1, 36% (40/110) are in superbubbles, and 58%
(64/110) are in a very tenuous medium with density lower
than 1 H-atom cm−3. It is interesting to note that WN2-4 and
WN7-L have the highest percentages associated with H II
class 3, the most evolved state. Based on the massive star
evolution summarized in Figure 10 of Langer (2012), we sug-
gest that these WN2-4 stars in a very tenuous medium have
progenitors with 20–30 M� initial masses, and that these
WN7-L stars are the massive helium-burning ones whose
progenitors have ≥ 50M� initial masses. Note, however, that
this conclusion can change if stellar rotation, close binary
evolution, and magnetic fields are considered in models of
massive star evolution (Meynet et al. 2017)."
"5.2. WR Bubbles: Observation versus Expectation
5.2.1. Too Few WR Bubbles are Detected"
"According to our current understanding of nebulae around
WR stars, as detailed in Section 2.2, we may expect every
WR star to be surrounded by a small circumstellar bubble
and enclosed by a larger interstellar bubble. However, only
six WR stars (WR 2, 4, 17, 52, 61, 154) are inside nested"
WR2 (WN2) WR4 (WN3+O6V) WR12 (WC4)
WR14 (O2If*/WN5) WR17 (WN3) WR19 (WN7h)
WR21 (WN3/O3) WR25 (WC4) WR29 (WN3)
"Figure 3. 4m MOSAIC Hα images of small bubbles around WR stars in the LMC. The field of view of each panel is 4’×4’. The WR star is at
the center of the panel except WR 12, which is marked by a red cross."
"small and large shells, which could be candidates for circum-
stellar and interstellar bubbles. In fact, only 12% of WR stars
are surrounded by small bubbles and only a small fraction of
these bubbles have abundance observations to confirm that
they are in fact circumstellar bubbles."
"The scarcity of small bubbles observed around WR stars
needs explanation. It is possible that a close binary compan-
ion may perturb and redirect the mass outflow of the WR"
"star’s progenitor, prohibiting the formation of a circumstel-
lar bubble. However, ∼24% of LMC WR stars with small
bubbles are binary, and among all LMC WR stars, ∼22% are
binary, not too different from that for WR stars with small
bubbles, suggesting that binarity may not be a main factor in
prohibiting the formation of circumstellar bubbles."
"A more plausible cause for the nondetection of circumstel-
lar bubbles may be in its evolution. It is conceivable that"
WR52 (B3I+WN5) WR54 (WN7h) WR61 (WN3+O7.5)
WR71 (WN3+OB) WR75 (WN3) WR76 (WN4h)
WR79 (WN3) WR97 (WN3) WR154 (WN3)
"Figure 3. (cont.) 4m MOSAIC Hα images of small bubbles around WR stars in the LMC. The field of view of each panel is 4’×4’. The WR
star is at the center of the panel except WR12, which is marked by a red cross."
"as a circumstellar bubble expands, its density decreases and
its emission measure rapidly drops below the detection limit.
(Emission measure ≡ n2L, where n is the electron density
and L is the emitting path length). The maximum emission
measure of a shell is along the path length tangent to the
shell’s inner rim. For a uniform shell with mass M, radius R,
and fractional shell thickness ∆R/R, the maximum emission
measure will be n2L = 32−1/2π−2R−5(∆R/R)−3/2(M/mH)2,"
"where mH is the mass of a hydrogen atom. Using observer-
friendly units, the emission measure can be expressed in units
of cm−6 pc as n2L ≈ 30R−5(∆R/R)−3/2M2, where n is in units
of cm−3, L in parsecs, R in parsecs, and M in M�."
"It is evident that as the shell expands, the density drops and
the maximum emission measure of the shell will decrease
rapidly in proportion to R−5. As shown in Figure 5, for a
10 M� shell with ∆R/R = 0.05, the maximum emission mea-"
"Figure 4. 4m MOSAIC Hα images of example superbubbles around WR stars in the LMC. The field of view of each panel is 15’×15’. The
WR stars are marked by red crosses."
"sure drops below a detection limit of 10 cm−6 pc at a radius of
∼8 pc. Therefore, we do not expect to detect a circumstellar
bubble around every WR star."
"The invisible interstellar bubbles were a puzzle until Nazé
et al. (2003) showed that interstellar bubbles blown by MS
O stars expand slowly, with expansion velocities of only 15–
20 km s−1, producing very weak shocks and compression.
Without a large density jump, the interstellar bubble cannot
stand out against the background, and the bubble cannot be
morphologically identified in direct images. Therefore, in-
terstellar bubbles formed by MS stars are not expected to be
seen around WR stars unless the WR star has gone through
an RSG phase when the ambient ionized interstellar gas re-
combines and cools. The isothermal sound velocity of neu-
tral H I gas at 100 K is ∼1 km s−1, and an interstellar bubble
expanding at 15-20 km s−1 would generate strong shocks
and compression, causing a large density jump. Such an in-
terstellar bubble will become visible in Hα when the WR
phase starts, and the bubble and ambient ISM become pho-
toionized. Whether an interstellar bubble is visible around a
WR star depends a lot on the evolutionary path and physical
conditions of the ambient ISM."
5.2.2. Circumstellar versus Interstellar Bubbles
"The most definitive diagnostic of a circumstellar bubble is
the N/O abundance ratio (e.g., Esteban et al. 1991). Of the
small WR bubbles identified, abundance observations have
been made for only three–WR 2, 12, and 19–and only the
bubble around WR 19 shows high N/O ratio confirming its
circumstellar bubble nature (Garnett & Chu 1994; Stock et
al. 2011). The small nebula near WR 47 (BAT99-38) was
also observed by Stock et al. (2011); however, this small neb-
ula consists of bright-rimmed Bok globules with embedded
star formation (Chu et al. 2005) and not a WR nebula, as de-
scribed in more detail in the Appendix."
"In Section 5.2.1 we have shown that circumstellar bubbles
expand and fade below the detection limit when the bubble
size is greater than ∼20 pc. The smallest WR bubbles are
thus more likely to consist of CSM; however, WR 2 and WR
19 have bubbles of similarly small sizes but only the latter
shows enhanced N/O ratio. Future spectroscopic observa-
tions of the small WR bubbles are needed to determine un-
ambiguously whether they consist of CSM."
5.2.3. Correlation with Stellar Properties and Environments
"The statistics of small WR bubbles is summarized in Table
6. About 67% of the small bubbles are found around WN2-
4 stars, and more strikingly, none of these WN2-4 stars are
in OB associations. If all massive stars are born in clusters
or OB associations, the absence of OB associations around
these WN2-4 stars with small bubbles suggests that the par-
ent OB associations have dissolved after losing the more"
"massive stars in supernova explosions and that these WN2-
4 stars must have lower initial masses, ∼25 M�. Among
WN2-4 stars in superbubbles, only ∼50% are in OB associ-
ations. This superbubble statistic for WN2-4 stars might be
caused by two possible evolutionary paths, with the ones in
OB associations more massive than those not in OB associa-
tions."
"In contrast, two WC4 stars are in small bubbles, and both
are in OB associations. This may look like small number
statistics, but all 12 WC stars in superbubbles are in OB as-
sociations as well. The implication of “WC stars in bubbles
and superbubbles are all in OB associations” is intriguing but
not clear."
"5.3. Preexisting Environmental Conditions of Supernova
Remnants"
"Massive as they are, WR stars may explode as core-
collapse supernovae near the end of their evolution. We have
shown through this survey of bubbles around WR stars that
circumstellar bubbles can be observed only at a young age,
and as they expand, the density drops and the bubble fades
to oblivion. While the interstellar and circumstellar bubbles
are not always detected, their shell densities are still above
those of the diffuse ISM. Thus, when the central star even-
tually explodes as a supernova, the supernova ejecta quickly
expands in the low-density bubble interior until it hits the cir-
cumstellar or interstellar bubble shell. This is called cavity
explosion. Supernova remnants formed through cavity ex-
plosion include N132D and N63A (Hughes 1987; Hughes et
al. 1998), and they are characterized by their large size and
high X-ray luminosity."
6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
"We have conducted a multiwavelength survey of ISM and
CSM around WR stars in the LMC. The latest LMC WR cat-
alog by Neugent et al. (2018) contains 154 entries and should
be fairly complete. A number of survey data sets are avail-
able for us to probe the ionized and neutral medium around
the WR stars: the MCELS images in the Hα, [O III] , and
[S II] lines; Blanco 4m Telescope MOSAIC images in the
Hα line; Spitzer Space Telescope 8 and 24 µm images; and
ATCA + Parkes Telescope H I 21 cm line data cube of the
LMC."
"As a massive star evolves from the MS to WR phase, its
fast MS wind turns into a slow RSG or LBV wind and then
a fast WR wind. The interactions between these winds and
the ambient medium should form a circumstellar bubble in-
side an interstellar bubble (Garcia-Segura et al. 1996a,b). We
expect the interstellar and circumstellar bubbles to be small,
<50 pc in size. Our search finds small bubbles around ∼12%
of WR stars in the LMC, and around ∼15% of WR stars in
the LMC but outside 30 Dor. Most of these small bubbles"

"are around WN stars and most of them are not in OB asso-
ciations. Only the small bubble around WR 19 has a high
N/O abundance ratio to confirm its circumstellar bubble na-
ture. The scarcity of small bubbles can be caused by several
factors. As a bubble expands, its surface brightness drops in
proportion to (radius)−5 and fades below the detection limit
within a short time. Furthermore, it has been observed that
interstellar bubbles expand at 15–20 km s−1, which cannot
produce strong compression for the bubble shell to stand out
against the background; thus, interstellar bubbles can be di-
agnosed kinematically but not morphologically (Nazé et al.
2003)."
"WR stars and nearby massive stars can jointly blow a su-
perbubble with their fast stellar winds and supernova explo-
sions. In 30 Dor, 63% of its 46 WR stars are in superbubbles,
and 28 of the 29 WR stars in superbubbles are also in OB
associations. Outside 30 Dor, only 33% of the 110 WR stars
are in superbubbles; about two-thirds of these WR stars in
superbubbles are also in OB associations. The contrasting
statistics is caused by the prominent starburst in 30 Dor that
produced the massive OB association LH 90 in 30 Dor C and
more impressively the super star cluster R136 (LH 100) in
the central superbubble of 30 Dor A. While both inside and
outside 30 Dor WN stars contribute to ∼80% of the WR pop-
ulation, the number ratio of WN2-4 to WN5-6 stars is 1:3 in
30 Dor and 8:1 outside 30 Dor. The dominant WN4-5 stars
in 30 Dor are probably massive H-burning stars."
"We have also classified the H II environments of WR stars
into three categories: class 1 for bright amorphous H II re-
gions; class 2 for shell H II regions, such as superbubbles;
and class 3 for low-density diffuse medium. These three
classes correspond to a progression in the dynamical disper-
sal of ISM around massive stars. Inside 30 Dor, the distri-
bution of WR stars in classes 1-3 is 15%, 72%, and 13%,
respectively. The stars in class 3 H II environments are in the"
"outskirts of 30 Dor. Outside 30 Dor, the distribution of WR
stars in classes 1–3 is 5%, 36%, and 58%, respectively. The
contrast between 30 Dor and elsewhere reflects the age and
mass differences in the WR star population. For example,
among the 65 WN2-4 stars outside 30 Dor, about 68% are
not in OB associations and 63% are in class 3 H II environ-
ments. The WN2-4 stars not in OB associations and in class 3
H II environments are most likely He-burning WR stars from
progenitors with initial masses below ∼30 M�."
"Finally, spectroscopic analyses of abundances are needed
to determine whether the small WR bubbles contain ISM or
CSM. It is important to determine the physical properties and
nature of small WR bubbles, as they will define how the fu-
ture supernova remnants develop."

APPENDIX
"In this appendix, the nomenclature for OB associations, H I
and H II features are abbreviated as the following:"
"LHn – OB association from Lucke & Hodge (1970),
Nn – LHα 120-Nn H II region from Henize (1956),
DEM Ln – LMC H II region from Davies et al. (1976),
H II SGS LMC-n – ionized SGS identified from Hα"
"images by Meaburn (1980),
H I GS n – H I giant shell from Kim et al. (1999), and
H I SGS n – H I SGS from Kim et al. (1999)."
"WR1 is in a field without any nebulosity in the vicinity or
any identifiable large shell structure."
"WR2 is surrounded by a small, incomplete shell with di-
mensions 0.′4 × 0.′3 on the northern rim of a larger 3.′2 ×
2.′2 shell, which is likely a superbubble blown collectively
by WR2 and other massive stars. The small shell was first
reported by Pakull (1991) to be highly ionized, and its abun-
dance was observed by Garnett & Chu (1994). It was later
shown that both the small and large shells exhibit He II λ4686
emission (Nazé et al. 2003). This small shell has an expan-
sion velocity of ∼16 km s−1 (Chu et al. 1999). On a larger
scale, these features are projected on the northwestern rim
of H II SGS LMC-7 (Meaburn 1980). There is a known su-
pernova remnant, MCELS J0449-6921 (Maggi et al. 2016),
centered ∼1.′5 to the northwest of WR2, and it is best seen in
the [S II] image. WR2 is more than 100 pc from LH1, thus
not likely a member of this OB association."
"WR3 is located in a field with a network of faint Hα fil-
aments without obvious shell structure. In the 8 µm and 24
µm images, there is a long, thin filament extending from the
eastern vicinity to 1.′6 north of the star; however, it is uncer-
tain whether this filament is physically associated with WR3.
The background H I gas shows two radial velocity compo-
nents at 282 and 295 km s−1, which may indicate a large-
scale expanding structure, but no H I giant shells have been
identified. The relationship between the gas kinematics and
the WR star is unclear."
"WR4 is surrounded by a 0.′6 shell on the eastern rim of
a 4.′3 × 4′ shell extending from the luminous H II region
DEM L10 around the OB association LH2. The small shell
is best seen in the 24 µm image. WR4 is inside H I GS 9, as
corroborated by the split velocity components in the H I. The
WR star is projected at ∼80 pc from LH2, thus not likely a
member of this OB association. Details of this object have
been reported by Gvaramadze et al. (2014)."
"WR5 is in a complex network of faint Hα filaments lo-
cated on the northern rim of H II SGS LMC-7, and some
filaments appear to form a large shell measuring 18′ × 12′
with its major axis oriented along the NE-SW direction. Nei-"
"ther the shell nature nor the physical association between the
star and the shell is certain. WR5 is also projected inside H I
GS 9. This H I shell is more extended than the Hα shell in
the southeast direction. The star is ∼90 pc from LH5, thus
not likely a member of this OB association."
"WR6 is superposed on diffuse Hα emission in the outskirts
of the luminous H II region DEM L22 and associated with the
OB association LH5. These features are all on the northern
rim of H II SGS LMC-7. The WR star is projected inside
H I GS 15, which is corroborated by the H I position-velocity
plot. Note, however, that H II SGS LMC-7 is much more
extended than H I GS 15."
"WR7 is superposed on diffuse Hα emission and projected
at ∼80 pc from LH5. The 8 µm and 24 µm images show a 4′
long filamentary arc structure to the west of the star, roughly
following the surface of the H I cloud. The infrared arc struc-
ture and the apparent H I cavity around the WR star suggest
a wind-ISM interaction. The WR star is projected in the inte-
rior of H I GS 15 and on the northern rim of H II SGS LMC-7."
"WR8 is projected within a faint, filamentary shell-structure
with dimensions 11′ × 7.′6. The [O III] λ5007/Hα ratio of
this shell is higher than other H II regions, indicating a higher
excitation. As WR8 is an early type WN3 star with a high
effective temperature, it is likely that WR8 has photoionized
this nebula."
"WR9 is projected in an incomplete, filamentary shell-like
structure with dimensions 7.′6 × 6.′6 and associated with the
OB association LH8. The WR star is also on the western rim
of H I GS 18 and inside H II SGS LMC-7. The H I position-
velocity plots show split velocity components from the ex-
pansion of H I GS 18."
"WR10 is located in the northern outskirts of the H II com-
plex N11. The overall morphology of this region suggests an
outflow from the prominent central superbubble around LH9,
and the H I position-velocity plots show velocity splits indi-
cating expansion. In the Hα image, WR10 is surrounded by a
4′ × 2′ arc in the north, resembling a half shell, and a straight
filament to its west; however, the [O III] image shows that the
straight filament is of lower excitation and thus extraneous.
The WR star may be partially responsible for the half-shell
structure. WR10 is more than 100 pc away from the OB as-
sociations LH9 and LH10, thus, it cannot be a member of
either."
"WR11 is in the prominent 12′ × 8′ superbubble in the H II
complex N11 and a member of the central OB association
LH9. The superbubble is inside H I GS 16. The expansion
of the superbubble is clearly seen in the H I position-velocity
plots."
"WR12 is in a 3′ × 2′ shell in the H II region DEM L39
around the OB association LH12, of which the WR star is a
member. This OB association and its H II region are on the
northwestern rim of H I SGS 2 and H II SGS LMC-6. The
bubble of WR12 was first identified by Chu & Lasker (1980)
and has been observed to have an average expansion velocity
of 42 km s−1 (Chu 1983)."
"WR13 is located in H I GS 18 and H II SGS LMC-7. The
8 µm and 24 µm images show an arc around the star, which
measure ∼3.′5 across. The northeast end of this arc is con-
nected to more emission features. It is difficult to discern
whether these features are physically associated with WR13."
"WR14 is a known runaway star with a radial velocity of
≤130 km s−1 relative to the ambient medium (Gvaramadze
et al. 2010). There is a 2.′2 × 1.′4 bow-shock-like feature
northeast of the star, DEM L40; however, the WR star is not
at its center of curvature. The H I gas shows two velocity
components, although the WR star is not in any catalogued
H I shells."
"WR15 is surrounded by some complex filamentary fea-
tures without apparent shell morphology. WR15 is located
on the southeastern rim of the N11 complex. The WR star is
not in any catalogued OB associations in N11."
"WR16 does not show any obvious Hα emission in its
vicinity. The WR star is located inside H I SGS 2 and H II
SGS LMC-6. Note that the coordinates of this star in Table 1
have been corrected from Neugent et al. (2018)."
"WR17 is in a small 2′ × 2′ shell (Dopita et al. 1994) inside
a larger 10.′2 × 8.′4 superbubble in DEM L45 (Chu & Lasker
1980). The small shell is best seen in the [O III] line because
the spectral type of the WR star is WN3, thus, its photoion-
ized gas has high excitation and high [O III] λ5007/Hα ratio."
"WR18 has no obvious nebulosity in its vicinity; however,
on a larger scale, it is surrounded by a faint shell-like struc-
ture with dimensions 20′ × 20′. The northern part of the shell
is brighter and coincides with H I GS 22. The relationship
between the optical shell and the H I shell is not clear as the
former is twice as extended as the latter. WR18 is projected
outside H I GS 22."
"WR19 has a small, incomplete elliptical shell surround-
ing the star with dimensions 0.′7 × 0.′3 (Dopita et al. 1994).
This shell’s nitrogen abundance indicates enrichment by stel-
lar ejecta (Garnett & Chu 1994; Stock et al. 2011), and its
observed average expansion velocity is 80 km s−1 (Chu et al.
1999). The WR star is also on the northwest outskirts of the
H II region DEM L5."
"WR20 is in the diffuse emission region DEM L68 adjacent
to the bright H II region DEM L67. The [O III] image shows a
diffuse large ring with a much higher [O III] λ5007/Hα ratio
than the bright H II region DEM L67. The ring measures 7.′7
× 4.′3 and might be associated with the WR star. The star is
also projected on the periphery of H II SGS LMC-8. The H I"
"position-velocity plots show velocity splits, but no H I shell
was cataloged."
"WR21 is inside a 3.′0 × 2.′8 shell-like structure in the H II
region DEM L66. The WR star is not in known OB associ-
ations. WR21 is also projected on the northern rim of H I
SGS 5. The H I gas shows two velocity components possibly
associated with H I SGS 5."
"WR22 has no nearby nebulosity but is located in H II SGS
LMC-8. The WR star is over 100 pc away from LH18 and
LH26, which is too distant for a membership."
"WR23 is surrounded by some faint diffuse and filamentary
Hα emission features but with no recognizable shell struc-
tures. The WR star is within 50 pc to the rim of LH26 but
over 100 pc to its center, thus, it is unlikely to be a member.
WR23 is also projected in H II SGS LMC-8."
"WR24 is located in a blister-like structure of dimensions
4.′4 × 3′ extending from the bright H II region DEM L86 to
the west. There are fainter filaments extending to the north
and south of this blister structure, but the relationship be-
tween them is not clear. DEM L86 is photoionized by the
OB association LH31, of which WR24 is a member. The
WR star is near the eastern interior of H I SGS 5. The H I gas
shows two velocity components possibly associated with the
expansion of H I SGS 5."
"WR25 is at the base of an east-west elongated shell, mea-
suring 2.′8 × 1.′4 and extending from the bright H II region
DEM L86 to the east (Dopita et al. 1994). DEM L86 is pho-
toionized by the OB association LH31, of which WR25 is a
member. The complex is on the eastern rim of H I SGS 5. The
H I gas shows two velocity components possibly associated
with the expansion of SGS 5."
"WR26 is on the bright southern rim of the 10.′2 × 7.′4 shell
structure of DEM L105, which is centered on the OB associ-
ation LH36. However, WR26 is a member of a different OB
association, LH37, on the southern rim of DEM L105. There
are no sharp filaments near WR26 indicating stellar wind in-
teraction. The whole structure is inside H I GS 44."
"WR27 is a member of the OB association LH39 and inside
the incomplete shell structure DEM L110 with dimensions 7′"
"× 4.′6. It is likely that the OB association is responsible for
shaping the shell structure. Interestingly, the 8 µm image
shows that WR27 is near the center of an apparent cavity.
DEM L110 is inside H I GS 45."
"WR28 is superposed on some diffuse Hα emission with-
out any filamentary or shell morphology between the shell
H II regions DEM L105 and DEM L106, which are centered
on the OB associations LH36 and LH38, respectively. At a
distance of ∼30–35 pc from each OB association, it is not
clear whether the WR star is a field star or a runaway star
originating from one of these OB associations. The WR star
and the neighboring H II regions DEM L105 and DEM L106
are located inside H I GS 44."
"WR29 is inside a 2.′8 × 2.′6 shell structure extending from
the bright H II region DEM L108. The shell is better seen in
the 8 µm and 24 µm images. The WR star is ∼10 pc from
the edge the OB association LH35 and within 50 pc from the
center. WR29 is projected within H I GS 46."
"WR30 is projected near the eastern interior of the 10.′2
× 7.′4 shell H II region DEM L105 and is located ∼25 pc
outside the OB association LH36, which is at the center of
DEM L105. The WR star and DEM L105 are inside H I
GS 44."
"WR31 is in the diffuse H II region DEM L119 with some
filaments on the bright southern part of the H II region. The
WR star is projected on the southwest rim of H I GS 47."
"WR32 is superposed on some diffuse emission to the west
of DEM L132a. There are some random filaments nearby
but no organized shell structure. The WR star is projected
on H I GS 51. The H I gas shows two velocity components
associated with the expansion of H I GS 51."
"WR33 and WR34 is in a tight cluster in the OB associ-
ation LH41 and located inside the H II region DEM L132a.
The cluster is in H I GS 54."
"WR35 is on the edge of the H II region DEM L132b and
is a member of the OB association LH41. Due to the large
number of massive stars in the vicinity, multiple clusters in
LH41, and complexity in the nebula structure, it is not possi-
ble to identify specific features associated with the WR star.
No small bubbles are seen around the star. The star is pro-
jected in H I GS 54."
"WR36 is a member of the OB association LH42 and is on
the northwest rim of a small 1.′4 × 1.′1 shell structure, though
they are likely not associated. The 8 µm image shows a 2.′6
× 2′ cavity around the WR star, and the H I position velocity
plots also show a slowly expanding shell structure around the
WR star. The WR star could be responsible for excavating
this cavity. The bright H II region DEM L143 is associated
with the OB association LH42."
"WR37 is located in the OB association LH43 and inside
the large 13.′8 × 12.′8 superbubble DEM L137 (Chu & Lasker
1980). The superbubble expansion velocity was observed to
be 15–20 km s−1 (Chu 1982b). The WR star is also projected
in H I SGS 6."
"WR38, WR 39 are near some nebulosities and are associ-
ated with the OB association LH45. These two WR stars are
inside H II SGS LMC-5 with complex filamentary structure.
No specific structures can be identified to be specifically as-
sociated with these WR stars. H II SGS LMC-5 is associated
with H I SGS 7."
"WR40 is located inside the OB association LH47 on the
southwest rim of the superbubble in DEM L152. The WR
star is also in the base of a blowout-like structure extending
1.′8 long and 1.′2 wide."
"WR41 is in the large elliptical shell DEM L165 of dimen-
sions 8.′1 × 5.′5 with an opening on the southeast quadrant
while the south rim of the shell extends from the base of the
major axis to the northeast for about 6′ (Chu & Lasker 1980).
The expansion velocity of this shell has been determined to
be less than 10 km s−1 (Chu 1982b). The H I position-velocity
plot indicates an expansion with an expansion velocity of
∼12 km s−1 . The WR star is not in any known OB asso-
ciations and is located on the south rim of H I GS 61."
"WR42 is in the bright diffuse H II region DEM L160,
which has nonuniform surface brightness with dust lanes and
emission filaments but does not have any discernable shell
structure around the star. The WR star is a member of LH49."
"WR43 is inside the 15.′4 × 12.′7 superbubble DEM L164.
The superbubble is around the OB association LH50, of
which WR43 is a member. DEM L164 is on the south rim
of H II SGS LMC-9 and inside H I GS 61. The largest line
splitting of the H I position-velocity plot shows an expansion
of H I GS 61 of up to 20 km s−1 ."
"WR44 is projected inside the H II SGS LMC-5. Some faint
Hα filaments are seen within the central cavity of LMC-5 and
together, these filaments are called DEM L154. The filament
to the south of the star is curved away from the star, thus, it
is unlikely that the WR star is responsible for shaping this
feature. The WR star is also inside H I SGS 7."
"WR45 is in the H II region DEM L174, which shows stria-
tions in its morphology (Chu & Lasker 1980). Although there
is an apparent cavity near the star and some curved filaments
suggesting wind-ISM interaction, the overall H II morphol-
ogy does not indicate any shell structure. The internal motion
does not indicate an expansion (Chu 1982b). The WR star is
projected outside the northwest rim of H II SGS LMC-3."
"WR46 is in a small emission nebula with numerous dust
lanes to the north of the star. This small nebula is interior to
the northern rim of a 7.′6 × 3.′8 shell structure. WR46 is ∼80
pc from the OB association LH52 thus likely not a member
of this OB association. The WR star is also projected on the
eastern rim of H II SGS LMC-5 and in H I SGS 7."
"WR47 is inside the 12 × 9.′5 superbubble DEM L192 and
a member of the OB association LH54. DEM L192 is pro-
jected on the southwest rim of H II SGS LMC-4 and H I
SGS 11. Stock et al. (2011) reported a small nebula around
this star and that its elemental abundances are similar to those
of LMC H II regions. However, Hubble Space Telescope
images have resolved this small nebula into bright-rimmed
dust globules, and Spitzer Space Telescope has revealed em-
bedded star formation (Chu et al. 2005); thus, this nebula
has no association with the WR star. These bright-rimmed
dust globules can be seen in the MCELS2 Hα image, and
the young stellar objects in the dust globules can be seen in
the 8 µm and the 24 µm images. The surface of the glob-
ules might be photoionized by WR47, but this nebula is not"
"shaped by the WR star and there is no evidence of wind-ISM
interaction."
"WR48 is inside a 3.′8 × 2.′9 shell structure in the southeast
lobe of DEM L175a while the northwestern lobe is a super-
nova remnant. Overall, the structure is shaped like a double-
lobed nebula and is located in the interaction zone between
H II SGS LMC-4 and H II SGS LMC-5 and the interaction
zone between H I SGS 7 and SGS 11. The shell’s large size,
50 pc across, makes it uncertain whether it is a bubble blown
by WR48."
"WR49 and WR50 are members of the OB association
LH58 in the 10′ × 10′ superbubble DEM L199, which is on
the west rim of H II SGS LMC-3. The WR star is also in H I
SGS 12."
"WR51 is projected along a curved filament of the H II re-
gion DEM L198, which is inside H II SGS LMC-3. The WR
star is also in H I SGS 12."
"WR52 is member of the OB association LH58 in the 10′ ×
10′ superbubble DEM L199, which is on the west rim of H II
SGS LMC-3. A continuum-subtracted [O III]/Hα ratio map
reveals a small 0.′8 × 0.′8 shell around the star (Oey et al.
2000). While this small shell is prominent in the [O III]/Hα
map, only partial northwestern and southeastern rims of this
shell can be seen in the MCELS2 Hα and MCELS1 [O III]
images. This small bubble has also been noted by Dopita et
al. (1994). The WR star is also in H I SGS 12."
"WR53 is in the OB association LH62 and inside the super-
bubble DEM L208, measuring 14.′4 × 13.′5 and has multiple
rings most prominent in the Hα image (Chu & Lasker 1980).
DEM L208 is on the northeastern rim of H II SGS LMC-9."
"WR54 is superposed on the faint, diffuse H II region
DEM L210 with a filamentary shell-like structure, measuring
3′ × 2.′4, extending from the star to the south. DEM L210 is
projected inside in H II SGS LMC-3 and H I SGS 12."
"WR55 is in the faint diffuse emission region DEM L210
and is a member of the OB association LH61. DEM L210 is
projected within H II SGS LMC-3 and H I SGS 12."
"WR56 is in the faint diffuse emission region DEM L210
and is ∼60 pc from LH61 thus not a member of this OB
association. DEM L210 is projected within H II SGS LMC-3
and H I SGS 12."
"WR57 is in the faint diffuse emission region DEM L210,
which is projected within H II SGS LMC-3 and H I SGS 12."
"WR58 is a member of the OB association LH64 and pro-
jected on the northern interior of H II SGS LMC-3 and H I
SGS 12."
"WR59 is projected on the southern interior of H II SGS
LMC-3 and H I SGS 12."
"WR60 is located near some diffuse nebulosity. The WR
star is inside H II SGS LMC-3 and H I SGS 12."
"WR61 is surrounded by an apparent bow-shock like fea-
ture, measuring 1.′4 × 1.′4, which has been known to emit"
"He IIλ4686 emissions (Niemela et al. 1991). However, the
MCELS2 Hα and MCELS1 [O III] images show that the
“bow-shock” may not be a coherent structure. The WR star
is ∼70 pc from LH66 and more than 100 pc from LH69,
although it is projected within the 14′′ × 11′′ superbubble
DEM L221. The WR star is also projected in H II SGS LMC-
9 and H I GS 70. The H I position-velocity plots show split
components originating from the expansion of H I GS 70."
"WR62 is in a cavity of H II SGS LMC-3 and H I SGS 12
with no nearby nebulosity."
"WR63 is ∼70 pc from the OB association LH64 and is
projected on the northern interior of H II SGS LMC-3 and
H I SGS 12."
"WR64 is on the southern interior of H II SGS LMC-4 with-
out any obvious nebulosity nearby. The WR star is also pro-
jected within H I SGS 11, whose expansion is corroborated
by the two velocity components in the H I position-velocity
plots."
"WR65 is near some filamentary structure within the su-
perbubble DEM L221 and on the southwest rim of H II SGS
LMC-9. This WR star is a member of the OB association
LH69, which is responsible for shaping the 14′ × 11′ super-
bubble DEM L221 and the surrounding H I GS 70."
"WR66 is superposed on a filament on the eastern rim of
H II SGS LMC-3 and ≥100 pc from the OB associations
LH74 and LH67 thus not likely a member of either."
"WR67 is near some filaments on the eastern rim of H II
SGS LMC-3 and ≥100 pc from the OB associations LH74
and LH67 thus not likely a member of either. It is interesting
to note that WR67 is a very late type WN star (WN11); the
bright 24 µm emission indicates a very dense stellar wind.
There is a small emission nebula at 15′′ northeast of the WR
star, and may consist of material ejected by the star. Spectro-
scopic observations of the nebular abundance are needed to
determine its nature."
"WR68 is ∼60 pc from LH76, thus likely not a member.
The WR star is also projected on the western rim of the 11.′5
× 6.′5 superbubble DEM L229, which is blown by LH76 and
on the southern rim of the H II SGS LMC-4."
"WR69 is not superposed on any detectable nebulosity but
is projected near a faint filament on the southern interior of
H II SGS LMC-4 and within H I SGS 11. The WR star is also
∼90 pc from LH70 thus likely not a member."
"WR70 is located in a dusty, complex environment of the
H II region DEM L227 with a large arc northeast of the star,
but no shell structure can be claimed to be formed by this
WR star. DEM L227 is located on the northern rim of H II
SGS LMC-3, associated with H I SGS 12."
"WR71 is ∼75 pc from the OB association LH76, thus
likely not a member. The WR star is inside the small 1.′5
× 1.′2 shell DEM L231 (Chu & Lasker 1980), with an expan-
sion velocity no greater than 18 ± 1 km s−1 (Chu 1983)."
"WR72 is in a diffuse emission field of DEM L224, which
contains a collection of random filaments without any shell-
like structure. This WR star is not in any known OB associ-
ation."
"WR73, WR74, and WR77 are members of the OB as-
sociation LH81, which is projected inside the 21′ × 15′ su-
perbubble DEM L246 within H I GS 73. The H I position-
velocity plots show the expansion of H I GS 73."
"WR75 is inside a 0.′7 × 0.′2 bow shock-like structure em-
bedded in the brightest parts of the filamentary conglomera-
tion of DEM L239. The bow shock structure is best seen in
the MCELS2 Hα image. DEM L239 is on the northern rim
of H II SGS LMC-4 and H I SGS 11."
"WR76 is in a small 1.′5 × 1.′1 bubble in DEM L240 on
the southeastern edge of H II SGS LMC-4 and H I SGS 11.
This shell was first observed by Chu & Lasker (1980), and
Cowley et al. (1984) reported the high radial velocity of the
star, ∼470 km s−1, with respect to the LMC velocity, ∼270
km s−1."
"WR78 is superposed on the filamentary conglomeration
DEM L263. There are no obvious wind interaction features
that can be associated with this star."
"WR79 is in a 0.′5 × 0.′3 ring associated with a small 0.′8
diameter H II region embedded in a diffuse field within the
conglomeration of DEM L263. This ring structure, identified
as an oval ring nebula by Dopita et al. (1994) and studied
by Stock & Barlow (2010), is best seen in the MCELS2 Hα
image. Comparisons between the Hα and [O III] images in-
dicate that this ring nebula has a higher [O III]/Hα emission
line ratio than the neighboring H II region; this high excita-
tion is expected from WR79’s WN3 spectral type. WR79 is
∼90 pc from the rim of LH89 thus likely not a member."
"WR80 is a member of the OB association LH87. The star
is projected inside the 21′ × 15′ superbubble DEM L246,
which is inside H I GS 73. To the east of the WR star a fil-
amentary shell structure can be seen along the northeast rim
of the superbubble DEM L246."
"WR81 is projected on the eastern interior of H II SGS
LMC-4 and H I SGS 11. The WR star is superposed on dif-
fuse emission with no apparent stellar wind interaction fea-
tures."
"WR82, WR83, WR84, and WR85 are members of LH90
and are projected along the western rim of the 7.′5 × 5.′2 su-
perbubble 30 Dor C. The H I giant shell associated with this
superbubble is H I GS 75. The H I position-velocity plots
show that H I GS75 is more extended than the ionized super-
bubble."
"WR86, WR87, WR89, and WR91 are superposed on
faint, diffuse emission between 30 Dor and H II SGS LMC-3
and are members of LH89."
"WR88 is superposed on faint, diffuse emission between 30
Dor and H II SGS LMC-3 and is a member of LH85."
"WR90 is projected on the eastern interior of H II SGS
LMC-4 and H I SGS 11. The WR star is superposed on vey
faint diffuse emission with no apparent stellar wind interac-
tion features."
"WR92, WR93, WR94, and WR95 are members of LH90
near the center of superbubble 30 Dor C, measuring 7.′5 ×
5.′2. The H I giant shell associated with this superbubble is
H I GS 75, and its expansion velocity assessed from the H I
velocity splits is 12–15 km s−1."
"WR96 is a member of LH88 and is projected in a super-
nova remnant in DEM L241."
"WR97 has an incomplete shell of radius 0.′75 that can be
seen in the Hα image but shows the highest contrast against
the background in the [O III] image. On a larger scale, there
appears to be a 6.′6 × 2.′7 shell that can be seen in the Hα
and [O III], and the MCELS2 Hα image reveals sharp fila-
ments along the shell rim. The filaments on the eastern side
of the shell structure appear to be connected with other sharp
filaments on the southeast rim of 30 Dor C, forming a large
arc structure and making the apparent superbubble structure
around WR97 highly uncertain. The WR star is located on
the northeastern outskirts of 30 Dor C and is ∼45 pc from
the OB association LH90 thus likely not a member."
"WR98 is a member of LH94 and located in an empty field
between filamentary Hα emission features that do not seem
to be associated with the WR star or LH94. The H I position-
velocity plots show multiple velocity components from the
ISM."
"WR99 is superposed on a band of Hα emission without
any wind interaction features and is a member of LH96. On
a larger scale, the WR star is surrounded by a 6.′9 × 5.′2 fila-
mentary shell-like structure south of 30 Dor C."
"WR100 is just outside the eastern rim of the superbubble
30 Dor C with no associated wind interaction features. The
WR star is ∼60 pc from LH90 thus likely not a member of
this OB association."
"WR101 is in a diffuse emission region on the western edge
of 30 Dor. No wind interaction features are seen in the vicin-
ity of the star."
"WR102 is superposed on some diffuse field emission in
DEM L261 and south of 30 Dor B without any wind interac-
tion features. The WR star is a member of LH97."
"WR103 and WR104 are in a diffuse emission region on
the western edge of 30 Dor and ∼25 and ∼33 pc from the
center of LH99, respectively. No wind interaction features
are seen in the vicinity of the stars. The H I position-velocity
plots show very complex motions in the ISM."
"WR105 is superposed on diffuse emission to the south of
30 Dor B without any wind interaction features and is ∼60
pc from the center of LH99. The H I position-velocity plots
show at least four velocity components, indicating a very
complex interstellar environment."
"WR106 is in a small cluster with diffuse field emission on
the northern edge of 30 Dor B and a member of LH99. No
wind interaction features are seen in the vicinity of the star."
"WR107 is in an apparent cavity of dimensions 4.′3 × 1.′6.
There is enhanced emission around the cavity, but it does not
have sharp features indicating wind-ISM interaction. It is not
clear whether the WR star is responsible for this structure.
The H I position-velocity plots show complex motions in the
ISM. The WR star is located in DEM L261 to the south of 30
Dor B and is a member of LH97."
"WR108 is superposed on diffuse emission with some un-
organized filaments in Shell 3 of 30 Dor (Wang & Helfand
1991). It is ∼70 pc from LH100 and ∼75 pc from LH99 and
is not likely a member of either OB association."
"WR109 is superposed on diffuse emission on the north-
eastern part of 30 Dor B without any wind interaction fea-
tures. It is a member of LH99."
"WR110 and WR111 are superposed near some faint dif-
fuse emission in DEM L269 without any wind-ISM interac-
tion features. It is a member of LH101."
"WR112 is 20 pc northwest of the R136 cluster inside 30
Dor. The WR star is outside the western rim of a 1.′1 × 0.′9
shell."
"WR113 and WR114 are projected at 12–15 pc southwest
of the R136 cluster in 30 Dor. These WR stars are outside the
2.′5 × 1.′4 shell around R136. They are superposed on very
bright nebulosities, though no wind-ISM interaction features
can be seen."
"WR115 is on the outskirts of the R136 cluster, LH100, in
the center of 30 Dor and is interior to the western end of a
2.′5 × 1.′4 shell."
"WR116, WR117, WR121, WR122, WR123, WR124,
WR125, WR126, WR127, WR128, WR129, WR130,
WR131, and WR132 are in the R136 cluster, or LH100, in
the center of 30 Dor. This cluster is interior to the western
end of a 2.′5 × 1.′4 shell. 30 Dor is in H I GS 78. The H I
column densities are so high at the core of 30 Dor that self-
absorption occurs, causing the apparent depression in surface
brightness."
"WR118, WR119, WR120 are at ∼12 pc north of the R136
cluster in 30 Dor, but are still within LH100. They are outside
the northern edge of the 2.′5 × 1.′4 shell around the R136
cluster and interior to the southern rim of a 1.′1 × 0.′9 shell.
These three WR stars are projected in the boundary between
the two shells and are likely associated with the latter shell."
"WR133, WR134 are 80 and 60 pc, respectively, north of
the R136 cluster, LH100, in 30 Dor. Both are inside Shell 5
of 30 Dor (Wang & Helfand 1991), measuring 8′ × 4′."
"WR135 is in 30 Dor but is ∼30 pc from the R136 cluster.
The WR star is superposed on the edge of a dark cloud. No
wind-ISM interaction features can be seen."
"WR136 is not in the R136 cluster in the center of 30 Dor
but is interior to the eastern end of the same 2.′5 × 1.′4 shell
around the R136 cluster."
"WR137 is superposed on bright diffuse emission in
DEM L269 with no obvious wind interaction features asso-
ciated with the star. The WR star is a member of LH101."
"WR138 is superposed on bright emission of 30 Dor and
is ∼45 pc from the R136 cluster, LH100. No wind-ISM in-
teraction features can be identified close to the star, and the
environment is too complex to unambiguously make any as-
sociations."
"WR139 is projected just outside the eastern rim of Shell 5
of 30 Dor (Wang & Helfand 1991). It is ∼75 pc from LH100
and thus likely not a member."
"WR140 is in the faint diffuse outskirts of 30 Dor, about
330 pc from the R136 cluster. There are some broad filamen-
tary structures in the field, but none are curved around the
WR star to indicate wind-ISM interaction."
"WR141 is in the bright H II region on the southwest rim of
the superbubble in DEM L284, which sits in the ridge of very
active star formation on the west rim of H II SGS LMC-2.
The surrounding of WR141 is quite dusty, and the apparent
shell morphology in the [O III] image is caused by embedded
dust lanes. This environment is too complex to identify phys-
ical structures unambiguously. The WR star is a member of
LH103."
"WR142, WR144, WR145 are in the central cavity of the
7.′5 × 6.′3 superbubble of DEM L269, which sits in the ridge
of very active star formation on the west rim of H II SGS
LMC-2, corresponding to H I SGS 19. The WR star is a
member of LH104 that is responsible for the superbubble in
DEM L269."
"WR143 is projected within the 12′ × 8′ superbubble of
DEM L284, which sits in the ridge of very active star forma-
tion on the west rim of H II SGS LMC-2. The H I position-
velocity plot shows very complex velocity structure. The WR
star is a member of LH103."
"WR146 is on the northeast rim of the 7.′5 × 6.′3 superbub-
ble in DEM L269 and on the western rim of H II SGS LMC-2.
The WR star is a member of LH104 which is responsible for
the superbubble."
"WR147 is outside the superbubble of DEM L269 in the
ridge of active star formation on the western base of H II SGS
LMC-2. The WR star is ∼60 pc from LH104, and is thus
likely not a member of this OB association."
"WR148 is to the west of a long north-south oriented fila-
ment, out of which a faint 2.′8 × 1.′8 arc extends around the
WR star, forming a shell structure. The bright long filament
actually connects fainter filaments on both ends to form a
large 6.′3 × 4.′5 shell. The star is located in H II SGS LMC-
2, DEM L310, and to the east of 30 Dor. The H I position-
velocity plots show multiple velocity components, indicating"
"complex kinematic structures, rendering the aforementioned
apparent shells somewhat uncertain."
"WR149 is near the small diffuse H II region DEM L294.
WR150 is projected in the central cavity of H II SGS LMC-"
"2, or DEM L310. There are some filamentary features near
the star, but nothing can unambiguously be identified to be
associated with the star."
"WR151 is at the southern edge of the H II region
DEM L309 and projected in the northern interior of a large
ionized shell measuring 17′ × 15′, which is associated with
H I GS 94. The WR star is a member of LH116."
"WR152 is projected on the northern exterior of the H II re-
gion DEM L309 and is ∼55 pc from LH116. The WR star
is near the northern boundary of the large filamentary ion-
ized shell measuring 17′ × 15′, which is associated with H I
GS 94."
"WR153 is superposed on faint diffuse emission of
DEM L308 inside a large filamentary ionized shell measur-
ing 17′ × 15′, which is associated with H I GS 94. The H I
position-velocity plots show velocity splits indicating an ex-
pansion velocity of ∼20 km s−1 for H I GS 94. The WR star
is over 60 pc from LH116 and thus not likely a member of
this OB association."
"WR154 is projected in a small 1.′8 × 1.′3 elliptical shell in
the western interior of a larger 7.′5 × 5.′2 shell in DEM L315
(Chu & Lasker 1980). The expansion velocity of the small
shell has been observed to be ∼47 km s−1 (Chu 1983).
DEM L315 is on the northeastern rim of a large 17′ × 15′
ionized shell associated with H I GS 94."
