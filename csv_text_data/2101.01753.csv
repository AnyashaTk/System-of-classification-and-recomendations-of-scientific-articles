ABSTRACT
Ultra-diffuse galaxies have generated significant interest due to their large optical extents and low
"optical surface brightnesses, which challenge galaxy formation models. Here we present resolved syn-"
thesis observations of 12 H i-bearing ultra-diffuse galaxies (HUDs) from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
"Array (VLA), as well as deep optical imaging from the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope at Kitt Peak Na-"
"tional Observatory. We present the data processing and images, including total intensity H i maps and"
"H i velocity fields. The HUDs show ordered gas distributions and evidence of rotation, important pre-"
requisites for the detailed kinematic models in Mancera Piña et al. (2019b). We compare the H i and
"stellar alignment and extent, and find the H i extends beyond the already extended stellar component"
"and that the H i disk is often misaligned with respect to the stellar one, emphasizing the importance"
of caution when approaching inclination measurements for these extreme sources. We explore the
"H i mass-diameter scaling relation, and find that although the HUDs have diffuse stellar populations,"
"they fall along the relation, with typical global H i surface densities. This resolved sample forms an"
important basis for more detailed study of the H i distribution in this extreme extragalactic population.

1. INTRODUCTION
Very low surface brightness (vLSB) galaxies are es-
sential to our understanding of questions ranging from
"galaxy formation (e.g., Agertz & Kravtsov 2016) to cos-"
"mology (e.g., Giovanelli & Haynes 2016), but can be"
difficult to study at optical wavelengths. While vLSB
"galaxies have been studied for decades (e.g., Disney"
1976; Sandage & Binggeli 1984; Ellis et al. 1984; see also
"reviews by, e.g., Bothun et al. 1997; Impey & Bothun"
"1997), more recent advances in low surface brightness"
detection techniques (see Abraham & van Dokkum 2014;
Greco et al. 2018) have revealed increased numbers of

"vLSB galaxies, with particular interest in a subset with"
"stellar masses of dwarf galaxies (∼ 108M�) but radii
comparable to Milky Way sized (L?) galaxies (half light"
"radii of several kpc; e.g., van Dokkum et al. 2015)."
"Dubbed “ultra-diffuse” galaxies (UDGs), these galaxies"
"have generated significant attention for, among other"
"things, their potentially extreme dark matter properties"
"(e.g., van Dokkum et al. 2016, 2018; see also Trujillo"
"et al. 2019), and their implications for galaxy formation"
"models, since they make up a non-negligable fraction"
of the total galaxy population (Jones et al. 2018; Prole
et al. 2019; Danieli & van Dokkum 2019).
Galaxies fitting this loose definition of “ultra-diffuse”
"have been detected in cluster environments (e.g., Koda"
"et al. 2015; Mancera Piña et al. 2019a), and the field"

whether these are completely analogous populations re-
"mains unclear. To date, the distance measurements for"
most isolated UDGs come from neutral hydrogen (H i)
"redshifts, since optical spectra are difficult to obtain"
"at these low surface brightnesses, and isolated galaxies"
"tend to be gas-rich. For example, the Arecibo Legacy"
Fast ALFA blind H i survey (ALFALFA; Giovanelli et al.
2005; Haynes et al. 2018) revealed 253 galaxies (Leis-
man et al. 2017; Janowiecki et al. 2019) out of its over
"31,000 extragalactic detections with rr,eff > 1.5 kpc,"
"and 〈µ(r, reff)〉 > 24 mag arcsec−2. In addition to hav-
ing readily obtained redshift measurements, these H i-"
bearing ultra diffuse sources (HUDs) provide an oppor-
tunity to probe both their gas contents and their dynam-
"ics through H i measurements. Indeed, Leisman et al."
(2017) and Janowiecki et al. (2019) note that HUDs ap-
pear to have narrow H i velocity widths and elevated
gas fractions relative to other H i selected populations
of similar H i mass.
"However, these and other single dish H i observations"
"of HUDs (e.g., Papastergis et al. 2017; Spekkens &"
"Karunakaran 2018) do not resolve these sources, leaving"
"the H i radii, density, and rotation poorly constrained."
Though Leisman et al. (2017) present resolved synthe-
"sis imaging of three HUDs, which tentatively suggested"
"lower than typical gas densities and rotation speeds,"
their small sample size prevented them from drawing
more general conclusions.
Here we present resolved H i and deep optical observa-
"tions of additional sources from Leisman et al. (2017),"
"that expand the resolved sample, and allow for more"
robust analysis and broader conclusions. We give a de-
"tailed presentation of the data and observations, and fo-"
"cus our analysis on the H i mass-diameter relation, and"
the diffuseness of the gas in relation to the diffuseness
of the stellar population. Analysis of the rotation of
"the HUDs in a subset of this expanded sample, includ-"
ing their position off the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation
"(Mancera Piña et al. 2019b), and their angular momen-"
tum content (Mancera Piña et al. 2020) are presented
elsewhere.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we
"discuss the optical and H i observations of our sample,"
and in Section 3 we present the results of those obser-
vations. We discuss where the HUDs fall on the H i
mass-diameter relation and the implications of such in
"Section 4, and then present our conclusions in Section 5."
"For all calculations we assume H0 = 70 km s
−1 Mpc−1,"
"Ωm = 0.3, and ΩΛ = 0.7."
2. OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS
2.1. HI data
We observed 11 sources using the Karl G. Jansky
Very Large Array (VLA) in March-August of 2017 (pro-
"posal 17A-210; P.I. Leisman), and include one addi-"
tional source (AGC 219533) observed during a previ-
ous set of VLA observations (proposal 14B-243; Leis-
"man et al. 2017), for a total sample of 12 galaxies (Table"
1). Two of the sources (AGC 334315 and AGC 122966)
also have data from the Westerbork Synthesis Radio
Telescope (WSRT) presented in Leisman et al. (2017).
We note that these sources were chosen from early ver-
"sions of the Leisman et al. (2017) catalog, which re-"
"quired rr,eff > 2 kpc, and 〈µ(r, reff)〉 > 24 mag arcsec−2,
as measured SDSS data, nearest neighbor separations"
"> 350 kpc on the sky and >500 km s−1, and distances"
<120 Mpc. The observed sample size was further re-
"stricted by requiring that sources had MHI> 10
8M�,"
and that they fell in fields where mid-depth GALEX
"data was available, and did not have missing or bad"
"SDSS data (due to, e.g., nearby bright stars). The"
GALEX and SDSS data requirements are approximately
"random across the region covered by ALFALFA, thus"
the synthesis sample should be approximately represen-
tative of the broader ALFALFA sample from Leisman
et al. (2017).
"We observed all sources in “C” configuration, and two"
sources in “D” configuration due to scheduling pressure
constraints; details for each galaxy are listed in Table
1. We typically observed the sources for three two-hour
"observing blocks in C-configuration, or for two one-hour"
observing blocks in D-configuration. We observed the
"nearest of the standard flux calibrators, 3C48, 3C147, or"
"3C286, for approximately 10 minutes at the beginning or"
end of each observation and observed the nearest appro-
priate phase calibrator from the VLA catalog with a con-
servative cadence of approximately 2 minutes of phase
calibration for every 18 minutes of time on source. We
used the WIDAR correlator in dual polarization mode
"with a single 8 MHz wide sub-band with 1024 channels,"
"giving a native channel width of 1.7 km s−1, which we"
smooth to a velocity resolution of 4 km s−1.
The data reduction process followed standard meth-
ods in the Common Astronomy Software Application
(CASA; McMullin et al. 2007). Flagging of the visibil-
"ities was done by hand, and standard cross-calibration"
was performed with the primary calibrator used to de-
termine the flux scale and bandpass. The phase calibra-
tor was used to determine the complex gains over the
"course of the observation, and continuum subtraction in"
the uv plane was applied to each source. We created
data cubes by combining all calibrated data sets using
the CASA task CLEAN in interactive mode. We used
"a Briggs robust weighting of 0.5, a cleaning threshold of"

"3.0 mJy or 3σ, and the multiscale clean option, creating"
images with 3′′ pixels and 4 km s−1 channels. The re-
"sulting noise and beam size from each cube is listed in
Table 1."
We note that four of these resulting VLA image
"cubes (AGC 114905,AGC 219533, AGC 248945, and"
AGC 749290) were used in the analysis of Mancera Piña
et al. (2019b) (which also include WSRT observations
of AGC 334315 and AGC 122966 from Leisman et al.
"(2017)), and six in Mancera Piña et al. (2020) (the four"
"above, plus AGC 334315 and AGC 122966)."
We created moment 0 and moment 1 maps using
"masked data cubes, with masks calculated at 2σ (for mo-"
ment 0) and 3σ (for moment 1) on data cubes smoothed
to twice the beam size (we use a higher masking thresh-
old for moment 1 analysis to reduce noise near the edge
"of the maps), and using only channels in the velocity"
range of the source. We converted the moment 0 total
flux maps to H i column density maps assuming opti-
"cally thin H i gas that fills the beam, and perform a final"
masking on the resulting maps (using a mask calculated
at the 3σ level from a smoothed moment 0 map) to cre-
ate the images presented below. We note that our mask-
ing technique is different from that used in Mancera Piña
"et al. (2019b), resulting in some visual differences in the"
"resulting moment maps, but having little impact in the"
"measured parameters, as discussed in section 4.1. We"
extracted spectra from the unmasked data cubes within
"the spatial region defined by the moment 0 maps, and"
fit the resulting line profiles to obtain measurements of
"total flux, redshift, and line width, which we report in"
Table 3. We compared the resulting recovered VLA flux
to that of ALFALFA as additional verification of our
reduction; this ratio is also reported in Table 1.
We computed H i masses from the VLA flux measure-
ments assuming that the H i is optically thin using the
"standard formula (e.g., Roberts 1975):"
"MHI = 2.36× 105D2
∫
SdV (1)"
4 Gault et al.
"where D is the distance in Mpc and
∫
SdV is the inte-"
grated H i line flux in Jy km s−1. We assumed distances
from the ALFALFA catalog (Haynes et al. 2018) as re-
ported in Table 3. We calculated uncertainties on the
H i mass following Haynes et al. (2018) by combining
"the uncertainty in the distance, the integrated line flux,"
and a 10% systematic flux calibration uncertainty.
We note that we were unable to recover an image of
"AGC 198596, and thus exclude it from our analysis. One"
of the three C configuration observations of this source
"was corrupted and unusable, and the other two observa-"
"tions had extreme RFI, such that over 60% of the data"
had to be flagged in both observations.
2.2. Optical Data
We observed 11 of the 12 sources in our sample be-
tween 2016 and 2018 using the One Degree Imager (ODI;
Harbeck et al. 2014) on the 3.5-meter WIYN telescope
"at Kitt Peak National Observatory, and one source in"
2013 using ODI when it was partially-populated (pODI;
see Table 1). Each source was observed in the g and r
bands for a total exposure time of 45 minutes per fil-
ter. The observations typically consisted of a nine-point
dither pattern of 300 second exposures in order to fill in
gaps between the CCD detectors.
We reduced the images using the Quick Reduce (Ko-
tulla 2014) data reduction pipeline through the One De-
"gree Imager Pipeline, Portal, and Archive (ODI-PPA;"
Gopu et al. 2014) science gateway. This pipeline per-
forms the following tasks: masks saturated pixels; cor-
rects crosstalk and persistence; subtracts the overscan
"signal; corrects for nonlinearity; applies the bias, dark,"
and flat-field corrections; corrects for pupil ghosts; and
removes cosmic rays. We also perform an illumina-
"tion correction, subtract the sky background, and scale"
the images to a common flux level. The scaling fac-
tors for the images are calculated based on measure-
"ments of the peak fluxes in a few dozen bright, unsatu-"
rated stars distributed across all areas of the field. We
then stack the scaled images and restore the appropriate
"background level to the final, stacked image. The same"
set of bright stars is again used to measure the typical
full width at half-maximum of the point spread function
(FWHMPSF) in the images. The average FWHMPSF
"for all images in our sample is 0.8′′ in g and 0.9′′ in r,"
with a range of 0.6′′ - 1.7′′ in both bands.
We measure simplistic optical surface brightness pro-
files (Figure 1) following the procedure presented in
"Mancera Piña et al. (2019b). In brief, we perform back-"
"ground subtraction, noise estimates, and masking fol-"
"lowing the procedure detailed in Marasco et al. (2019),"
and determine position angles and axial ratios using
SExtractor. We then fit ellipses using a fixed posi-
"tion angle, centered on optical centers (determined ei-"
ther from SExtractor or the SDSS optical coordinates
from the ALFALFA catalog (Haynes et al. 2011)) of the
galaxy. We note that the centroid position from SEx-
"tractor and from Haynes et al. 2011 mostly agree, ex-"
cept in cases where the center of light is not the bright-
est point in the galaxy. The choice of centroid makes
"very little difference to our measured magnitudes (∼0.02
mag), but can have an impact of ∼0.1 mag arcsec−2 on
the measured central surface brightness, and of ∼0.4 kpc
on the effective radii."
"We mask the images in a semi-automatic fashion,"
modifying the signal-to-noise threshold for applying
"masks to nearby sources as appropriate. When in doubt,"
"we chose to be conservative with our masking, not mask-"
ing features that might be part of the galaxy. We then
"compute total magnitudes, surface brightnesses, and"
radii using exponential fits to the resulting profiles;
these values are given in Table 2.
We estimate stellar masses using the color-M/L rela-
tion from Herrmann et al. (2016). This relation is cali-
"brated for dIrr-like galaxies, which have many similari-"
ties in their stellar properties with field UDGs (though
"see Du et al. (2020), published after original submission"
"of this work, for a discussion of potential systematic off-"
"sets). The uncertainties in our colors, magnitudes, and"
the color-M/L relation result in Gaussian distributions
for each stellar mass estimate; the value reported in Ta-
"ble 2 corresponds to the median of this distribution, and"
its uncertainties represent the difference of this median
with the 16th and 84th percentiles.
3. RESULTS
3.1. The resolved H i in HUDs
Figures 2-5 show the data for the HUDs in our sam-
ple. The central panels show ODI color images of the
"optical components of the HUDs, with H i column den-"
"sity contours overlaid as white lines, representing con-"
tours at the column density levels detailed in the figure
captions. The figures are organized in order of ascend-
"ing peak column density, with galaxies of similar peak"
column densities grouped with the same contour levels.
The left-most column in each figure shows a zoomed-in
grey-scale g-band ODI images of each galaxy. The right-
"hand panels show the moment 1 velocity maps, with the"
black lines representing the same contours as in the op-
tical images. The grey circles represent the size of the
"beam for each source, and the color gradient represents"
the line of sight velocity in km s−1.
"In the H i maps, most sources are resolved with 3 or"
4 independent beams across the full extent of detected

H i emission. Beam sizes range from 14.5′′ to 18.1′′ in
"major axis, which corresponds to physical resolutions"
from 4.6 kpc to 9.1 kpc at the distances of the sources
(details listed in Table 1 and 3).
Sources AGC 238764 and AGC 248945 are only
"marginally resolved, with measured H i semi-major axes"
"at 1 M� pc
−2 equal to or less than the beam size, and"
"with only ∼2 beams across the full detected extent of
the galaxies. These two sources are also the only two"
sources with recovered fluxes FVLA/FALFA well below 1
(0.55 and 0.59 respectively).
Most HUDs in our sample appear to have regular H i
gas morphologies at our resolution. While this is to be
"expected at our relatively low physical resolution, it in-"
dicates these sources are not likely disturbed clouds of
"debris, and are presumably disks, allowing for reason-"
"able estimates of the inclinations of these HUDs, which"
we discuss further in Section 4.1.
All HUDs presented exhibit H i gas distributions that
"extend well beyond their observed optical counterparts.
This is characteristic of typical H i-bearing galaxies (e.g.,"
"Boomsma et al. 2008; Lelli et al. 2016), but is interesting"
given the extended “ultra-diffuse” nature of the stellar
populations in question. We return to this point in Sec-
tion 4.2. We also find that the gas is most dense in the
center of these galaxies and becomes less dense as the
H i radius increases from the center. Peak H i surface
"densities range from 3.98 to 7.50 x 1020 atoms cm−2,"
though it is important to note that this measurement
"assumes the gas fills the beam, and thus depends heav-"
ily on our resolution; the true peak density is almost
certainly higher.
We estimate the H i diameter at an H i surface den-
"sity of 1 M� pc
−2 along the major axis using a second"
"moment analysis method, as described in Banks et al."
"(1995). Specifically, we measure the elliptical shape of"
"emission above the 1 M� pc
−2 level by applying a col-"

3.2. The Stellar Populations of Resolved H i-bearing
The left-hand and center panels in Figures 2-5 show
the optical data for the 11 galaxies in our sample. The
left-hand panels are g-band images with contrast cho-
sen to highlight the low surface brightness features of
"the galaxies, while the center panels show color images"
with H i contours at column density levels based on peak
column density overlaid in white.
"All sources have very low surface brightness, with"
clearly detected stellar features that are nearly invisi-
ble in Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging. Similar to the
"result reported in Leisman et al. (2017), most HUDs"
appear blue in color with mostly irregular morphologies
"without well defined features. Two sources, AGC 334315"
"and AGC 749251, have some arc-like features remi-"
"niscent of spiral arms, but without distinct patterns"
"or strong evidence of a stellar disk. Three sources,"
"AGC 114905, AGC 748738, and AGC 749290, have ob-"
served optical components that loosely resemble stellar
"disks in our optical images, but still would be better clas-"
"sified as irregular galaxies at the detected level. Also,"
"one source, AGC 219533, has a bright, very blue higher"
surface brightness clump superimposed on its low sur-
face brightness emission; it is not fully clear if it is a
"bright star forming region associated with the galaxy,"
or if it is a foreground or background source.
In many cases the centroid of the stellar population is
"aligned with the peak in the H i column density, but"
"there are several exceptions, including AGC 114905,"
"AGC 238764, and AGC 248945. However, we note that"
AGC 238764 and AGC 248945 are less well resolved and
lower signal-to-noise detections than the other sources in
"the sample, so the position of their peak column density"
is somewhat less well defined.
"Importantly, we note that we only poorly constrain"
the galaxies’ inclinations using the stellar populations.
Part of this is that the irregular morphologies make it
difficult to accurately estimate the structural parame-

ters used to constrain inclination and construct surface
brightness profiles (section 2.2). While the process of az-
imuthally averaging the light tends to mitigate the effect
of these structural uncertainties on the measurements of
"magnitude, surface brightness, and effective radius (es-"
"pecially as we hold the PA and axial ratio fixed), these"
uncertainties strongly affect the reliability of estimates
"of the major and minor axis. Moreover, the patchiness"
of the stellar light suggests that it may not be true that
the apparent axial ratio of the light from the most visible
"stars actually traces the stellar disk, thus only provid-"
ing at best a loose constraint on the systemic inclination.
Only three of the sources have morphologies that loosely
"resemble stellar disks, AGC 114905, AGC 748738, and"
AGC 749290; for these three sources we find that at-
tempts to measure their inclination optically always dif-
fers considerably from the value found using the H i gas.

tion 4.1.
3.3. H i mass-diameter relation
The H i mass-diameter relation is an observed tight
correlation between the H i mass of a galaxy and its H i
"radius measured at an isophotal level of 1 M� pc
−2 (e.g.,"
Broeils & Rhee 1997; Lelli et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016).
Given that the HUDs are selected to have extended op-
"tical counterparts, it is a natural question to ask if they"
"also have extended H i disks for their mass. Indeed,"
"we may expect HUDs to fall off the relation, having"
larger H i sizes for their mass if the formation mechanism
responsible for their extended optical size also affects
the gas disk (though the physical interpretation of the
"H i mass-diameter relation is complex; see, e.g., Stevens"
et al. 2019). If any of the HUDs are “failed” L? galaxies
"(e.g., van Dokkum et al. 2015, 2016), an extended gas"
disk could help to explain their low surface brightness
nature: an extended H i disk for a given H i mass im-
"plies a lower average surface density of gas, which could"
affect the ability of the neutral gas to condense and cool

4. DISCUSSION
"Here we discuss our results, noting the importance"
"of resolved H i imaging for measuring inclinations, H i"
"radii, and column densities, as well as deep optical imag-"
ing for measuring optical sizes at low surface brightness.
We explore the implications of the ultra-diffuse sources
"falling on the MHI-DHI relation, finding that though"
"their stellar disks are extremely low surface brightness,"
and though they are dark matter poor inside their disks
"(Mancera Piña et al. 2019b), their H i radii are typical"
"for their optical effective radii. However, their H i radii"
"are large for their stellar mass, suggesting these galax-"
"ies are quite gas rich, consistent with the findings from"
Leisman et al. (2017).
4.1. H i Inclination Measurements
"One of the main results from this sample, presented"
in detail in Mancera Piña et al. (2019b) is that these
"isolated, very low surface brightness sources appear to"
"be rotating too slowly for their baryonic mass, i.e., they"
lie off the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. Leisman et al.
(2017) found low velocity widths for the larger parent
"sample, but resolved measurements are necessary to con-"
strain the source inclinations and ensure against incli-
nation selection bias.
A number of methods can be employed for measur-
"ing the inclination of galactic disks (see, e.g., Garcia-"
Gomez & Athanassoula 1991; Andersen & Bershady
2013). Mancera Piña et al. (2019b) determine incli-
nations by minimizing the residuals between observed
moment 0 maps and model galaxies projected across a
"range of inclinations, including a convolution step that"
makes the measurement of the inclination largely unbi-
ased by the shape of the beam (see Mancera Piña et al.
(2020) for a detailed description).
Another common method is to use ellipses fit to 2D
H i or optical photometric images to derive position an-
"gles and axial ratios, which are then converted to incli-"
nation assuming disks of some estimated thickness (see
"e.g., Boroson 1981). In the cases where the minor axis"
"of our galaxies is resolved with at least two beams, we"
estimate axial ratios with our beam corrected major and
"minor axes measurements, and use these to compute in-"
"clinations using the standard formula (e.g., Jacoby et al."
1992):
"cos2(i) =
(b/a)2 − q20"
1− q20
12 Gault et al.
"Figure 6. The DHI −MHI relation, with the HUDs over plotted on data from Wang et al. (2016). The HUDs, despite having
an extended, “ultra-diffuse” stellar population, are H i normal, with typical H i radii and global gas densities. The solid line
shows the linear fit from Wang et al. (2016). The dotted lines show the 3σ scatter around the relation. H i mass errors are
smaller than the size of the markers."
assuming two representative values for thin and thick
"disks, q0=0.1 and 0.4. We report these, along with"
"the measurements from Mancera Piña et al. (2019b),"
in Table 4. For the galaxies included in both sam-
"ples, our measurements are consistent with those de-"
rived from Mancera Piña et al. (2019b) except in two
cases: AGC 248945 and AGC 334315. These two galax-
ies had inclinations that were more than 10 degrees dif-
ferent (smaller) from those found in Mancera Piña et al.
"(2019b), though are still within 2σ given uncertainties"
due to beam smearing.
We find that the estimated inclinations for our 11
"sources tend to cluster around 40 degrees, ranging only"
from 26 to 54 degrees. Though our inclinations are
only somewhat weakly constrained due to our compar-
"atively low resolution, these constraints still give phys-"
"ically interesting results. First, this inclination distri-"
bution seems inconsistent with the assumption of ran-
"domly oriented oblate spheroids. More specifically, we"
would expect randomly oriented oblate spheroids to be
"evenly distributed in bins of cos i (that is, for the num-"
ber of galaxies in each inclination bin to increase from
"face on (0◦) to edge on (90◦) as a function of sin i, see,"
"e.g., Binney & Merrifield (1998)). This distribution can"
be modified somewhat by diameter and magnitude se-
"lection effects (e.g., Jones et al. 1996), though these ef-"
fects are modest for optically thin disks. Even with just
"11 sources, our measured inclinations seem inconsistent"
with a random distribution (even accounting for mag-
nitude or diameter selection effects); a KS test gives a
probability that the sources in our sample have a ran-
dom underlying distribution of p < 0.001.
That our galaxies are not randomly distributed is in
"itself, not surprising: the surface brightness criteria used"

*For these galaxies the observed morphological axis does not co-"

suming nicely rotating disks should be treated with caution"
"in Leisman et al. (2017), along with the visual elimina-"
tion of sources could easily bias the sample against edge
on galaxies. This may in part explain our observed dis-
tribution.
"However, while these results may suggest an inclina-"
tion dependent selection bias in Leisman et al. (2017)
"and Janowiecki et al. (2019), they also support the con-"
clusion that their observed low velocity width distribu-
tion for the full sample of HUDs cannot be explained by
inclination effects. A KS test comparing our observed
inclination distribution with the distribution necessary
to make the Leisman et al. (2017) HUDs lie on the BTFR
"gives a probability p = 9 × 10−7 of being drawn from
the same distribution. This result thus supports the ar-"
gument from Mancera Piña et al. (2019b) that HUDs
indeed do have abnormally low rotation velocities for
their mass.
"Yet, it is also possible that our observed inclination"
distribution indicates that the assumption of thin oblate
spheroids may not be appropriate for this sample of
"galaxies. A number of authors (e.g., van den Bergh"
1988) have pointed out that dwarf irregular galaxies may
not be well represented by spheroids with some intrinsic
"flattening, and may rather be triaxial, or at least have"
thicker disks. While the free fall time for H i makes a
"thick H i disk unlikely, a triaxial or otherwise irregular"
disk may be reasonable in light of their irregular stel-
"lar properties. Thus, we emphasize the importance of"
caution when approaching inclination measurements for
these extreme sources.
"As a further note of caution, we compare the H i in-"
clination estimates to estimates of optical inclination.
"As discussed in section 3.2, most sources in our sam-"
"ple have irregular optical morphologies, precluding accu-"
"rate optical measurements of inclination. However, for"
the three sources with the most regular morphologies
"in our sample, AGC 114905, AGC 748738, and AGC"
"749290, we estimate stellar inclinations to compare to"
"our H i measurements. In all three cases, the inclination"
"estimate from the stellar population is ∼ 20◦ different
from the estimates from H i, with the stellar disk giving"
"larger inclinations than the H i (which, we note, would"
place them even further off the baryonic Tully-Fisher
relation). We find the offsets in the HUDs sample are
even more extreme than those in Verheijen & Sancisi
"(2001), who also found a significant difference between"
"inclinations measured optically, and using H i."
"Further, there appears to be a 90◦ difference between"
the position angle measurements for AGC 749290 with
the optical being 289◦ and H i being 28◦. These differ-
ences may be because the observed optical morphology
in HUDs is likely dominated by patchy star formation.
"Therefore, we reiterate that the stellar population of H i"
"-bearing UDGs is, in general, a poor indicator of incli-"
nation; we must also consider the H i component when
attempting to understand the orientation of HUDs.
This note is especially important given the draw to
"inclination selection of edge-on HUDs (e.g., He et al."
"2019), since this, in principle, removes the problem of"
inclination-correction for rotational (and surface bright-
ness) studies. Since HUDs are likely a heterogeneous
"population including both irregular and spiral-like disks,"
it may or may not be that sources with high axial ratios
are edge-on disks where inclination corrections can be
ignored. Our work confirms that the optical morpholo-
gies are not necessarily aligned with the kinematics of
"the gas, so one should have caution in interpreting un-"
resolved kinematic information.
4.2. Implications of HUDs on the H i Mass-Diameter
Relation
The results presented in Section 3.3 and Figure 6 show
that the HUDs in this sample are all consistent with the
H i mass – diameter relation of Wang et al. (2016). An-
14 Gault et al.
other way of exploring this result is to calculate the aver-
"age H i surface density for our sample, which should give"
"a result similar to other H i-bearing galaxies, regard-"
"less of mass. Following Broeils & Rhee (1997), we com-"
"pute a characteristic surface density ΣHI,c = 4
MHI
πDHI"
"4.15± 0.27 M� pc−2, which is slightly higher than, but
consistent with, their value of 3.8±0.1 M� pc−2.2 Like
other authors, we note that this characteristic ΣHI,c is"
"actually slightly higher than the actual average ΣHI, be-"
"cause we use the full measured MHI rather than MHI
enclosed within DHI to most accurately compare with"
previous works.
"Given the lower stellar surface density of these sources,"
the “normal” H i surface density may be somewhat sur-
"prising (e.g., de Blok & McGaugh 1996). One potential"
"explanation is that the H i radii are isophotal radii, mea-"
"sured at one position along the surface density profile,"
whereas the effective radius measurement used to de-
fine the optical radius is related to the slope of the light
"profile. Thus, these sources could still have larger than"
typical effective H i radii if they have shallower slopes.
We explore this by measuring the flux enclosed within
"the H i radius, compared with the flux outside the ra-"
dius. We compute the fraction of the total flux enclosed
"within the H i radius, and report the values in Table 4."
"We find that our sources contain an average of ∼ 81% of
the total H i flux within the measured H i radius, with"
a sample standard deviation 6% (though we note the
individual uncertainties based on the rms in our flux
measurements are typically closer to 10%). This is con-
sistent with the estimates from Wang et al. (2016) of
"∼ 83± 10%.
We also confirm that this technique can differentiate"
between samples with different slopes by applying this
method to nine ATLAS 3D (Serra et al. 2012) sources
used in the Wang et al. (2016) sample which have sig-
nificantly shallower H i profiles (see Wang et al. (2016)
Figure 2). We find that these galaxies contain an aver-
age of 62% of the total H i flux within the H i radii re-
"ported in Wang et al. (2016), with a standard deviation"
of 14% (though we note that this comparison is some-
what limited since a number of the ATLAS 3D sources
"are disrupted, making estimation of the H i radius more"
"difficult (see Serra et al. 2012, 2014)."
To determine whether our masking procedure intro-
"duces a systematic bias, we also compute this enclosed"
fraction on our unmasked cubes. We find this decreases
"2 Broeils & Rhee (1997) report a standard deviation of 1.1,
which, for their sample of 108 galaxies gives a standard error on
the mean of 0.11. The error on our characteristic surface density
of 0.27 is the standard error on the mean."
"our average measured gas fraction to 76 ± 9%, though
most of this change is driven by two sources with addi-"
"tional positive flux at large radii in the unmasked cubes,"
"which changes their estimated gas fractions by ∼16%. If
we remove these sources the average value is 79 ± 6%.
Though it provides a less direct comparison, we also"
"note that we recover, on average, 96% of the ALFALFA"
"flux, so if we instead use ALFALFA fluxes, this could"
"further decrease the gas fraction by an average of ∼4%,
still consistent with, but lower than the value measured"
by Wang et al. (2016).
"Thus, we suggest that the consistency of our measured"
enclosed fractions with Wang et al. (2016) implies that
the slope of the H i profiles is not significantly different
"from typical H i-bearing sources. However, higher res-"
"olution, well resolved H i profiles will be necessary to"
confirm this result.
We also explore measuring optical isophotal radii for
"this sample of galaxies, and present the radii measured"
at 25 mag arcsec−2 in the r band in Table 2. How-
"ever, while for typical gas-bearing galaxies radii mea-"
sured at 25 mag arcsec−2 contain most of the opti-
"cal light, for our galaxies, with peak surface bright-"
"ness near 24 mag arcsec−2, this estimate misses most"
"of the light of the galaxy. In fact, while for typical"
"galaxies r25 is 3-5× larger than the effective radius (i.e.,
the radius containing half the light), for our sources we"
find that r25 is approximately 2/3 of the effective ra-
"dius (〈rr25/reff〉 = 0.67 ± 0.10). This means that for
our sample, measurements of RHI/ropt,25 are signifi-"
cantly elevated compared with other samples. We find
"〈RHI/ropt,25〉 = 5.1 ± 1.6, compared to, e.g., 1.7 ± 0.5
as measured by Broeils & Rhee (1997) for spiral galax-"
"ies, or 1.9 ± 1.0 from Lelli et al. (2016) for the SPARC
sample (disk galaxies)."
"If instead we compare H i radii to optical effective
radii, we find the effective radii are only somewhat larger"
than predicted by their H i extent. Figure 7 shows the
H i radii compared with the stellar effective radii for our
sample and the SPARC sample of disk galaxies (Lelli
"et al. 2016), selected to have the same H i mass range"
(though a much larger stellar mass range). The HUDs
"fall in a similar parameter space, though with an el-"
evated average effective radius (matching their initial
"selection). This is understandable, given that Leisman"
et al. (2017) reported that these sources all have larger
"than usual gas fractions(see, e.g., their Figure 4)."
"Thus, when considered from the H i perspective, our"
sample of HUDs appears H i normal at our current reso-
"lution, with slightly elevated stellar radii, but very small"
stellar masses and low surface brightnesses. HUDs do
not significantly differ from typical galaxies in their av-

erage H i surface densities; and at the resolution of our
"data, appear to have normal H i gas distributions. While"
higher resolution observations will be required to con-
"firm the full mass density profiles of these galaxies, the"
results presented here suggest that though their stellar
"populations are “ultra-diffuse,” the H i gas in HUDs is"
5. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we present deep optical and resolved
H i imaging of a sample of 11 isolated H i-bearing ultra-
diffuse galaxies selected from the ALFALFA survey.
These sources are notable because of their extreme low
"surface brightnesses, large optical sizes, and their rela-"
tive isolation from other sources.
We find that the sources have irregular optical mor-
"phologies with generally blue colors, consistent with the"
findings in Leisman et al. (2017). We note that the stel-
"lar populations in these irregular sources, perhaps not"
"unexpectedly, often give inconsistent inclination mea-"
surements with the H i; thus resolved H i measurements
are essential for inclination-dependent studies. However
we also caution that our observed inclination distribu-
"tion seems inconsistent with a random distribution, po-"
"tentially due to selection effects, or H i distributions that"
deviate from circular disks.
"We further find that at the level of our resolution, the"
sources in this sample appear to have normal H i mor-
"phologies, with the H i extending beyond the observed"
diffuse stellar population in all cases.
We plot these extreme sources on the MHI-DHI re-
"lation, and find that they are all consistent with the"
"relation, and that they have normal global H i surface"
densities. We explore the gas fraction enclosed within
"the H i radius, and find it consistent with normal H i"
"disks, possibly suggesting that though their stellar pop-"
"ulations are ultra diffuse, the H i in HUDs is not. This"
"suggests that globally, their extreme surface brightness"
may not be driven by low or anomalous H i densities or
"distributions, though higher resolution observations will"
be necessary to confirm this suggestion.
"This publicly available,3 rich data set provides an im-"
portant baseline for future exploration of these mecha-
nisms and other questions relying on resolved studies of
"HUDs (e.g., their dark matter content, Mancera Piña"
"et al. 2019b), and for direct comparisons between theo-"
retical models and observations.
