1. Introduction
Producing a high-sensitivity radiation detector for dark matter is currently the most crucial
subject. Many groups are trying to find a WIMPs signal by various methods and target
nuclei. Although a large volume liquid xenon (LXe) detector set stringent limits on the exis-
"tence of WIMPs dark matter candidates[1–3], DAMA/LIBRA group reported the significant"
signal of WIMPs by applying highly radiopure and large volume NaI(Tl) scintillator. They
observed the annual modulating signal of WIMPs rate due to the earth’s revolution around
the Sun [4]. The event rate and deposited energy of WIMPs modulate with their maximum
at the beginning of June and a minimum at the beginning of December. The DAMA/LIBRA
group developed a highly radiopure NaI(Tl) scintillator whose total mass was 250 kg. They
"reported a significant annual modulating amplitude between 2 keVee and 6 keVee, where"
keVee is the unit of energy scale calibrated by the kinetic energy of electron [5].
Many groups are trying to verify the DAMA/LIBRA’s result by NaI(Tl) scintillator [6–
9]. The COSINE group started the low background measurement from 2018 by high-purity
NaI(Tl) scintillator with its total 106 kg [8]. The event rate in the low energy region was
"about 2 ∼ 3 times larger than the one of DAMA/LIBRA. The higher background was due
to the intrinsic radioactive contamination, for example, 210Pb and 40K. The beta rays from
210Pb, 210Bi, and 40K make a continuous background in the energy region of interest (below"
10 keV). The Compton continuum due to 1462 keV gamma-ray emitted after electron capture
of 40K also contributes to the background. These background events obscure the dark matter
"signals. Recently, the COSINE reported the improved NaI(Tl) crystal, which was produced"
by re-crystallization [10]. They proved the effectiveness of the re-crystallization method to
reduce the radioactive contamination in NaI(Tl).
"We have tried further purification by applying a cation exchange resin, in addition to"
the re-crystallization method. The appropriate selection of the resin enabled the effective
reduction of the lead ion in the NaI solution. We developed an extremely high-purity NaI(Tl)
crystal whose concentration of 210Pb is less than 6 µBq/kg.
2. Purification methods
2.1. Re-crystallization method
The re-crystallization (RC) method helps remove the radioactive impurities that are well
"soluble in water. The solubility of NaI in water is 75.14 at 100 ◦C, and it decreases 64.76 at"
25 ◦C. The solubility is defined as the mass of solute in 100 g of water solution. The difference
in the solubility between 100 ◦C and 25 ◦C enables us to get the pure NaI sediment.

‡Present address: Butsuryo College of Osaka, 3-33 Ohtori Kitamachi, Nishi ward, Sakai city, Osaka, 593-8328, Japan"
The COSINE group showed the significant 40K suppression in the RC method[11]. Potas-
sium in the aqueous solution of sodium iodide forms a well soluble potassium iodide (KI)
or potassium hydroxide (KOH). The solubility of KI and KOH in water are as high as 59.7
"and 54.2 at 25 ◦C, respectively, as shown in Table 1. Since the concentration of potassium"
"is much lower than its solubility, potassium ions remain in the water during the NaI RC"
"process. The COSINE group reported the effectiveness of the RC method [10, 11]."
"Table 1 The solubility of NaI, KI, KOH, and PbI2 in water [12]."
Temp.(◦C) 0 20 25 100
NaI 61.54 64.1 64.76 75.14
KI 56.0 59.0 59.7 67.4
KOH 49.2 53.8 54.2 64.0
PbI2 0.041 0.060 0.076 0.43
We verified effectiveness of the RC method by measuring the 40K activity in NaI before
and after this procedure. The activity of 40K in the NaI was determined using an ultra-low
background HPGe detector which is installed at the KamLAND underground facility of the
Kamioka neutrino observatory. The HPGe detector was constructed by joint efforts of Kavli
IPMU (Tokyo Univ.) and RCNS (Tohoku Univ.) research groups. More information about
"the HPGe detector and underground clean room facility can be found in [13, 14]. We found"
an apparent reduction of gamma-ray intensity by the RC method. The initial radioactivity
"of 40K in the original (non-purified) NaI powder was in the range of 18 ∼ 32 mBq/kg at 90%
CL. After a single RC cycle, the activity of 40K was reduced to 0.2 ∼ 10 mBq/kg at 90%
CL."
We prepared 100 ◦C NaI saturated solution in a bottle filled with pure nitrogen. The bottle
was slowly cooled down to room temperature to avoid adhering of NaI crystals to the bottle’s
surface. The NaI crystals were separated from the water solution by suction filtration. The
filtration was done in a glove box flushed with pure nitrogen to prevent contact with air
containing radon.
2.2. Resin method
"The COSINE group reported the re-crystallization worked well to reduce 210Pb [10, 11]. Our"
"results also showed a significant reduction by double and triple RC methods, as listed in"
"Table 6. Nevertheless, we need a higher reduction to get a pure NaI(Tl) crystal below a few"
tens of µBq/kg. We tried to combine another strategy to remove Ra and Pb ions.
We extensively searched for the source of 210Pb and found it was not only 222Rn in pure
"water but also 210Pb in original NaI powder. We combined several methods to remove both
222Rn and 210Pb from the water solution of NaI. The gaseous 222Rn in water was removed"
"by bubbling the pure water with pure nitrogen gas. The longer bubbling, typically one hour,"
gives a significant reduction. We tried to catch Pb in the water solution of NaI by both
cation exchange resin and crown ether.
We searched for the best combination of the resins by processing the NaI aqueous solu-
"tion, which was initially added 4.9 ppm of lead ion. We tested four resins delivered by two"
"companies. The resin A is suitable to remove strontium, uranium, and lead ions. The resin"
"B is designed to remove the lead ion. The resins C and D, which another company delivers,"
are applied to remove uranium and iron ions.
"We measured the concentration of the Pb ion in the sample by ICP-MS, Agilent 7900 at"
Osaka University and Agilent 7700 at Osaka Sangyo University. The measured values of the
"reduction factor of lead ion are listed in Table 2. According to the result, we selected the"
"resin B to reduce lead ion. In addition to resin B, we apply the resins A to reduce not only
210Pb but also U, Ra, and Th."

2.3. Crystallization
We took necessary precautions to avoid contacts between the room’s air and NaI powder
during drying process. We dried the purified NaI solution by a rotary evaporator. We selected
a flask made of synthetic silica glass to avoid the possible pollution from it. We filled pure
nitrogen gas into the flask to break the vacuum when the drying finished. Additional drying
was done by using a vacuum oven before growing NaI(Tl) crystal.
The large volume NaI(Tl) crystal was produced by the Bridgeman-Stockbarger technique.
The purified and dried NaI powder and thallium iodide were filled into a high-purity graphite
crucible. Certain details describing purification of the crucible material can be found in
"[13, 14]. The crucible was installed in a quartz vessel filled with inert gas at the center of"
"the furnace. The crucible was heated to 700 ◦C to melt the NaI powder, and it was slowly"
moved to crystallize. The crystallization takes at least two weeks of cooling and annealing
"to make a transparent, colorless, and large single crystal without any inclusion. The melted"
NaI does not interact and infiltrate the pure graphite crucible because of the special coating
on the surface of the crucible. In the end of crystal formation the NaI(Tl) ingot detaches
from the crucible. We see no evidence of interaction between the crucible and melted NaI.
We think that there is no significant pollution of the NaI(Tl) ingot occurs by the crucible
material.
3. Data taking and analysis
3.1. Detector construction
The original NaI(Tl) ingot was used to make a NaI(Tl) crystal shaped as a cylinder (a
76.2 mm in diameter and 76.2 mm long). An optical window made of synthetic quartz
with 10 mm in thickness was attached on one side of the crystal edge. Other surfaces of
the crystal were covered with an enhanced specular sheet (ESR) made of polyethylene.
The whole crystal was encapsulated into a 4 mm-thick black acrylic container. We used the
acrylic housing to minimize absorption of low energy gamma and X-rays emitted by external
calibration sources.
An acrylic housing enables a low energy calibration down to 6.4 keVee. The Kβ X-rays
emitted after the electron capture of 133Ba are between 34.9 keV and 35.8 keV with total
"intensity of 11.5 % [15]. After the photoelectronic effect on iodine, the ionized iodine emits its"
"Kα X-ray, 28.6 keV and 28.3 keV [15]. If these Kα X-rays escape from the crystal a residual"
energy of approximately 6.4 keV is deposited in a NaI(Tl) scintillator. This low energy peak
is useful to test the stability of low energy calibration.
Acrylic housing has a risk of moisture permeability. We tested deliquesce when the NaI(Tl)
detector was installed in the shield with pure nitrogen. The NaI(Tl) detector has not suffered
any deliquescence for at least 1.8 years.
We made several trials of purification. The details of the NaI(Tl) detectors are listed in
"Table 3. Hereafter, we identify the NaI(Tl) detector by crystal ID shown in Table 3."

3.2. Data acquisition system
"We measured activity of radionuclides remained in the crystals #68, #71 and #73 using"
an ultra low-background setup [14] at the KamLAND underground facility. The radiopurity
of two other crystals (#24 and #85) was measured in a surface laboratory at Tokushima
University.
"In Kamioka, the DAQ system consists of VME based MoGURA electronics [16] produced"
by Tokyo Electron Device Ltd. Several supplementary NIM modules were used to reject
majority of noise pulses from a photomultiplier tube (PMT) [13]. The MoGURA on-board
flash analog-to-digital converters (FADC) can be used to record up to 10 µsec long wave-
forms. Signal selection as well as rejection of the remaining noise pulses from PMT were
done by offline pulse shape analysis (PSD).
"In the surface laboratory, the current pulse from a PMT was divided into three routes and"
digitized by CAMAC ADC [17]. The one was used for a trigger. We introduced one current
signal of the PMT to a charge-sensitive ADC (CSADC: REPIC RPC-022) channel through
a 200 ns cable delay. The CSADC integrates the total charge of the current pulse for 1 µs.
The other current signal was introduced into the other ADC channel directly to integrate it
partially.
The PSD was performed to extract the alpha-ray event. The decay time of the NaI(Tl)
"for an alpha-ray, τα is 190 ns, on the other hand, the one for a beta or gamma-ray, τβ
is 230 ns[18]. This difference enables clear discrimination of an alpha-ray and others. The"
parameter R was calculated as
"R ≡

"t0

where I(t) was the input current. The upper limit and the lower limits of the integration
"are defined as t2, t0, and t1, respectively. The present values of t0, t1, and t2 were listed in"
Table 4.

3.3. Measurement of 40K in underground laboratory
"We analyzed dependence of the concentration of 40K in the NaI(Tl) detectors #68, #71,"
and #73 on various purification methods listed in Table 3.
Fig. 1 The detector and the shield of the present measurement in Kamioka.
We measured the concentration of 40K in the NaI(Tl) crystal at Kamioka Underground lab-
"oratory, Tohoku University. The 40K decays both beta decay (89.26%) and electron capture"
(10.72%). We need a low background environment to measure the tiny amount of radioac-
tivity because of the enormous external background. The Kamioka Underground laboratory
is suitable to reduce the background from cosmic rays. To suppress environmental gamma-
"rays, the detectors were placed inside of an ultra-low background passive shielding made of"
"a 15 ∼ 20 cm-thick lead and a 5 cm-thick 99.99% pure copper layers. Structure and compo-
sition of the passive shielding were also reported in the earlier publications [13, 14]. Figure"
1 shows crystal #73 surrounded by the copper shielding layer. An ultra-low background
"PMT, Hamamatsu Photonics 4-inch R13444X [13], was attached to the optical window of"
the NaI(Tl) crystal by an optical grease. A pure nitrogen gas was supplied into the shield
to purge out air containing radon.

The MoGURA data acquisition system recorded the pulse shape of the PMT output. The
"pulse shape analysis was done, as shown in the left panel of Figure 2. The Energy-Ratio"
distribution makes three loci. The PSD distribution shows the significant distortion above
4000 keVee due to the saturation of PMT output. The beta/gamma-ray energy spectrum was
obtained without distortion to check the existence of the beta-ray (Eβmax = 1311.09 keV)
and gamma-ray (Eγ = 1461 keV) [15]. We selected the beta- and the gamma-ray events by
PSD analysis. The energy spectra observed by the crystals #68 and #71 are shown in the
right panel of Figure 2. There was a clear difference in the energy spectra between crystals
#68 and #71. There was a prominent continuum below 1.3 MeVee of crystal #68 due to the
beta-rays of 40K. The prominent beta-ray spectrum insisted that the 40K was contained in
the NaI(Tl) crystal of #68. The concentration of natK in the crystal #68 was calculated as
"130 ppb by Geant 4.10 Monte Carlo simulation, assuming the natural abundance of 40K in"
"natural potassium is 0.0117%. On the other hand, there were no significant components of"
both beta-ray and gamma-ray from 40K in the energy spectrum of the crystal #71. The beta-
ray event rate in crystal #71 was at least 1/6 smaller than in crystal #68. It corresponds
to the concentration of natK was less than 20 ppb at 90% C. L.
The reproducibility and the effectiveness of the triple RC method were tested by ingot #73.
The upper limit of natK was 30 ppb at 90% C. L. We found that the double RC method
was enough to reduce potassium contamination. We confirmed the double RC method’s
effectiveness by later ingots #76 and #83.
3.4. Measurement of alpha-rays in surface laboratory
We measured the alpha concentration in purified NaI(Tl) crystals. After establishing the
"potassium reduction, we optimized the reduction method of alpha-ray emitters. The present"
crystal #85 was made by the combined method of double RC and resins. We also measured
the alpha-rays in #24 to verify the reduction.
"We accumulated the data for the live-time of 36.33 day×1.279 kg for #85 and
11.2 day×1.279 kg for #24. The result of the PSD analysis with the crystal #85 is
shown in Figure 3. It shows the faint concentration in the region 0.4 < R < 0.45. A large"
"locus around R = 0.53 is the events of beta-rays, gamma-rays, and cosmic-rays. We com-"
"pared the energy spectrum of alpha-rays with one of our previous best NaI(Tl) crystal,"

Fig. 4 The energy spectrum of alpha-ray
taken by crystal #85.
The alpha-ray energy spectrum consists
of two components (see Figure 4). One
is the lower energy region (below 4000
"keVee), and the other is the higher energy"
region (above 4000 keVee). Both compo-
nents have no prominent structure. We
considered that the events above 4000
keVee are an accidental spread of R of high
energy cosmic rays. We assumed there
is a constant background of the cosmic-
ray events below 4000 keVee. The energy
spectrum below 4000 keVee consists of con-
"stant cosmic-ray, alpha-ray emitted in the"
"NaI(Tl) crystal, and alpha-ray emitted on"
the ESR reflector sheet.
We measured the surface concentration of alpha-ray emitters on the ESR sheet to deter-
mine the alpha-ray intensity. We applied the low-background and position-sensitive alpha-ray
"tracker, µ−PIC[20, 21]. No significant excess beyond the background was observed, as shown
in Figure 5. The upper limit of the surface contamination was calculated as 1.77 × 10−3"
alpha/hr/cm2 (90% C. L.).
We simulated the energy spectrum from the ESR sheet by Geant4.10 Monte Carlo simula-
tion [22]. We assumed the origin of the alpha-ray was 210Po because the ESR sheet attracts
"the progeny of 222Rn. 210Pb terminates the decay chain from 222Rn, and accumulated 210Pb"
generates the 210Po. A red line in Figure 4 shows the calculated energy spectrum of 210Po

from the ESR sheet. There is significant excess in the event rate in the low energy region
above the red line. We concluded the excess is due to the alpha-rays emitted in the NaI(Tl)
crystal.
The energy spectrum of alpha-ray from the NaI(Tl) crystal showed no prominent structure.
The event number of alpha ray was too small to perform further analysis such as time-
correlation analysis. We calculated the yield by integrating the number of events instead of
the peak fitting. We set the integration interval according to the quenching factor of alpha-ray
and energy resolution. The alpha-rays which have near energies make a cluster in the energy
spectrum because of low energy resolution. We analyzed the alpha-ray intensity according to
the clusterized energy ranges was calculated according to the quenching factor of alpha-ray
in NaI(Tl) scintillator [19]. The energy listed in Table 5 is the FWHM (Full Width Half-
Maximum) interval of the clusterized peak. The chemical symbol in the parenthesis indicates
"the decay chains of uranium and thorium. The electron equivalent energy of alpha-ray, Eee,"
is derived by
Eee = fαEα. (2)
Where fα is the quenching factor of alpha-ray. We determined fα = 0.58 from the shape of
the energy spectrum.
The alpha-ray of 224Ra lies between (C) and (D) clusters. The alpha-rays of 224Ra con-
tributes both event rates of (C) and (D) because of low energy resolution. We divided two
clusters at the peak energy of the alpha-ray of 224Ra. The event rates of the clusters (C) and
(D) contain half of the 224Ra events. We confirmed the result of this analysis by the data
from crystal #24. The present analysis agrees with the result by peak fitting.
The concentration of radioactivity was calculated from the event numbers in Table 5 and
"the total exposure 36.33 day×1.279 kg. We assumed that all the radioactivities of isotopes
in the decay chain of thorium were in secular equilibrium. The isotopes of uranium-series,
226Ra, 222Rn, 218Po, and 214Po were in secular equilibrium. We did not include 214Po in the"
"present analysis since we cannot take all the events of alpha-rays from 214Po. The half-life of
214Po is as short as 164 µsec, and the dead-time of the present data acquisition system was"

We successfully developed the highly-
radiopure NaI(Tl) scintillator. The severe
"background origins, 40K, 210Pb, and 226Ra,"
were successfully removed by combining
the RC method and resin method. All val-
ues of radioactive imurities in the crystal
#85 were below our goals.
We expect the highly sensitive verifica-
tion of the DAMA/LIBRA experiment. A
large volume scintillator whose dimension
is 12.7 cm in diameter and 12.7 cm in
length is under construction. The expected
energy spectrum due to the intrinsic RIs
are shown in Figure 6. The next origin of
the background is mainly the gamma-ray
from external RIs. They will be selected
and removed by anti-coincidence of arrayed NaI(Tl) detector system.
"We will start the dark matter search experiment by large NaI(Tl) scintillators, PICOLON"
"phase-I, from 2021 spring. It consists of at least four modules of NaI(Tl) scintillator, whose"
total mass is 23.4 kg. We plan the phase-II and phase-III with the total mass of 100 kg and
250 kg of NaI(Tl) crystal to verify and search for new fundamental processes in nuclear and
particle physics.
