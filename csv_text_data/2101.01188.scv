"The detection rate for compact binary mergers has grown as the sensitivity of the global network
of ground based gravitational wave detectors has improved, now reaching the stage where robust
automation of the analyses is essential. Automated low-latency algorithms have been developed
that send out alerts when candidate signals are detected. The alerts include sky maps to facilitate
electromagnetic follow up observations, along with probabilities that the system might contain a
neutron star, and hence be more likely to generate an electromagnetic counterpart. Data quality is-
sues, such as loud noise transients (glitches), can adversely affect the low-latency algorithms, causing
false alarms and throwing off parameter estimation. Here a new analysis method is presented that is
robust against glitches, and capable of producing fully Bayesian parameter inference, including sky
maps and mass estimates, in a matter of minutes. Key elements of the method are wavelet-based
de-noising, penalized maximization of the likelihood during the initial search, rapid sky localization
using pre-computed inner products, and heterodyned likelihoods for full Bayesian inference."
I. INTRODUCTION
"What started with a trickle in 2015 [1] has now turned
into a veritable deluge [2, 3] of gravitational wave signals
detected by the LIGO and Virgo instruments. Keep-
ing up with the ever increasing event rate is challeng-
ing. While the searches for gravitational wave signals are
now highly automated and capable of producing near-
real time alerts [4–8], full parameter inference [9, 10] has
lagged behind. This is in part due to the large compu-
tational cost of fully Bayesian parameter inference, and
in part due to the challenge of working with data that
needs to be carefully calibrated [11, 12] and cleaned of
various noise contaminants [13–16]."
"The instrument noise in the LIGO and Virgo data is,
for the most part, well described as locally stationary
and Gaussian [17]. Short duration signals, such as high
mass binary black holes, are in the sensitive band of the
detector for a second or less, and the odds of the signal
encountering a noise transient is low. However, for longer
duration signals, such as low mass black hole binaries or
systems that include a neutron star, the signals are in the
sensitive band of the detectors for tens of seconds or even
minutes, and it is likely that the signal will encounter a
noise transient. As the low-frequency sensitivity of the
detectors improve, low mass systems are virtually guar-
anteed to encounter noise transients. The LIGO/Virgo
analyses have been fortified against noise transients using
a combination of vetoes [18], glitch robust search statis-
tics [19], gating [20] and glitch subtraction [16]. Gating
of glitches is used in the online searches, while glitch sub-
traction is performed prior to off-line parameter estima-
tion."
"Here a proof of concept for a robust end-to-end
low-latency Bayesian parameter estimation algorithm -
QuickCBC - is presented. The QuickCBC algorithm reads
in calibrated strain data, performs robust on-source spec-
tral estimation, executes a rapid search for compact bi-
nary coalescence (CBC) signals, uses wavelet de-noising
to subtract any glitches from the search residuals, pro-"
"duces low-latency sky maps and initial parameter es-
timates, followed by full Bayesian parameter estima-
tion. For binary black holes the entire process takes
just minutes on a laptop; for binary neutron stars, ini-
tial sky maps and mass estimates are ready in min-
utes, and full results are ready in less than an hour.
The QuickCBC code is open source https://github.
com/eXtremeGravityInstitute/QuickCBC, and can be
used to analyze public LIGO-Virgo data hosted by the
Gravitational Wave Open Science Center https://www.
gw-openscience.org. For testing purposes the algo-
rithm was run in real time during the LIGO-Virgo O3
observing run, automatically generating results for trig-
gers sent to the Gravitational-Wave Candidate Event
Database."
"Existing algorithms can perform most of the indi-
vidual steps in the QuickCBC algorithm. For example,
the PyCBC search algorithm [20] performs low-latency
searches for CBC signals that incorporate glitch mit-
igation via a chi-squared test [19] and automatic gat-
ing of loud glitches [20]. The BayesWave algorithm [16,
21, 22], produces on-source spectral estimates and per-
forms glitch subtraction [3, 23, 24]. The BayesStar algo-
rithm [25] produces low-latency sky maps to help guide
the search for electromagnetic counterparts to binary
mergers, and several rapid parameter estimation algo-
rithms have been developed [26–30]. What is novel is
that QuickCBC is a fully automated, end-to-end analy-
sis algorithm that is robust against glitches, and able to
produce reliable results in a matter of minutes. Many
of the methods used by QuickCBC, such as wavelet de-
noising [31], banded likelihoods for glitch rejection, and
heterodyned likelihoods for rapid inference [32, 33], are
new to LIGO-Virgo data analysis."
"Core elements of the QuickCBC algorithm have been
merged with the BayesWave algorithm [34]. The key
difference between the implementations is that the
BayesWave variant [35] jointly marginalizes over the CBC
signal parameters, a model for the power spectral density
(PSD) and a wavelet based model for noise transients."

"The QuickCBC algorithm uses a fixed PSD and a point
estimate for any noise transients. The other key differ-
ence is speed: QuickCBC can be provide results with a la-
tency of minutes, while the more refined BayesWave+CBC
analysis [35] takes hours."
II. OVERVIEW OF THE QUICKCBC ALGORITHM
"The QuickCBC algorithm works with short snippets of
LIGO-Virgo data, typically 4 to 8 seconds in length when
searching for binary black holes and 16 to 32 seconds in
length when searching for binary neutron stars. The run
time scales roughly linearly with the data volume."
"The first step is to produce estimates for the power
spectral density in each detector. On-source spectral es-
timation, where the short segment of data to be searched
is also used to estimate the power spectral density (PSD),
can be thrown off by the presence of loud signals or loud
glitches. To avoid such biases, QuickCBC uses an itera-
tive approach that combines a running median estimate
for the spectrum with spectral line identification and
wavelet de-noising [31]. The de-noising removes signals
and glitches, so only the spectral estimate from the first
stage of the analysis is passes to the second stage. The
second stage performs a rapid, network coherent search
for CBC signals using a parallel tempered Markov Chain
Monte Carlo algorithm (PTMCMC) [36] with a banded
likelihood that is analytically maximized over amplitude,
phase and arrival time. Only the intrinsic parameters
of the signal - masses and spins - are explored by the
PTMCMC. The banded likelihood automatically identi-
fies and rejects frequency bands that are impacted by
noise transients. The removal is done separately for each
time delay, resulting in a robust time-frequency glitch
rejection method that can detect signals in the presence
of glitches. The third stage subtracts the best-fit CBC
waveform from the data, and performs a second round
of spectral estimation and wavelet de-noising. The de-
noising produces a glitch model that is subtracted from
the original data, while preserving any gravitational wave
signals. The cleaned data and updated spectral estimates
are used in the subsequent stages of the analysis. The
fourth stage refines the estimates of the intrinsic param-
eters using a standard non-maximized and non-banded
likelihood function. Consequently, the amplitude, phase
and arrival time at each detector also have to be explored
by the PTMCMC. The refined estimates for the intrinsic
parameters are then passed to the fifth stage of the anal-
ysis, which uses a PTMCMC algorithm with an algebraic
likelihood function to map out the extrinsic parameters
of the source - sky location, luminosity distance, inclina-
tion and polarization angles while holding the intrinsic
parameters fixed. Since the extrinsic parameters only im-
pact the projection of the waveform onto the detectors,
the inner products in the likelihood can be pre-computed,
resulting in an algebraic likelihood function that can be
evaluated in a fraction of a microsecond [37]. With the"
"first five stages complete the algorithm will have pro-
duced a full three-dimensional sky map (RA, DEC and
luminosity distance), along with estimates for the com-
ponent masses and spins. All in about the time is took
you to read this paragraph. The precise run time will
depend on the duration and bandwidth of the signal and
the speed and number of computations cores. For binary
black hole systems at current LIGO/Virgo sensitivity it is
usually sufficient to use 4 seconds of data sampled at 2048
Hz. For neutron star - black hole systems it is enough
to use 8 to 16 seconds of data sampled at 2048 Hz, while
for binary neutron star systems we need 16 to 32 seconds
of data sampled at 4096 Hz. For a binary black hole
system, running on a 2016 MacBook Pro laptop with
a 2.9 GHz quad-core processor, it takes ∼ 60 seconds
for the PSD estimation and intrinsic parameter search,
and an additional ∼ 30 seconds to complete the extrin-
sic parameter search and produce sky maps. The cost
of the intrinsic parameter search scales linearly with the
data duration, while the cost of the extrinsic parameter
search scales linearly with the sample rate. Thus, the in-
trinsic parameter search for neutron-star black hole bina-
ries takes either two to four times longer than for binary
black holes, but time to produce a sky map is the same.
Sky maps can be produced in very low latency by skip-
ping the intrinsic search and instead using the intrinsic
parameters provided by the search pipelines (as is done
by BayesStar [25]). The run time to produce a sky map
with QuickCBC is comparable to, or a little faster than,
BayesStar. The main difference is that the QuickCBC
maps are fully Bayesian, while BayesStar maps are only
approximately so."
"The final stage of the algorithm refines the initial pa-
rameter estimates using a PTMCMC algorithm and a
fast, heterodyned likelihood function [32, 33]. The het-
erodyned likelihood offers significant speed advantages,
especially for long duration signals such as binary neu-
tron star inspirals. The run-time for the final PTMCMC
stage scales linearly with the sample rate and is indepen-
dent of the observation time. On the same laptop com-
puter described earlier, the PTMCMC stage takes four
minutes for black hole binaries and neutron star - black
hole binaries, and eight minutes for neutron star bina-
ries. These run-times are several orders magnitude faster
than the hours or days it takes for LALinference [9, 10]
to produce results."
A. Spectral Estimation and Wavelet De-noising
"The QuickCBC algorithm is design to work with short
stretches of data, typically between Tobs = 4 and Tobs =
32 seconds in duration. Traditional spectral estimation
techniques, such as Welch averaging, can not be used on
short data segments like these. The advantages of work-
ing with short data segments are speed and robustness
against non-stationary drifts in the power spectrum. The
disadvantages are low spectral resolution and possible bi-"

time domain data, d(t), is read in, windowed, and Fourier"
"transform to produce d̃(f). An initial on-source PSD esti-
mate S(f) is produced using wavelet de-noising to remove
glitch and signal power. Next the data is searched using a
glitch-robust likelihood function that maximizes over extrin-
sic parameters and returns initial estimates for the intrinsic
parameters ~η. The PSD estimation is then repeated on the
residual d−h(~η), and wavelet de-noising is used to fit and re-
move any glitches g̃(f) that might be present in the data. The"
"de-glitched data, d̃(f)− g̃(f), is used to pre-compute various
inner products for the projected network likelihood, allowing"
"for a rapid mapping of the extrinsic parameters ~ξ, such as the
sky position and luminosity distance. The initial estimates"
"for the full set of parameters ~θ = {~η, ~ξ}, are used along with
the de-glitched data and refined PSD estimate to initialize the
heterodyned likelihood function that is used by the PTMCMC
algorithm to rapidly produce full posterior distribution."
"ases due to the presence of loud signals or glitches. To
guard against such biases an iterative wavelet de-noising
approach is used to remove non-Gaussian features from
the data."
"The iterative spectral estimation procedure proceeds
as follows: A Tukey window is applied to the data to
limit spectral leakage. A FFT is then used to produce
a periodogram Sp(f). A running median of width ∆f
is used to smooth the periodogram. The width of the"

timation and de-noising procedure applied to four seconds

The initial spectral estimation and whitening (upper panel)
is impacted by the loud signal from GW150914. Wavelet de-
noising is used to remove the excess power, then the spectral
estimation is repeated. The original data is re-whitened (mid-
dle panel) ready for the next iteration. The process is iterated
until the excess SNR plateaus. The bottom panel shows the
de-noised data used to produce the final spectral estimate."
"smoothing window ∆f is chosen to strike a balance be-
tween following the slope of the spectrum (small ∆f ’s
follow the slope), and ignoring sharp spectral lines (large
∆f ’s are robust against lines). More accurately, it is the
number of Fourier samples in the smoothing window that
is critical, so for longer observation times smaller win-
dows can be used. For the shortest 4 second segments
the default width is ∆f = 16 Hz. The smoothed spectral
estimate Ss(f) is used to identify spectral lines, which
are found by taking the ratio R(f) = Sp(f)/Ss(f), with
lines defined as regions where this ratio exceeds R∗ = 10.
The full spectral estimate is then given by"
S(f) =
"{
Ss(f), for R(f) ≤ R∗
Sp(f), for R(f) > R∗"
"The initial spectral estimate is used to whiten the
data: d̃(f) → d̃w(f) = d̃(f)/"
"√
S(f). The whitened"
"data is wavelet transformed using an over-complete col-
lection of Morlet-Gabor continuous wavelets (see the
top panel of Figure 2). A wavelet de-noising proce-
dure [31] is then used to remove any non-Gaussian fea-
tures from the data. Wavelet de-noising is basically a
time-frequency thresholding technique. For stationary
Gaussian noise, the wavelet power spectrum, Snm, should
follow a chi-squared distribution with two degrees of free-
dom. Wavelet pixels with power above a certain thresh-
old are identified, then an inverse wavelet transform of
these pixels is used to produce a whitened time domain
reconstruction of the excess power. The reconstructed
feature is re-colored using the smooth component of the"
"power spectrum Ss(f) and subtracted from the original
time domain data. The thresholding procedure starts by
identifying pixels with Snm > S0, then surrounding pix-
els with Sn±1m±1 > S1 are also flagged, with the goal
of identifying clusters of excess power. The standard
threshold values are S0 = 10 and S1 = 6. The power
spectral estimation is repeated using the de-noised data.
The updated power spectrum is then used to whiten the
original data, and the wavelet de-noising procedure is re-
peated. The entire procedure is iterated until the signal-
to-noise of the non-Gaussian excess plateaus. This typi-
cally takes just one or two iterations, but data with very
loud glitches may require as many as five or six iterations
for the procedure to converge."
"Figure 2 illustrates the spectral estimation and de-
noising procedure using 4 seconds of data surrounding
GW150914. The initial spectral estimate used to whiten
the data (top panel) overestimates the height of the spec-
trum through the band between ∼ 40Hz → 120Hz due
to the loud gravitational wave signal. The data in the
middle panel is whitened using the updated spectrum
found after the initial round of wavelet de-noising. More
features are now visible in the mid-band frequencies. In
this example the procedure converged after two itera-
tions. The lower panel shows the de-noised data that
was used to produce the final spectral estimate. Figure
3 shows the whitened time domain reconstruction of the
feature that was removed by the de-noising process. In
this instance the feature is the gravitational wave signal
from a binary black hole merger. It would be a bad idea
to use the wavelet de-noised data from the spectral esti-
mation procedure for subsequent stages in the analysis!
Instead, just the spectral estimate is used."

"The final stage of the QuickCBC spectral estimation
procedure is to fit a fixed dimension version of the"
"BayesWave trans-dimensional spectral model [21, 22] to
the glitch-subtracted data. The spectral model includes
a smooth component described by a cubic spline, and line
features described by a Lorentzian line model. The run-
ning median is used to initialize the spline model. The
spacing of the spline points is determined by comparing
two running averages of the running median, one with a
window twice as wide as the other. The usual choice is to
use 4 Hz and an 8 Hz window. The spline control points
are spaced more closely in regions where the two aver-
ages diverge, and spaced further apart in regions where
the two averages converge. The minimum spacing of the
spline control points is set at 4 Hz and the maximum
spacing is set at 32 Hz. The threshold on the ratio of the
the two averages is set at 20%. The Lorentzian line model
is initialized using the outliers from the running median
to set the initial location, amplitude and width of the
lines. A simple fixed dimension MCMC is then used to
refine the model parameters. To control unphysical oscil-
lations in the spline model, a prior is used that penalizes
points with large second derivatives. Figure 4 compares
the QuickCBC spectral estimate to the estimate from the
BayesWave algorithm [21, 22]. The QuickCBC estimate
agrees very well with the BayesWave estimate. The key
difference is that the QuickCBC estimate is produced in
seconds, while the more refined BayesWave estimate takes
tens of minutes or longer to produce."

B. Parallel Tempered Markov Chain Monte Carlo
"The QuickCBC algorithm uses a Parallel Tempered
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PTMCMC) algorithm [36,
38, 39] for both the initial search, the fast sky map-"
"ping and the full parameter inference. The implemen-
tation varies slightly between the different stages, mostly
in terms of the likelihood function used, but the central
engine is the same."
"The PTMCMC algorithm uses a collection of chains
that explore likelihoods that are scaled by “inverse tem-"
"peratures” βi: lnL(βi, ~θ) = βi lnL(~θ). Chains with
βi = 1 explore the target posterior, while chains with
βi > 1 range more widely, and help chains to escape
from local maxima. Chains with βi < 1 can be used to
help lock on to weak signals. The temperature ladder
is set so that there are multiple “cold” chains: βi = 1
for i = [1, Nc] that interact with Nh “hot” chains on a
geometrically spaced temperature ladder: βk = α"
"k for
k = [1, Nh]. The choice of increment α and the num-
ber of hot chains are tunable parameters. Setting α too
large will result in poor exchange between chains. Set-
ting α too small will require a prohibitive number of
chains to reach the desired maximum temperature. A
good rule-of-thumb for the maximum temperature is that
the effective signal-to-noise ratio for the hottest chain,
SNRNh = SNR"
"√
βNk should be of order 4-5. For typ-"
"ical LIGO-Virgo signals with SNR ∼ 10 → 20 we need
βNk ∼ 1/4 → 1/16. Using a spacing of α = 0.8 requires
of order Nh ∼ 6 → 12 hot chains to reach the desired
maximum temperature. These rule-of-thumb settings for
the PTMCMC temperature ladder have been found to
work in practice, but the efficiency could be improved
by using dynamic temperature spacing [39]. When loud
signals (SNR > 30) are detected, it may be necessary to
start a new analysis with additional chains to have a high
enough maximum temperature."
"Each chain is updated using a mixture of proposal
distributions. The standard mix includes draws from
the prior distribution, jumps along eigenvectors of the
Fisher information matrix, differential evolution, Gaus-
sian jumps along each intrinsic parameter direction and
a dedicated extrinsic parameter proposal that draws new
sky locations that maintain the time delay between a
randomly selected pair of detectors, while analytically
adjusting the other extrinsic parameters to keep the de-
tector frame waveforms unchanged. The extrinsic pro-
posal is described in detail in section IVa of Ref. [16]."
"The Fisher information matrix proposal is based on a
quadratic expansion of the log likelihood:"

"The reference value ~θ is updated to the current value of

values λk, found by solving the linear system"

"where γ ∼ N (0, 1) is a zero mean, unit variance Gaus-
sian deviate. The proposal densities for this jump can-
cel in the Metropolis-Hastings ratio since the Fisher ma-
trix is held fixed (aside from occasional infrequent up-
dates). Jumping along eigen-directions is more robust
that drawing from the full Fisher matrix, as the matri-
ces are often poorly-conditioned. The poor conditioning
typically only impacts one or two eigen-directions, and
still allows for good acceptance of jumps along the other
eigen-directions. Small Gaussian jumps along individual
parameter directions are included in the proposal mix to
help cover directions that might not be explored well by
the Fisher matrix jumps."
"Differential evolution (DE) proposals [40] are particu-
larly good at exploring degenerate directions in parame-
ter space - the very same directions that cause the Fisher
matrix to become ill-conditioned. The variant of differ-
ential evolution used by QuickCBC works as follows: A
history array of past samples, z is collected for each tem-
perature level (with multiple copies for the cold chains).
The array is initialized with draws from the prior. Sam-
ples are added to the history array after every ∼ 10 it-
erations. A counter j keeps track of how many samples
have been added. The new sample added is added to the
array at index j(modNH). That is, when j reaches NH
the first entry in the array gets replaced and so on. The
DE proposal is made as follows: Two samples, k, l, are
drawn from the history array and used to propose a new
location"
y = x + γ(zk − zl) . (6)
"Here γ is drawn from a Gaussian of width 2.38/
√"
"2d for
90% of the DE updates, where d is number of parameters,
and set to γ = 1 for the rest. The proposal is symmet-
ric, so the proposal densities cancel in the Metropolis-
Hastings ratio. The Gaussian DE jumps are good for
exploring local correlations, while the γ = 1 DE jumps
allow the chains to move between discrete modes of the
posterior."
"The QuickCBC sampler is currently limited to using
waveform templates that describe non-precessing, quasi-
circular binaries. These templates can be parameterized
in terms of four intrinsic parameters and seven extrinsic"
"parameters. The intrinsic parameters are the individual
mass m1,m2 and the aligned dimensionless spins χ1, χ2."
"Here χ = ~χ · L̂, where ~χ = ~S/m2 is the dimensionless
spin vector and L̂ is a unit vector aligned with the orbital
angular momentum. The seven extrinsic parameters are
the sky location RA, DEC = (α, β), luminosity distance
DL, polarization and inclination (ψ, ι), merger time and
merger phase (tc, φc)."
The QuickCBC sampler uses the modified collection
"of parameters ~η → {lnM, lnM,χ1, χ2} and ~ξ →
{α, sinβ, lnDL, ψ, cos ι, φc, tc, }, where M = m1 + m2 is
the total mass and M = (m1m2)3/5/M1/5 is the chirp
mass. The priors are taken to be uniform in all the pa-
rameters save for M,M,DL. For the masses the pri-
ors are uniform in m1,m2, which can be enforced us-
ing the Jacobian factor JM = Mm1m2/"

L. Some waveform mod-"
"els, such as the IMRPhenomD model [41, 42] used to
produce the plots in this paper, are only considered
to be reliable for a sub-set of mass ratios and spins.
To account for this, the prior ranges for the IMRPhe-
nomD analyses are restricted such that m1/m2 < 18 and
|χ| < χmax = 0.85. The default prior on the spins is uni-
form in the aligned spin component. To facilitate com-
parison with the IMRPhenomPv2 precessing model [43],
which uses a uniform-in-direction spin prior, a second
spin prior option can be selected that is uniform in the
aligned spin component for isotopically distributed spins,
namely, p(χ) = ln(χmax/|χ|)/(2χmax)."
C. Glitch Robust Coherent Search
"The QuickCBC algorithm can be used to search for CBC
signals in segments of LIGO/Virgo data. The standard
usage is to follow-up triggers from template-bank based
CBC search pipelines, but any valid GPS time will do.
QuickCBC executes a stochastic search using a PTMCMC
algorithm and a glitch-robust maximized likelihood func-
tion. The search is limited to the dominant waveform
harmonic for non-precessing, quasi-circular binaries. As
such, the search may fail to detect systems with signifi-
cant contributions from higher modes, strongly precess-
ing systems, or highly eccentric systems. Extending the
search to include higher modes is straightforward. In-
cluding precession and eccentricity is far more challeng-
ing."

is held fixed and the (da|da) term is a constant that
can be ignored. Standard tricks are used to maximize
over the amplitude, phase and arrival time of the wave-
forms. Writing the signal in terms of unit normalized
sine and cosine quadratures, (ha,s|ha,s) = (ha,c|ha,c) = 1,
(ha,s|ha,c) = 0:"
"ha(f) = Aa (ha,s(f) sinφa + ha,c(f) cosφa) , (14)"
"the log likelihood (dropping the (da|da) constant term)
becomes"
"lnLa = Aaρa(ta, ~η) cos(φa − ϕa(ta, ~η))−
1"
"2
A2a , (15)"
"where ~η are the intrinsic parameters of the source, and
ρa(ta, ~η) = |za(ta, ~η)|, ϕa(ta, ~η) = arg{za(ta, ~η)} where"
"za(ta, ~η) = 4"
"∫
da(f)h"
"∗
a,c(f, ~η)"
"Sn(f)
e2πifta . (16)"
"The likelihood is maximized with respect to amplitude
and phase by setting Aa = ρa and φa = ϕa:"
"lnLa,max(ta, ~η) =
1"
"2
ρ2a(ta, ~η) . (17)"
"The complex SNR time series za(ta, ~η) can be computed
using an inverse fast Fourier transform. The likelihood
can then be maximized with respect to the time offset ta
by sorting the resulting time series ρa(ta, ~η). The network
likelihood"
"lnLmax({ti}, ~η) =
1"
"ρ2a(ta, ~η) (18)"
"can be maximized with respect to the arrival times in
each detector, {ti}, subject to the constraint that the
time differences ∆tij = |ti − tj | are less than the light
travel times between the detector sites. The maximiza-
tion is done pair-wise between detectors, starting with
a reference detector. For networks with three or more
detectors the pair-wise approach can yield collections of
time delays that do not correspond to any physical sky lo-
cation. Similarly, the relative phases may not correspond
to any physical sky location, inclination and polarization
angle. In most cases this is not a problem as the extrin-
sic parameters get refined in the subsequent sky-mapping
stage of the analysis."
"When glitches are present in the data, the log likeli-
hood times series in each detector, lnLa,max(ta, ~η), may
have multiple distinct maxima. Some of these maxima
will be associated with glitches and some will be asso-
ciated with the signal. To account for this possibility,
all maxima that are at least 50 ms apart are recored for
each detector before applying the network time-delay re-
striction. The algorithm can return multiple solutions,
each with different arrival times, amplitudes and phases.
A glitch rejection step is then applied to each candidate
solution before arriving at a unique maximum likelihood
solution."
2. Banded Glitch Rejection
"CBC searches use variants of the ρ search statistic,
defined for data d and templates h as"
"ρ =
(d|h)"
"(h|h)1/2
. (19)"
"When a glitch is present in the data, d = n + g, the
template can ring-off against the glitch. Usually this oc-
curs across a narrow band of frequencies. Looking at
how ρ accumulates with frequency can be used to detect
glitches. Rather than steadily accumulating, ρ gets a big
boost in the frequency band where the signal crosses a
glitch. Motivated by these considerations, a chi-squared
test for glitch rejection has been incorporated into CBC
searches [19]. The statistic uses frequency bands on vary-
ing width, with the width chosen so that the template has
equal SNR="
"√
(h|h) in each band."

"FIG. 5: The banded ρ̄ statistic as a function of central fre-
quency for a template with chirp mass M = 1.197M�, total
mass M = 2.8M� and merger time tc = 1187008882.4486
GPS seconds. The ρ̄ statistic successfully identifies the fre-
quency bands where the signal track crosses a loud noise tran-
sient in the LIGO Livingston detector."
"Here we introduce a variant of this approach with
fixed-width frequency bands. Defining the ρ̄ statistic:"
"ρ̄(f,∆f) =
(d− h|h)maxφ0"
"(h|h)1/2
(20)"
"where the noise-weighted inner products are computed
across a frequency band of width ∆f , centered at fre-
quency f . The inner product of the residual, d− h, and
the template, h, is analytically maximized with respect to
the overall phase in that band using sine/cosine quadra-
tures. In pure Gaussian noise, d = n, we have"
"E[ρ̄] = 1− SNR, Var[ρ̄] = 1. (21)"
"When the template matches a signal in the data, d =
n+ h, we have"
"E[ρ̄] = 1, Var[ρ̄] = 1. (22)"
"When a glitch is present in the data, d = n + g the
template rings-off against a glitch and ρ̄(f,∆f) becomes
large and positive. Frequency bands where ρ̄(f,∆f) > 4
are excluded from the likelihood calculation. The am-
plitude and phase maximization are repeated for the full
template with any glitch-impacted bands removed. The
banded glitch rejection is applied to the collection of can-
didate solutions from the original likelihood maximiza-
tion step. The solution with the largest banded likelihood
is returned and used by the PTMCMC search algorithm."
D. Glitch Removal
"The PTMCMC search using the banded maximum
likelihood function returns an initial estimate for the ex-
trinsic parameters of the signal, along with the arrival"
"times, amplitudes and phases in each detector. This
solution is then used to subtract the CBC signal from
the data. The residual is then processed through the
same spectral estimation procedure that was applied to
the original data. Figure 6 shows the reconstructed
glitch model for residual in the LIGO Livingston detec-
tor roughly a second before the merger of binary neutron
star GW170817."

GW170817 signal, which is coincident with the glitch, was
subtracted from the data."
"Figure 7 shows time-frequency maps of the LIGO Liv-
ingston data surrounding the GW170817 event. The up-
per panel shows the time-frequency track for the point
estimate of the signal that was subtracted from the data
prior to the second round of spectral estimation and
wavelet de-noising. The lower panel shows the whitened
data after the noise transient has been removed. All sub-
sequent stages of the analysis are performed using the
glitch subtracted data."
E. Low Latency Sky Mapping
"The search phase delivers an estimate for the intrinsic
parameters, in addition to the amplitudes, phases and
arrival times in each detector. The next step is to find ex-
trinsic parameters that are consistent with the waveforms
seen in each detector. With three or more detectors the
problem of solving for the extrinsic parameters ~ξ given
the relative amplitudes, arrival times and phases is over-
constrained, and often ill-posed due to noise. Rather
than trying to solve the problem analytically, we once
again resort to a Monte Carlo approach, this time aided
by an extremely cheap-to-compute likelihood function."
"When the intrinsic parameters ~η are held fixed, the
response in each detector can be found by applying pro-
jections to a reference geocenter waveform that amount
to amplitude re-scalings, phase shifts and time shifts (see"
"FIG. 7: Time-frequency maps of the LIGO Livingston data
centered at GPS time 1187008882. The upper panel shows the
raw whitened data. The black line indicates the reconstructed
time-frequency track for GW170817 found using the banded
maximum likelihood. The best-fit signal is subtracted from
the data, then wavelet de-noising is used to identify any noise
transients in the data. The noise transients are removed from
the original data in preparation for more refined parameter
estimation (lower panel)."

"can be evaluated using a Fast Fourier transform (FFT).
In order to have sufficient time resolution (typically a
tenth of a millisecond or less), it is necessary to zero-
pad the frequency series prior to performing the FFT.
Nonetheless, the computational cost is small. Putting
everything together we have"
"lnL(~ξ, ~θ) =
∑

"2Fa|Ca(ta)| cos(λa−arg{Ca(ta)})−

"(25)
The quantities Da and Ca(ta) can be pre-computed and
stored for any choice of intrinsic parameters ~η. The like-
lihood for any set of extrinsic parameters can then be
found at the cost of a few multiplications and a cosine,
allowing for millions of likelihood evaluations per second.

"A PTMCMC algorithm is used to explore the extrinsic
parameters. The initial “burn-in” phase can be acceler-
ated by randomly trying out sky locations until one is
found that yields the correct time delays between the de-
tectors to within some pre-defined tolerance. However
the likelihood evaluation is so fast that such acceleration
is not necessary, and the chains can simply be initialized
at some random draw from the prior distribution. During
the burn-in phase the extrinsic PTMCMC uses the same
number of chains and the same temperature ladder as
the intrinsic PTMCMC from the coherent search. Each
chain inherits the intrinsic parameters from the search
phase. A mixture of proposal distributions are employed:
Jumps along eigenvectors of the extrinsic Fisher matrix"
"ΓEij ; small Gaussian jumps along each extrinsic parameter
direction; and deterministic jumps along sky rings that
preserve the time delay between a randomly selected pair
of detectors [16]. Samples from the chains with unit in-
verse temperature are used to produce low latency sky
maps such as the example shown in Figure 8."
F. CBC Parameter Estimation
"The rapid coherent search and low latency sky map-
ping yield a good starting solution for a Bayesian explo-
ration of source parameters. The inference is performed
using the PTMCMC sampler Fisher matrix proposals,
differential evolution, deterministic sky ring jumps in the
extrinsic parameters and small Gaussian jumps along
each parameter direction. The analysis is sped up by
using a heteroydned likelihood function [32, 33]."
"The heteroydyned likelihood uses a reference waveform
h̄, in this case the maximum likelihood solution from the
search, to re-write the log likelihood as"
"lnLa = (r̄a|h̄a) +
1"
"2
(h̄a|h̄a)− (r̄a|∆h̄a)−"
"2
(∆h̄a|∆h̄a)."
"(29)
where r̄a = da− h̄a and ∆ha = h̄a−ha. The (r̄a|h̄a) and
(h̄a|h̄a) terms in the likelihood can be computed once and
stored. The (∆ha|∆ha) term can be written as"

∆Φ(f) = Φ̄(f)−Φ(f). The phase difference between the
reference waveform h̄, and waveforms drawn from the
posterior distribution h will always be small, so using a
reference waveform effectively heterodynes the numera-
tor of equation (30), rending it a slowly varying function
of frequency. The (r̄a|∆ha) in the likelihood can be writ-
ten as"
"(r̄a|∆ha) = 4

"is the heterodyned difference in the waveforms, whitened
by the smooth component of the amplitude spectral den-
sity. The integrands in (30) and (31) can be written as
products of a slowly varying function s(f) and a rapidly
varying function r(f). In equation (30) the numerator"
"is a slowly varying function, while the inverse of the
full power spectral density is a rapidly varying function
due to the spectral lines. In equation (31) the real and
imaginary parts of ∆hw are slowly varying while the real
and imaginary parts of the heterodyned residual r̄w are
rapidly varying. The integrals (in practice sums over fre-
quency) can be evaluated accurately and rapidly using a
Legendre polynomial expansion. The sum over frequency
is broken up into bands of width ∆f and the discrete
Legendre polynomial expansions of the rapidly varying
function r(f) are computed once and stored for each fre-
quency band. Each frequency band covers M = Tobs∆f
frequencies, and the number of bands is K = 2fring/∆f ,
where fring is the ringdown frequency of the reference
waveform. The discrete values of the rapidly varying
function in each band can be expanded in a sum of dis-
crete Legendre polynomials:"
"M∑
`=0"
ρ`P`(k) (34)
"where P`(k) are the discrete Legendre polynomials of or-
der ` [44] and the expansion coefficients are given by"
ρ` = α`
"M∑
k=0"
"P`(k)rk , (35)"
"where α` is a normalization constant. The contribution
to the inner products from each frequency band are given
by"
"M∑
k=0"
"skrk '
1∑
`=0"
"α−1` ρ`σ` , (36)"
"where σ` are the expansion coefficients for the slowly
varying function s(f) and the sum has been restricted to
just the first two terms in the Legendre expansion, which
is usually sufficient when using short frequency bands,
∆f ≤ 4 Hz. For the slowly varying function s(f) the
required expansion coefficients in the k < K frequency
band are given by σ0 = (s((k + 1)∆f) + s(k∆f))/2 and
σ1 = (s((k+ 1)∆f)− s(k∆f))/2. The sum (36) includes
the first and last bins in each frequency band, so there is
a double counting of the contributions from these bins,
which can be corrected for by subtracting the sum over
the K−2 repeated values values. The heterodyning pro-
cedure speeds up the likelihood calculations by a factor
of ∼ M , with the largest speed up being for low mass,
long duration signals such as those from binary neutron
star mergers."
G. Examples from GWTC-2
"To illustrate the performance of the sampler, two ex-
amples were chosen from the second Gravitational Wave
Transient Catalog, GWTC-2 [3]. The first example,"
"GW190924 021846, was chosen as it was one of the
signals flagged for glitch removal.The second example,
GW190719 215514, was chosen as it has among the low-
est signal-to-noise ratios, and thus posed more of a chal-
lenge for the initial search."
"The prior ranges on the masses were set between
0.25M� and 150M�. The priors on the aligned spin com-
ponents were chosen to correspond to a uniform distri-
bution of spin directions and magnitudes in an effort to
mimic the priors used in the reference LIGO/Virgo anal-
yses which using the IMRPhenomPv2 precessing spin
model [43]. The analyses shown here used the IMRPhe-
nomD phenomenological model [42], which describes the
dominant ` = |m| = 2 mode of a quasi-circular, spin-
aligned binary system. To stay within the domain of
validity of this model the maximum spin magnitude was
set to χmax = 0.85 and the maximum mass ratio was set
to m1/m2 < 18."
"FIG. 9: Time-frequency maps of LIGO Livingston data cen-
tered at GPS time 1253326744. The black line indicates the

panel shows the whitened data after wavelet de-noising."
"Figure 9 illustrates the output of the search phase and
glitch removal for GW190924 021846. A moderately loud
glitch that intersects the time-frequency track of the sig-
nal was identified and removed from the data."
"Figure 10 compares the output of the full QuickCBC
analysis using the internally de-noised with the pub-
licly released LALinference samples available from the
GWOSC website. The LALinference used a BayesWave
PSD and glitch model. The results show good agree-
ment, the main difference being that the QuickCBC anal-
ysis took a few minutes while the LALinference analysis
took a few days."

posed no obstacle to the QuickCBC analysis, with the
search phase locking onto the signal after a few hundred"
"iterations. The posterior distributions from the two
samplers are again in good agreement."
III. SUMMARY
"The QuickCBC analysis pipeline is an end-to-end, open-
source tool for gravitational wave data analysis. Its key
features are speed and robustness against noise tran-
sients. The main limitation of the pipeline is that it
currently only works with the IMRPhenomD waveform
model. A near-term development goal is to expand
the range of waveform models, starting with the IM-
RPhenomHM model [45], which includes contributions
from higher modes, and the IMRPhenomD NRTidal
model [46] which includes tidal effects for binanry neu-
tron star mergers. A longer term goal is to add precessing
spin models."
"Possible uses for the QuickCBC pipeline for researchers
outside the LIGO/Virgo collaboration are as a platform
to develop novel analyses that can be applied to the pub-
licly released data. Within the LIGO/Virgo collabora-
tion the pipeline could be used to generate low latency
sky maps, and to provide estimates for how likely it is
that the system will result in the disruption of a neu-
tron star, and thus a good candidate for producing an
electromagnetic counterpart."
