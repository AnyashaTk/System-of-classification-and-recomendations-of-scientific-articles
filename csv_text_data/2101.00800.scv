"2019. At 1.7 hours after the issue of its preliminary alert, we started a target-of-opportunity"
imaging observation in Y -band to search for its optical counterpart using the Hyper Suprime-
Cam (HSC) on the Subaru Telescope. The observation covers a 118.8 deg2 sky area cor-
responding to 11.6% confidence in the localization skymap released in the preliminary alert
and 1.2% in the updated skymap. We divided the observed area into two fields based on the
"availability of HSC reference images. For the fields with the HSC reference images, we applied"
"an image subtraction technique; for the fields without the HSC reference images, we sought"
individual HSC images by matching a catalog of observed objects with the PS1 catalog. The

"latter method. Subsequently, we performed visual inspection and obtained 83 candidates using"
the former method and 50 candidates using the latter method. Since we have only the 1-day
"photometric data, we evaluated probability to be located inside the 3D skymap by estimating"
their distances with photometry of associated extended objects. We found three candidates are
"likely located inside the 3D skymap and concluded they could be an counterpart of S190510g,"
while most of 133 candidates were likely to be supernovae because the number density of
candidates was consistent with the expected number of supernova detections. By comparing
"our observational depth with a light curve model of such a kilonova reproducing AT2017gfo, we"
show that early-deep observations with the Subaru/HSC can capture the rising phase of blue
component of kilonova at the estimated distance of S190510g (∼230 Mpc).

1 Introduction
A multi-messenger observation with gravitational waves
(GW) and electromagnetic (EM) waves is crucial for un-
derstanding physical processes of compact star coalescence.
Neutron-star (NS) mergers are expected to be accompa-
nied by EM emissions called “kilonova” (or “macronova”)
powered by radioactive decays of r-process nuclei (Li &
Paczyński 1998; Kulkarni 2005; Metzger et al. 2010); there-
"fore, the EM emission from BNS-merger events aids in un-"
derstanding the origin of heavy elements produced by the
r-process (Metzger et al. 2010; Kasen et al. 2013; Barnes
& Kasen 2013; Tanaka & Hotokezaka 2013; Tanaka et al.
2014; Kasen et al. 2015).
The localization area of GW observations can be an or-
"der of 10 deg2 for the best case, but can be as large as 1000"
deg2. It has been quite large for locating a galaxy hosting a
"system that caused the GW event. Therefore, EM follow-"
up observations had been expected to play a key role in
identifying the counterpart. The first identification of EM
counterpart to GW was achieved in the event of the first
detection of GW from a neutron star merger (GW170817).
GW170817 was localized with three interferometers in the
second observing run (O2) of the LIGO/Virgo collabora-
tion (Abbott et al. 2017). The identification of the EM
counterpart was made by several observatories on earth
including space from radio to gamma ray (Arcavi et al.
2017; Coulter et al. 2017; Dı́az et al. 2017; Evans et al.
2017; Lipunov et al. 2017; Soares-Santos et al. 2017; Tanvir
et al. 2017; Tominaga et al. 2018; Valenti et al. 2017).
Untargeted wide-field surveys are important for identi-
fying the uniqueness of the counterpart. The Japanese col-
laboration for Gravitational wave ElectroMagnetic follow-
up (J-GEM; Morokuma et al. 2016) conducted coordi-
nated observations (Utsumi et al. 2017) and deep blind
z-band imaging surveys to identify an EM counterpart us-
ing Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru Telescope
(Miyazaki et al. 2018; Kawanomoto et al. 2018; Komiyama
et al. 2018; Furusawa et al. 2018). They succeeded
in independently identifying the counterpart (AT2017gfo;
Tominaga et al. 2018). HSC is a 1.5 deg φ wide-field op-
"tical imager, which is the largest among the current exist-"
ing telescopes with an aperture larger than 8 m. While
galaxy-targeted and untargeted wide-field surveys identi-
"fied AT2017gfo, wide-field survey observations with the"
Subaru/HSC and Blanco/Dark Energy Camera (DECam)
succeeded in identifying the uniqueness of AT2017gfo with
a high completeness by ruling out the other candidates
including transients which are not associated with galaxy.
Kilonova models can broadly reproduce the time evolu-
tion of optical and near-infrared emissions of AT2017gfo
(Shibata et al. 2017; Tanaka et al. 2017; Kasen et al.
2017; Perego et al. 2017; Kawaguchi et al. 2018; Rosswog
"et al. 2018). However, the observed emissions display blue"
"components in the early-phase spectra, and the origin of"
the emission is unclear. Two models for the early blue com-
ponent are proposed: radioactive heating model (a kilo-
nova model having higher electron fraction Tanaka et al.
2017; Villar et al. 2017; Waxman et al. 2018) and shock
heating model (a cocoon emission model Kasliwal et al.
2017; Piro & Kollmeier 2018). These models can repro-
"duce the EM emission after 0.5 days from the explosion,"
at which the first observation of AT2017gfo was performed.
They predict different behaviors that predate 0.5 days from
"the explosion (Arcavi 2018), i.e. a cocoon model shows"
a higher luminosity than the radioactive kilonova model;
"therefore, the earlier observations for future events are im-"
portant to discriminate these models.
The LIGO/Virgo collaboration started their third ob-
servation run (O3) in April 2019. They detected a BNS
event named GW190425 (Abbott et al. 2020) on April
"25, 2019 at 08:18:05 UTC (GCN, The LIGO Scientific"
Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration 2019a) for the
"first time in O3. On May 10, 2019 at 02:59:39 UTC, they"
"Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, (2018), Vol. 00, No. 0 3"
"detected the third BNS event in O3, S190510g, using three"
"interferometers (GCN, The LIGO Scientific Collaboration"
and the Virgo Collaboration 2019b). They analyzed the
GW signal using BAYESTAR pipeline (Singer & Price
2016) and released a preliminary localization skymap on
"May 10, 2019 at 04:03:45 UTC. The 50% and 90% confi-"
dence regions correspond to the areas of 575 deg2 and 3462
"deg2, respectively. The luminosity distance was 269± 108
Mpc. In this alert, the GW event was classified as a BNS"
coalescence with 98% confidence level and a false alarm
"rate (FAR) of 8.4× 10−10 Hz (about one in 37 years).
On receiving this alert, we conducted a target of op-"
"portunity (ToO) imaging observation (GCN, The J-GEM"
"collaboration 2019), which covered 118.8 deg2 correspond-"
ing to the integrated probability of 11.6% in the localiza-
"tion skymap, using the Subaru/HSC. After our observa-"
"tions, we received an improved localization skymap which"
is reanalyzed with the LALInference pipeline (Veitch et al.
"2015) by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration on May 10, 2019 at"
"10:06:59 UTC (GCN, The LIGO Scientific Collaboration"
and the Virgo Collaboration 2019c). The 90% localization
area and the luminosity distance were revised to 1166 deg2
"and 227± 92 Mpc, respectively. The integrated probabil-
ity in our observation area decreased to 1.2% of the total"
"probability owing to the revision. In this alert, the prob-"
ability of the event being a BNS-merger event decreased
to 42% (the probability of it being a terrestrial event in-
"creased to 58%) with an FAR of 8.8×10−9 Hz (about one
in 3.6 years)."
"In this paper, we describe the details of the observation"
"of GW event S190510g using the Subaru/HSC, the candi-"
"date selection, and a list of candidates. We investigate the"
nature of the candidates by estimating a contamination
"from supernovae. Finally, we discuss the future prospects"
for optical-follow-up observations using Subaru/HSC. In
"this paper, all magnitudes are given as AB magnitudes."
2 Observation and data analysis
We commenced a follow-up observation for the GW event
"S190510g using Subaru/HSC on May 10, 2019 at 05:46:27"
"UTC, 1 h 43 min after the issue of the preliminary-alert"
and 2 h 47 min after the GW detection. Our original plan
was to perform i- and z-band observations for the GW
"follow-up; however, we conducted the observation in Y -"
band for this event because only the Y -band filter was
available that night. We selected 120 healpix grids with
high probabilities in the BAYESTAR localization skymap
"with a HEALPix resolution of NSIDE = 64, which corre-"
"sponds to 0.84 deg2/pix2, allowing the field of views (FoVs)"
to overlap each other. The HSC pointings were set as the
central coordinates of the each grid (Table 1). We exposed
the 120 pointings with 30 s each and revisited them with
a 1-arcmin offset in each pointing at least one hour apart.
The exposure time was determined considering the obser-
vation time of the half night and an exposure interval of
approximately 34 s (Utsumi et al. 2012).
The survey pointings and 90% contour for the
BAYESTAR skymap are shown in the bottom left panel
of Fig. 1. The observed area of 118.8 deg2 corresponds
to the integrated probability of 11.6% in the BAYESTAR
localization skymap. The skymap is revised significantly
to the LALInference localization skymap. In this updated
"skymap, the integrated probability in the observed area de-"
creases to 1.2%. The 90% contour in the updated skymap
is shown in the right panel of Fig. 1.
We reduce the observational data with hscPipe v4.0.5
(Bosch et al. 2018). This pipeline is a standard reduc-
tion pipeline for HSC and provides complete packages for
"the analyses of image data, including bias subtraction, flat"
"fielding, astrometry, flux calibration, mosaicing, warping,"
"stacking, image subtraction, source detection, and source"
measurement. We estimate 5σ limiting magnitudes in the
single-exposure images by measuring standard deviations
of sky fluxes in randomly distributed apertures with a di-
ameter of twice the full width at half maximum (FWHM)
"of a point spread function (PSF). Subsequently, we found"
that the Y -band limiting magnitudes have a mode value of
22.30 mag. The mode value of the seeings in each single-
exposure image is approximately 0.6 arcsec.
"3 Selection methods for transient objects
and results"
"In this section, we describe the methods used to search for"
transient objects related to S190510g and the correspond-
ing results. We apply the following two methods: One is to
"search for transients with an image-subtraction technique,"
which is useful for searching transient objects embedded
"in host galaxies. However, deep reference images are not"
available for all the survey pointings as shown in Fig. 2.
The area with deep Subaru/HSC reference images is 25.9
deg2 while the area without deep reference image is 92.9
"deg2. Therefore, we adopt the second method for the re-"
maining area. This method searches the single-exposure
images without using the image subtraction by matching
known objects in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1; Flewelling et al.
2016) catalog.

3.1 Selection in fields with HSC-SSP reference
images
"First, we apply image subtraction for the fields with deep"
reference images. We use images obtained in the HSC
Subaru Strategic Program (SSP; Aihara et al. 2018) as the
reference images. These reference images were taken from
"March 25, 2014 to April 8, 2019, and the total exposure"
time for each field is 200 s. The limiting magnitude of ref-
erence images is 23.3 mag according to the HSC Exposure
"Time Calculator1 (ETC), and is substantially deeper than"
"our observations. Thus, the search depth in the subtracted"
images are determined by our images because they domi-
nate the noise of the subtracted images. The subtraction
package in the hscPipe implementation is based on an al-
gorithm proposed in Alard & Lupton (1998) and Alard
(1999). The seeings in the reference images are blurred to
those in our observation images by being convolved with
kernels to make their PSFs equivalent in this algorithm.
The mode value of 5σ limiting magnitudes for the im-
"ages subtracted with the reference images is 22.28 mag,"
obtained using the same method as described in Section
2. The depth is not degraded even after the subtraction
because the reference images are sufficiently deep.
We then perform a candidate selection in the different
"images to exclude bogus detections (e.g., caused by bad"
pixels in the reference images or failure of the image sub-
traction) and moving objects by referring to the criteria
1 https://hscq.naoj.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/HSC ETC/hsc etc.cgi
"Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, (2018), Vol. 00, No. 0 5"
"used in Tominaga et al. (2018). First, we set the follow-"
"ing five criteria; (i) |(S/N)PSF| > 5, (ii) (b/a)/(b/a)PSF >
0.65 where a and b are the lengths of major and minor"
"axes of the shape of an object, respectively (iii) 0.7 <"
"FWHM/(FWHM)PSF < 1.3, (iv) PSF-subtracted residual"
"< 3σ-standard-deviation range (in the difference image),"
and (v) detected at least twice and one hour apart. The
"criteria (ii) and (iii) are adopted to identify point sources,"
and (iv) is required to confirm that the objects can be de-
scribed by a PSF. The criterion (v) is applied to exclude
"moving objects, such as minor planets. We find 1000 ob-"
jects satisfying these criteria. Figure 3 shows a flowchart
of the selection process for these objects. Since our obser-
vation area corresponds to the footprints of the PS1 sur-
"vey (Chambers et al. 2016), we match these objects with"
the PS1 catalog (Flewelling et al. 2016) to exclude objects
associated with known stellar-like objects (point source)
"within 1 arcsec. To classify the point sources, we use a"
flag of extended in objInfoFlag in the PS1 catalog. By
"this process, 228 objects are excluded."
"Next, we classify the remaining 772 objects by their an-"
gular separation θsep from the nearby extended objects.
We use the catalog of extended objects taken from the
PS1 catalog. We obtain 369 objects located at the center
"of an extended object (θsep < 1
′′), 113 objects located at"
"off-center (1′′ < θsep < 15
′′), and 290 objects that have no"
"close extended objects (θsep > 15
′′). Moreover, we statis-"
tically evaluate the probability of the associated extended
objects inside the 3D localization map using the observed
magnitudes and the luminosity function of galaxies. We
calculate a probability P3D that an extended object is lo-
cated inside a 3σ range of the LALInference 3D skymap
following the method described in Tominaga et al. (2018).
The P3D is defined as follows:
"P3D(λj , mj) :="
"∫
Dmean+3σD"
"Dmean−3σD
φAdD"
"0
φAdD"
"where φ=φ(λ,M) is the luminosity function of galaxies at"
a rest wavelength λ derived from the rest-frame UBV RI-
luminosity functions (Ilbert et al. 2005) and the Planck
"cosmology (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014), A = A(D)"
"is an observed surface area at a distance of D, Dmean and"
σD are mean value and standard deviation of a probability
"distribution of the distance, respectively, M = M(D; mj)"
is an absolute magnitude of a galaxy with observer-frame
"j-band apparent magnitude mj at a distance of D, and"
λ = λ(D; λj) is the rest wavelength redshifted from a
observed wavelength λj at a distance of D. We cor-
rect the Galactic extinction (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011)2

magnitudes. We use r- and/or i-band PSF-magnitudes
"(rMeanPSFMag, iMeanPSFMag in PS1 catalog) of the ex-"
tended objects for conversion to M and classify the ob-
jects according to whether P3D is higher than 50% or not
"(“Inside” or “Outside” 3D skymap, respectively). The ob-"
jects classified as “Outside” are likely to be unrelated to
the GW event. If both rMeanPSFMag and iMeanPSFMag are
"set to −999, the P3D are not evaluated, and these objects
are classified as “No Info.”"
"Finally, we perform a visual inspection because bogus"
detections remain in these candidates. After the visual
"exclusion of bogus detections, we finally obtain 83 can-"
didates. Figure 4 shows some example images of these
candidates. A detailed information of these candidates is
shown in Table 2 (“Off-center” and “No close objects”) and
Table 3 (“Center of extended object”). Since only Cand-
"A10 has a high P3D, we conclude this source as a final"
candidate of an electromagnetic counterpart of S190510g.
"However, this source may result from a variability of an ac-"
tive galactic nucleus because it is located at center of the
extended object. We cannot evaluate P3D of three candi-
"dates (Cand-A07, Cand-A08 and Cand-A09) because these"
have no close extended object and thus cannot rule out
their possibility to be the counterpart of S190510g.
3.2 Selection in fields without HSC-SSP reference
images
"Next, we examine the fields without the HSC-SSP refer-"
ence images. We construct the candidate catalog from the
"single exposure images, rather than using the method in"
"Section 3.1. Here, we also focus on point source-like tran-"
sients in the single-exposure images before stacking. We
perform a forced photometry to the single-exposure im-
ages with the hscPipe and select objects by the following

observation images (New) and difference images (Diff).
criteria: (i) extendedness3 equals to 0.0 (i.e. point-like
object) and (ii) detected twice with an interval of at least
"1 hour. Additionally, we add a criterion: (iii) magnitude"
< 21.3 mag for matching the objects with the PS1 cata-
"log, which corresponds to the 5σ depth4 in y-band of the"
"PS1 3π steradian survey. Therefore, the search depth is"
limited to 21.3 mag by the depth of the PS1 catalog. For
"finding sources on a bright region of an extended object,"
the effective search depth can be shallower than isolated
sources: this is because the source on extended objects is
detected only when the source is bright enough to make a
significant local minimum of brightness between the source
and the peak of extended source (Magnier et al. 2020). We
find 664477 objects satisfying these criteria.
"Since these objects include stars, we perform an ob-"
ject screening with criteria similar to the one in Section
3.1. We show a flowchart for this screening process in Fig.
"5. First, we discard 647557 objects positionally coinciding"
"with point-like objects in the PS1 catalog within 1 arcsec,"
"and obtain the remaining 16920 objects. Next, we clas-"
sify them based on whether they have PS1 objects which
is extended within 15 arcsecs or not. We obtain 6644 ob-
jects without close objects and 10276 objects associated
with the extended PS1 objects. If the objects located at
the center of the extended object include non-transient ob-
"jects, it is difficult to visually classify them without image"
subtraction. We discard 6843 objects associated with the
"extended PS1 objects within 1 arcsec, and then obtain 3433"
“Off-center” objects. Considering P3D of the extended ob-
"jects associated with the “Off-center” objects, 159 objects"
are classified as “Inside” and 2842 objects are classified
"3 The extendedness has the Double type; however, it has only two values"
"1.0 and 0.0 in hscPipe v4.0.5.
4 Cited from PanSTARRS1 Quick Facts in https://panstarrs.stsci.edu/"
as “Outside.” Both rMeanPSFMag and iMeanPSFMag of the
PS1 objects associated with the remaining 432 objects are
"set to −999 in the PS1 catalog. Therefore, those P3D are
not evaluated, and are classified as ‘No Information’."
"Finally, we conduct a visual inspection to remove the re-"
maining bogus objects from 10077 objects (6644 “No close
"objects,” 432 “No information,” 159 “Inside,” and 2842"
"“Outside”). Here, we compare our images with the PS1"
"stacked images in g-, r-, i-, z-, and y-band. We discard the"
objects when a counterpart below the detection threshold
can be recognized in the PS1 catalogs. These objects in
the PS1 images are significantly faint and slightly visible.
We then obtain 50 candidates after the visual inspection
as summarized in Table 4 (“Associated”) and Table 5 (“No
close objects”). Figure 6 shows some examples of the can-
didate. Since two sources (Cand-B01 and Cand-B02) have
"high P3D, we also include these sources to final candidates"
of an electromagnetic counterpart of S190510g. We cannot
exclude the possibility to be the counterpart of S190510g
for 40 objects tagged “No close object” and a “No infor-
mation” because we cannot evaluate P3D of them.
4 Discussion
4.1 Contamination from supernovae
"The candidates include objects unrelated to the GW event,"
"such as supernova (SN). However, it is difficult to deter-"
mine their nature because we have only 1-day photomet-
"ric observations. Thus, we compare our results with the"
expected number of SN detections and consider the con-
"tamination from them. As shown below, this comparison"
"demonstrates that our sample is dominated by SNe. Here,"
we adopt a similar method to that introduced in Niino
et al. (2014). The expected number is estimated by sum-

taken 500 days before the detection. Although the Y -band
"bandpasses are different between HSC and PS1, we assume"
same filters for two observations in this estimation. The ef-
fect of the difference is negligible compared to other effects
of model uncertainties.
"Under the above conditions, we derive the expected"
number density as a function of the limiting magnitude
"(Fig. 7). The cyan region represents the ±50% error orig-
inating from the uncertainty of the core-collapse SN rate"
"density. The dots with error bars are given by N/Sfield,"
where Sfield is the area corresponding to the fields with
or without the HSC-SSP reference images (filled or open
"circle), and N is the number of candidates found in each"
field. The horizontal error bar of filled circle represents the
1σ-standard-deviation range of the limiting magnitudes in
the difference images. The vertical error bars represent the
"uncertainties defined as
√
N/Sfield by assuming that the"
number of candidates follows a Poisson distribution with
the expected value of N . Although there is a probabil-
ity that we overlooked some SNe because we neglected the
objects located at the center of extended objects in the
"fields without the HSC-SSP reference images, these dots"
are within the error region and consistent with the simu-
"lation. Therefore, most of our candidates are likely to be"
SNe. The Dark Energy Survey also performed a follow-up
observation covering 84 deg2 (65% of the total probability
region) using a DECam with the depths of 20.58 mag (z-
"band), 21.72 mag (r-band), and 21.67 mag (g-band) and"
reported that the result of their all candidates are consis-
tent with supernovae (DES Collaboration et al. 2020).

4.2 Comparison with kilonova model and future
prospects
"In this section, we compare our search depths with a kilo-"
"nova model, and discuss future prospects for the follow-up"
observations with Subaru/HSC. When we convert the ab-
"solute magnitudes to the apparent magnitudes, we correct"
"the Galactic extinction by assuming E(B−V ) = 0.10 mag
(Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011)."
"Here, we adopt a kilonova based on the radiative trans-"
fer simulations by Banerjee et al. (2020) for comparison
with the early phase of brightness evolution. We assume
that a kilonova with the same propertieis with GW170817
is located at the distance of 227 Mpc reported in S190510g.
"Figure 8 shows multi-color (i-, z- and Y -band) light curve"
of a kilonova model with an ejecta mass Mej =0.05M⊙ and
"an electron fraction Ye = 0.30−0.40 (no lanthanide). This
parameter set can explain the observed early multi-color"
light curve of AT2017gfo. Properties of the light curves
are affected by choice of the ejecta mass and electron frac-
tion. The peak bolometric luminosity roughly scales with
the Mej to the power of 0.35 (e.g. Fernández & Metzger
"2016; Tanaka 2016; Metzger 2019). Also, the electron frac-"
tion Ye influences the light curves through the opacity: for
"example, if the Ye is low (Ye < 0.25), the ejecta becomes"
Lanthanide rich and the opacity becomes higher. In such
"case, the light curves can be fainter by 2-3 mag than our"
"fiducial model (Ye = 0.30− 0.40) in the early time.
For observational limiets, we show the limiting mag-"
"nitude in the difference images (green solid line), the 5σ"
depth of the PS1-y band catalog (gray dots line) and the
limiting magnitudes in HSC-z or HSC-i2 band (orange dots
"lines), respectively, by horizontal lines. The values in HSC-"
z and HSC-i2 are calculated with HSC ETC by assuming
"an exposure time of 60 s (30 s × 2 exposures). We can
observe an area of ∼60 deg2 in both z- and i- bands with
this exposure time during a half night of the telescope time."
We note that the limiting magnitudes could be shallower
"(∼0.5 mag) depending on the sky condition as in the case
of our Y -band observation."
This comparison demonstrates that observations using
"Subaru/HSC can detect the kilonova emission in i-, z-,"
and Y -bands during peak times even at 227 Mpc. For
"S190510g, our observations covered approximately 0.1-0.3"
"days (2.8-7.0 hours), as shown in the gray shaded area in"
Fig. 8. If the emission is purely powered by radioactive
"decays, the emission still rises in those phases, as shown"
"in Fig. 8. However, if ejecta are further heated by co-"
coon produced by the interaction between the relativistic
"jets and the ejecta, the emission might be brighter than"
"this kilonova model (Arcavi 2018). Therefore, the early"
observations will be important to provide constraints on
the emission models.
Observations with the Subaru/HSC can detect kilonova
fainter than GW170817/AT2017gfo even at the distance of
"S190510g (227 Mpc). For example, if the Mej is 0.01M⊙"
"with all the other parameters fixed, the peak bolometric"
luminosity is decreased from our fiducial model by 40%.
"Then, the peak of the light curves gets∼0.6 mag fainter un-
der an assumption that the magnitude in each band is de-"
creased following the bolometric luminosity. Subaru/HSC
can easily detect such an emission from the rising phase.
"Also, if the Ye is low (Ye < 0.25), the magnitudes are ex-"
pected to be fainter by 2-3 mag in the early time as men-
"tioned above. Even for such a case, we can also detect the"
peak of the light curve in i- and r-bands.
"Here, we also emphasize the importance of the deep ref-"
erence image. The horizontal solid line shows our limiting
"magnitude for the fields with HSC-SSP reference image,"
while the dashed line shows the limit of search depth in
"the fields without the reference. In the latter case, obser-"
"vations are limited by the depth of the PS1 images, and"
"thus, we cannot detect transient sources fainter than 21.3"
mag. For this particular kilonova model at 227 Mpc dis-
"tance, if the deep reference image is available, the first"
detection in Y -band would be 0.4 days compared to 1.5
days without the deep reference image.
"Finally, we consider future prospects in the fourth and"
fifth observing runs (O4 and O5) of the GW interferom-
eters. Colored squares in Fig. 9 correspond to a BNS
range and an observation period in the each observing run
shown in the document of observing run plans6. Dots with
error bars are distances (left vertical axis) of GW events
"reported in O1, O2, and O3. The right vertical axis refers"
to a peak magnitude of the light curve in z-band in the
same kilonova model as Fig. 8 on an assumption that it is
located at a distance shown in the left vertical axis. The
limiting magnitude evaluated with the exposure time of
60 s in HSC-z band is 23.45 mag (black dashed line). We
expect that observations with HSC will sufficiently attain
the BNS ranges expected in O4 or O5.
"Here, we estimate how many survey observations for"
GW events classified as BNS can be performed with
Subaru/HSC. Assuming the Subaru telescope can view the
"sky above 20◦ of elevation, the total area of visible sky is"
approximately 90% of the whole sky in a day. Since the
nature seeing becomes poor in the elevations lower than
"20◦, they are undesirable for the good imaging quality."
"Furthermore, typical hours of “night”, 8 hours, reduces"
"this ratio to approximately 30%. In addition, considering"

we can conduct the follow-up observation will be approx-
"imately 9% of BNSs, of which the most probable point is"
located in the observable sky for HSC. Assuming the BNS
rate of 110-3840 Gpc−3yr−1 shown in Abbott et al. (2019)
"and the mean ranges of LIGO during each observing run,"
the numbers of BNS-merger events expected to be detected
"by LIGO are 0.8 ∼ 28.2 (in O3), 4.9 ∼ 172.4 (in O4) and
41.4 ∼ 1445.1 (in O5). Therefore, the expected number of
BNS events that HSC can contribute to is 0.1∼2.5 (in O3),
0.4∼ 15.2 (in O4) and 3.7∼ 127.7 (in O5). These numbers
are further increased if we include poorly localized events"
whose most probable point locates outside the observable
"sky. It is, therefore, important to prioritize to the events"
with a better localization.
5 Summary & conclusion
"The GW detection S190510g, that may include NSs, had"
been reported by the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration on May
"10, 2019. For this event, we performed a ToO observation"
with Subaru/HSC in Y -band for the optical-counterpart
Fig. 9. BNS range during each observing run
shown in the document of observing run plans
(https://dcc.ligo.org/public/0161/P1900218/002/SummaryForObservers.pdf).
Dots with error bar are the distance (left vertical axis) of GW events reported
"in O1, O2 and O3. The right vertical axis refers to a peak magnitude of the"
light curve in z-band in the same kilonova model as Fig. 8 on an assumption
that it is located at a distance shown in the left vertical axis. Black dashed
line indicates the expected limiting magnitude in HSC-z band.
survey as early as 1.7 hours after the issue of its prelimi-
"nary alert. Our observation area, which was selected from"
"the preliminary localization skymap, covers 118.8 deg2. It"
corresponds to 11.6% of the total probability in the lo-
"calization skymap released in the preliminary alert, and"
1.2% in the updated skymap. We searched for an optical-
"counterpart by dividing the observed area into two fields,"
depending on whether a previous reference HSC image is
available.
"For the fields with HSC-SSP reference images, we"
searched for optical counterpart by using the image sub-
traction. We obtained 83 candidates through screening
sources in the difference images. For the fields without
"HSC-SSP reference images, we searched our individual ob-"
servation images by matching the observed sources with
"PS1 catalog, and found 50 candidates except the sources lo-"
"cated at the center of extended object. We, then, estimate"
their distance with photometry of associated extended ob-
"jects. Finally, we concluded three sources (Cand-A10,"
Cand-B01 and Cand-B02) as final candidates of the elec-
tromagnetic counterpart of S190510g because these candi-
date are likely located inside the 3D skymap. We could not
rule out the possibility that 44 candidates are related to
the GW event because their distance cannot be estimated.
"Unfortunately, no spectroscopic observations for them are"
performed. The search depth for the second method is
shallower than that for the first method because we chose
only brighter source than 21.3 mag to match the sources
with the PS1 catalog.
We estimated the expected number of SN detections
by performing mock observations. We confirmed that the
number density of our candidates was consistent with the
"10 Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, (2018), Vol. 00, No. 0"
"expected number within the 50% uncertainty. Therefore,"
it may imply that most of 133 candidates could be SNe.
By comparing with a radioactive kilonova model repro-
"ducing AT2017gfo, which is based on the radiative trasfer"
"simulations with realistic opacity (Banerjee et al. 2020),"
we found that our observations were sufficiently deep to
"detect the kilonova emission well before the peak at ∼230
Mpc distance. We showed that our observations reached"
the sensitivity to detect the kilonova emission from the fu-
ture BNS events in O4 and O5. With the current estimate
"of the event rate, we find that Subaru/HSC can observe"
"0.1 ∼ 2.5 (in O3), 0.4 ∼ 15.2 (in O4) and 3.7 ∼ 127.7 (in
O5) events."
Our observations demonstrate that follow-up observa-
tions with Subaru/HSC can cover over 100 deg2 within a
few hours after the GW event. For future GW observing
"runs, most of the GW events will be discovered at >100"
"Mpc distance; therefore, deep and wide observations, as"
"shown in this paper, will become more important. The"
early observations with Subaru/HSC will enable the early
detection of the EM counterpart for relatively distant ob-
jects. Such an early detection will facilitate spectroscopic
"and multi-color photometric follow-up observations, which"
"are crucial to firmly identify of the EM counterpart. Also,"
since radioactive heating and shock heating models predict
"different behaviors before 0.5 days, early deep observations"
as presented in this paper put strong constraints on the
emission mechanism of early kilonova emission.
