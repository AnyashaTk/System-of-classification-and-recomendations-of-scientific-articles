ABSTRACT
"Spiral arms are distinctive features of many circumstellar disks, observed in scattered light, which
traces the disk surface, millimeter dust emission, which probes the disk midplane, as well as molecular
emission. The two leading explanations for spirals are wakes generated by a massive planet and the
density waves excited by disk self-gravity. We use stratified 3D hydrodynamic shearing-box simulations
including dust particles and disk self-gravity to investigate how gas and dust spirals in a self-gravitating
disk depend on the simulation size, the cooling efficiency, and the aerodynamics properties of particles.
We find that opening angles of spirals are universal (∼ 10o), and not significantly affected by the size
of the computational domain, the cooling time, or the particle size. In simulations with the biggest
domain, the spirals in the gaseous disk become slightly more open with a higher cooling efficiency. Small
dust follows the gaseous spirals very well, while intermediate-sized dust with dimensionless stopping
time (St) close to 1 concentrates to the spirals more and shows stronger spirals. However, large dust
with St > 1 also shows spirals, which is different from some previous simulations. We identify that this
is due to the gravity from the gas to the dust component. We show that when St & Q, the gravitational
force from the gaseous spirals to the dust particles becomes stronger than the particles’ aerodynamic
drag force, so that the gas significantly affects these large particles through gravitational interaction.
This has important implications for both spiral observations and planetesimal formation/dynamics."

1. INTRODUCTION
"Protoplanetary disks are observed with a number of
features and substructures, from the common rings of
recent surveys (Andrews et al. 2018; Long et al. 2018)
to the less common but equally intriguing spirals (Grady
et al. 2013; Pérez et al. 2016; Huang et al. 2018a; John-
ston et al. 2020), vortices (van der Marel et al. 2013,
2016) and potential warps (Benisty et al. 2015). Spirals
in the gas can be caused by two distinctive mechanisms,
either by the wakes produced by the superposition of
higher order modes induced by a point source (i.e. a
planet) (Zhu et al. 2015; Dong et al. 2015; Bae & Zhu
2018a,b) or by non-axisymmetric modes of gravitational
instabilities (Lin & Shu 1964; Dong et al. 2016; Lee et al.
2019). Distinguishing between these two sometimes re-
lies on the pitch angle of the spiral arms (Pohl et al.
2015; Hall et al. 2018), the number of arms (Bae & Zhu
2018a,b) or their amplitude (Juhász et al. 2015). We
focus on the pitch angle for the ease in comparing and"

"constraining this parameter with observations. While
the number of arms is easier to constrain observation-
ally, most disks only show two which is in line with theo-
retical expectations for either cause (Bae & Zhu 2018a).
Due in part to observational constraints, determining
which causes the spirals in images, however, has proven
to be a challenge (Forgan et al. 2018b,a; Ren et al. 2018)."
"Observations come in three regimes, those which are
observed in light scattered off the optically thick gas
surface of the disk (Muto et al. 2012; Grady et al. 2013;
Garufi et al. 2013; Stolker et al. 2016; Benisty et al. 2015;
Dong et al. 2018b, etc.), those which are observed as spi-
rals in the dust emission (Pérez et al. 2016; Huang et al.
2018a; Reynolds et al. 2020) with ALMA and molecu-
lar line emission (Boehler et al. 2018; Booth et al. 2019;
Huang et al. 2020). By only observing the surface of the
disk, spirals in scattered light images may not indicate
the presence of a feature throughout down to the disk
midplane. In TW Hydrae for example, there exists an
apparent discrepancy between the spirals in gas observa-
tions (Teague et al. 2019) and the rings seen in the dust
continuum (Andrews et al. 2016). On the other hand,
although spirals in the dust may probe the midplane of"

"the disk, they may not reflect the spirals in the gaseous
disk (Pérez et al. 2016)."
"Gravitationally unstable disks are commonly charac-
terized through the presence of spiral arms due to the
sheared self-gravitating waves generated by the massive
disk (Lin & Shu 1964; Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965).
These are typically represented by the dominant m = 2
spiral mode, but higher order spirals are common in sim-
ulations depending on disk mass and disk aspect ratio
(Cossins et al. 2009; Kratter & Lodato 2016). Compar-
atively, a spiral formed by a planet will feature a dom-
inant m = 1 exterior mode, with higher order interior
modes, depending on the mass of the perturber (Bae &
Zhu 2018a). Thus a planet that induces multiple spirals
are almost always considered to be located further out
than the observed spirals."
"However, recent images of potentially self-gravitating
disks reveal either no signatures of spirals (Andrews
et al. 2018) or only faint spirals (Pérez et al. 2016)
and disks with spirals are not conclusively in the
regime where self-gravitational effects should be relevant
(Huang et al. 2018b). Similarly, most disks which show
spiral features also do not have obvious planet candi-
dates (Boehler et al. 2018; Dong et al. 2018a), although
this may be due to detection limitations of low luminos-
ity planets (Ren et al. 2018)."
"Thus, in the absence of more robust indicators, the
characterization of the pitch angle perhaps makes it pos-
sible to disentangle the cause of spiral features. In the
case of an embedded planet, the angle of the spiral is in-
fluenced by the mass of the planet as well as the viscosity
and local temperature (Rafikov 2006; Muto et al. 2012).
Overall, the pitch angle is greater close-in to the planet
and decreases further away from the planet. For studies
which delve into the properties of the spirals generated
by embedded planets we refer to Zhu et al. (2015); Meru
et al. (2017); Hall et al. (2018); Dong et al. (2018b,b);
Bae & Zhu (2018b)."
"The spiral structure of self-gravitating disks are of-
ten studied for their gas dynamics (Cossins et al. 2009;
Michael et al. 2012), but the effect of self-gravity with re-
spect to solid material is an often neglected part of mesh-
based simulations, due in part to the computational ex-
pense and because of the minor effect in low-mass disks.
Without considering the self-gravity effects from the gas
onto the dust and between the dust particles themselves,
larger dust species will remain decoupled from the gas
and form axisymmetric structures, and this may be the
expected outcome in many cases (Cadman et al. 2020).
However, as we will show, when the effects of the gas
self-gravity is included on the dust, even large species
will form non-axisymmetric structure similar to the gas."
"In this paper, we investigate how the simulation pa-
rameters of domain size and cooling timescale affect the
pitch angle of gas and dust spiral features in local self-
gravitating disks. In Section 2 we outline the formation
of spirals in self-gravitating disks and then describe the"
"numerical setup in Section 3. We then present the re-
sults in Section 4 and discuss the implications and lim-
itations in Section 5 before concluding in Section 6."
2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
2.1. Spiral Structure
"Spiral density perturbations in a disk are, regardless of
the source, described in the form of a plane wave under
the assumption of being tightly-wound1, with potential
X (Shu 2016; Binney & Tremaine 2008)"
"X(x, t) = Xei(k·x−ωt), (1)"
"which for a simplified 2D potential in terms of the radial
and azimuthal wavenumbers, k and m respectively, is
written as"
"X(r, θ, t) = Xei(mθ+kr−ωt). (2)"
"In a self-gravitating disk, the density perturbations
are described in linear theory by the Lin-Shu dispersion
relation (Lin & Shu 1964)"
"(mΩ− ω)2 = c2sk
2 − 2πGΣ|k|+ κ2, (3)"
"which relates the frequency of density perturbations ω
to the azimuthal and radial wavenumbers. Gravitational
collapse proceeds for high surface densities Σ unless pre-
vented by shear and pressure. The shear, given by the
epicyclic frequency κ, simplifies to the orbital frequency
Ω ="
"√
GM∗/R3 for a Keplerian disk at radius R around"
"a central star of mass M∗. Also supporting against col-
lapse is the thermal pressure, quantified in terms of the
sound speed cs."
"When m = 0 and axisymmetric collapse is dominant,
Equation (3) produces the familiar Toomre stability cri-
terion for the gravitational collapse of a gaseous disk
(Toomre 1964)."
"Q =
csΩ"
"πGΣ
= 1 (4)"
"However, when Q > 1 and higher modes of m are
not suppressed by a dominant m = 0 mode, non-
axisymmetric structure becomes prevalent in a gravi-
toturbulent disk."
"Smaller simulation domains are advantageous for the
high grid cell counts per length scale, potentially cap-
turing small scale turbulence, but can suffer from
inadequate coverage of stabilizing and destabilizing
modes. Booth & Clarke (2019) showed one effect of a
small shearing box includes significant fluctuations away
from equilibrium gravitoturbulent densities and stresses."
"1 Also known as the WKB approximation: the radial space be-
tween any consecutive spiral arms is much smaller than the radius
of the disk."

"to the potential nor feel the gas potential, i.e. test particles that feel drag force only."
"This is attributed to the missing large scale destabilizing

will dominate and may drive a smaller pitch angle θ"

"With smaller simulation boxes (smaller R), the pitch
angle will increase. In a realistic disk with H/R ∼ 0.1,
the pitch angle of the critical mode will be ∼10o for the
m = 2 mode."
"Similarly in a shearing box, we can decompose the
density perturbation in the Fourier domain with kx and
ky. Then the most unstable mode has"

"which also implies that the simulation domain needs to
be larger than 2πH to contain the most unstable mode.

"On the other hand, even if the most unstable mode
always has m = 1 or 2, the mode may not represent
the spiral in the nonlinear phase. Then, another way
to derive the pitch angle is to use the saturated stress
in gravitotubulent disks. Gammie (2001) pointed out
that cooling leads to disk accretion in gravitotubulent
disks so that α is inversely proportional to the cooling
timescale (β). As shown by Gammie (2001), the α vis-

"this to α ∼ θ. The two estimates above (Equation 10
and 13) are based on different assumptions and provide
very different results about the pitch angle θ. Equation
10 suggest that the pitch angle depends on the box size
while Equation 13 implies that the pitch angle depends
on the cooling (or α). We want to measure the pitch
angle from our simulations and compare with these an-
alytical estimates."
"Furthermore, the spirals in the dust disk may have dif-
ferent pitch angles from the gaseous spirals, and obser-
vations probe both the gas and dust spirals at different
wavelengths. Thus, we will look into spirals in both gas
and dust disks."
2.2. Particle Drag and Self-Gravity
"As will be shown later, the gravity from the gas com-
ponent to the dust component is crucial for forming the
spirals in dust disks. When particles only experience
drag forces, smaller species that are more coupled to
the gas are expected to closely match the pitch angle
of the gas. Larger particles will remain on their initial
trajectories for longer and should be largely unaffected
by turbulent gas motions."
"Previous work which did not include the gravity from
gas to dust (e.g. Gibbons et al. 2012; Cadman et al.
2020) suggested that large particles form axisymmetric
rings in self-gravitating disks, while in our simulations
we will show that large particles still form spirals. Thus,
there are several differences between our work and Gib-
bons et al. (2012). First, in 2D simulations particles
are assumed evenly distributed in the vertical direction,
while our vertically stratified 3D simulations show differ-
ent vertical dust profiles for each particle species (Baehr
& Zhu 2021). Intermediate species settle rapidly, in-
creasing their local concentration and the effect of self-
gravity between particles. But secondly, we identify that
the gravity from gas to dust is the main cause for the
difference."
"We compare the relative strengths of the drag and gas
gravitational forces with the following simple argument.
Considering that GI turbulence is transonic (Gammie
2001), we assume that velocity differences between par-
ticles w and the gas u are on the order of the sound
speed cs for big particles. Then, the acceleration due to"

gravity becomes more important in this regime, large

3. MODEL
"We use 3D hydrodynamic shearing box simulations
to study the dynamics of self-gravitating disks with La-
grangian super-particles embedded in the Eulerian mesh
using the Pencil code (Brandenburg 2003). Pencil is
a sixth-order in space and third-order in time finite dif-
ference code with MPI for high parallelization. The code
also has robust routines for self-gravity and particle-gas
interaction and has been thoroughly tested for a num-
ber of astrophysical contexts (Youdin & Johansen 2007;
Lyra et al. 2007; Yang & Johansen 2016)."
"For our simulations we require thermal and hydro-
dynamic properties such that the disk is marginally
Toomre stable, i.e. Q > 1. That is to say, for the
gravitational constant G and Ω both equal to one, the
sound speed cs and combined gas and dust surface den-
sity Σ0 = Σg,0 + Σp,0 are chosen such that the initial
Q0 = 1.02 everywhere."
"Local simulations allow the Toomre wavelength2 ∼
2πH to be well-resolved in the radial and azimuthal di-
rections (x and y in the Cartesian coordinates, respec-
tively) and keep the boundary conditions periodic. The
Toomre wavelength needs to be resolved by at least four"

unphysical overdensities (Truelove et al. 1997; Nelson
2006). We easily satisfy this by resolving each pressure

wavelength by around 60 grid cells."

opacity will be dominated by the small dust grains and
an increase of the particle density will increase the local
cooling timescale."
"Self-gravity of the gas and dust is solved in Fourier
space by transforming the density to find the potential
at wavenumber k and transforming the solution back

and we distinguish these six from the next three by the
inclusion of gas-particle and particle-particle gravita-
tional interactions self-consistently. Among these three
simulations, the simulation with ’low dust mass’ indi-
cates that the particle mass is so low that it does not
contribute to the gravitational potential Φ = Φg and
thus every particle does not feel the gravity of other
particles while still feeling the gravitational acceleration
from the gas potential. For the simulation indicated
as ’no particle self-gravity’, the particles neither con-
tribute to the potential nor feel the gas potential and
thus the particles only feel the aerodynamic drag force,
the Shearing box inertial forces, and the gravitational
force from the central star."

cle drag is calculated by interpolating particle positions
to the grid using a second-order triangular-shaped cloud
scheme (i.e. Yang et al. 2018). Larger particles are less
coupled to small scale gas motions, retain their initial
perturbations for longer and thus have higher Stokes
numbers. On the other hand, smaller particles are well-
coupled and will quickly match the velocity of the gas"

"Our full collection of simulations and relevant parame-
ters is summarized in Table 1. We compare two different
box sizes, Lx = Ly = (80/π)H and (160/π)H, which we
label medium and large respectively. Both sizes have
the same vertical extent Ly = (40/π)H, but the effec-
tive resolution of the larger simulations is half that of
the medium ones. Additional simulations at a higher
grid resolution were run with β = 20 and β = 30 in
order to explore trends to broader disk conditions."
4. RESULTS
"Figure 1 shows the vertically integrated particle count
for each of the particle species included in two of our sim-
ulations after gravitoturbulence has been established.
All species trace the gas to some extent, matching the
same features of the gas with particularly narrow struc-
tures in the case of St = 1. Since particles of this size
should drift most efficiently towards pressure maxima,
this is expected. This also compares well with simi-
lar simulations in Gibbons et al. (2012), particularly for
particle sizes St = 1 and smaller (see their Figure 2). In
Gibbons et al. (2012) however, particles of size St = 10"
"and 100 show some axisymmetric structure, but do not
correspond to the gas features, suggesting more iner-
tial behavior. Discrepancies at these larger sizes can
be attributed to two differences between how particles
are treated. In our primary simulations, we include the
effects of self-gravity of and on the particles, which facil-
itates dust concentration, and the 3D implementation of
these simulations which considers sedimentation effects
which proceed faster for moderate Stokes number par-
ticles, St = 0.1 and St = 1. The effects of self-gravity
will be discussed later in this section, and the effects of
settling will be discussed in Paper II."
"It is from these particle distributions and the verti-
cally integrated gas that we calculate the pitch angle θ
in each simulation. To determine the average opening
angle, we calculate the autocorrelation of the gas and
particle surface densities separately (cf. Gammie 2001;
Michikoshi et al. 2015)"
"ξ(x̃, ỹ) =
∑
x"
"Σ(x, y)Σ(x+ x̃, y + ỹ). (28)"
"Thus each point on the autocorrelation map, (x̃, ỹ) rep-
resents a distance away from each physical point (x, y)
on the 2D density map, all superimposed. This allows
for a characterization of the overall direction and shape"

"of density structures at a given point in time. Calcu-
lating the autocorrelation on a 5122 grid was computa-
tionally expensive, so all density data at that resolution
was interpolated to a 2562 grid for calculating the au-
tocorrelation over the entire domain. To calculate the
autocorrelation when the distance (x̃, ỹ) crosses a shear
periodic boundary at x = −Lx/2, Lx/2 (cf. Hawley et al.
1995), the density is shifted in the azimuthal direction
by ∆y = (3/2)Ωx so that features are aligned correctly."
"From the autocorrelation, the angle with respect to
the azimuthal axis was measured via the ridge of maxi-
mum ξ(x̄, ȳ) tracing the diagonal feature, which we mark
with a dotted line. The particle autocorrelation is typ-
ically less smooth, and thus a Gaussian smooth was
applied to the data before determining the line which
traces the diagonal feature. This dotted line is then fit
with a straight line and the angle θ is defined as that
opened counterclockwise with respect to the azimuthal
(y) axis."
"We focus our efforts at a time where gravitoturbulence
has been established in the simulation, such that non-
axisymmetric (non-linear) features have been allowed to
evolve over at least a few dynamical timescales. In Fig-
ures 2 and 3, we show the gas and total dust autocor-
relation calculations at t = 60 Ω−1. Overall, gas pitch
angles θg are within a few degrees of θ = 12"
"◦, with an ap-
parent decreasing trend with increasing β for the larger
simulations."
"The particle autocorrelation is partially complicated
by the dust clumping due to particle drift and particle-
particle self-gravity at high particle concentrations. Nu-
merous bright spots make it hard to find the overall dust
pitch angle, particularly for St = 1. However, there is"
"less clumping at other sizes such that the overall dust
picture is not disrupted significantly."
"We further break down the autocorrelation analysis by
particle size. Figure 4 shows two medium-sized simula-
tions at t = 60 Ω−1. Particles with size St = 1 are espe-
cially prone to clumping, such that densities along fila-
ments are higher and the autocorrelation shows a starker
contrast. This makes determining the pitch angle at this
species more difficult than the rest and this is reflected
in the larger variation of pitch angles at this size. Over-
all, the spirals shown by different sized particles have
surprisingly consistent pitch angle. The pitch angle is
almost unchanged even if the St of the dust changes by
5 orders of magnitude."
"In Figure 5, we plot the radial-azimuthal distribution
of particles from two simulations identical to our ini-
tial six simulations, aside from how particle self-gravity
is treated. The left panel includes particle density as
part of the potential, but the particles only have 10−4"
"times the mass. Thus, they contribute little to the over-
all potential, even at high local concentrations. How-
ever, the particles still feel the acceleration of the gas
potential and thus are still affected by dense gas struc-
tures. As the autocorrelations show in the left side of
Figure 6, particles still retain effectively the same non-
axisymmetric structure at all sizes, although it does not
perfectly correlate to the gas."
"In the other case, shown in the right panel of Fig-
ure 5, particle density is not included in calculating the
self-gravity potential and the acceleration of the poten-
tial is not included in Equation (25). In this situation,
particle-gas interaction is through the aerodynamic drag
only. Thus, larger dust particles become increasingly ax-
isymmetric with increasing dust size (θ approaching 0◦),"

"until they are randomly distributed at St = 1000. These
axisymmetric features are similar to the results shown in
Gibbons et al. (2012). On the other hand, the left panels
in Figure 5 are consistent with previous 2D simulations
by Shi et al. (2016) who have shown spiral features for
large particles. By comparing the left and right panels
of Figure 5 and 6, we identify that non-axisymmetric
structure can occur for St > 1 since the self-gravity of
the gas is acting on the dust."
5. DISCUSSION
5.1. Gas and Dust Spirals
"The pitch angles measured in all simulations are pro-
vided in Table 2. The pitch angles of the gaseous spirals
are ∼10◦ universally and vary by a degree or two over
time. For shearing box simulations, the most unstable
mode as in Equation 10 has θ ∼ 14◦ using Ly = (80/π)H
(equivalent to H/R = 0.25 in a global disk) for our
mid-sized box and m = 1 shown in Figure 1. Al-
though this is close to 10◦, it cannot explain the similar
10◦ pitch angles observed in large box simulations with"
"Ly = (160/π)H (equivalent to H/R = 0.12 in global
disks) and m = 1."
"Furthermore, for these large box simulations, we no-
tice that the pitch angles increase slightly with a faster
cooling time (smaller β), which is more consistent with
Equation 13. For a disk with a faster cooling and a
larger α, the spirals need to be more open so that the
gravitational interaction is more efficient to transport
angular momentum. On the other hand, we didn’t ob-
serve significant change of the pitch angle (e.g. there is
no factor of 5 change with β changing from 10 to 2),
which may suggest that the f factor in Equation 13 also
depends on the cooling rate (e.g. a faster cooling leads
to a stronger spiral so that f is closer to 1). Our simula-
tions shed light on the gaseous spiral structures, but the
explanation still deserves more analytical and numerical
calculations in future."
"The overall dust structure generally matches the gas
well. In most cases, the pitch angles of the dust spirals
are within a few degrees below the gas pitch angle. We
find that the most surprising feature is the weak or com-
plete lack of a decreasing pitch angle with an increasing"

"particle size. If particles are dominated by their aero-
dynamic properties (gas-to-particle drag forces only),
one might expect only the more well-coupled species
to match the gas and decoupled particles to have more
axisymmetric structure (Gibbons et al. 2012; Cadman
et al. 2020). Two-dimensional simulations at longer
cooling timescales have shown decreasing pitch angle
(Shi et al. 2016), but we do not observe a considerable
decrease in θ with increasing β. We occasionally see
some very low pitch angles in the dust despite a typical
gas pitch angle. We attribute this to interactions be-
tween the spiral arms that temporarily disrupt the dust
structure but the dust later returns to tight agreement
with the gas structure."
"Even if spirals are a ubiquitous feature among all par-
ticle species, it may be possible that the contrast be-
tween regions of high and low dust concentrations are
not discernible as spirals at all. In Figure 7, we look at
a slice of a simulation at constant radius (x = 0) and
compare the dust surface density of the smaller species
that might be observable. That the surface densities of
the small dust varies by at least an order of magnitude
suggests that these spiral features would not be confused
with rings in observations."
"We note a slight decrease in the pitch angle with par-
ticle size in the simulation S t2 BB, but the pitch angle
does not decrease to θ = 0 as it does for purely aero-
dynamic particles and still has some non-axisymmetric
structures. The situation is reversed in S t10 BB, and
the larger species have significantly larger pitch angles
than the other species and even the gas. Gas pitch angles
are not constant in time and for both cases, this could be
a result of a delayed response to a temporary shift in the
gas structure to a smaller or larger pitch angle. Thus,
the smaller dust would more quickly match the angle
of the gas through gas drag and the larger dust would
require more time. Similar disparities between gas and
magnetic field structures have been noted in Guan et al.
(2009)."
"Yu et al. (2019) analyzed the pitch angles of a num-
ber of potentially self-gravitating disks with spirals and
find a dependence of the angle on disk mass through the
Toomre parameter. Many of the disks they analyze with
Q < 4 have pitch angles from 7◦ to 15◦ and larger an-
gles for larger values Q. Our simulations with a Q = 1
disk mostly fall within the range of θ = 10 − 12◦. We,
however, do not explore how the structure in our simu-"

"lations varied with initial Toomre Q and leave that for
future investigations."
5.2. Particle Size
"Particles of size St = 0.01 and St = 0.1 are the most
well-coupled and similar to the cross-correlation of dust
and gas in Riols et al. (2020), within the gas structure.
While they will concentrate along gas structures, cou-
pling to small scale gas motions will prevent the forma-
tion of narrow, concentrated filaments. This does not
mean that small particles necessarily match the pitch
angle of the gas the best."
"This is corroborated by the intermediate size St = 1,
the size which drifts especially well and thus concen-
trate efficiently into narrow structures. When particle-
particle self-gravity is included, these concentrations are
able to collapse into denser clumps of particles as long
as the local particle density is high enough. The collapse
of dense particle clouds can be modeled similarly to un-
stable gas (Gerbig et al. 2020), resulting an unstable
m = 0 dust mode and occasional strong local axisym-
metric structure (θ = 0◦) in the dust. Only for this size
do we see particles concentrate enough for the dust-to-
gas ratio to reach unity (Baehr & Zhu 2021). This is
the point where dust backreaction, had it been included
in our simulations, becomes relevant. With backreac-
tion, dust concentration will become more pronounced,
and dust may concentrate for a broader range of particle
sizes. Pitch angles at this dust size show the most vari-
ability across all simulations, just as often in the range
θ = 6− 8◦ as in the overall average of θ = 10− 12◦."
"Even larger particles, which should be much less af-
fected by turbulent gas flow, have remarkably similar
structures especially when comparing the two largest
particle sizes in the right-hand plot of Figure 5. This al-
ready hints at something other than aerodynamic drag
molding the particle structure at these large sizes and
we identify as the gravitational potential of the gas disk."
"This is particularly noticeable in the St = 100 and
St = 1000 cases on the left half of Figure 5, where both"
"species are very similar in overall structure despite hav-
ing very low dust mass and thus even considerable con-
centrations of particles do not affect the gravitational
potential. This is very similar to the more massive par-
ticle cases in the plots of Figure 1, except that particle
clumping does not occur at St = 1, which appears to be
the largest difference between the two simulations with
drastically different particle masses."
"While the disk cooling timescale does not have a
strong overall impact on the pitch angle of spiral fea-
tures, it does have an effect on how concentrated fea-
tures are for St > 1 (comparing the left and right pan-
els in Figure 1). The density concentration for St > 1
particles within filament is stronger with a longer cool-
ing timescale. Simulations including self-gravitating
particles in 2D simulations by Shi et al. (2016) show
the same characteristics. They note that since turbu-
lent strength decreases with less efficient cooling, i.e.
α = (4/9)(γ(γ − 1)β)−1 (Gammie 2001), particles are
stirred less vigorously by the gas and thus relative ve-
locities between particles decrease by an order of a few.
With lower particle velocities, gravitational forces from
the gas structures begin to have an effect on particle
trajectories."
"Thus, based on the simulations presented, we suggest
Equation (17) serves to determine when particles of a
particular size form non-axisymmetric structures due to
aerodynamic drag interactions with the gas or via grav-
itational interaction with the gas."
5.3. Box Dimensions
"Shearing boxes are a useful approximation for their
high resolution of predominantly local phenomena, but
become unreliable when the simulation domain is too
small to resolve all or even some unstable wavenumbers
(Booth & Clarke 2019) or when the domain is so large
that the local linear approximation no longer remains
tenable. The former is largely problem dependant and
what may be too small for gravitational instabilities is
still suitable for simulating magnetorotational instabili-
ties. While the large and medium simulations used here
are suitable for calculating spiral pitch angles, anything
smaller does not develop sufficient gravitoturbulence to
form the necessary large scale structures."
"Hirose & Shi (2017) calculated autocorrelation maps
for various domain sizes and concluded that their small-
est boxes do not locally transport angular momentum as
well as larger boxes. This also agrees with the study of
Booth & Clarke (2019) which showed that small shear-
ing boxes produced erratic behavior once stabilizing ra-
dial modes did not fit within the domain. This causes
large swings in the density fluctuations and gravitotur-
bulent stress which would adversely affect the measured
pitch angle. Ultimately, similar to the comparable 2D
simulations of Shi et al. (2016), we find gas and dust
structures do not differ greatly between the two domain
sizes studied here."
Particles & Self-Gravity I: Spirals 13
5.4. Spirals Generated by Planets
"Spiral arms can also be attributed to an embedded
planet, caused by the superposition of multiple modes
of azimuthal and radial disturbances in the gravitational
potential which constructively and destructively inter-
fere with each other to produce the spiral morphology
seen in simulations (Goldreich & Tremaine 1979; Bae &
Zhu 2018a; Miranda & Rafikov 2019)."
"Because these spirals are launched from the planet lo-
cation they have a very steep pitch angle that becomes
shallower the further away from the planet it propagates
and will not have a single pitch angle. Thus, the spirals
from planets will have a range of pitch angles between
0◦ and 20◦, depending on the location away from the
planet, but not vary significantly with time (Bae & Zhu
2018a). This differs from the spirals formed by gravita-
tional instabilities, which may vary with time, but have
a generally consistent pitch angle over the range of the
disk for any given snapshot in time."
"Planets have been proposed as progenitors of spirals
in many disks, including the frequently studied disks
SAO 206462 (Muto et al. 2012; Grady et al. 2013; Dong
et al. 2015), MWC 758 (Dong et al. 2015, 2018b; Boehler
et al. 2018), and HD 100453 (Benisty et al. 2017; Wagner
et al. 2018). The spirals in these disks are unlikely to
be caused by gravitational instability in large part due
to their older ages and lower disk masses, none being
in the ranges normally associated with a self-gravitating
disk. Even so, the absence of a detected companion
keeps open the possibility of gravitational instabilities
as a cause."
6. CONCLUSION
"We investigated the spiral arms in self-gravitating
disks and analyzed a number of factors which could af-
fect what form they take and how they are observed.
Using local 3D shearing box simulations of gravitotur-
bulent disks we focused on the influence of the gas cool-
ing rate and simulation domain and how different sized
particles presented in each case. Self-gravitating disks
are a possible cause of spiral features which have been
observed in both gas and dust disks."
"In our simulations, We characterize their features in
not only gas properties, but in the dust as well, which
allows for a better comparison with observations. We
summarize our results in the following points:"
"• The opening angles of gas spirals in GI disks are
universal (∼ 10o), which are not significantly af-
fected by the size of the computational domain.
In our simulations with the biggest domain size,
the gas spirals become slightly more open with in-
creased cooling efficiency."
"• Particles of different sizes have similar responses to
the gas structure as measured by the pitch angle
when gas self-gravity acts on the dust. While it is
expected that smaller particles are more coupled
and have pitch angles that are more similar to the
gas, we find that this is also true for the larger
particles which are less affected by aerodynamic
drag but more affected by the gas gravity."
"• The above point suggests drag and self-gravity
may be comparable influences on the shape spi-
rals take. When particles do not feel the potential
of the gas at all, the ability of large particles to
form features corresponding to the gas is drasti-
cally diminished. This suggests that self-gravity
plays a role in shaping the structure spirals in grav-
itoturbulent disks, particularly for larger particles.
Even very low mass particles behave very similar
to more massive particles, but will not collapse
into small dense clouds unless particle-particle self-
gravity is included."
"• While large particle species show very broad non-
axisymmetric features, they become more refined
with decreased cooling efficiency (increasing β).
This occurs even for a vertically unsettled distri-
bution of particles which are still undergoing over-
damped oscillations about the midplane."
"Overall, both gas and dust at different sizes show spi-
rals with ∼ 10◦ pitch angle (almost all from 6◦ to 14◦ ),
independent on the simulation domain size. This pitch
angle is roughly consistent with current protoplanetary
disk observations. We observed some weak trends re-
garding particle sizes and cooling time. On the other
hand, considering the global nature of GI, it is desired
to investigate both gas and dust spirals in global simu-
lations in future."
