ABSTRACT
"Observations suggest that protoplanetary disks have moderate accretion rates onto the central young
star, especially at early stages (e.g. HL Tau), indicating moderate disk turbulence. However, recent
ALMA observations suggest that dust is highly settled, implying weak turbulence. Motivated by such
tension, we carry out 3D stratified local simulations of self-gravitating disks, focusing on settling of dust
particles in actively accreting disks. We find that gravitationally unstable disks can have moderately
high accretion rates while maintaining a relatively thin dust disk for two reasons. First, accretion stress
from the self-gravitating spirals (self-gravity stress) can be stronger than the stress from turbulence
(Reynolds stress) by a factor of 5-20. Second, the strong gravity from the gas to the dust decreases
the dust scale height by another factor of ∼ 2. Furthermore, the turbulence is slightly anisotropic,
producing a larger Reynolds stress than the vertical dust diffusion coefficient. Thus, gravitoturbulent
disks have unusually high vertical Schmidt numbers (Scz) if we scale the total accretion stress with
the vertical diffusion coefficient (e.g. Scz ∼ 10-100). The reduction of the dust scale height by the
gas gravity, should also operate in gravitationally stable disks (Q >1). Gravitational forces between
particles become more relevant for the concentration of intermediate dust sizes, forming dense clouds
of dust. After comparing with HL Tau observations, our results suggest that self-gravity and gravity
among different disk components could be crucial for solving the conflict between the protoplanetary
disk accretion and dust settling, at least at the early stages."

1. INTRODUCTION
"Disks accrete significant amounts of material during
their ∼ 1 Myr lifetime (Ribas et al. 2015), but the pro-
cess which can ubiquitously transfer angular momentum
in a disk remains elusive. Measurements of gas turbu-
lence often cannot reveal the midplane properties, due
to optically thick tracers. Normally only gas velocities
in the upper disk atmosphere can be probed (Flaherty
et al. 2015; Teague et al. 2016; Flaherty et al. 2017).
Observing the dust layer allows for a different indicator
of disk turbulence at the midplane (Pinte et al. 2016)."
"Various fluid instabilities have been used to explain
the turbulence which can drive disk accretion, including,
but not limited to, the magneto-rotational instability
(MRI) (Balbus & Hawley 1991), subcritical baroclinic
instability (SBI) (Klahr & Bodenheimer 2003; Klahr
& Hubbard 2014), and vertical shear instability (VSI)
(Nelson et al. 2013). Each is promising but comes with"

"important caveats. SBI requires low viscosities and pro-
duces comparatively weak angular momentum transport
(Malygin et al. 2017; Pfeil & Klahr 2019) while MRI
appears less likely to operate in the midplane of proto-
stellar disks due to low ionization and non-ideal MHD
effects (Lesur et al. 2014; Bai 2015)."
"VSI has become a focal point of research to explain
disk turbulence due to its robustness and being capable
of producing other disk features (e.g. vortices) (Stoll
& Kley 2014; Manger & Klahr 2018). However, Flock
et al. (2020) recently showed that for the level of tur-
bulent stress that VSI produces, the measured dust dis-
tribution is thicker than in observations. Pinte et al.
(2016) has shown that the dust disk of HL Tau revealed
by ALMA has a scale height less than 1 AU at 100 AU,
which is equivalent to a turbulent level of α < 10−3. On
the other hand, the detected accretion rate requires a
turbulent level of α ∼ 10−2. Furthermore, recent edge-
on ALMA observations of dust disks (Villenave et al.
2020) and disk accretion rate constraints from spectral
energy distribution studies (Ribas et al. 2020) add more
evidence that dust layers are significantly thinner than
theoretically anticipated. This suggests particles are sig-"

"nificantly settled even though there is still moderate ac-
cretion to drive short disk lifetimes."
"In this paper, we focus on the vertical dust distribu-
tion in disks subject to gravitational instabilities (GI)
which make it an alternative to hydrodynamic instabili-
ties like VSI. We lay out the theoretical framework on GI
and dust diffusion in Section 2. Section 3 describes our
numerical setup. In section 4, we measure the particle
scale heights and gas turbulent properties to determine
the level of vertical dust settling and vertical diffusion.
Finally, the implications on disk observations and the
evolution of protoplanetary disks are discussed in Sec-
tion 5 before we summarize our findings in Section 6."
2. GRAVITOTURBULENCE
"Turbulent transport in disks is described via the α
model (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), where the viscosity ν
is scaled to the local isotropic pressure"
"ν = αcsH , (1)"
"such that α is a dimensionless constant describing the
relative size and speed of turbulent motions in terms of
the disk pressure scale height H = cs/Ω and the sound
speed cs (Pringle 1981). Please note that we define"
"cs =
√
γP/ρ, which has also been adopted for defining"
"the Toomre Q parameter and disk α (Gammie 2001).
In a thin disk approximation, the remaining component
of the vertically-integrated stress tensor T can be ex-
pressed in terms of α, pressure P , orbital radius R and
orbital frequency Ω (Cossins et al. 2009)"
"Trφ = −αP
d ln Ω"
"d lnR
. (2)"
"The stress tensor can be separated into two compo-
nents, the gravitational stress G (e.g. due to spiral’s
self-gravity) and the Reynolds stress R from the disk
turbulence,"
"R+G = −αP
d ln Ω"
"d lnR
, (3)"
"where d ln Ω/d lnR = −3/2 in a Keplerian disk. Thus,
one can describe the total α stress"
α = αR + αG. (4)
as the sum of the Reynolds alpha
"αR =
2"
"〈ρuxuy〉
〈ρc2s 〉"
and the gravitational alpha
"αG =
2"
"〈gxgy〉
4πG〈ρc2s 〉"
"where gx and gy are the local gravitational accelerations
in the x and y directions respectively and P = ρc2s is"
"the locally isothermal pressure. In this paper, angled
brackets are the average over the horizontal x− y plane
for each vertical position."
"Circumstellar disks are susceptible to non-
axisymmetric density waves and gravitoturbulence as
long as 1 < Q . 1.5 (Durisen et al. 2007) where"
"Q =
csΩ"
"πGΣ
, (7)"
"is the Toomre stability parameter (Toomre 1964). Disks
will fragment when the both the thermal relaxation time
tc = βΩ"
"−1 . 3 and when Q < 1 (Gammie 2001). To
avoid fragmentation, we consider Ω = G = 1, cs,0 = π
and the combined gas and dust surface density Σ0 =
Σg,0 + Σp,0 such that Q(t = 0) is just slightly above
unity."
"Depending on the cooling efficiency β, gravitoturbu-
lence can be quite strong, i.e. α ∼ 0.01 − 0.1 (Gam-
mie 2001,but see Paardekooper 2012). However, without
mass replenishment, the turbulence can die out quickly.
The accretion led by the instability decreases the mass
which in turn makes the disk stable against the instabil-
ity, and only with enough accretion from the envelope
onto the disk can gravitational instabilities persist (Zhu
et al. 2012)."
"Recent studies that have looked into the vertical struc-
ture of gravitoturbulence find that turbulent stresses
and turbulent velocities vary only by an order of mag-
nitude from the midplane to a few scale heights despite
much steeper decreases in gas density (Shi & Chiang
2014; Riols et al. 2017). It is important to distinguish
between the stress components R and G and their di-
mensionless counterparts, αR and αG. In stratified sim-
ulations, the vertical density profile and thus the vertical
pressure profile will lead to separate structure for both
components. The initial temperature profile is isother-
mal and it remains vertically isothermal when in equilib-
rium, so the density and pressure profiles scale the same
with distance from the midplane. Reynolds stresses
scale similar to the pressure, leading to a mostly flat
profile of αR. Gravitational stresses G are stronger near
the midplane but only drop off modestly with increas-
ing height above the midplane, highlighting the range
and strength of gravitational interactions (Shi & Chiang
2014). Since the pressure drops off rapidly with height
above the midplane compared to the gravitational stress,
αG will increase significantly even though the gravita-
tional stress is decreasing (Shi & Chiang 2014). Thus
αG is comparable to αR near the midplane (∼ 10−2),
but in some cases approaching order unity in the upper
levels of the disk atmosphere. This is potentially rele-
vant to observations, as only a fraction of disk accretion
is due to the turbulence which can diffuse the dust."
"More recently, Riols et al. (2020) investigated the ver-
tical structure of both the gas and dust in gravitotur-
bulent disks in order to ascertain how well turbulence
models compare to well-coupled dust measured at and"

range vertical effects of self-gravity in comparison to the
local midplane turbulence can affect the settling of dust
merits closer attention."
"Besides the fact that the total α can be significantly
larger than the turbulent αR which can lead to a thin
dust disk, the vertical gravity from gas to dust can make
the dust disk even thinner. We can derive the density
structure of the dust disk by equating the settling flux
with the diffusion flux. For small particles, the terminal
velocity can be calculated by balancing the gravitational
force with the gas drag force"

from the star (the second term in the exponential) by a
factor of 4H/(QHd,0). Although, this factor can become
quite large if H � Hd,0, our derivation only applies if
most of the disk mass is at the midplane. Considering
that the gas mass is far larger than the dust mass, it
means that our derivation applies to dust that is not
very settled (e.g. Hd,0 ∼ H)."

assume that the self-gravity from gas dominates and the"

hydrodynamic shearing box simulations to study the dy-
namics of self-gravitating disks with Lagrangian super-
particles embedded in the Eulerian mesh using the Pen-
cil code (Brandenburg 2003)."
"We set our simulations to be marginally Toomre sta-
ble, Q0 = 1.02. The simulation details are given in
the model section and Table 1 of Baehr & Zhu (2021).
We briefly summarize the simulations below. Simula-
tions are designated by their cooling timescale and size."

simulations with Lx = Ly = (160/π)H, Lz = (40/π)H

gas mass ratio is � = 0.01. Simulations with self-gravity
of the gas and dust turned on or off are described below.
Additional simulations were run at cooling timescales
comparable to those in Riols et al. (2020), and at higher
grid resolution."
"Gas and dust are both initialized with Gaussian dis-
tributions with the same vertical width Hg,0 = Hd,0 =
0.63H and allowed to relax as turbulence and settling
develop. Stellar gravity is included with a sinusoidal
vertical profile to avoid a discontinuity of the vertical
acceleration at the periodic upper and lower boundaries.
Simulations are either resolved in each direction by 10
grid cells per H for the large boxes or 20 grid cells per
H for the medium boxes. We compare these resolutions
with other studies in Section 5.4."

tial and density of the gas plus dust particles combined.
This is the default setup for the first six simulations and
we distinguish these six from the next three by the in-
clusion of gas-particle and particle-particle gravitational
interactions self-consistently. Among these three simu-
lations, the simulation with ’low dust mass’ (simulation
suffix lowpsg) indicates that the particle mass is so low
that it does not contribute to the gravitational potential
Φ = Φg and thus every particle does not feel the grav-
ity of other particles while still feeling the gravitational
acceleration from the gas potential. For the simulation
indicated as ’no particle self-gravity’ (simluation suffix
nopsg), the dust particles neither contribute to the po-
tential nor feel the gas potential and thus the particles
only feel the aerodynamic drag force, the shearing box
inertial forces, and the gravitational force from the cen-
tral star."
4. RESULTS
"We summarize the simulation results in Table 1 and
describe the two main diagnostics for the radial viscous
stress and vertical particle diffusion below."
4.1. Turbulence
"We measure two properties of the gas turbulence: the
α stresses and the dispersion of the vertical gas velocities
u2z, averaged in the x-y plane at different heights. They
are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1. Figure 1 also
shows the gas and dust vertical density profiles in blue
and orange lines, respectively. Turbulence may have
transient fluctuations which produce negative stresses,
even while averaged in the x-y plane. To eliminate these
fluctuations, quantities are averaged in time for 30 snap-
shots between t = 50 Ω−1 and t = 80 Ω−1, when turbu-
lence has settled, and thus they are denoted with bars,"
"e.g. 〈u2z〉 or α. Even so, Reynolds stresses at the mid-
plane are still lower than elsewhere and even negative as
in the middle-right panel of Figure 1."
"We compare the total stress of Equation (4), as a sim-
ple volume average which can be compared with the
analytic expression from Gammie (2001):"
"γ(γ − 1)β
. (17)"
"In Figure 1, Equation (17) is indicated by the gray
dashed line. Averaged over the vertical extent, the grav-
itational stress (green line) is roughly an order of mag-
nitude greater than the Reynolds stress. From the top
to bottom panels, we can see that the ratio between αG
and αR decreases (αG/αR from 30 to 5) with a longer
cooling time (β from 2 to 10). Thus, gravitational stress
is more important for a faster cooling GI disk."
"The dark red lines in Figure 1 show the vertical profiles
of the vertical gas velocities and are typically subsonic,
but can reach transonic values in the upper disk atmo-
spheres. The averaged gas velocities in Table 1 are cal-
culated both as a simple volume average and a density-
weighted volume average. The two differ by around
∼ 15%, since the dense midplane generally has lower
vertical velocities, and the density-weighted average will
lean towards the lower velocities near the midplane."
"The particle density distributions all show some set-
tling as a narrower peak near the midplane. The fol-
lowing section breaks down this particle distribution by
size to determine how settling varies with each particle
species."
4.2. Vertical Particle Diffusion
"In Figure 2, the vertical distribution of the four small-
est dust species are shown. Particles are binned ac-
cording to their nearest grid cell in Figure 1, and"

Figure 6. Comparison of three different implementations of particles. Left panel: vertical turbulence and density profiles as in
Figure 1. Right panel: the evolution of the gas (dashed) and dust (solid) vertical scale heights. The oscillations in the particle
"scale height are due to the overdamped settling of the large dust species St ≥ 10. The first case does not include gas or dust
self-gravity as a reference case, the second considers that particles do not contribute to the potential, i.e. Φ = Φg, and do not"
"feel the potential either. In the third case, the dust-to-gas ratio is smaller by a factor of 10−4, meaning they do not contribute"
"significantly to the potential, but still feel the gas."
"then summed over 30 snapshots. Particles with smaller
Stokes numbers are more broadly distributed compared
to larger particles, and will take tens of orbital periods
to fully settle. Larger species St ≥ 10 settle as over-
damped oscillations, overshooting the midplane many
times in each direction before eventually settling. The
especially large dust species with St ≥ 100 will do so for
longer than the duration of the simulation and therefore
are not included in the following analysis. Dust settling
is balanced by the vertical diffusion from gravitoturbu-
lence. Particles with St closer to 1 have faster settling
which is harder for turbulent diffusion to balance, thus
forming a narrower distribution."
"Based on the distribution of particles at each size, we
determine the scale height for each dust species. We fit
Gaussian profiles to the entire vertical distribution (i.e.
z = [−6H, 6H]) of each species binned to the nearest
grid cell, using an initial guess with a width of z = H.
In Figure 3, we plot these particle scale heights against
the inverted particle size St−1 in order to estimate the
vertical particle diffusion coefficient Dd,z,"

"Equation (18) is most appropriate for particles that

heights of St = 0.1 and 1 in Figure 3 to derive the dif-
fusion coefficients. The dimensionless diffusion constant

"d,z = Dd,z/csH is reported in Table 1. Alternatively,
we can use a more general equation which applies to
both small and big dust to estimate the diffusion coef-
ficient with all the three smallest species. By doing so,
we find very similar values (see Appendix Section A).

"d,z.
Table 1 suggests that ScR,z of the large simula-"
"tions calculated with the Reynolds stresses are close to
unity, while ScR,z from the medium-sized simulations
are around a factor of 4 greater. Due to the large ratio
between α and αR in our GI simulations, the Schmidt
number calculated with the total α stress is much larger,
almost two orders of magnitude greater in some cases.
This indicates a significant amount of settling of the
intermediate-sized dust compared to the high radial ac-
cretion."
"We highlight an observed trend in the ratios α/αR
and Scz as function of the cooling timescale in Figure
4. With rapid cooling and strong radial transport, both
α/αR and Scz are very high, but decrease as the gravi-
toturbulence weakens and becomes more comparable in
strength to the Reynolds stress. We expect that simula-
tions with longer cooling times, i.e. β ∼ 20-30, and res-
olution similar to or medium boxes could have Schmidt
number that explain the turbulence levels and dust set-
tling of disk observations."
"In Figure 5 we show the evolution of the dust and gas
scale heights over the duration of the simulation. The
gas pressure scale height, indicated by the dashed lines,
is less than Hg/H = 1 for two reasons. First, since we
use an adiabatic equation of state, the gas scale height
is Hg = H/"
"√
γ = 0.77H. Second, gas self-gravity has"
"a small, but noticeable effect on the gas distribution,
such that it is no longer Gaussian and slightly narrower
within two scale heights of the midplane (Riols et al.
2017). This discrepancy can be seen in the right panel
of Figure 6, where the gas in a disk without self-gravity"
"has settled to Hg/H ∼ 0.8 and the others with self-
gravity are narrower, as indicated by the blue lines in
the panels to the right."
"The dust scale height including all particle species is
indicated by the solid line in Figure 5. In both medium-
sized and big box simulations, the dust scale heights
with the most efficient cooling β = 2, increase consis-
tently over a long time scale until it matches the gas
scale height. This appears to correspond to some excess
Reynolds stress just above the the disk midplane (see
gold lines in top two panels of Figure 1), potentially an
indicator of the parametric instabilities reported in Riols
et al. (2017)."
"A parametric instability in a self-gravitating disk
would be the result of an axisymmetric mode interacting
with inertial waves with half the frequency. We inves-
tigate this further in Figure 7. Apparent in Figure 5
is the gradual increase of the particle scale height with
time in simulations as long as β = 2, perhaps indicating
the presence of additional turbulence. Figure 7 shows a
comparison of the gas flow patterns in the top row and
the vertical properties closer to the end of the end of
the simulations. When β = 10 the symmetric circula-
tion patterns near the intersection with the high-density
spiral arms is stronger compared to the case where β = 2
and the pattern is disrupted by turbulence near the mid-
plane (compare with Figure 9 of Riols & Latter (2018)).
In the vertical profile of the latter, the vertical motions
around the midplane u2z are suppressed."

"at a few scale heights above the disk midplane from the
subsonic to transonic regions, as with Riols et al. (2017)."
"We emphasize the importance of the gas self-gravity
acting upon particles in Figure 8. The left panel shows
the vertical distribution of particles calculated based on
30 snapshots from t = 50 Ω−1 to t = 80 Ω−1, but with
different treatments for self-gravity. From these simula-
tions we draw a number of key conclusions about how
self-gravity affects the settling of dust and what it im-
plies about the vertical diffusion."
5.1. Particle Settling
"The top panel in Figure 8 shows a settling test of the
particles in the complete absence of any self-gravity from
either the gas or the particles. Thus, particles settle
in a static disk without turbulence. The settling time
is inversely proportional to their sizes tsettle ∼ 1/St for
St ≤ 1 particles (Youdin & Lithwick 2007) in the absence
of any turbulent diffusion. The intermediate particles
St = 0.1, 1, 10 settle rapidly and form a thin layer at the
two grid cells on either side of z = 0. The simulation
does not last long enough for St = 0.01 particles to
completely settle."
"The second panel from the top in Figure 8 shows how
particles settle in a gravitoturbulent disk with only the
gas component being considered for self-gravity. Parti-
cles only feel the vertical gravity of the stellar potential
and do not feel the gravity from the gas or dust mass
concentrated at the disk midplane. Thus, without any
self-gravity acting on the dust, each particle size has a
thicker layer compared to the cases which include self-"

"gravity. This test studies the dust diffusion by the grav-
itoturbulence solely without including additional con-
centration effects due to the gas and dust gravity. The
two intermediate sized particle species (St =0.1, 1) are
diffused by the gravitoturbulence of the gas while the
largest and smallest particles are largely unchanged."
"In the third panel from the top, the same simulation
is run again, but particles do feel the gravitational accel-
eration of the gas, but not of the other particles. Here
we see noticeable settling of the intermediate dust and
slight narrowing of the distribution for the smallest dust.
The narrowing is roughly consistent with our expecta-
tion (Equation 15). Finally in the bottom panel, the
dust particles contribute to the self-gravity potential and
is fully self-consistently included, but it has little effect
on the overall settling of any dust species compared with
the panel above."
"The dust scale heights and the diffusion coefficients
for these tests are shown in the right panel of Fig-
ure 8 and Table 1. Comparing the S t5 B nopsg and
S t5 B lowpsg cases, we see that the gas gravity re-
duces the dust scale height by a factor of ∼ 1.8. The
turbulence is quite isotropic (ScR,z = 1.7) when the gas
gravity is neglected (the S t5 B lowpsg case). Strictly
speaking, when we include the gravity from gas to dust,
the turbulent properties are not changed so that we
should use the same diffusion coefficient and Equation
15 to derive the dust scale height. On the other hand, it
is more convenient to factor theQ coefficient of Equation
15 into the definition of dust diffusion coefficient and use
Equation 18 to derive a new dust diffusion coefficient.
This is also how previous observations constrain the dif-
fusion coefficient (e.g. Pinte et al. 2016). Thus, the new
dust diffusion coefficient defined in this way is reduced
by a factor of ∼3, so that Scz and ScR,z is increased"
"by a factor of ∼3 compared with the case without gas
gravity."
5.2. Vertical Schmidt Number
"Such a high Schmidt number (20-200) is crucial for ex-
plaining the moderate disk accretion (Ribas et al. 2020)
but thin dust disk (Villenave et al. 2020). Pinte et al.
(2016) estimate that Scz ≥ 10 is needed to explain HL
Tau’s accretion rate and thin dust disk."
"The Schmidt number has been studied for turbulence
driven by several instabilities in protoplanetary disks,
including the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) (Jo-
hansen & Klahr 2005; Carballido et al. 2011; Zhu et al.
2015; Riols & Lesur 2018) and the vertical shear insta-
bility (VSI) (Stoll & Kley 2016). Simulations of the
MRI show that the particle diffusion is comparable to
the angular momentum transport, i.e. Schmidt numbers
around unity. In some cases, especially for non-ideal
MHD, the Schmidt number can be even smaller than 1
(Zhu et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2018). In the case of VSI,
Flock et al. (2020) find that Schmidt number of VSI is
∼ 0.04 due to the thin vertical circulating motion. Thus,
both MRI and VSI cannot explain observations. Other
accretion mechanisms need to be explored, such as disk
wind (Riols & Lesur 2018) or disk self-gravity."
"Some previous works have explored how dust in self-
gravitating disks can settle. Sengupta et al. (2019) use
a Monte Carlo turbulent settling model and find that
dust settling is enough to affect the local Toomre sta-
bility of the disk. But it does not include the gravita-
tional force from the gas disk to the dust. Riols et al.
(2020) use much the same methods as here, but ar-
rive at the conclusion that settling is not very signifi-
cant. This may in part be due to the fluid description of
solids which limits the range of included dust particles
to St < 1. For St = 0.1 at β = 20 we find the ratio"
Particles & Self-Gravity II: Accretion and Dust 11
"of the dust-to-gas scale height Hd/Hg ∼ 0.23, similar
to the value for St = 0.16 in Figure 3 of Riols et al.
(2020). However, whereas their value for vertical dif-
fusion Dz = 0.013 predicts the scale height ratio to be
Hd/Hg ∼ 10−1 at St = 1, we find scale height ratios
as low as Hd/Hg = 5 × 10−2. Thus, we infer a lower
diffusion constant. This trend continues in our simula-
tions at β = 20 and β = 30 and our Schmidt numbers
remain high, suggesting more research is needed to quan-
tify the strength of dust settling. Nevertheless, based on
the diffusion and accretion coefficients provided in Ri-
ols et al. (2020), Scz is ∼4 in their simulations, which is
also larger than 1, in broad agreement that non-isotropic
diffusion is operating in GI disks."
"Our simulations suggest that gravitationally unstable
disk can easily have Scz ≥10, consistent with HL Tau
observations. Furthermore, due to the early evolution-
ary stage of HL Tau, the disk is quite massive (Carrasco-
González et al. 2019) and GI will naturally operate in
such a disk. In Figure 11, we compare the dust set-
tling which results from some of the diffusion parame-
ters measured in Table 1 with the settling inferred from
HL Tau observations (Pinte et al. 2016) and from global
VSI simulations (Flock et al. 2020). All the GI cases
shown have accretion α > 0.01. Observations indeed
suggest significant accretion equivalent to α ≈ 0.01 at
100 au (Beck et al. 2010; Pinte et al. 2016) which is not
congruent with the angular momentum transport typi-
cally associated with VSI, but may be consistent with
MRI (Flock et al. 2017). Gravitoturbulence on the other
hand, can provide both significant accretion along with
a thin dust disk. Unexplained however is why the spirals
characteristic of such a massive disk would be absent in
ALMA dust continuum observations. This can be due
to some other mechanisms which are producing gaps in
HL Tau and concentrate dust in rings. In this case, the
spirals may still be present in the gas. Or, the lack of
observed spirals can be due to that the Q in the disk is
not low enough to trigger the spirals."
"We emphasize that even if Q > 1 and the disk is
gravitationally stable, the additional settling due to gas
gravity cannot be neglected (Equation 15). At a height
z = H above the disk midplane, vertical acceleration
due to stellar gravity is comparable to self-gravity when"
Ω2H = 2πGΣ (20)
"which corresponds to Q = 2. Thus, the effects of disk
self-gravity are likely to be non-negligible for Q up to a
few. Future simulations will need to focus on the inter-
action between gas self-gravity and VSI, as even a Q = 2
disk may be enough to reduce the dust scale height in a
VSI disk significantly. HL Tau has a measured Toomre
Q as low as 2 (Liu et al. 2017), which should be not
expected to produce spiral features as long as Q & 1.7,
consistent with the ring features of HL Tau. Overall,
disk self-gravity may still promote dust settling even in"

5.3. Particle Self-Gravity
"Gravitoturbulent disks have been suggested as a pos-
sible location for planetesimal formation (Rice et al.
2004; Gibbons et al. 2012) as long as relative veloc-
ities between dust particles are low enough to avoid
fragmentation events which prevent growth (Booth &
Clarke 2016). While the gravitational acceleration be-
tween particles (dust disk’s self-gravity) has little effect
on vertical dust settling, it is only with particle-particle
self-gravity that dense clouds of dust are formed. In
Figure 9, we show the number of grid cells with N par-
ticles for three comparable simulations, aside from the
implementation of self-gravity. Only in the case where
particles can feel the self-gravity of the other particles
are there a considerable number of concentrations up to
N = 104. When the dust does not feel any self-gravity at
all (blue line), particles concentrate less in the interme-
diate ranges N ∼ 10 − 100 compared to the simulation
with gas self-gravity acting on the particles (green line)."
"We plot the velocity distribution of each particle
species in Figure 10 for the case where (a) particle-
particle self gravity is included and (b) when dust mass
is too low for it to matter. The sharp features of the
St = 1 in (a) indicate that many of the dense clumps
from Figure 9 are groups of intermediate-sized parti-
cles with low relative velocities and potentially bound.
Whether these particle clouds can become planetesimals
depends on whether or not dust can grow to the interme-
diate sizes fast enough and avoid encountering the frag-
mentation and drift barriers of planetesitmals (Booth &
Clarke 2016). The critical length scale to be resolved for
collapsing to a planetesimal is (Klahr & Schreiber 2020)"

simulations. Even if a simulation is unable to resolve

or above Hill density"
"ρHill =

", (22)"
"can be subject to diffusion-regulated collapse (Gerbig
et al. 2020), given a stellar mass M∗ and an orbital ra-
dius R. Several of our St = 1 dust clouds are above
dust-to-gas ratio of unity and at Hill density. Whether
these clouds have the sufficient conditions for further
collapse in the presence of the large scale diffusion of
gravitoturbulence and the smaller scales turbulence due
to streaming instability will be studied in future work."
"We note that particle feedback, the effect of solid ma-
terial pushing a fluid as it passes through it, is not in-
cluded in these models. When local dust-to-gas ratios
approach � = 1 and greater, feedback will become im-
portant and may lead to enhanced particle densities."
5.4. Additional Considerations
"We want to note that another explanation for well-
settled dust disks comes from the launching of winds
from the disk surface. A disk wind could remove angu-
lar momentum and provide moderate accretion without
adding any turbulence to the midplane, allowing dust
to settle (Bai & Stone 2013). In tandem with a layered
accretion, where disk surfaces are MRI active and the
midplane is a dead zone due to non-ideal MHD effects
(Gammie 1996), disk winds could work together to ex-
plain the high accretion and settling (Hasegawa et al.
2017). On the other hand, even if this is the case and
the disk is gravitationally stable, the studied gravita-
tionally effect to reduce dust scale height (e.g. Eq. 15)
should still operate in such massive disks."
"While the box size does not appear to be a decisive
factor in the results of our simulations, medium boxes
are slightly more consistent with analytic predictions of
overall turbulent stress α. This is likely due to the better
resolution, although the resolution of both domain sizes
is within the converged ranges of similar studies. How-
ever, the gas density profile is slightly broader in these
larger domains, and the lack of resolution in the vertical
direction may have a two-fold effect. Slightly stronger
Reynolds stresses would broaden the gas density profile
and as a result weaken the vertical self-gravity. This
can be seen in the almost order of magnitude difference
between ScR,z of each size in Figure 4. With higher
resolution, the Reynolds stresses appear to become less
isotropic. Booth & Clarke (2019) find that gravitotur-
bulent diagnostics like α and the volume averaged Q"
"are unaffected by resolution down to 8 grid cells per
scale height H (see their Figure 1), for a simulation size
slightly larger than the medium boxes used here. Our
resolution is 10 grid cells per H for the big boxes, and 20
cells per H for the smaller boxes. These smaller boxes
are similar in size Lx = Ly = 25H and effective resolu-
tion (20 grid cells per H) to the primary runs of Riols
et al. (2020). They see a lower resolution by a factor 2,
which is comparable in resolution to our big box runs,
does not change the measured dust scale heights signif-
icantly (their Figure 3). However, box size is still an
important factor which determines which modes are in-
corporated in disk stability, reflected in the overall larger
Q values for larger boxes. (Booth & Clarke 2019). Ulti-
mately, as an instability with long-range effects, we aim
to model GI in global simulations, which will provide
the most insight into dust settling in gravitoturbulent
disks and compare with observations."
6. CONCLUSION
"Using 3D vertically stratified local hydrodynamic sim-
ulations, we investigate the vertical settling of different
sized dusts in gravitationally unstable disks. We sys-
tematically explore how different cooling times, differ-
ent box sizes, and treatments of gas/dust gravity affect
the particle settling. We summarize our results in the
following points:"
"• Turbulent strength in our simulations is consis-
tent with the analytical expectation. The gravita-
tional stress is comparable to the Reynolds stress
near the midplane, but as the latter falls off with
height, the volume averaged gravitational stress is
stronger than the turbulent Reynolds stress by a
factor of 5− 30, increasing with a shorter cooling
time."
"• Dust settling is enhanced by the vertical gravi-
tational attraction of the gas onto the particles.
Even when a disk becomes less massive and the
disk is gravitationally stable (e.g. Q > 1), the in-
fluence of gas self-gravity on particles should be
included when studying dust settling in disks with
other turbulent driving mechanisms."
"• The resulting high Schmidt numbers due to both
strong gravitational stress and gas vertical gravity
(Scz ∼ 20 − 200) suggest gravitationally unstable
disks could have strong accretion accompanied by
thin dust disks. The high amount of settling could
possibly help explain the observations of young,
thin, dust protoplanetary disks accreting at mod-
erate rates (e.g. HL Tau)."
"• While self-gravity of the gas onto the dust parti-
cles causes the significant settling of intermediate-
sized dust, self-gravity between dust particles of
the same size produces several dense clouds with"
Particles & Self-Gravity II: Accretion and Dust 13
"high dust-to-gas ratios. These clouds have low rel-
ative velocities and could continue to collapse to
form planetesimals at a very early stage in the disk
lifetime."
"Ultimately, self-gravity of the dense gas midplane has
a significant affect on the vertical settling of dust in grav-
itoturbulent disks. Despite the strong turbulence and
high radial diffusion typical of gravitoturbulent disks,
the gravitational acceleration of the dense gas midplane
causes significant settling of intermediate dust sizes.
This could help to explain recent ALMA observations
and also promote planetesimal formation."

A. DIFFUSION CONSTANT
"The diffusion constant derived in the text uses a simpler relation between particle scale height Hp and particle size ts
based on an assumption of no vertical stratification. The simulations presented are clearly stratified, but the relation
still holds well for the intermediate sizes and is easier to interpret from Figure 3. Nevertheless, we find it important
to validate the result with a more rigorous relation and we provide an alternate derivation of the diffusion constant
based on Dubrulle et al. (1995) which allows for a fit which includes St = 0.01"
