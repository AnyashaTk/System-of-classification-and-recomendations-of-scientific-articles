ABSTRACT
"Extreme emission-line galaxies (EELGs) at redshift z = 1− 2 provide a unique view of metal-poor, starburst
sources that are the likely drivers of the cosmic reionization at z ≥ 6. However, the molecular gas reservoirs
of EELGs - the fuel for their intense star-formation - remain beyond the reach of current facilities. We present
ALMA [C II] and PdBI CO(2–1) observations of a z = 1.8, strongly lensed EELG SL2S 0217, a bright Lyman-
α emitter with a metallicity 0.05 Z�. We obtain a tentative (∼3-4σ) detection of the [C II] line and set an upper
limit on the [C II]/SFR ratio of ≤ 1× 106 L�/(M� yr−1), based on the synthesized images and visibility-plane
analysis. The CO(2–1) emission is not detected. Photoionization modelling indicates that up to 80% of the [C II]
emission originates from neutral or molecular gas, although we can not rule out that the gas is fully ionized. The
very faint [C II] emission is in line with both nearby metal-poor dwarfs and high-redshift Lyman α emitters,
and predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. However, the [C II] line is 30× fainter than predicted by the
De Looze et al. [C II]-SFR relation for local dwarfs, illustrating the danger of extrapolating locally-calibrated
relations to high-redshift, metal-poor galaxies."

(M? . 109 M�) galaxies with intense star formation rates;

photons will be able to escape and reionize the neutral in-
tergalactic medium (e.g., Robertson et al. 2010, 2015; Atek
et al. 2015; Stark 2016). These metal-poor, dwarf galaxies
contribute significantly to the cosmic star-forming rate (SFR)"

"at z ≥ 3 (e.g., Bouwens et al. 2009). Consequently, charac-
terizing the star-forming processes in z ≥ 6 dwarf galaxies
presents a crucial step towards understanding the evolution
of galaxies at early cosmic times. However, these faint, high-
redshift dwarf galaxies remain elusive due to the limitations
of current facilities (mainly the Hubble Space Telescope and
the Spitzer Space Telescope), along with the fact that for the
most distant targets the diagnostic-rich optical emission is
shifted to the near-IR regime and thus currently unobservable
- a situation that will be soon remedied by the James Webb
Space Telescope. Consequently, large uncertainties remain
on the physical mechanisms of galaxy-led reionization, such
as the actual fraction of ionizing photons that escape their in-
terstellar medium (ISM), their star formation efficiency, and
feedback processes at play."
"An alternative to studying directly the z ≥ 6 dwarf galax-
ies is to target the intermediate-redshift (z ∼ 2) extreme
emission line galaxies (EELGs; van der Wel et al. 2011;
Atek et al. 2011; Maseda et al. 2013, 2014; Amorı́n et al.
2015), which are likely analogues of primordial galaxies
at the EoR and can be studied much more efficiently, par-
ticularly in emission and absorption lines. EELGs have
been identified through extremely high equivalent widths
(EWs) of optical emission lines such as [O III] 5007 Å
(with rest-frame EW exceeding 500Å), via excess emis-
sion in HST/WFC3 broad-band filters (van der Wel et al.
2011), and through HST/WFC3 grism spectroscopy (Maseda
et al. 2018). Spectroscopic and photometric follow-up con-
firm that these are low-mass (M? ∼ 108 − 109M�), low-
metallicity (Z < 0.30Z�) dwarf galaxies with high SFRs
(∼ 10 − 100M�yr−1), likely undergoing an intense but
short-lived burst of star formation (e.g., Maseda et al. 2013,
2014; Masters et al. 2014; Tang et al. 2019)."
"While rest-frame UV and optical studies of high-redshift
star-forming dwarfs have primarily targeted the ionized ISM,
their intense star formation must be fueled by cold neutral
gas. In particular, measuring the cold gas reservoirs of high-
redshift dwarfs is crucial for understanding the timescales
on which their high-mass star formation can be maintained.
However, direct observations of the cold ISM phase in these
faint, metal-poor sources are extremely challenging, even at
z ∼ 1− 2."
"Our best bet for probing the molecular gas content of this
metal-poor galaxies is the [C II] 158-µm line, thanks to
its low critical density and large intrinsic brightness. At
z ∼ 2, Herschel and ALMA Band 9 [C II] observations
have been instrumental in probing the gas content of M? =
109−1011M� galaxies (e.g., Stacey et al. 2010; Brisbin et al.
2015; Schaerer et al. 2015; Zanella et al. 2018). Crucially,
for the EoR sources, the [C II] line is easily observable with
ALMA and has become the chief probe of cool gas in early
galaxies (e.g., Maiolino et al. 2005, 2015; Knudsen et al."
"2016; Bradač et al. 2017; Matthee et al. 2019; see Hodge
& da Cunha 2020 for a recent review). At the same time, the
[C II] emission in high-redshift galaxies has been explored by
a number of cosmological (e.g., Olsen et al. 2017; Lagache
et al. 2018) and zoom-in simulations (e.g., Vallini et al. 2015;
Katz et al. 2017; Pallottini et al. 2019; Lupi & Bovino 2020)."
"In this paper, we attempt to study the neutral ISM in
a strongly gravitationally lensed z ∼ 2 SL2S 0217, tar-
geting the [C II] line with Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-
millimetre Array (ALMA), and CO(2–1) with the Plateau de
Bure Interferometer (PdBI). Thanks to its large magnifica-
tion, SL2S 0217 provides a unique opportunity to detect the
neutral ISM in a high-redshift EELG with a stellar mass of
just 108 M� - 1 dex lower than any previous z ∼ 2 study."
"This paper is structured as follows: § 2 presents our ALMA
and PdBI observations, data combination and imaging proce-
dures; § 3 presents the derivation of the source-plane upper
limits on the [C II] and CO(2–1) luminosities. In § 4, we
compare our [C II] non-detection to the expectations pho-
toionization modelling (§ 4.1), various empirical and theoret-
ical [C II]-SFR relationships (§ 4.2) as well as local and high-
redshift observations (§ 4.3). Finally, we discuss the fate of
the molecular gas in SL2S 0217 (§ 4.4) and the prospects of
detecting the [C II] emission from SL2S 0217-like dwarfs in
the Epoch of Reionization (§ 4.5)."
2. OBSERVATIONS AND IMAGING
2.1. Target description
"SL2S 021737–051329 (henceforth SL2S 0217, J2000 02h
17m 37.237s -05d13m29.7s) is a redshift z = 1.844 EELG,
strongly gravitationally lensed by a z = 0.6459 elliptical
galaxy. SL2S 0217 was serendipitously discovered by Geach
et al. (2007, source ID SXDF-iS-170569). Thanks to its po-
sition under the cusp of the lensing caustic, SL2S 0217 is
lensed into a brilliant, 2.5-arcsec long Einstein arc, with a
fainter counter-image. The lens system includes a second,
doubly-imaged background source SL2S 0217.X at z = 2.29
(Brammer et al. 2012)."
"The stellar content of SL2S 0217 was studied by Brammer
et al. (2012, B12) using HST GRISM spectroscopy and Berg
et al. (2018, B18) using Keck/LRIS optical spectroscopy.
Pixellated lens modelling of SL2S 0217 based on the HST
data1 was performed by Cooray et al. (2011), B18 and Erb
et al. (2019); in the B18 model, the HST F606W continuum
is magnified by a factor of ∼ 17, with a source-plane UV
half-light radius of ∼ 0.35 kpc. We adopt the source-plane
properties listed in Table 1, based on the B18 lens model. The
Z = 0.05 Z� metallicity of SL2S 0217 is typical of z ∼ 6
galaxies with the same stellar mass (c.f. FIRSTLIGHT sim-"

"The spatial distribution of the Lyα emission in SL2S 0217
was studied by Erb et al. (2019, E19) using narrow-band HST
imaging. This revealed a 0.6-kpc offset between Lyα and the
UV continuum, indicating a varying column density of neu-
tral hydrogen across the source, with the bulk of the Lyα pho-
tons escaping along a low column density channel. The long-
wavelength spectral energy distribution of SL2S 0217 is only
poorly sampled, with a single detection in the Spitzer/MIPS
24-µm imaging (B12; 7.3–9.1 µm rest-frame, including the
7.7 and 8.6 µm PAH bands) which indicates a significant hot-
dust and/or PAH emission. In this paper, we extend this com-
prehensive dataset to the far-infrared and mm-wave regime,
targeting the [C II] 158 µm line."
"We assume a flat ΛCDM cosmology, with Ωm = 0.315
and H0 = 67.4 km s−1 Mpc−1 (Planck Collaboration et al.
2020). At z = 1.844, this translates to a luminosity distance
DL = 14460 Mpc; 1 arcsec corresponds to a physical dis-
tance of 8.65 kpc (Wright 2006)."
2.2. ALMA Band 9 observations and imaging
"We combine deep ALMA Band 9 observations of the [C II]
line (f0=1900.539 GHz) and the underlying rest-frame 160-
µm continuum from the ALMA projects #2016.1.00142.S
and #2016.1.00776.S."
"The ALMA programme #2016.1.00142.S (PI: da Cunha)
observations were carried out in two array configurations:"
"C43-1 (2018 July 6) and C43-2 (2018 August 16). The base-
line length ranged between 15 and 314 m (C43-1) and 15
to 479 m (C43-2). Forty 12-m antennas were used on both
dates. The primary beam FWHM was 9.0 arcsec at 680 GHz.
The precipitable water vapour (pwv) ranged between 0.4 and
0.5 mm. The total observing time was 2.7 hours, with a total
on-source time of 67 minutes."
"The spectral setup consisted of four spectral windows
(SPWs) with 480 channels of 3.906 MHz each, giving a total
bandwidth of 2.0 GHz per SPW. The individual SPWs were
centered at 667.61, 669.53, 649.91 and 648.03 GHz."
"As the ALMA pipeline products suffered from calibration
issues, we calibrated the data manually by completely flag-
ging antennas with high system temperature: C43-1 config-
uration: DA62, DA44, DA50, DV09, DV24; C43-2: DA62.
We used DV07 as the reference antenna due to its low system
temperature, good bandpass stability, and central position in
the array."
"We supplemented these data by observations from the
ALMA programme #2016.1.00776.S (PI: Cooray). These
were taken in two array configurations: C43-2 with forty-
seven 12-m antennas (2018 October 19) and C43-6 with fifty-
one 12-m antennas (2016 October 1 and 14). The baseline
length ranged between 15 and 3145 m (C43-6) and base-
lines 15 and 484 m (C43-2), pwv ranged between 0.55 and
0.80 mm. The on-source time was 47.0 min for each configu-
ration. The spectral setup consisted of four SPWs configured
with 128 15.625-MHz-wide channels (2.0 GHZ bandwidth
per SPW), with central frequencies of 664.95, 666.64, 668.34
and 670.03 GHz. For the C43-6 configuration, we manually
flagged antennas DA43, DV14, DV17. This reduced the total
number of antennas to 48."
"For the imaging, we concatenate the visibilities from both
ALMA programmes to maximize the S/N; the total on-source
time is 160 min. For the C43-6 configuration, we discard all
baselines longer than 1000 kλ, as adding the long baselines
significantly reduces the surface brightness sensitivity of the
combined dataset. The resulting (u,v)-plane coverage pro-
vides sensitivity to spatial scales between 0.21 and 6.2 arc-
secs; given the arc length of 2.5 arcsec, we do not expect any
structure to be resolved out."
"We produce dirty images of the concatenated dataset us-
ing natural weighting, at the full angular resolution and us-
ing a 0.5 and 1.0-arcsec Gaussian taper. For the [C II] line,
we create several dirty-image cubes using different (u,v)-
plane tapers (no taper, 0.5 and 1.0-arcsec taper) and channel
width (∆f = 50-500 MHz, equivalent to 25-225 km s−1).
The σrms levels in the resulting images match the expected
ALMA sensitivity within 10%."

ging the channels affected by atmospheric lines. The re-

"Figures 1 presents the resulting synthesised images. We
do not find any significant (≥ 5σ) [C II] or rest-frame 160-
µm continuum emission. However, the [C II] images show
a suggestive 2-3σ emission along the main Einstein arc (see
discussion below). In addition, we obtain a tentative (2-4σ)
detection of the rest-frame 140-µm continuum from the sec-
ondary lensed source SL2S 0217.X (z = 2.29, B12)."
"The ALMA data were reduced and imaged using the Com-
mon Astronomy Software Applications package (CASA, Mc-
Mullin et al. 2007), versions 5.1 and 5.4."
2.3. PdBI Band 1 observations and imaging
"In addition to the ALMA observations of the [C II] 158-
µm line, we target the CO(2–1) line using the Plateau de
Bure Interferometer (PdBI) with the WideX correlator (pro-
gramme X037, PI: Aravena). The PdBI data were taken be-
tween 2013 June 15 and 2013 September 14 in a total of 16
successful tracks. The total on-source time was 29.6 hours
(5-antennas equivalent); the total observing time was 40 h.
All observations were carried our in the most compact D-
configuration, with five 15-meter antennas. The baseline
length ranged between 15 and 97 m, resulting in a synthe-
sized beam FWHM = 7 arcsec; the source is thus completely
unresolved. The observations covered a frequency range of
79.6 - 83.2 GHz with a spectral resolution of 2 MHz. The
resulting rms sensitivity at the expected frequency of the
CO(2–1) line is 0.28 mJy beam−1 over 100 km s−1 band-
width. The data were reduced using the GILDAS/CLIC pack-
age (http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS)."
3. RESULTS
"3.1. [CII] line and 160-µm continuum
3.1.1. Searching for signal in the image plane"
"To convert the image-plane [C II] flux to source-plane (in-
trinsic) flux, we need to account for the gravitational lens-
ing. The magnification of the extended source depends on"
"its surface brightness distribution and the lensing geometry.
Although we could simply assume that the [C II] emission
is co-spatial with the HST continuum, resolved observations
of high-redshift galaxies have revealed kpc-scale offsets be-
tween the rest-frame UV and [C II] emission (e.g., Maiolino
et al. 2015; Carniani et al. 2017) and very extended [C II]
reservoirs (e.g., Carniani et al. 2018; Matthee et al. 2019;
Carniani et al. 2020). If [C II] is significantly offset from the
UV continuum, the [C II] might be less magnified the UV,
increasing the source-plane L[CII] upper limit."
"We consider three circular source-plane apertures centered
on the UV-continuum peak, with a radius R =1.0, 2.0 and
3.0 kpc; the latter is comparable to the largest [C II] reser-
voirs observed in (much more massive) z ∼ 6 galaxies (Car-
niani et al. 2020). We project these into the sky-plane using
the Cooray et al. (2011) lens model for the lensing galaxy. To
maximize the S/N, we consider only the part of the sky-plane
aperture corresponding to the main arc (Figure 1); as the arc
accounts for 95% of the total flux. The magnification factor
is µ = 43, 25 and 16 for the R =1, 2 and 3-kpc apertures,
respectively."
"We note that in the synthesis imaging, the area under a
dirty beam integrates to zero for large aperture sizes, un-
like for a classical point-spread function. Consequently, flux
measurements extracted from dirty images over extended ar-
eas might be biased, particularly in presence of strong posi-
tive or negative sidelobes. However, the dirty beams corre-
sponding to the Fig. 1 images are well-described by a central
Gaussian with only very small sidelobes (≤5%) within the
apertures considered here. Our flux limits should therefore
be robust."
"Figure 2 shows the spectra extracted from within these
apertures, at 100 MHz resolution, which reveal an excess flux
at 667.9 GHz. The excess signal is unlikely to be caused by
e.g. continuum contamination or phase errors. At 250 MHz
binning (110 km s−1), the excess is detected at 3.2 − 4.3σ
significance, depending on the taper and aperture used."
"No continuum signal is detected at ≥ 3σ significance; we
therefore put a conservative 3σ upper limit on the rest-frame
160-µm flux S160µm ≤ 0.23 mJy, based on the 1.0-arcsec
taper images and the R ≤ 3 kpc aperture."
"3.1.2. Searching for signal in the (u,v) plane"
"As the spatial filtering by the incomplete (u,v)-plane cov-
erage might decrease the sensitivity to extended emission in
the synthesized images, we try to confirm our tentative de-
tection of the [C II] line in the (u,v)-plane. How bright can
the [C II] emission be to be still consistent with the observed
visibilities?"
"We use the following approach by adapting the (u,v)-
plane lens-modelling technique from Rybak et al. (2015);
Rybak (2017). First, we extract the visibility data (real and"

[C II] flux for a 250 MHz bandwidth (see Fig 1), assuming differ-
ent surface brightness distributions and compared to the sky-plane
limit (21 mJy). Colored dashed lines indicate sky-flux PDFs for a
“line-free” part of the data (i.e., where no signal is expected). Al-
though the [C II] PDF peaks around 15 mJy for R ≤ 2, 3 kpc aper-
tures, this solution is not strongly preferred over the null hypothesis
(S[CII] = 0 mJy) and is below the sky-plane limit. This result does
not depend on the noise model used. We therefore adopt an upper
limit on S[CII]=21 mJy based on image-plane analysis."
"peaks near S[CII] = 0 mJy (dashed lines) for all apertures.
Tweaking the noise calculation (e.g., by combining the po-
larizations, calculating the rms over several scans) does not
substantially change the PDFs. This might be indicative of
an extended [C II] emission in SL2S 0217. However, the
S[CII] = 15 mJy solution is not strongly preferred over the
S[CII] = 0 mJy, our null hypothesis."
"Consequently, we adopt a [C II] upper limit of S[CII] ≤
21 mJy over 250 MHz (110 km s−1) bandwidth, measured
for the 1.0-arcsec uv-taper and R ≤ 3 kpc source-plane
aperture (3.2σ significance). The 1.0-arcsec taper maxi-
mizes the surface-brightness sensitivity, while large aperture
size accounts for a potentially very extended [C II] emis-
sion. This line flux corresponds to a sky-plane luminosity
of L[CII] ≤ 3.4×108 L�; after de-lensing (µ = 16), we set a
source-plane upper limit of L[CII] ≤ 2.1× 107 L�. The line
width adopted here is comparable to the typical line FWHM
of ∼ 120 km−1 of z ∼ 2 EELGs (Maseda et al. 2014)."

4. DISCUSSION
4.1. Photoionization modelling
"With an ionization energy of 11.3 eV, the [C II] 158-µm
emission2 can arise from all ISM phases: molecular (H2),
neutral (H), and ionized (H+). Although studies of nearby
galaxies have shown that at Z ≤ 0.25 Z� almost all [C II]
emission arises from the neutral ISM (Croxall et al. 2017;
Sutter et al. 2019), the large ionizing flux and limited self-
shielding due to low metallicity in SL2S 0217 might cause
the ionized component to dominate its L[CII] (Ferrara et al.
2019). In SL2S 0217, the semi-forbidden C II]2325Å emis-
sion line and the C II absorption line detected in the Keck
spectra (B18) confirm the presence of at least some C+ in
the ionized ISM. But can the ionized gas account for the en-
tire [C II] 158-µm emission?"
"We address this question by using photoionization mod-
elling to predict the [C II] 158-µm emission from the ionized
ISM using the MAPPINGS V photoionization code (Allen
et al. 2008; Groves & Allen 2010). We focus on the
[C II] 158µm far-IR line and the rest-frame UV C II] 2325Å
line and the C III] 1909Å doublet3. The photoionization
modelling provides a lower limit on L[CII], as the contri-
bution of [C II] 158 µm from photon-dominated regions
(PDRs) (e.g., Hollenbach & Tielens 1997) is not included
in the MAPPINGS models. Due to the lack of constraints
on the PDR phase (just our [C II] 158-µm and a very weak
CO(2–1) upper limits, we refrain from modelling the neu-
tral/molecular ISM."
"2 In this section, we explicitly state the wavelengths of individual emission
lines for clarity."
"3 Here, we treat the ISM as uniform. However, as shown by E19, the UV
spectral slope varies considerably across the source; the C II], [C II] and
C III] lines are thus likely not co-spatial on sub-kiloparsec scales., which
are all predicted by MAPPINGS V"
[CII] EMISSION IN SL2S 0217 7
"The semi-forbidden C III] 1909Å doublet originates in the
H II regions (e.g., Jaskot & Ravindranath 2016; Kewley et al.
2019; Vallini et al. 2020), and - thanks to its brightness - is a
convenient tracer of ionized gas in the EoR (Stark et al. 2015,
2017; Zitrin et al. 2015); the C II] 2325Å line traces the outer
layers of H II regions, which also emit the [C II] 158 µm
line. Based on our upper limits and B18 spectroscopy, the
observed ratios are [C II] 158 µm / C II] 2325Å≤ 4.7, [C II]
158 µm / C III] 1909Å ≤ 0.8 and C III] 1909Å / C II] 2325Å
= 6.2±0.5 (in W m−2 units). Using C II] instead of any of the
other UV lines detected in the Keck spectrum by B18 avoids
systematic uncertainties related to the carbon abundance and
ionization state."
"To set the ionizing radiation field, we use the STAR-
BURST99 stellar population models4 (Leitherer et al. 1999,
2010), including also the effects of stellar rotation on the
emitted spectra of massive stars, as described in Levesque
et al. (2012)."
"Following the B18 modelling of the UV spectrum, we set
the model metallicity to 0.05Z� and assume an instanta-
neous starburst. We explore models with electron densi-
ties between ne=10 and 100 cm−3, since the C II] 2325Å/
[C II] 158µm flux ratio is very sensitive to density due to
the low critical density of the [CII] 158µm line in ionised gas
(ne=50 cm3). We vary the ionization parameterU (defined as
the ratio of the≥ 13.6 eV photon number density and the gas
density n) and the age of the ionizing star cluster (in steps of
0.5 Myr). We adopt a one-dimensional plane-parallel geom-
etry as appropriate for the expected geometry in SL2S 0217:
a screen of ionized ISM on front of an ionizing cluster. Fig-
ure 5 shows the predicted [C II] 158 µm / C II] 2325Å and
C III] 1909Å / C II] 2325Å ratios for each realization."
"The C III] 1909Å/C II] 2325 Å ratio depends both on the
ionisation parameter (impacting both the gas temperature and
ionization state) and the age of the starburst (affecting the rel-
ative number of C+ ionizing photons, >24.4 eV, to C0 ioniz-
ing photons, >11.3 eV). See Jaskot & Ravindranath (2016);
Kewley et al. (2019) for other examples, and the color axes
in Fig. 5."
"As the [C II] 158 µm and C II] 2325 Å lines arise only
from a single species and ionisation state, their ratio is purely
dependent upon the electron density and temperature, which
drive the relative collisional rates. Because of the low critical
density for [C II] 158 µm (ne ' 50 cm−3) and high excita-
tion energy of the C II] 2325 Å line, the [C II] 158 µm / C II]
2325 Å ratio depends strongly on both electron density and
temperature."
"4 For the case considered here, the predicted line intensities differ only
marginally (≤ 0.1 dex) between the different stellar model libraries. See
D’Agostino et al. 2019 for a detailed comparison."
"We find that, for ne = 100 cm−3 (the value assumed by
B18), MAPPINGS predicts log(Lion"

158µm line luminosity Lion"
"[CII]158µm

"This estimate is approximately 5× lower than our
[C II] 158 µm upper limit (Lsky"
"[CII]158µm
≤ 3.4 × 108 L�)"
"although the lack of ne constraints implies a ∼1 dex uncer-
tainty in the predicted flux ratio."
"For most of the ne, U models considered here, our [C II]
158 µm upper limit is higher than the contribution from the
ionized ISM; the neutral/molecular ISM can account for up
to 80% of the [C II] 158 µm line flux, similar to the z = 0
low-metallicity galaxies (Croxall et al. 2017; Cormier et al.
2019). However, in the low-density, high-ionization regime
(ne = 10 cm−3, log U ≥ −3.5), the predicted [C II] 158-µm
luminosity exceeds our upper limits. In such case, the ISM
in SL2S 0217 will be fully ionized."
4.2. Comparison with empirical models and simulations
"We now compare SL2S 0217 to predictions for [C II] lu-
minosity from various empirical models and hydrodynamical
simulations. Thanks to the stream of high-redshift [C II] de-
tections from ALMA (Hodge & da Cunha 2020), the [C II]
emission from high-redshift galaxies has been extensively
studied by a number of high-resolution hydrodynamical sim-
ulations. Our tentative [C II] detection in a Z = 0.05 Z�
dwarf allows us to validate these models in the poorly ex-
plored high-SFR, low-metallicity regime."
"Namely, we consider the following [C II]-SFR relations:
the empirical De Looze et al. (2014) relation for nearby low-
metallicity dwarf galaxies, the Herrera-Camus et al. (2015)
calibration for nearby star-forming galaxies, as well as pre-
dictions from simulations of Vallini et al. (2015); Olsen et al.
(2017) and Lagache et al. (2018). Table 3 lists the re-
spective [C II]-SFR relations and the predicted source-plane
[C II]/SFR ratio for SL2S 0217. Figures 6 and 7 compare
the L[CII] and L[CII]/SFR in SL2S 0217 with relations from
Table 3, and low- and high-redshift observations (see below)
as a function of SFR and metallicity."
"Our upper limit is in agreement with the metallicity-
dependent relations of Vallini et al. (2015) and Olsen et al.
(2017). On the other hand, the [C II] emission in SL2S 0217
is at least 30× fainter than expected from the locally-
calibrated De Looze et al. (2014), a ≥4σ tension. The
Herrera-Camus et al. (2015) relation predicts even higher
L[CII]/SFR with a smaller scatter (∼ 0.2 dex); this is likely"
8 RYBAK ET AL.
"Figure 5. MAPPINGS modelling of C+/C2+ emission lines from the
ionized ISM as a function of the starburst age (upper) and the ion-
ization parameter U (lower). We show the ratios of [C II] 158µm,
C II] 2325Å and C III] 1909Å luminosities for an instantaneous
star-formation burst, Z = 0.05 Z�, ne =10 and 100 cm−3. The
grey lines connect models with constant U and increasing age. The
shaded area is excluded by the [C II] 158 µm / C III] 1909Å ra-
tio. The upper limit on L[CII] is consistent with a young (<5 Myr)
starburst over a wide range U and allows for a substantial [C II]
emission from the neutral ISM."
"a consequence of a relatively high metallicity of their sample
(12 + log(O/H)=7.7-8.8)."
"Finally, Lagache et al. (2018) underpredict the SL2S 0217
[C II] luminosity by a factor of 20; however, given the 0.5 dex
1σ scatter of the Lagache et al. (2018) trend, our upper limit
is still consistent with it at 2.5σ level. We note that the La-
gache et al. (2018) simulations contain a significant number
of galaxies with SFR, metallicity and L[CII] consistent with
SL2S 0217."
"The strong dependence of the L[CII]/SFR ratio on average
gas metallicity is supported by the high-resolution simula-
tions of high-z dwarf galaxies by Lupi & Bovino (2020): for
Z ≤ 0.1 Z�, they find L[CII]/SFR≤ 106 L�/(M� yr−1),
consistent with our upper limit."
"Finally, we consider the analytical model of Ferrara et al.
(2019), who investigated low [C II] luminosities of some of
the high-z UV-selected sources. In the low-metallicity, high-
ΣSFR regime of SL2S 0217, the [C II] surface density Σ[CII]
is given by:"
"Σ[CII] = 1.8× 107
(
ngas
n500"
")
, (2)"
"where n500 = 500 cm−3. For SL2S 0217, with an ion-
ization parameter logU = −1.5 (B18) and assuming that
[C II] is co-spatial with the UV continuum, Eq. (2) matches
our Σ[CII] upper limit for ngas ' 150 cm−3 (ngas decreases
further if [C II] is more extended than the UV continuum).
As the Ferrara et al. model directly sets U ∝ ΣSFR/Σ2gas,
to reconcile the high U and 〈ΣSFR〉, SL2S 0217 has to be
an extreme starburst, with a gas surface density Σgas '
3.5 × 108 M� kpc−2. This roughly agrees with the ex-
pectation from the E19 gas column density estimate NHI '
1021.7 cm−3, which predicts Σgas = NHI × mproton '
8× 107 M� kpc−2."
4.3. Comparison with low-metallicity galaxies near and far
"In the present-day Universe, SL2S 0217 can be directly
compared to galaxies from the Dwarf Galaxy Survey (DGS)
(Madden et al. 2013), which span Z = 0.02 - 1.0 Z� and SFR
= 0.0005 - 25 M� yr−1; 48 galaxies from the DGS sam-
ple were targeted with Herschel PACS far-IR spectroscopy
by Cormier et al. (2015). Although the DGS sample shows
a broad [C II]/SFR correlation, the [C II]/SFR ratio varies
between 105.0 and 109.5 L�/(M�yr−1) (Figure 6). Four
DGS sources have [C II]/SFR ratios similar or lower than
SL2S 0217. In particular, SBS 0335-052 - which matches
SL2S 0217 in terms of the rest-frame UV line ratios and the
overall SED (E18) - has [C II]/SFR ' 5.5 × 105 L�/(M�
yr−1), directly comparable to our upper limits."
"At z = 1 − 2, the bulk of [C II] and CO molecular
gas studies have focused on relatively massive galaxies with
M? ≥ 1010 M� (e.g., Stacey et al. 2010; Brisbin et al.
2015; Zanella et al. 2018). The only exception is the strongly
lensed M? ' 2.5 × 109M� galaxy detected in [C II] and
CO(3–2) by Schaerer et al. (2015); however, it is still ∼ 10×
more massive and metal-enriched than SL2S 0217. The
[C II]/SFR ratio measured by Schaerer et al. (2015) is 107 L�
/ (M� yr−1), 1 dex higher than in SL2S 0217."
"At z ≥ 6, two z = 6 − 7 EELGs lensed by galaxy clus-
ters have been detected in the [C II] emission by Knudsen
et al. (2016, who also obtained a strong upper limit on an-
other source) and Bradač et al. (2017). Similar to SL2S 0217,
all three sources have [C II]/SFR ≤ 3 × 106, significantly
lower that the locally-calibrated De Looze et al. (2014) re-
lation (Figure 6). While the Knudsen et al. (2016) [C II]-
detected source has a relatively low SFR and high stellar"

served the [C II] line in 189 z = 4 − 6 galaxies with SFR =

4.4. The fate of molecular gas in SL2S 0217
"Given the upper limits on the [C II] and CO(2–1) lumi-
nosity, what can we say about the state of the molecular gas
in SL2S 0217? Does SL2S 0217 still contain a substantial
molecular gas reservoir, or is it at the very end of its starburst
phase, with the ISM depleted and ionized? We briefly dis-
cuss three facets of this problem: i) limits on the molecular
gas mass, ii) the possibility of the ISM being fully ionized
and iii) photoevaporation of molecular gas."
"First, adopting the conservative magnification factor µ =
16, the CO(2–1) upper limit translates to a (very weak) 3σ
upper limit MH2 ≤ 2 × 109 M�, where we assume r2/1 =
0.6 (Cormier et al. 2014) and a Galactic αCO = 4.4M�/(K
km s−1 pc2). However, studies of nearby low-metallicity
dwarfs (e.g., Schruba et al. 2012; Hunt et al. 2015; Shi et al.
2016) found αCO up to 3 dex higher than the Galactic value,
significantly weakening our Mgas upper limit."
"Figure 8. Upper limits on the [C II]/SFR ratio in SL2S 0217 ver-

emitters and the z = 4.4 − 5.9 ALPINE survey Schaerer et al.
(2020). SL2S 0217 is a factor of 3 below the empirical relation
of Harikane et al. (2020)."
"Alternatively, we can estimate the molecular gas mass
MH2 from the [C II] luminosity, as originally proposed by
Zanella et al. (2018). Due to the very low metallicity of
SL2S 0217, rather than using the Zanella et al. (2018) re-
lation (see below), we use the recently-published relation of
Madden et al. (2020) calibrated on the DGS sample:"
"M
[CII]
H2"
"(M20) = 132× L0.97[CII], (3)"
". which for SL2S 0217 yields MH2 ≤ 2.1× 109 M�. Alter-
natively, using the Zanella et al. (2018) relation calibrated on
more massive main-sequence galaxies:"
"M
[CII]
H2"
"(Z18) = 30× L[CII], (4)"
"we obtain MH2 ≤ 0.8× 109 M�; although the extrapolation
of the Zanella et al. (2018) relation to the low-Z regime might
not be straightforward. BothMgas estimates imply a high gas
mass fraction fgas = Mgas/(Mgas+M?) ' 0.8. This is con-
sistent with high gas fractions and dynamical mass estimates
for z = 1 − 2 EELGs (Maseda et al. 2014) and simulations
of high-redshift dwarf galaxies (Ceverino et al. 2018)."
"A gas mass of ∼ 108 M� is also supported by the expec-
tations from the Ferrara et al. (2019) model and the column-
density estimates from E19 (see § 4.2)."
"A gas mass of 108 M� is further supported by the high
ΣSFR/U ratio in SL2S 0217 (see § 4.2). With SFR=23 M�
yr−1, SL2S 0217 will deplete its gas in ∼10 Myr (likely
much faster, as some gas might be expelled from the sys-
tem). This suggests that SL2S 0217 is in a final stage of an
intense starburst."
[CII] EMISSION IN SL2S 0217 11
"Second, as indicated in § 4.1, a substantial fraction of the
gas reservoir might be ionized. Namely, the maximum col-
umn density proposed by E19 (ΣHI ≤ 1021.7 cm−2) is com-
parable to the ionized gas column depth of ∼ 1021.3 cm−2
predicted by Ferrara et al. (2019) for SL2S 0217-like ion-
ization parameter and metallicity. The fraction of the ion-
ized gas might be further increased due to additional ionizing
sources. In particular, the unusually strong He II emission in
SL2S 0217 cannot be reproduced by standard photoioniza-
tion models (B18) and requires additional ionization source,
such as radiative shocks (Allen et al. 2008; Plat et al. 2019)
or high-mass X-ray binaries as seen in, e.g., a nearby dwarf
I Zw 18 (Lebouteiller et al. 2017; Schaerer et al. 2019, but
c.f. Plat et al. 2019). This extra ionization would increase
the contribution of the ionized ISM to the [C II] luminosity
compared to our photoionization models; on the other hand,
strong FUV fields might suppress the [C II] emission by ion-
izing C+ into C2+ (e.g., Langer & Pineda 2015)."
"Third, the combination of the strong FUV fields and the
lack of ISM self-shielding at low metallicities can lead to
a rapid ionization and photoevaporation of the molecular
clouds on 1-10 Myr timescales, thus further suppressing the
[C II] emission (Vallini et al. 2017)."
"We note that in the very near future, the warm neutral or
molecular gas might be traced at mid-infrared wavelengths
via the PAHs or rotational-vibrational H2 emission using the
James Webb Space Telescope. Alternatively, the gas mass in
SL2S 0217 can be constrained kinematically (e.g., Calistro
Rivera et al. 2018), using the integrated-field spectroscopy of
the bright C III] 1909Å line (Maseda et al., in prep.)."
"4.5. Detectability of [CII] emission from metal-poor dwarfs
at z ≥ 6"
"What are the prospects of detecting the [C II] 158-µm
emission in SL2S 0217 if it was at z ∼ 6? Assuming
L[CII] = 2.6 × 107 L�, achieving a spatially unresolved
5σ detection at z = 6 would require σrms ∼ 50 µJy over
100 km s−1 bandwidth, which corresponds to ∼10 hours of
ALMA on-source time. For comparison, the deepest ALMA
Band 6 observations to-date, delivered by the ASPECS (Wal-
ter et al. 2016; González-López et al. 2020) and ALMACAL
(Oteo et al. 2016) projects and the Fujimoto et al. (2016)
compilation, reach sensitivities of σrms ∼ 100 µJy over the
same bandwidth."
"Another promising way of studying the population of
galaxies at high redshift is the line-intensity mapping (e.g.
Gong et al. 2012; Silva et al. 2015). The feasibility of the
[C II]-intensity mapping measurements depends critically on
the [C II] luminosity function at z ≥ 6. A recent [C II]-
intensity mapping feasibility study of Yue & Ferrara (2019)
considered several [C II] luminosity function models. The
detectability of the [C II] power spectrum is the highest for"
"the De Looze et al. (2014) dwarf-galaxies relation, and low-
est for the Vallini et al. (2015) relation; the predictions for
the expected power-spectrum and shot-noise signal from the
two models differ by a factor of ∼30. Consequently, if the
low [C II]/SFR ratio in SL2S 0217 can be taken to validate
the Vallini et al. (2015) and Olsen et al. (2017) [C II] lumi-
nosity models, the z ≥ 6 [C II] intensity mapping signal will
fall below the detection threshold of the potential ALMA or
single-dish intensity-mapping experiments (e.g., a 1000-hour
programme on the CCAT-p telescope, Stacey et al. 2018).
Our analysis highlights the need to properly account for the
metallicity evolution of galaxies and its impact on the [C II]
emission."
5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
"We have presented deep ALMA and PdBI observations of
the [C II] 158-µm and CO(2–1) emission in the z = 1.844
strongly lensed metal-poor dwarf galaxy SL2S 0217. In one
of the deepest ALMA Band 9 observations to-date, we obtain
a tentative 3-4σ detection of the [C II] line. No CO(2–1)
emission is detected in the PdBI observations."
Our main conclusions are:
"• We report a tentative (3-4σ) detection of the [C II]
line based on the image-plane spectra; the source-
plane luminosity is L[CII] ≤ 2.1 × 107 L�, derived
from 1.0-arcsec taper imaging, R ≤3 kpc aperture and
a 250 MHz bandwidth. We do not find strong evi-
dence for [C II] emission in the (u,v)-plane. The rest-
frame 160-µm continuum and the CO(2–1) line are not
detected. Our tentative [C II] detection extends the
molecular gas studies at z ∼ 2 by 1 dex in stellar mass,
down to the M? ' 108 M� regime."
"• The upper limit on the L[CII]/SFR ratio in SL2S 0217
is 2×106 L�/(M� yr−1), within the range spanned by
nearby dwarf galaxies (Cormier et al. 2015), as well as
z ≥ 5 lensed dwarf EELGs and Lyα emitters."
"• The [C II]/ SFR ratio in SL2S 0217 is consistent
with the Vallini et al. (2015) and Olsen et al. (2017)
simulations-based models. However, the [C II]/SFR
ratio in SL2S 0217 is 30× lower than predicted by the
locally-calibrated De Looze et al. (2014) relation."
"• We use MAPPINGS photoionization modelling to pre-
dict the fraction of [C II] emission arising in the ion-
ized ISM. We find that our upper limit leaves room for
a significant (up to 80%) contribution from the PDRs;
however, we can not exclude that the ISM is fully ion-
ized, particularly for low electron density. The con-
tribution from the ionized ISM might be boosted due
to extra ionizing radiation from e.g., shocks or X-ray
binaries. Future ALMA and JWST observations of"
12 RYBAK ET AL.
"PDR tracers will allow us to directly probe the neu-
tral/molecular ISM."
"• The tentative [C II] detection and the high ΣSFR
and ionization parameter suggest a gas mass of few
108 M�. In this scenario, SL2S 0217 will be in a late
phase of an extreme starburst and deplete its gas reser-
voir in <10 Myr. More robust constraints on the gas
mass might be obtained from spatially-resolved spec-
troscopic observations of the bright rest-frame FUV
lines."
"• If SL2S 0217 is representative of the z ≥ 6 low-
mass galaxies, these will be within reach of deep-
field ALMA observations (even without gravitational
lensing). On the other hand, a strong dependence of
[C II]/SFR ratio on metallicity might strongly suppress
the [C II] signal in line-intensity mapping experiments."
"The large discrepancy between the [C II]/SFR ratio in
SL2S 0217 and the widely-used De Looze et al. (2014) rela-
tion for present-day dwarf galaxies highlights the limitations
of applying locally established relations to high redshift. At
the same time, the good agreement between our tentative
[C II] detection, high-redshift observations, and simulations
confirms that - though challenging to study - SL2S 0217 re-
mains a powerful analogue of the sources from the Epoch of
Reionization."
