Abstract
"Solar flares convert magnetic energy into thermal and non-thermal plasma energy, the latter"
implying particle acceleration of charged particles such as protons. Protons are injected out of
"the coronal acceleration region and can interact with dense plasma in the lower solar atmosphere,"
producing mesons that subsequently decay into gamma rays and neutrinos at O(MeV-GeV) en-
ergies. We present the results of the first search for GeV neutrinos emitted during solar flares
carried out with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. While the experiment was originally designed
"to detect neutrinos with energies between 10 GeV and a few PeV, a new approach allowing for a"
O(GeV) energy threshold will be presented. The resulting limits allow us to constrain some of the
theoretical estimates of the expected neutrino flux.
I. INTRODUCTION
While multi-messenger astronomy has recently recorded major breakthroughs such as the
first joint observations of high-energy neutrinos and electromagnetic radiation from a single
"source [1], the interior and exterior of the Sun have been detected through several messengers"
for decades. Both the quiescent and the active phases of the corona are studied through
"the electromagnetic radiation emitted across the entire spectrum. However, in the neutrino"
"search presented in this paper, we only focus on the gamma rays produced by high-energy"
protons that are accelerated in solar flares and subsequently collide with dense layers of the
"solar atmosphere. These gamma rays can be detected, e.g. by the Fermi-LAT satellite [2, 3],"
which significantly increased the fraction of solar flares detected in the high-energy range.
"So far, solar neutrinos have only been detected in the MeV range being produced by"
fusion reactions in the core of the Sun. Large neutrino telescopes have recently started to
"search for solar atmospheric neutrinos [4], which are created by the collisions of high-energy"
cosmic rays colliding with the solar atmosphere [5–8]. While only upper limits have been
"established so far, the observation of this flux would allow us to probe solar magnetic field"
topology and would constitute a neutrino floor for dark matter searches in the core of the

Sun. The same high-energy cosmic-ray collisions with the solar atmosphere create a muon
shadow (deficit) in the Sun’s direction. As a fraction of the cosmic rays are absorbed in
"the solar atmosphere or deflected by the solar magnetic field, the flux reaching the Earth"
atmosphere is reduced and so is the subsequent secondary atmospheric muon flux detected
by IceCube [9]. The variations in the shadow can be used to constrain the solar coronal
magnetic field [10].
"In addition to the aforementioned emissions that are expected to be continuous in time,"
transient neutrino emissions could be produced by solar flares. Despite several searches since
"the late eighties [11–14], no significant neutrino signal from solar flares has been confirmed to"
date. The main interest in searching for solar flare neutrinos comes from their hadronic ori-
"gin: being inherent products of high-energy proton collisions in the chromosphere, neutrinos"
represent a direct probe of the proton acceleration. Theoretical investigation [15–17] have
demonstrated that this neutrino flux could extend from MeV up to a few GeV in energy.
Focusing on the high-energy component of the solar flare neutrino spectrum would allow us
to probe the proton acceleration up to the highest energies that can be reached within the
solar flare environment.
This paper describes first the scientific motivation for and the associated production
mechanism of the GeV neutrinos in solar flares. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory used
for this search was built to detect neutrinos with energies larger than 10 GeV. A new analysis
approach developed for this study allows for the measurement of neutrinos at the single GeV
"energy scale. In Section III, we present the scheme of how we select a special class of solar"
flares for this study based on the tight link existing between gamma rays and neutrinos. The
IceCube Neutrino Observatory used for this neutrino search is described in Section IV and
"the event selection we have developed is presented in detail in Section V. Finally, the first"
"results of a solar flare neutrino search carried out with IceCube are presented in Section VI,"
along with perspectives for the next solar cycle.
II. THE POTENTIAL PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS BROUGHT BY NEUTRINOS
Solar flares convert magnetic energy into plasma heating and kinetic energy of charged
"particles such as protons [18]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, protons are ejected away from the"
"coronal acceleration region and interact with the dense plasma in the lower solar atmosphere,"

reconnection and the two arrows show the direction of the subsequent outflow jets.

π− −→ µ− + ν̄µ; µ− −→ e− + ν̄e + νµ.
"Here, the kinetic energy threshold for this process is 280 MeV for both proton-proton and"
proton-neutron interactions.
"For the interpretation of our result, we assume that the accelerated proton flux can be"
"modeled by the functional form dφ/dE = AE−δH(Emax − E), where A is a normaliza-"
"tion constant, δ represents the spectral index, and Emax is the upper cutoff in a Heaviside"
"function, as motivated in [19]."
The proton spectral index has been extracted fitting gamma-ray observations by Fermi-

proton spectrum with a spectral index δ = 3. The distributions have been obtained using a
GEANT4-based simulation of proton-proton interactions in the chromosphere.
LAT and assuming a pion decay model for different phases of the solar flare. The data were
provided by the Fermi-LAT Collaboration based on an analysis similar to the one carried out
"in [20]. So far, there are no constraints on the value of the upper cutoff. The effect of this"
"upper cutoff on the subsequent neutrino flux is illustrated in Fig. 2, where the colored points"
show the average neutrino yield per injected proton when assuming an initial proton flux
following a power law with a spectral index δ = 3 and realistic values of Emax in the (3−10)
GeV region. This result is obtained using a GEANT4-based simulation of high-energy proton
collisions with the solar atmosphere. The accelerated protons were injected in a direction
tangent to the photosphere as it leads to a better agreement with gamma-ray observations
by Fermi-LAT. Most of the neutrinos are produced in the Chromosphere at densities around
10−7 - 10−8 g cm−3 in our simulation. More details about the simulation can be found in
"[16]. As it can be seen in Fig 2, a higher cutoff value leads to a higher neutrino yield in the"
GeV energy range and would thus lead to a larger signal in sensitive neutrino telescopes.
Coupling Fermi-LAT and IceCube observations has therefore the potential to constrain both
this upper cutoff and the spectral index by measuring the strength of the detected neutrino
signal in IceCube and the fitted spectral index of the gamma ray spectrum.
III. SELECTION OF SOLAR FLARES
"Following Eq. (1), one finds that pion production generates both neutrino and gamma-"
ray emissions. We focus only on solar flares that must emit neutrinos at some level and use
the gamma-ray observations to pick the most relevant candidates for our neutrino search.
These are indications that pion-decay products dominate the gamma-ray spectrum above
"100 MeV [22], an energy that Fermi-LAT has the ability to detect. A spectral analysis"
confirms that the major contribution of the Fermi-LAT observations was indeed consistent
with pion decay emissions [23].
We assume that the neutrino emission is coincident in time with significant pion decay
signals detected in Fermi-LAT during solar flares. This leads to a significant difference
"to previous solar flare samples [13, 14] that were based on the X-ray flux. For example,"
"Fermi-LAT only detects 5% of the M- and X-solar flares, i.e. solar flares with a X-ray"
"brightness in the wavelength range between 1 and 8 Ångströms above 10−5 and 10−4 W/m2,"
"respectively, detected by the Geo-Stationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)"
on average 1 [24].
The light curve recorded by X-ray devices and by Fermi-LAT usually shows a short high-
intensity peak on top of a lower baseline flux with an underlying period [22]. An example of
such a flare is shown in Fig. 3. The peak is referred to as the impulsive phase. The analysis
of the gamma rays detected during these impulsive short phases reveals a relatively hard
"initial proton spectrum, with a spectral index around 3 [20]. In contrast, the long duration"
emissions manifest themselves in a softer proton spectral index (typically between 4 and 6)
and a spread of the gamma-ray emission over several hours. Focusing on the impulsive phase
of bright events of the 24th solar cycle allows one to minimize the background integrated in
the neutrino telescope and to thus increase the chance of a neutrino detection in coincidence
with solar flares.
These criteria applied to the first Fermi-LAT Solar flare catalog [3] resulted in a list of
5 promising candidates for our neutrino search. The details of each analyzed solar flare are
reported in Table I. The choice of the time window and duration of each solar flare was made
in view of maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio in IceCube. We started from the maximum
1 This number has been obtained by counting the number of solar flares detected by Fermi-LAT between
2011 and 2015 and the number of M and X-class flares. The field of view of Fermi-LAT allows for
solar observations during 20% to 60% of the time [21] and cannot explain by itself this small fraction of
observations. 11

45% of the observation time window reported by Fermi-LAT. The observed fraction of the
other solar flare events considered in this work are reported in Table I.
IV. THE ICECUBE NEUTRINO OBSERVATORY AND THE SEARCH FOR GEV
NEUTRINOS
The IceCube Neutrino Observatory consists of a cubic kilometer of instrumented ice
"located at the South Pole, 2 km below the surface [25]. Completed in December 2010, the"
"detector is made of 86 vertical strings, with 60 digital optical modules, or DOMs, each. The"
strings have an average horizontal spacing of 125 m while the DOMs are located every 17 m
"along the instrumented portion of the string. A sub-detector, named DeepCore, is installed"
at the center of the array as shown in Fig. 4. Characterized by smaller spacings between
"strings (≈ 70 m) and DOMs (≈ 7 m), DeepCore offers a lower energy threshold for neutrino"
"detection, down to 10 GeV [26]. No DOMs were deployed between depths of 2000 m to"
2100 m where the optical scattering and absorption are significantly increased due to a dust
layer [27]. More details about the DOMs used as detection units can be found in [25] and
references therein.
"In order to reduce the noise rate, trigger conditions based on coincidences are applied."
"FIG. 3: Gamma-ray light curve of a solar flare recorded above 100 MeV on Sept 10th, 2017"
by Fermi-LAT (main plot) and selected time window for the neutrino search (orange points
in the inset). The dashed line distinguishes the impulsive phase from the long duration
emission. The data points are kindly provided by the Fermi-LAT Collaboration.
FIG. 4: Schematic view of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory with the IceTop surface
array and the DeepCore subdetector.
Different coincidence criteria classify the signal detected in IceCube [28]: Hard Local Co-
"incidence (HLC), when two neighbor or next-to-neighbor DOMs on the same string record"
a signal above threshold within a 1 µs time window; and Soft Local Coincidence when the
hit does not qualify for the HLC criteria. The main trigger for IceCube events is the Simple
"Majority Trigger, or SMT-8, which requires at least 8 DOMs with HLC pulses within a 5 µs"
"time window. A softer trigger condition, SMT-3, has been implemented for DeepCore events"
"in order to lower the energy threshold. It requires, in analogy to its counterpart in the full"
"IceCube array, 3 DOMs with HLC pulses within 2.5 µs. Considering the low energy expected"
"for solar flare neutrinos, we focus on events that have fulfilled the SMT-3 condition."
A parallel data stream allows IceCube to be sensitive to Galactic core-collapse super-
novae [29]. Individual neutrino interactions in the MeV range produce a signal too dim
"to identify individual events, but the large flux emitted during a close-by supernova would"
"lead to a detectable coherent rise in the individual hit rates of the DOMs. In this paper,"
we apply the principle used for MeV core collapse supernova neutrinos to the GeV energy
range in order to search for neutrinos from solar flares. This is explained in more detail in
the next section.
V. OPTIMIZED SEARCH FOR GEV NEUTRINO INTERACTIONS
"Before this analysis was developed, neutrino searches in IceCube were possible in the MeV"
range by the use of the Supernova Data Acquisition system and starting at around 10 GeV
for neutrino oscillation studies in DeepCore [25]. We introduce a novel selection procedure
that enables us to cover part of the gap between these two energy ranges. The general idea
of the analysis is to monitor the rate of GeV-like events in IceCube and to search for an
"increase in this rate during an astrophysical transient, as for example a solar flare. While"
"the principle is similar to the one in use for MeV supernova neutrino searches, the neutrino"
flux produced by solar flares is expected to be several orders of magnitude below the one
of Galactic core-collapse supernovae. The Supernova Data Acquisition system could not be
used for our purpose; we focus on events that have triggered the data taking in IceCube.
The new event selection has been developed in a data-driven way following a blind pro-
cedure. We have used several hours of IceCube data recorded when no solar flare had been

detected on either side of the solar disk. In order to determine the time period when such
"data were available, we compared the observations by the X-ray instrument GOES [24] and"
"Fermi-LAT [2], which is sensitive to gamma rays. We have also used the observations of the"
"STEREO-A and STEREO-B satellites that observe the hidden side of the Sun and detect,"
"among others, energetic particles arising from the Sun [30]. In addition to these off-time"
"data, we have simulated various classes of events to understand the behavior of the selection"
to different types of events present in data. We use CORSIKA [31] and GENIE [32] to
"simulate atmospheric muons and neutrinos respectively, and a noise event generator based"
on an empirical model consisting of three noise components inherent to IceCube DOMs: un-
"correlated thermal noise, uncorrelated radioactive noise, and correlated scintillation noise."
"Finally, signal-like neutrino interactions were generated with GENIE by selecting events with"
an energy between 500 MeV and 5 GeV that arrive from the observed declination range of
"the Sun at the South Pole, i.e. [-23, 23] degrees. We note that various neutrino interaction"
"processes are included in the simulation - deep inelastic scattering, quasi-elastic scattering,"
"resonant production - which all contribute substantially to the total interaction rate, as well"
as scattering that contributes only marginally.
The event selection is discussed in detail below. It can be divided into three main steps:
"removal of high-energy events from the sample, reduction of the contribution from events"
"triggered by noise, and the increase of the purity of the final sample."
A. Removing High-Energy Events
"The first step of the event selection aims at reducing the number of high-energy events,"
"in this work understood as neutrinos with an energy & 5 GeV, from the data sample be-"
cause we expect solar flares to produce neutrinos only up to a few GeV. The main difference
between an event with arbitrarily high energy and a GeV neutrino interaction is the amount
"of light emitted in the ice, as shown in Fig. 5. We use available data streams (“software"
filters”) that have been developed to tag specific kind of events such as high energy muons
"or cascades. As depicted in Fig. 5(d), our events activate a small number of DOMs and"
are thus not expected to pass any of the filters designed to tag high-energy interactions.
"To be part of our event sample, an event therefore has to pass the filter that selects events"
contained in DeepCore and fail all other filter conditions. An exception is made for two
"filters: one targeting low-energy neutrinos coming from the Northern sky, and the one that"
"uses parts of the detector as veto against incoming muon events, as both subsequent samples"
contain low-energy events [25]. This combination of filters results in a significant reduction
of the number of atmospheric muons: the event rate after applying this filter selection is
of the order of 15 Hz while the original rate was around 1400 Hz. More than 98% of the
simulated neutrino events between 500 MeV and 5 GeV pass this filter selection.
The number of HLC hits in IceCube and DeepCore strings is small for low-energy neutrino
"events, while background events from atmospheric muons and neutrinos are typically charac-"
terized by a large number of HLC hits in the detector. We can therefore impose a constraint
on the maximum number of HLC hits allowed in DeepCore and the strings outside DeepCore
to remove high-energy events from our sample. More stringent constraints on the number
of HLC hits in IceCube strings do not improve the signal over noise ratio of the selection
because of noise hits on the considered strings present in both signal and background events.
The number of hits that share a causal connection inside an event can also be used as a
parameter for the amount of light emitted in the detector as a consequence of the neutrino
interaction. We use an algorithm designed to select sets of hits most likely connected to the
same physical interaction and therefore unrelated to dark noise. The algorithm selects hits
that have at least one other hit within a sphere of radius R = 150 m and within a time
"window of ∆T = 1000 ns called Single R-T hits, or SRT hits hereafter. The constraints"
listed in Table II lower the data rate to about 5.5 Hz while keeping 98% of the simulated
signal events in the sample.
B. Minimizing the Contribution of Pure Noise
Noise triggers occur with relatively few hits and no preferred direction. Figure 5(c)
represents a typical noise event satisfying the SMT-3 trigger condition and passing the filter
selection previously described. Accidental triggers by pure noise constitute a significant
background for low-energy interactions such as the ones illustrated in Fig. 5(d). The IceCube
Collaboration has developed an algorithm able to identify and eliminate noise signals. The
algorithm searches for a preferential direction in pairs of hits to classify the event as being
"of physics origin. In practice, an event is classified as physics if it contains, during a certain"
"time window (W ), a minimum of N pairs of hits with an effective particle velocity contained"
"in a [vmin,vmax] m/ns interval pointing in excess towards a certain direction. If this is not"
"the case, the event is classified as noise."
"The default set of these four parameters ([W , N , vmin,vmax] = [500 s, 7, 0.05 m/ns,"
0.5 m/ns]) is implemented in the IceCube software and regularly used for data analyses (see
"e.g., [33]). The algorithm has a Boolean output with TRUE attributed to physics-like events"
and a likely noise event corresponds to FALSE. This optimization allows one to differentiate
noise from 10-100 GeV neutrino interactions. In order to be effective for our lower energy
"events, we have re-optimized the method. We have applied the algorithm for each possible"
set of parameters and constructed combinations of these sets that maximize the signal to
noise ratio. We request an output FALSE for sets of variables specifically targeting small
"apparent speed in a long time window (e.g., [800 s, 0 , 0.00 m/ns, 0.10 m/ns]) as these"
"parameters correspond to scattered hits. On the contrary, the sets for which a TRUE"
output is required to pass the selection lead to a sample dominated by high apparent speed
"in a short time window, i.e. unscattered hits (e.g., [100 s, 2, 0.20 m/ns, 0.90 m/ns])."
The data rate is about 0.2 Hz after applying the two combinations of parameter sets shown
"in Table II. For comparison, the noise rate is estimated to be around 0.12 Hz. More than"
55% of simulated signal events survive these cuts.
C. Increasing the Purity
"With most of the noise events removed from the sample, we continue to increase its purity."
Several selection criteria are applied:
• Charge distribution: cut on the ratio of the charge deposited in DeepCore during the
first 600 ns after the first HLC hit in DeepCore and the total charge in the event. This
cut allows one to remove remaining low-energy tracks created by atmospheric muons
"that travel across the detector. To be kept in the sample, an event is requested to"
have a charge ratio ≤ 0.26.
• Depth: cut on the depth of the first HLC hit in DeepCore. Low-energy atmospheric
muons will leave more energy in the top of the detector rather than in deeper DOMs.
The optimal depth for the selection of GeV neutrino events has been defined as [-
"2453 m, -2158 m], which corresponds to the part of DeepCore located below the dust"
layer.
• Centroid of the event : cut on the distance and the time delay between the first and
"the second HLC hits in DeepCore. Since our events are of low energy, the DOMs able"
to record the events are close to each other and the hits happen within a short time
window. We requested the distance between these two hits to be smaller than 70 m
with a time delay not more than 50 ns.

• Total charge: the total deposited charge inside the detector must be lower than 60
photoelectrons.
A summary of the cuts applied for the final selection is presented in Table II. The data
"rate, constant over time, is 20 ± 2 mHz, which can be compared with the simulated rates of"
"18 mHz for pure noise events, less than 5 mHz for atmospheric muons, 0.3 mHz and 0.8 mHz"
"for νe+ ν̄e and νµ+ν̄µ, respectively. A study of these off-time data showed that the number"
of events recorded in short time windows were consistent with a Poisson distribution.
The leading systematic uncertainties in this analysis arise from our limited understanding
of the optical properties of the surrounding ice. We studied in particular the impact of the
DOM efficiency and the scattering length in the ice directly surrounding the DOM. This is
the ice in the approximately 60 cm diameter bore hole that refroze after the DOMs were
deployed. The DOM efficiency impact study was carried out using a conservative variation
of ± 10% of the quantum efficiency of the photocathodes in the simulation of low-energy
"neutrino interactions. Two different scattering lengths (namely, 100 cm and 50 cm) were"
used in simulations to assess the corresponding effect on low-energy interaction detection.
We concluded that the uncertainty on each parameter would lead to a number of low energy
events within 20% of the nominal value. As a GeV neutrino interaction needs to happen
"close from a DOM to trigger the data taking, the uncertainties on the light absorption and"
scattering in the bulk ice will have a negligible impact compared to the two other systematic
effects previously mentioned.
The passing rate of GeV neutrino events is of the order of 40 % and shows only a small
"zenith dependence (see Fig. 6). Therefore, the event selection previously described can be"
used to search for transient events at an arbitrary position in the sky. Fig. 6 shows the
effective areas for events as function of the zenith. We highlighted the position of the solar
flares that are considered in this work by colored vertical lines.
D. Searching for a statistical fluctuation
We use the statistical test by Li and Ma [34] to quantify a possible excess of events. This
"method has been developed to estimate the significance of events in a certain time region,"
with the null-hypothesis defined as the non-existence of a signal source. Three parameters
are used and their description in the framework of our analysis is:
• Non the number of events in our final sample during the optimized solar flare time
window.
FIG. 6: Effective areas for GeV-like neutrino events (500 MeV - 5 GeV) as function of
their zenith coordinate. The colored vertical lines show the location of the solar flares
studied in this work. The white region highlights the zenith range covered by the Sun at
the South Pole.
• Noff : the number of events in our final sample during 8 hours prior to the solar flare
onset.
"• α = ton/toff, where toff is the duration of the time window considered prior to the solar"
"flare, i.e. 8 hours, and ton, the selected time window during the solar flare."
The estimate of the significance S proposed in [34] can be used under the conditions that
"the counts (Non, Noff) were obtained by a single observation, where Non and Noff are not too"
"few. If these conditions are fulfilled, S refers to the number of standard deviations of the"
"event (Non, Noff). This approach is particularly interesting when, as it is the case in this"
"analysis, there are two unknown parameters:"
"• Ns: the number of signal events, equivalent to Non - α Noff"
"• NB: the number of background events, during the time window of the search that is"
now precisely known.
VI. RESULTS AND OUTLOOK
Table III shows the number of off-source and on-source IceCube events as well as the
"corresponding significance S, calculated using Eq. 2 following the Li and Ma approach [34]"

We observe no significant signal. We can therefore derive upper limits on the potential
"number of signal events solving Ns = Non - α Noff and using Eq. 3, which links the number"
of observed events and the neutrino fluence Φ:
"∫
Aeff(E) Φ(E) dE, (3)"
where Aeff is the effective area shown in Fig. 6. The final upper limits presented in Table III
"take into account the flavor ratio at Earth after oscillations, assumed as νe : νµ : ντ = 1 :"
"1 : 1, and the effective area expected for each flavour and interaction type."
"As shown in Table I, the optimized time window for our neutrino search only contains"
a fraction of the observed gamma-ray light curve. Since this analysis assumes that the
"neutrinos are emitted jointly with the gamma rays, we assume our time windows contain"
the same fractions of the total neutrino emission. We therefore take these fractions into
account when comparing with theoretical predictions. The limits presented in Table III
constrain the integrated neutrino flux emitted during the considered time window.
We note that similar number of events and fractions of the light curves are observed for
"the events of March 7th, February 25th and September 1st (see Table III). This is reflected"
in the similar upper limits set for these events. Approximatively half of this fraction is
"contained in the short flare of September 10th, which explains the apparent lower upper"
"limit. Finally, the September 6th flare targets the long duration emission that lasted for"
"several hours, as previously mentioned. The origin of a such temporally extended emission"
"is still under investigation [3], and therefore cannot, at the moment, be compared with the"
neutrino upper limits set for the other solar flares.
The exact spectral index δν of the neutrino spectrum is not precisely known but could be
estimated to lie between 4 and 6 using a GEANT4 [35] simulation of proton-nucleus interac-
tion in a solar environment as described in [16]. The neutrino upper limits are presented as
"a function of the parameter space (δν , C), where C is the integrated neutrino flux between"
"500 MeV and 5 GeV. The upper limit obtained from the Sept 10th, 2017 event is shown"
"in Fig. 7 together with its systematic uncertainties. In Fig. 7, the obtained upper limit is"
"compared to two predictions [16, 17]. The difference between these two predictions comes"
from different assumptions on the proton flux accelerated by the solar flare: the total energy
released by the magnetic reconnection is converted into protons that subsequently produce
"pions producing neutrinos is considered in [17], while only a small fraction of the released"
"energy, consistent with the estimates based on Fermi-LAT observations, is used in [16]. To"
"put the result into context, we estimated the corresponding normalization factor if more"
energy should go to the accelerated proton flux for the latter model. The experimental up-
per limit constrains the prediction made in [17] when assuming an average neutrino energy
of 140 MeV. The still optimistic 500 MeV line is slightly below the reach of the current
"sensitivity. The second prediction [16], however, is far below the current reach of IceCube,"
even when assuming the entire energy released during the solar flare goes to protons that
subsequently produce pions. Similar results have been obtained for the other solar flares in
"Table I and are discussed in [16, 36]."
VII. OUTLOOK
"In this paper, we presented the first results from a search for neutrinos coincident with"
solar flares using IceCube. This was possible with the development of a new low-energy
selection that allows IceCube to be sensitive to <5 GeV neutrinos. We note that similar
"analyses may be carried out on other types of transient sources, such as compact binary"
"mergers, fast-radio bursts, or novae."
The limitation of this analysis is given by the current effective area of the IceCube detector
for GeV neutrinos. Besides the small cross section of GeV neutrinos with the surrounding
"matter that limits the number of interactions, each of these interactions needs to trigger the"
"detector to be recorded. As previously described, the minimal requirement to be considered"
as an event is 3 DOMs with HLC pulses within 2.5 µs.
"A future option may be to utilize the HitSpooling data, which saves every single hit oc-"
"curring in the detector, independent of trigger condition [25]. This means that sub-threshold"
"neutrino interactions, lost in regular IceCube data, can be saved and studied. Using such a"

"among others, the deployment of the IceCube Upgrade [37] within IceCube. This detector"
will demonstrate a lower detection threshold together with enhanced reconstruction capa-
bilities because of the multi-photomultiplier geometry of its sensors. We are exploring how
the analysis of the upcoming 25th solar cycle would benefit from the dense instrumentation
and the new sensors.
