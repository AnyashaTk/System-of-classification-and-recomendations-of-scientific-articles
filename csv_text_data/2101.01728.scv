ABSTRACT
"Context. Pebble accretion is an emerging paradigm for the fast growth of planetary cores. Pebble flux and pebble sizes are the key
parameters used in the pebble accretion models.
Aims. We aim to derive the pebble sizes and fluxes from state-of-the-art dust coagulation models, understand their dependence on
disk parameters and the fragmentation threshold velocity, and the impact of those on the planetary growth by pebble accretion.
Methods. We use a one dimensional dust evolution model including dust growth and fragmentation to calculate realistic pebble sizes
and mass flux. We use this information to integrate the growth of planetary embryos placed at various locations in the protoplanetary
disk.
Results. Pebble flux strongly depends on disk properties, such as its size and turbulence level, as well as on the dust aggregates
fragmentation threshold. We find that dust fragmentation may be beneficial to planetary growth in multiple ways. First of all, it
prevents the solids from growing to very large sizes, for which the efficiency of pebble accretion drops. What is more, small pebbles
are depleted at a lower rate, providing a long lasting pebble flux. As the full coagulation models are computationally expensive, we
provide a simple method of estimating pebble sizes and flux in any protoplanetary disk model without substructure and with any
fragmentation threshold velocity."

1. Introduction
"In the classical paradigm of planet formation a significant frac-
tion of solids is very quickly converted into kilometer-sized plan-
etesimals. Some of those planetesimals continue to grow rapidly
via the runaway growth (e.g., Wetherill & Stewart 1989; Ida &
Makino 1993; Kokubo & Ida 1996). However, this fast stage of
growth is soon over as the embryo starts to stir its feeding zone
and the accretion transitions to oligarchic growth stage, slowing
down with embryo mass (e.g., Kokubo & Ida 1998; Ormel et al.
2010). By the end of the oligarchic growth, the embryo absorbs
all of the material in its immediate vicinity and reaches the isola-
tion mass, which is as low as Mars mass in the terrestrial planets
region, but increases with the distance to the star (Kokubo &
Ida 2002). The isolation mass may be high enough to reproduce
the cores of giant planets but the core growth timescale in the
planetesimal-driven scenario becomes prohibitively long to al-
low for accretion of gaseous atmosphere outside of Jupiter loca-
tion (Thommes et al. 2002, 2003; Levison et al. 2010; Johansen
& Bitsch 2019)."
"These drawbacks of the classical planetesimal-driven model
motivated development of the alternative scenario called pebble
accretion. In this paradigm, the embryo is accreting centimeter-
sized pebbles rather than planetesimals. Gravity and gas drag
act together to enhance the cross section of a planetary embryo
for its encounters with pebbles and thus speed up the growth
(Ormel & Klahr 2010; Lambrechts & Johansen 2012). Because
pebbles are rapidly drifting through the protoplanetary disk, the
size of the feeding zone increases, allowing the embryos to grow"
"to larger sizes before the pebble flux is halted by planet-disk in-
teractions (Lambrechts et al. 2014)."
"In the pebble accretion scenario, the outcome of planet for-
mation is determined by the sizes and flux of the pebbles drift-
ing through the protoplanetary disk. Kretke & Levison (2014)
used large pebbles with a size distribution between 0.5 m and
5 m (corresponding to the Stokes number of 0.25 and 25) and
a constant pebble flux of 0.13 M⊕ yr−1. They found that repro-
ducing the giant planets in the Solar system is challenging as
pebble accretion tends to convert too many planetesimals into
large embryos. Levison et al. (2015a) showed that this difficulty
may be mitigated if pebbles form gradually so that the grow-
ing planetesimals have time to interact and stir each other. Re-
cently, Lambrechts et al. (2019) showed that a high pebble flux
leads to formation of giant planets, while a lower flux leads to
formation of super-Earths. However, many authors studying the
pebble-driven planet growth for simplicity define a fixed size or
Stokes number of pebbles and the value of the pebble flux (or
the pebble to gas flux ratio) as arbitrary parameters (typically
fixed in orbital distance and/or time), independent of the pro-
toplanetary disk model (Johansen et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2019;
Lambrechts et al. 2019; Johansen et al. 2019; Ogihara & Hori
2020; Brasser & Mojzsis 2020; Wimarsson et al. 2020)."
"Lambrechts & Johansen (2014) presented an algorithm for
calculating the pebble flux and pebble Stokes number, which is
often used by the community (Levison et al. 2015a,b; Ida et al.
2016; Bitsch & Johansen 2016; Matsumura et al. 2017; Brüg-
ger et al. 2018; Bitsch 2019; Bitsch et al. 2019a; Izidoro et al.
2019). In this model, which is based on a simplified scenario
of dust evolution, it is assumed that all dust grains grow until"

"the growth timescale becomes longer than the drift timescale.
Since the growth timescale strongly increases with distance, the
""pebble formation front"" moves outward, leading to subsequent
portions of solids decoupling from the gas and maintaining in-
ward pebble flux until the front reaches the outer edge of the
disk. This picture is roughly consistent with the outcome of dust
coagulation models as long as dust growth can proceed without
being hindered by fragmentation. However, the increase of col-
lision speeds with aggregate sizes often prevents dust growth to
reach those sizes."
"Laboratory experiments show that collisions of dust aggre-
gates become destructive already at speeds much lower than pre-
dicted for the protoplanetary disk environment. The exact frag-
mentation threshold speed remains uncertain and it was shown
to strongly depend on the porosity and composition of the ag-
gregates (Wada et al. 2011; Meru et al. 2013; Blum 2018). Until
recently, it was believed that the icy aggregates outside of the
water ice line are significantly more sticky than the dry aggre-
gates inside of the ice line (Aumatell & Wurm 2014; Gundlach &
Blum 2015). However, newer laboratory data do not support this
view, demonstrating that the icy aggregates break easily (Gund-
lach et al. 2018; Steinpilz et al. 2019; Musiolik & Wurm 2019)."
"Nevertheless, most of the works concerned with planet
growth via pebble accretion published to date neglect the effect
that fragmentation of pebbles has on their sizes and flux (the ex-
ceptions are Chambers 2016, 2018, Guilera et al. 2020, and Ven-
turini et al. 2020a,b). In this paper, for the first time, we study the
growth of planetary embryo by pebble accretion in connection
with a self-consistent dust evolution model considering full size
distribution obtained in detailed dust coagulation simulation."
"This paper is organized as follows. We present the numer-
ical model used in this work in Sect. 2. We present the result-
ing planet growth tracks and their dependence on the parameters
that are the most important to defining dust evolution outcome
in Sect. 3. We present a simple way of predicting a realistic peb-
ble flux and sizes which is valid in a fragmentation dominated
as well as in drift dominated protoplanetary disk in Sect. 4. In
Sect. 5 we discuss our work and we summarize it in Sect. 6."
2. Model
2.1. Protoplanetary disk model
"We model protoplanetary disk surrounding a solar mass star with
effective temperature of Teff = 5772 K. In the initial condition,
we set the gas surface density as a function of the radial distance
r to the often used, self-similar solution to the viscous evolution
equations (Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974)"

"Σdust,0 = Z · Σgas,0, (2)"
"where Z is the global solids-to-gas ratio. In all the models pre-
sented in this paper, we consider disks with exactly the same
initial mass budget. Mdisk is set to 0.2 M� and Z has the standard
value of 0.01, which corresponds to the initial mass in solids of
about 650 M⊕. We consider two values of the characteristic ra-
dius, rc = 30 au in the compact disk model and rc = 300 au in the
large disk model. The initial gas surface density profiles are pre-
sented in the upper panel of Fig. 1. Despite their high mass, both"

"of the disk models are gravitationally stable, with the Toomre
Q > 2, as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1."
"The gas disk evolves viscously, which means that the char-
acteristic radius increases, while the surface density drops with
time. The speed of viscous evolution is determined by the α pa-
rameter. We set the default value to α = 10−4. In Section 3.3, we
show the effects of varying the α parameter. In this work, we do
not consider disk dispersal by photoevaporation."
"The pebble accretion rate is sensitive to the vertical scale
height of gas Hgas and thus to the disk temperature structure.
In this paper, we take into account both stellar irradiation and
viscous heating using the simple prescription proposed by Ida
et al. (2016, their equation 7 and 8). Most of the disk is heated
by stellar irradiation, leading to a shallow temperature profile
Tirr ∝ r−3/7. In the inner part of the disk, viscous heating may
change the temperature profile to a steeper function of the radial
distance, Tvis ∝ r−9/10. In the viscous heating regime, the temper-
ature depends on the gas mass accretion rate, and thus this effect
is particularly important in the compact disk model, as visible in
the middle panel of Fig. 1, and in models with α = 10−3, where
the gas mass flux, defined as Ṁgas = 3παΣgasH2gasΩK, with ΩK
being the Keplerian frequency, is higher."
2.2. Dust evolution
"We investigate the dust evolution on a logarithmic radial grid
with 120 grid points spaced between 1 au and 1000 au. We
compute dust evolution in the azimuthally and vertically aver-
aged framework using the DustPy code, a Python-based version
dust coagulation model similar to the code presented by Birnstiel
et al. (2010). At every radial distance to the star, dust mass grid
with 9 mass bins per mass decade is built and the Smoluchowski
equation is used to solve for dust growth and fragmentation. We
assume that the dust grains initially have radius of one micron
and internal density of 1.25 g cm−3. The collisions are driven by
the Brownian motion, turbulence prescribed with the α param-"

(in prep.)."
2.3. Planet growth by pebble accretion
"We consider growth of planetary embryos with starting mass of
0.001 M⊕ (approximately 0.1 Moon mass, or 7 masses of the
largest asteroid, Ceres). We model the growth of embryos at
various radial locations and do not consider their migration or
planet-disk interaction. We do not subtract the dust accreted by
an embryo from the dust evolution code, which means that we
assume that each model corresponds to a single planet. We con-
sider various possibilities for the point at which we insert the
embryos into the simulation t0: either we let the pebble accre-
tion start to grow from the beginning of the simulation, or after"
"105 years and after 106 years. We assume that the embryos are
on circular orbits with zero inclination."
"To calculate the pebble accretion efficiency, we use the
method provided by Liu & Ormel (2018) and Ormel & Liu
(2018) who used 3-body calculations to obtain a general recipe
for the pebble accretion efficiency of a single planet1. In Fig. 2,
we show the example of pebble accretion efficiencies obtained
using this recipe for a range of planetary embryo masses and
sizes at 5 au and at 30 au in the initial condition of the com-
pact disk model with the turbulence parameter α = 10−4. As
can be seen in this figure, the recipe takes into account both
the 2D regime, where the embryo is large enough to accrete
from the complete layer of pebbles, and the 3D regime, where
the small embryo only has access to some fraction of the peb-
ble layer. The transition from 3D to 2D regime is marked with
the dashed-dotted line. The grey dashed line shows the transi-
tion between the headwind and shear regimes. The headwind
regime, also called Bondi regime, is valid for small embryos
or small pebbles, when the pebbles are accreted only from the
embryo proximity and the relative velocity between the pebbles
and the embryo is determined by the gas flow. Larger embryos
enter the shear regime, also called Hill regime, when the pebbles
are accreted from much larger area and their approach veloc-
ity is determined by the Keplerian shear. The transition between
the headwind and shear regimes does not impact the pebble ac-
cretion efficiency in the 3D regime, while in the 2D regime it
slightly changes the dependence of εPA on the Stokes number.
This effect becomes more important in the outer regions of the
disk, when the transition between headwind and shear regime
shifts to higher embryo masses. As explained in Ormel (2017),
in the 3D regime the pebble accretion efficiency increases with
the Stokes number because dust settling is more efficient and
the embryo accretes from a denser midplane layer, while in the
2D regime this effect is canceled by the increasing drift speed
of pebbles and the decreasing embryo-pebble interaction time.
The dotted line in Fig. 2 shows the pebble accretion onset, that"

"is the minimum embryo mass for which the aerodynamic deflec-
tion becomes important (Visser & Ormel 2016). For reference,
the typical planetesimal size formed in the streaming instability
models is about 100 km (Schäfer et al. 2017; Li et al. 2019a;
Klahr & Schreiber 2020). Interestingly, these smallest embryos
could only grow by accretion of small pebbles and with an ex-
tremely low efficiency. The pebble accretion onset shifts toward
even larger embryo masses in the outer parts of the disk."
"Figure 2 shows that the pebble accretion efficiency is mostly
dependent on the embryo mass and not on the pebble size, as
long as the Stokes number stays between 10−3 and 1, in the typ-
ical ""pebble-size"" regime. A relatively large embryo, with sig-
nificant fraction of an Earth mass, is able to grow quickly by
accreting a considerable fraction of the pebble flux. It is worth
noting that multiple small embryos could grow at the same time,
collectively capturing similar fraction of pebbles as a single large
embryo (Bitsch et al. 2019b). The growth rate of the planetary
embryo depends both on the pebble accretion efficiency and the
pebble flux. In this paper, we compute pebble fluxes consistently
with the pebble size resulting from our full dust coagulation
model."
"Our pebble accretion algorithm works as follows. At the
planetary embryo location ae, we calculate the Stokes number
of the dust particles from every mass bin, Sti. Then we calculate
the pebble accretion efficiency εPA(me, ae, Sti) for the current em-
bryo mass me and multiply it by the flux of solids corresponding
to each bin of the mass grid ṁp(ae, Sti) obtained in the dust evo-
lution code. In the next step, we sum the contributions from each
dust mass bin to obtain the embryo growth rate"
"ṁe =
∑"
"εPA (me, ae, Sti) · ṁp(ae, Sti). (5)"
"The growth stops when the embryo reaches the pebble isola-
tion mass. Following Lambrechts et al. (2014), we calculate the"
pebble isolation mass as
"Miso = 20 M⊕ ·
("
"Hgas/r
0.05"
")3
, (6)"
"where Hgas/r is disk aspect ratio. It is worth noting that Ataiee
et al. (2018) and Bitsch et al. (2018b) reported that the pebble
isolation mass may be increased in turbulent disks while Zorm-
pas et al. (2020) found that the pebble isolation mass is decreased
when a realistic equation of state and radiative cooling are taken
into account."
3. Results
"We performed seven different models, varying the fragmentation
threshold velocity, disk size, and turbulence level. In each of the
models, we considered growth of planetary embryos by pebble
accretion at 1 au, 5 au, 10 au, 20 au, 30 au, 40 au, and 50 au.
However, in none of the models did an embryo located outside
of 20 au reach the pebble isolation mass."
3.1. Fragmentation threshold
"We first focus on the impact of the fragmentation threshold value
on the planetary growth. Figure 3 presents results of four runs,
all performed with the compact disk model with the turbulence
strength α = 10−4 and different fragmentation threshold speeds
vf = 1 m/s, vf = 2 m/s, vf = 10 m/s, and vf = ∞, corresponding
to no fragmentation. The left panel of Fig. 3 presents the growth
of planetary embryos at 1 au, 5 au, 10 au, and 20 au. At each
location, we tested different embryo introduction times t0: at the
beginning of the simulation (t0 = 0), after 105 years, and after
106 years of dust evolution."
"The runs with vf = 10 m/s and no fragmentation produced
very similar results except for the inner region of the disk (r ≤
5 au). Interestingly, in this inner region of the disk, the growth of
embryos introduced at t0 = 0 and t0 = 105 years proceeds faster"

"in the runs with fragmentation than in the run without fragmenta-
tion. In the run without fragmentation, the embryo located at 1 au
does not reach its pebble isolation mass irrespective on the intro-
duction time, while in the run with vf = 10 m/s, the innermost
embryo reaches the isolation mass after only tens of thousands of
years. The reason for the slow growth of the close-in embryos in
the model without fragmentation is that pebbles break through
the drift barrier and continue growing quickly over the Stokes
number of unity, in the Stokes drag regime. This process has
been previously described in the literature, see e.g. Brauer et al.
(2008a); Birnstiel et al. (2010); Okuzumi et al. (2012); Laibe
(2014); Drążkowska et al. (2014)."
"The breakthrough only happens in the inner part of the disk,
as the outer part is still dominated by the radial drift barrier. Fig-
ure 4 presents the average Stokes numbers and grain sizes as a
function of radial distance at t = 2 · 105 years of evolution in the
four models with different fragmentation threshold. It is worth
noting that the flux-averaged dust size (and Stokes number) is
typically a bit larger than the mass-averaged value, except for
the grains that break through the St = 1 barrier. This is because
the radial drift velocity increases up to St = 1 and then decreases
again (see Eq. 3). The grain size of ∼100 m reached in the in-
ner region in the run without fragmentation is an effect of the
upper limit of the size grid used in the dust coagulation calcu-
lation rather than a physical value. The large solids do not drift
efficiently, which manifests as the low pebble flux at 1 au in the
right panel of Fig. 3. Since the grain growth is limited to the
upper boundary of the size grid, those results should be treated
as approximate, as the pebble flux would drop even more if the
growth could proceed without a limit."
"Except for reducing the pebble flux, breaking through the
St > 1 barrier has another negative impact on planet growth
rate. The efficiency of pebble accretion significantly drops for
such large dust aggregates (see Fig. 2), as technically they do
not count as pebbles anymore. Thus, even though the total mass
of solids passing around the close-in embryo over the disk life-
time is essentially the same, in the run without fragmentation the
planet does not reach the pebble isolation mass."
"This result shows that some level of dust fragmentation may
be beneficial for the planetary growth via pebble accretion. Thus,
we performed additional runs, lowering the fragmentation speed
even more, to vf = 2 m/s and vf = 1 m/s, the latter value being
roughly consistent with the conclusions from laboratory work
(Güttler et al. 2010). As visible in the right panel of Fig. 3,"
"decreasing the fragmentation speed leads to pebble flux reduc-
tion. In the runs with the low fragmentation speed, grains stay at
smaller sizes (see Fig. 4) and drift slower, leading to lower but
long-lasting mass flux, as depletion of small aggregates takes
longer. This effect is particularly important if the planetary em-
bryo takes a long time to form. In the left panel of Fig. 3, one
can see that if embryos are introduced at 1 Myr of dust evolu-
tion, they grow the most in the run with the lowest fragmentation
threshold, vf = 1 m/s."
"Interestingly, for embryos introduced at t0 = 105 years, the
vf = 2 m/s is the most favorable value in terms of planetary
growth. This is because, while the flux in the runs with the higher
fragmentation threshold is already decreasing at that point, the
flux in the vf = 2 m/s run stays high for another couple of hun-
dred thousands years (see the right panel of Fig. 3). At the same
time, the flux is factor of two higher in the vf = 2 m/s run than
in the vf = 1 m/s case."
3.2. Disk size
"In the results presented in Sect. 3.1, the pebble flux lasts for at
most 3 Myrs. However, millimeter and centimeter-sized pebbles
are observed in protoplanetary disks older than several Myrs
(Wilner et al. 2005; Ricci et al. 2010). Johansen et al. (2019,
their Appendix A) noticed this problem and speculated that lim-
ited dust growth in the outer part of the disk may be the solution
to retaining pebbles for long timescales. They have also shown
that large initial disk size facilitates long-lasting pebble flux, a
solution often used in pebble accretion models (Lambrechts &
Johansen 2014; Sato et al. 2016; Bitsch et al. 2018a). While large
disks are bright and thus relatively easy to image at high angu-
lar resolution (Andrews et al. 2018), there is evidence that most
of the disks may, in fact, be small (Ansdell et al. 2018; Long
et al. 2019; Maury et al. 2019; Tobin et al. 2020; Trapman et al.
2020). In this section, we study the impact of disk size on the
pebble flux and resulting planetary growth."
"Figure 5 presents results of two models where the same ini-
tial mass was distributed either in a compact disk with the criti-
cal radius rc = 30 au or in a much larger disk with rc = 300 au.
The other simulation parameters are the same: the fragmentation
speed is vf = 10 m/s and the turbulence strength is α = 10−4."
"The compact disk produces a very high pebble flux, well over
10−3 M⊕/yr, which, however, only lasts for about 3 · 105 years
and declines over the next couple of hundred thousands years
(see the right panel of Fig. 5). With such a high pebble flux, the
embryos introduced at the beginning of the simulation take less
than one hundred thousand years to reach their isolation mass.
The embryo placed at 1 au reaches its isolation mass in little
over ten thousand years, which is the fastest growth we observe
in any of our runs."
"Pebble flux obtained in the large disk model is almost one
order of magnitude lower than in the compact disk model, but
lasts proportionally longer. Thus, even embryos introduced late
during the simulation, at t0 = 106 years, are able to obtain their
isolation mass, at least inside of 10 au. Thus, extending the ini-
tial size of the disk gives similar results to lowering the frag-
mentation speed, as we discussed in the previous section. There
is however, one important difference, which manifests itself in
the planet growth results at and outside of 10 au. In the compact
disk, a significant fraction of the mass is initially located inside
of 10 au. The mass reservoir available for wide-orbit planets is
significantly higher in the large disk than in the compact disk.

"10 au, reaches its isolation mass in the large disk model but not
in the compact disk model."
"With the large mass reservoir available even at wide orbital
distances, it may be surprising that no embryo reaches its isola-
tion mass outside of 10 au in the large disk model. This is be-
cause the pebble accretion efficiency for a constant embryo size
significantly decreases with radial distance (see Fig. 2). In this
paper, we consider the initial embryo mass of 0.001 M⊕ irrespec-
tive of its location (and starting time). More massive embryos
could probably still reach pebble isolation mass in the outer parts
of the disk."
3.3. Turbulence
"The turbulence level in protoplanetary disk is a key unknown.
Observational constraints on the disk dispersal timescales sug-
gest turbulence levels of α ≈ 10−2 if the dispersal would be
driven solely by accretion driven by turbulent transport of angu-
lar momentum (Hernández et al. 2007). However, more recent
disk models suggest that the turbulence level may vary within
the disk and that large regions of the disk, particularly near to
the midplane, may have low levels of turbulence (Lesur et al.
2014; Bai 2016). This would be consistent with the disk images
obtained in millimeter wavelengths, where the pebbles appear
to be well-settled (Pinte et al. 2016; Villenave et al. 2020), and
also consistent with the low upper limits set by measurements
of turbulent line broadening (Flaherty et al. 2015, 2020; Teague
et al. 2016, 2018). Given the uncertainties and difficulties in con-
straining the turbulence level observationally, in this section, we
consider the turbulence strength α as a free parameter."
"Figure 6 shows results of three runs performed on the back-
drop of the compact disk model with different levels of turbu-
lence. We keep the fragmentation speed at v f = 1 m/s in all the
runs. As visible in the left panel of Fig. 6, low turbulence pro-
motes the planetary growth irrespective on the distance to the
star and the starting time of the embryo. This has multiple rea-
sons. First of all, lower turbulence level leads to better settling of"
"the pebbles and higher pebble accretion efficiency (Ormel 2017).
Lower turbulence speed promotes growth to larger pebble sizes,
which increases the pebble flux, although this effect is stopped
when the fragmentation starts to be dominated by the differential
radial drift rather than turbulence (this happens for α . 10−4, see
the right panels of Fig. 6)."
"It is worth noting that in case of the highest turbulence
parameter value that we considered, α = 10−3, no embryo
reaches the pebble isolation mass. If the turbulence is strong,
with α ≥ 10−3, the fragmentation threshold velocity needs to be
much higher than vf = 1 m/s, which we considered in models
presented in Fig. 6, to allow planetary embryos to benefit from
pebble accretion."
4. Simple prediction of the pebble flux
"As we showed above, planetary growth by pebble accretion is
very sensitive to disk parameters and details of dust evolution.
The pebble flux depends on the initial mass budget, disk size,
turbulence level, and fragmentation threshold speed. The peb-
ble accretion efficiency is sensitive to pebble size and settling.
The DustPy simulations described above are relatively expen-
sive, typically taking several days of computations. In this paper,
we propose a simple and efficient method that predicts the size
and flux of pebbles for arbitrary protoplanetary disk without sub-
structure, the pebble predictor2."
"The general mechanics of pebble predictor is closely re-
lated to two-pop-py presented by Birnstiel et al. (2012), albeit it
a full time integration of the disk is not performed. The pebble
predictor uses the initial state of the gas and dust disk surface
density Σgas,0 and Σdust,0, temperature T , the turbulence strength
α, and the fragmentation threshold velocity vf to predict the flux-"

growth could replenish them. In the opposite case, the pebble

mated as Σdust,i = Σdust,0 · Mout,i/Mout,0. Since the time steps sup-
plied in the input time grid are not necessarily fulfilling the CFL
condition, this routine cannot be treated as a rigorous integration.
Its goal is correcting the pebble flux for the remaining mass bud-
get rather than recovering the actual surface density evolution."
"Figure 7 shows the comparison of the pebble predictor
and DustPy results for various setups varying the disk size, frag-
mentation speed, and turbulence level. The representative Stokes
number from pebble predictor is benchmarked against the
flux averaged Stokes number from the full coagulation calcu-
lation. On the top right panel of Fig. 7, we additionally show
the flux and Stokes number prediction from the analytical model
proposed by Lambrechts & Johansen (2014). In this model, it is
assumed that the pebble flux is set by the initial dust surface den-
sity at the pebble formation front, which spreads radially with
time. The general outcome of this model fits our results well, al-
though the growth timescale is slightly underestimated and the
pebble flux starts later than in the numerical results. The most
significant difference reveals at later times, as the pebble flux
in Lambrechts & Johansen (2014) model abruptly stops when
the pebble formation front reaches the outer edge of the disk. In
reality, however, disk viscous spreading and dust diffusion mod-
ify the shape of the outer disk edge before the grains there reach
pebble sizes. What is more, not all the pebbles at a given location
grow and start drifting at once, which extending the duration of
the pebble flux as well. Finding analytical prediction that would
encompass all the relevant processes is not feasible. Thus, the
pebble predictor is a semianalytic model relying on some
empirical scaling."
"The main limitations of pebble predictor, causing some
discrepancies between its predictions and the full simulation re-
sults can be summarized as follows."
"– pebble predictor assumes that the growth is driven by
turbulence (only one of the turbulent regimes calculated by
Ormel & Cuzzi 2007, to be precise). This assumption breaks
in the case of low turbulence, when the collisions are mostly
driven by differential drift. For very small particles, the tur-
bulent speeds fall into a different regime (see also the dis-
cussion in Powell et al. 2019, their appendix B), which leads
to the need to modifying the growth timescale prescription
with the empirical dependencies on turbulent strength α and
radial distance in Eq. (7)."
"– Only the Epstein drag regime is considered, which leads to
error in estimating both the size and pebble flux where the
growth enters the Stokes regime, so in the inner parts of
disks in runs where dust fragmentation is not considered (see
Sec. 3.1)."
"– Gas disk evolution is not included, leading to inaccuracies
particularly at the outer regions of the disk, where disk
spreading slows down the flow of pebbles."
"– Similarly, dust advection with the gas flow is not considered
in pebble predictor, which may lead to issues with esti-
mating both the flux and pebble size correctly in runs when a
significant fraction of solids is coupled to the gas, for exam-
ple when the turbulence level is high and the fragmentation
threshold is low."
"– Diffusion is not considered, which is particularly important
at the outer edge of the disk, where the dust-to-gas ratio gra-
dient is strong (Birnstiel & Andrews 2014). This leads to the
characteristic peak in the dust flux visible in the runs involv-"
"Article number, page 8 of 12"
J. Drążkowska1 et al.: How dust fragmentation may be beneficial to planetary growth by pebble accretion
"ing compact disk and high fragmentation threshold, a feature
which is not reproduced by the pebble predictor."
"– Because the dust advection with gas flow and diffusion are
not included, pebble predictor should not be applied to
disks with substructure (see Sect. 5.5). A full model, such
as DustPy or a more advanced simplified method such as
two-pop-py developed by Birnstiel et al. (2012) may be bet-
ter choice in such case."
"Considering all the limitations, the pebble predictor does
surprisingly well predicting the dependencies of pebble flux and
size on the fragmentation speed, disk size, and turbulence level,
as demonstrated in Fig. 7."
5. Discussion
5.1. Limitations of the (full) model
"In this paper, we coupled dust evolution calculated with the
DustPy code and embryo growth by pebble accretion. Our mod-
els have certain limitations, some of them may impact the plan-
etary growth results discussed in this paper. These are listed be-
low."
"– We do not consider that dust grains are composed of various
materials and that evaporation of volatile components could
cause decrease of the pebble flux in the inner regions of the
disk."
"– We assume that all the dust aggregates are compact, with
constant internal density, and neglect the effects of porosity."
"– The structure of gas disk is independent of the evolution of
solids. This is valid as long as the solids-to-gas ratio stays
low, which is true in almost all of the models except for the
one without fragmentation, when the grains break through
the St = 1 barrier and pileup in the inner part of the disk."
"– Our models correspond to one-planet-per-disk approach as
we do not decrease the pebble reservoir by the amount ac-
creted by each planet. Similarly, we do not include perturba-
tions to disk structure caused by the growing planets. Such
multiplanet effects could be important as many embryos
would grow from the same pebble reservoir and the outer-
most embryo would block the pebble flux when it reaches its
pebble isolation mass."
"– In this paper, we assume that the disk is fully turbulent, with a
constant α value. Modern disk models predict that large parts
of the disk may be free from turbulence and the accretion
is primarily driven by magnetized disk winds (Lesur et al.
2014; Bai 2017). In such disks, the viscous heating would
not be relevant, leading to lower temperatures in the inner
part of the disk than we assume in our models (Mori et al.
2019). Lower temperatures typically promote pebble accre-
tion as the grains grow to larger sizes and are more settled.
On the other hand, the pebble isolation mass is lower for
colder disks."
"– Similarly, we do not include the gas disk dispersal by effects
other than viscous accretion. Magnetic and photoevaporative
winds could completely change the disk structure, particu-
larly in the later phases of its evolution, which would im-
pact the pebble fluxes and probably abruptly stop planetary
growth by pebble accretion."
5.2. Planet migration
"Perhaps the most significant limitation of our models is that we
do not include planetary migration. Interaction between a suffi-
ciently massive planetary core and the gas disk leads to radial"
"migration (Ward 1997). A typical timescale of the inward mi-
gration for Earth-mass planet at 1 au is 105 years (Ogihara et al.
2015), comparable to the timescale of planetary growth by peb-
ble accretion."
"Many authors have studied the interplay between the plan-
etary migration and planet growth in pebble accretion scenario.
Bitsch et al. (2015) showed that planets mostly migrate in the
type I regime while accreting pebbles, but the migration direc-
tion may be both inward and outward, depending on their radial
location. Planets that reach masses allowing for gas accretion
typically outgrow the outward migration region and significantly
change their radial location, by tens of au. Nevertheless, planet
growth by pebble accretion is generally fast enough for planets
to reach the pebble isolation mass before falling onto the cen-
tral star due to migration (Bitsch & Johansen 2016; Ndugu et al.
2018; Johansen et al. 2019)."
"A connection between planet migration and pebble accretion
including the self-consistent dust evolution model will be a sub-
ject to our future work."
"5.3. Validity of the single dust size approach in pebble
accretion models"
"In the models presented in this paper, we used dust evolution
model that includes distribution of dust sizes. For every size bin,
we use the solid flux calculated by the DustPy code, and multi-
ply it by the pebble efficiency factor εPA, corresponding to this
pebble size, to get the pebble accretion rate. We sum up contri-
bution from each size bin to calculate planet accretion rate, see
Eq. (5)3. However, since this type of model is computationally
expensive, many authors employ simplified models of dust evo-
lution. For example, the two population model for dust evolution
proposed by Birnstiel et al. (2012) is recently commonly used
to compute dust evolution in protoplanetary disk as it allows us
recovering the dust density evolution at a relatively low compu-
tational cost, without solving the full coagulation equation (see.
e.g., Drążkowska et al. 2016; Cridland et al. 2017; Tamfal et al.
2018; Charnoz et al. 2019; Gárate et al. 2020)."
"In this paper, we propose even simpler way of predicting
pebble size and flux based on one representative grain size at
every distance, the pebble predictor (see Sect. 4). It is justi-
fied to ask whether these simple models can be reliably used to
calculate planetary growth via pebble accretion even though they
do not calculate the full size distribution. We tested this by using
the results of pebble predictor to calculate embryo growth
and compared the results to the results obtained in the DustPy
models in Fig. 8. Although there are some differences, the re-
sults in terms of the time of reaching the pebble isolation mass
or the final embryo mass usually agree within one order of mag-
nitude. The biggest differences are for planets introduced late,
at t0 = 106 years. This is because the pebble predictor does
not include the gas disk evolution."
5.4. Early planet formation
"Studies of mass reservoirs of planet forming disks infer that
planet(-esimal) formation should start early (Greaves & Rice
2011; Najita & Kenyon 2014; Manara et al. 2018; Tychoniec
et al. 2020). There is growing evidence that planet formation"
"3 The sum in Eq. (5) may actually be omitted by using a single pebble
accretion efficiency parameter calculated for the flux-averaged Stokes
number and the total flux of solids. This approach gives a very good
agreement with the results presented in this paper."

"process is indeed well underway in young disks (Harsono et al.
2018; Segura-Cox et al. 2020). Pebble accretion may certainly
be an avenue to fast planet formation, as young, massive disks
should facilitate very high pebble fluxes."
"Our results show that the pebble flux is the highest just after
the dust aggregates at a given orbital distance reach their maxi-
mum size. Thus, if a large enough embryo forms early enough,
it may benefits from this high pebble flux and reach its peb-
ble isolation mass already during early stages of disk evolu-
tion (Tanaka & Tsukamoto 2019). The pathway to such an early
formation of massive planetesimals is not yet understood. The
fastest route to planetesimal formation, the streaming instabil-
ity, needs an enhanced solids-to-gas ratio to operate (Johansen
et al. 2009; Bai & Stone 2010). Enhancing their density requires
significant redistribution of solids, which may take a long time
(Drążkowska et al. 2016). The cold finger effect at water snow
line could lead to formation of some planetesimals already dur-
ing the disk buildup stage (Drążkowska & Dullemond 2018).
However, the planetesimals formed via the streaming instability
are most likely not large enough to accrete pebbles and inter-
mediate stage of planetesimal accretion is necessary (Liu et al.
2019)."
5.5. Substructures
"In this paper, we focused on the smooth disk model. However,
there is observational evidence that substructures are ubiquitous
in protoplanetary disks (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015; Long
et al. 2018; Andrews et al. 2018). Substructures are thought
to modify the evolution of dust, allowing for solids retention
over long timescales, consistent with observations (Pinilla et al.
2012b; Li et al. 2019b). They may be a preferential location of
planetesimal and planet formation (Haghighipour & Boss 2003;
Brauer et al. 2008b). In particular, planetesimal formation may
be triggered at the outer edge of a gap carved by a preexisting
planet (Stammler et al. 2019; Eriksson et al. 2020; Shibaike &
Alibert 2020)."
"In terms of pebble flux, substructures cause pileup of peb-
bles, likely speeding up local growth of planet located inside of
the pressure bump (Guilera et al. 2020; Morbidelli 2020). Ex-
istence of a long lasting substructure may be a way to enable
growth of giant planets at large orbital distance. At the same
time, however, overall pebble flux through the disk inward from
a pressure bump would decrease as some, potentially significant,
fraction of solids is held in the substructure."
"Comprehensive knowledge of the substructure and detailed
dust models are necessary to calculate the resulting pebble flux.
One dimensional models of dust evolution in a pressure bump
showed that dust growth can proceed to larger sizes inside of a
pressure bump (Brauer et al. 2008b; Pinilla et al. 2012a). Dust
trapping is hindered by diffusion and advection of small grains
with the gas flow. There is a critical size of dust, which depends
on the details of the bump structure, below which the grains can-
not be trapped (Pinilla et al. 2016; Weber et al. 2018). This ef-
fects can, in principle, be modeled with DustPy, which includes
both dust diffusion and advection with the gas flow, however
the results must be treated with caution, as recent two dimen-
sional models show that the planet induced spiral wakes may
modify the growth pattern (Drążkowska et al. 2019). The simple
flux prediction we proposed in Sect. 4 does not include diffusion
and grains advection with the gas flow and thus is not suitable
for disks with substructures. We leave development of tools that
would be useful in such disks for future work."
6. Summary
"In this paper, we studied planetary growth by pebble accretion in
a protoplanetary disk without substructure. We investigated how
the most uncertain parameters, the fragmentation velocity, disk
size, and turbulence strength, impact the growth rate of embryos
placed at different radial locations and times during the dust evo-
lution. We found that planetary growth strongly depends on dust
evolution and the pebble sizes and fluxes should be calculated
self-consistently with the disk structure. An important byprod-"

J. Drążkowska1 et al.: How dust fragmentation may be beneficial to planetary growth by pebble accretion
"uct of this paper is the pebble predictor, publicly available
script that predicts the Stokes number and flux of pebbles in
any smooth protoplanetary disk model for a given fragmentation
threshold velocity at a very low computational cost (see Sect. 4)."
"One of our conclusions is that the planet growth by pebble
accretion may be extremely fast if a large embryo is formed in
the disk while the pebble flux is still high. Compact disk may
produce very high pebble flux, leading to the close-in embryos
reaching their pebble isolation mass within 104–105 years, de-
pending on the fragmentation speed, when the turbulence is not
too strong (α ≤ 10−4). High turbulence levels universally re-
duce the planetary growth rate, while the effects of fragmenta-
tion threshold and disk size are not as obvious."
"Dust fragmentation keeps dust aggregates at pebble sizes, for
which pebble accretion is the most efficient. Without fragmen-
tation, dust growth would proceed over the pebble size limit,
making the solids useless for growing planets by pebble ac-
cretion. Strong fragmentation keeps the pebbles small and de-
creases their drift speed, lowering pebble flux and slowing down
the growth of embryos. At the same time, the low fragmentation
threshold promotes keeping significant fraction of solids in the
protoplanetary disk over long time and enables growth of em-
bryos that formed late."
"Compact disks are favorable for very rapid growth of close-
in planets. In contrast, large disks are needed for formation of
giant planets on wide orbits. Even with the large disk model,
growing cores of giant planets outside of 10 au is challenging
as the efficiency of pebble accretion drops with radial dis-
tance. One possible solution to this problem may be existence of
dust traps that could facilitate planet growth by pebble accretion."
