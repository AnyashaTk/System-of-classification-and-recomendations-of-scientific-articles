"Abstract. In the early Universe, as well as in supernovae and merging neutron stars,
neutrinos have such high densities that they affect each other and exhibit collective
flavor oscillations. A crucial ingredient for fast collective flavor oscillations is that the
electron lepton number (ELN) distribution changes its sign as a function of direction,
i.e., has a zero crossing. We present a study in two dimensions and show how fast
flavor oscillations depend on the ELN and its crossings. We show that a large number
of crossings can inhibit flavor oscillations. This may be a natural self-limiting mecha-
nism that stabilizes the flavor content of the dense neutrino gas in a vast majority of
scenarios, especially the early Universe, where the angular distributions for all flavors
are very similar and crossings occur mainly due to fluctuations."

1 Introduction
"Astrophysical neutrinos are a valuable probe of fundamental physics and astrophysics.
The focus of this paper is the so-called fast collective flavor evolution of neutrinos,
which can have a dramatic effect in dense astrophysical environments, e.g., on the
explosion of core-collapse supernovae, nucleosynthesis in supernovae and neutron star
mergers, and perhaps for neutrinos in cosmology."
"Neutrino oscillation in ordinary matter is governed through two frequency scales –
one is the vacuum oscillation frequency, ωE = |∆m2|/(2E), related to the mass-squared
difference between two different mass eigenstates, ∆m2 = m22−m21, and the other is the
matter potential, λ ="
"√
2GFne, coming from the coherent forward scatterings of neutri-"
"nos with electrons with possibly spatially varying density ne in the medium.
1 Broadly,"
"high density, λ � ωE, suppresses flavor mixing. As a result, large flavor conversion
in ordinary matter can occur either after λ drops below ωE, whence ordinary neutrino
oscillations ensue, or when these two frequency scales match, i.e., λ ≈ ωE, giving rise
to the well known phenomenon of matter-enhanced oscillations [1, 2]. Thus one might
think that neutrinos cannot oscillate deep inside stars or in the early Universe."
"1The quantum mechanical amplitude of forward scattering interferes with free propagation and
gives a potential for flavor oscillations. Momentum and number changing collisions do not produce
interference effects."
"Neutrino-neutrino scattering in a neutrino gas gives rise to a new scale, µ =√
2GFnν , proportional to the neutrino density nν [3]. This new potential makes the"
"flavor evolution nonlinear, allowing novel collective flavor oscillations in dense environ-
ments. A salient feature of these collective oscillations is that neutrinos of different
energies oscillate approximately at the same rate, i.e., the average ωE for synchronized
oscillations [4],"
"√
ωEµ for bipolar or slow collective oscillations [5, 6], and as rapidly"
"as µ for fast collective oscillations [7]. The slow variant of these collective oscillations
was studied deeply starting from the mid-2000s, exposing a sequence of new effects
such as swapping of the flavor-dependent spectra as well as momentum, space, and
time-dependent flavor transformations [8–19]."
"Fast flavor oscillations became a topic of wide interest only around 2015, starting
with the influential paper by Sawyer [20], which pointed out that the angular distri-
butions for the different neutrino flavors are different in the decoupling region in a
supernova and that can cause oscillations with rate ∝ µ. This was followed by two
crucial studies which developed theoretical understanding of fast oscillations in the
linearized regime [21, 22]. The first elucidated an underlying instability, showing how
it has little dependence on ωE [21], and the second clarified the role of homogeneity
and stationarity, and showed that fast oscillations may occur for the the presumably
realistic neutrino distributions inspired by state-of-the-art simulations [22]. Subse-
quently, this subject has seen significant progress [23–32], and it appears that fast
oscillations can occur in many environments [33–40] and drastically alter the flavor
composition therein [41, 42]. In particular, they may lead to almost complete flavor
depolarization [41, 42], limited by conservation of lepton asymmetry."
"Properly understanding these new effects requires solving a set of coupled nonlin-
ear partial integro-differential equations in a 3 (spatial) + 3 (momentum) + 1 (time)
= 7 dimensional space, which has remained unachievable till date. As a result, most
studies assume a high degree of symmetry and limit the flavor evolution to be along
a single coordinate — be it temporal evolution of a homogeneous gas or the spatial
evolution of a stationary dense neutrino gas. Previous experience with slow collective
oscillations [16–19] suggests that such restrictions artificially exclude allowed modes of
flavor evolution. Calculations in 1+1+1 dimensions are superior [41, 42], but as we will
discuss in Sec. 2.2.1 they too are not fully satisfactory. While a calculation in 3+3+1
dimensions remains the holy grail, going to at least 2+2+1 dimensions is necessary to
satisfy the constraints on neutrino velocities, include fully self-consistent space-time
evolution, and not artificially exclude allowed modes of flavor evolution."
"In this paper, we present a study of fast flavor oscillations of a dense neutrino
gas in 2+2+1 dimensions. Our study explores how the flavor evolution is related to
the symmetries and the number of zero crossings of the electron lepton number (ELN)
distribution, i.e., the difference of νe and ν̄e angular distributions; a more precise
definition appears later. We perform detailed comparisons of the numerical results
with those from a linearized analysis, finding excellent agreement. The main insights
obtained from our study are that the flavor evolution inherits symmetries of the ELN,
and why ELNs with a large number of zero crossings can in fact lead to a much weaker
flavor instability."
"The paper is organized as follows: Sec. 2.1 sets up the problem. Sec. 2.2 introduces
the types of neutrino angular distributions that we consider in this study. In Secs. 2.3,
2.4, and 2.5, we describe the analytical and numerical methods we use for solving the
equations. In Sec. 3, we discuss our numerical and analytical results for all examples
in a systematic way. In Sec. 4, we conclude with a brief summary."
2 Set-up and Methods
2.1 Equations of Motion
"Consider an effective two-flavor framework with each neutrino being a superposition
of the e and µ flavors. Neglecting momentum-changing collisions, the flavor evolution
of the neutrinos at position ~x and time t, with momentum ~p ≈ E~v, is given by [43]"
"(
∂t + ~v · ~∂"
")
P[E,~v] = H[E,~v]× P[E,~v] . (2.1)"
"We use the notation of Ref. [42]. The polarization vector P[E,~v] for each momentum
labeled by (E,~v) encodes the flavor state.2 Antineutrinos are represented by P̄[E,~v].
However, polarization vectors for antineutrinos behave as if they were polarization
vectors for neutrinos with negative E, so it is convenient to define P[−E,~v] := −P̄[E,~v],
where now the argument E in P[E,~v] takes values between −∞ to +∞. The overall
minus sign is a notational foresight that makes Eq.(2.5) simpler."
"Neutrino oscillations do not change the total occupation numbers of neutrinos
(or antineutrinos), but only the difference between flavors. One defines P[E,~v] =
g[E,~v] S[E,~v], with S[E,~v] having a unit length and"
"g[E,~v] ="
"{
+fνe [+E,~v]− fνµ [+E,~v] for E > 0
−fν̄e [−E,~v] + fν̄µ [−E,~v] for E < 0"
"being the normalization of the polarization vectors up to a sign. It is to be noted that
the occupation numbers for neutrinos and antineutrinos are only defined at positive
E, but together they are packaged into a single function g[E,~v] which spans over
E ∈ (−∞,+∞). Typically one has an excess of νe over νµ (resp. ν̄e over ν̄µ) at any
momentum, because the electron flavors can be preferentially produced via charged
current processes. This means that g[E,~v] is positive (resp. negative) for neutrinos
(resp. antineutrinos). If instead there is an excess of νµ over νe (resp. ν̄µ over ν̄e) it
simply means that g[E,~v] becomes negative (resp. positive)."
"2A few words about notation: Functional dependence will be denoted by square brackets [. . .],
though dependence on space-time (~x, t) is implicit. We reserve the parenthesis (. . .) for grouping
terms together or to denote vectors written as a tuple of their components. Sans-serif letters such
as S represent three-component vectors in flavor space. Symbols in the usual italic with an arrow on
top, e.g., ~x, represent three-dimensional vectors in real space. Later in the paper we will introduce
matrices that are space-time tensors; these are written as bold symbols, e.g., Π, and their components
as Πij with subscripts ij being indices that run over space and time. Angle brackets, i.e., 〈· · · 〉, will
stand for spatial averaging over all spatial coordinates."
"In the flavor basis, the orientation (0, 0,+1) corresponds to a purely electron
flavor and (0, 0,−1) to a muon flavor. All neutrinos and antineutrinos start out as
flavor eigenstates and the initial state of all Bloch vectors is chosen to be Sini[E,~v] =
(0, 0,+1). In this convention, at any space-time point, the third component of the
Bloch vector S[E,~v] is equal to twice the survival probability minus one."
"The Bloch vector for the hamiltonian has the form H = Hvac + Hmat + Hself .
Neutrino mass-mixing gives"
"Hvac[E] = ±ωE (sin 2θ, 0, cos 2θ) , (2.3)"
"with the plus (resp. minus) sign chosen for the normal (resp. inverted) mass ordering.
Note that antineutrinos having been defined as neutrinos with negative E accounts
for the sign-flip needed in the mass-mixing hamiltonian. Further, the effect of forward
scattering on electrons in the background matter is encoded in"

or antineutrinos with that flavor and velocity ~v to the neutrino density nν ."
"3Strictly speaking, one must keep ωE 6= 0 in Hvac; otherwise one can set the mass and flavor basis
to be identical, once and for all, and there are no oscillations. Thus ωE affects the kickstarting of the
oscillations, but the subsequent evolution very weakly [21, 23]. In practice, one imagines setting ωE
(or an external perturbation used as its proxy) to zero immediately after the evolution begins."

angular distributions of the νe and ν̄e and thus different numbers of crossings."
"2.2 ELNs with 1, 2, . . . ,∞ Crossings
In a typical astrophysical scenario, where the ambient temperature is lower than the
muon mass, there is no significant difference in the occupations for νµ and ν̄µ. Thus
G[~v] is approximately equal to Gνe [~v] − Gν̄e [~v], and can be called the electron lepton
number distribution. Integrating it over velocity, one finds"

", (2.8)"
"which is the net lepton asymmetry in neutrinos.
We now focus on a broad feature of this function G[~v] — the possibility that"
"this function changes sign as a function of direction — a feature that is referred to
as an ELN crossing. The reason we focus on this feature, is that it appears to be
necessary (and perhaps sufficient) for causing fast flavor oscillations. A crossing can
occur if Gνe [~v] and Gν̄e [~v] have different velocity dependence and are of a comparable
magnitude. Broadly, one can think of four possible scenarios:"
"• No crossing: If the density of νe far exceeds that of ν̄e, or vice versa, then one
of the terms in G[~v] dominates and there is no crossing in the ELN. The function
G[~v] remains positive or negative everywhere. This situation is shown as the
top-left schematic in Fig. 1."
"• One crossing: In the neutrino decoupling region in a SN, νe is expected to have
a higher number density compared to ν̄e. However, ν̄e kinematically decouples at
a smaller radius, and in the forward direction one may expect the ν̄e contribution
to the ELN to exceed the νe [20], if there are directions along which the lepton
asymmetry is not too large [22]. In this case, the function G[~v] is negative
in the forward direction, but positive elsewhere, and there is a single crossing.
Hydrodynamic fluctuations of the lepton asymmetry can allow asymmetry to
be small along some direction(s) and ELN crossing(s) could occur [34–36]. As
another example, in the disk of a neutron star merger [33, 38] (or if a quark-
hadron phase transition occurs in a SN [44]) the number density of ν̄e can exceed
that of νe, and all else remaining the same, a ν̄e excess in the radially outward
direction is even more likely. This situation is shown as the top-right schematic
in Fig. 1."
"• Two crossings: If the ν̄e contributions to the ELN exceed the νe in the forward
and backward directions, the function G[~v] is negative in the forward and back-
ward directions, but positive in the directions tangential to the radial direction.
A possible cause of larger ν̄e numbers in the backward direction, in addition to
a forward excess as discussed above, could be that ν̄e have a larger cross sec-
tion to backscatter off nuclei, thus creating a dominantly ν̄e back-flux [34]. This
situation with two crossings is shown as the bottom-left schematic in Fig. 1."
"• Many crossings: If the νe and ν̄e contributions to the ELN are almost equal
but fluctuate independently, perhaps due hydrodynamic waves and instabilities,
one would expect G[~v] to be changing sign frequently as a function of direction.
In this scenario, the ELN has many crossings. This is likely in the convective
layer of a SN [35–37], and perhaps in the early Universe [40]. A schematic of this
situation is shown on the bottom-right in Fig. 1."
2.2.1 True vs. Apparent Dimensionality
"The figures in the schematic in Fig. 1 are best visualized as sections of the corresponding
surfaces in the three-dimensional velocity space. However, studying fast flavor oscil-
lation in three spatial dimensions is numerically challenging. Typically, one assumes
that G[~v] is azimuthally symmetric, i.e., invariant to its rotations in velocity-space
about the radially outward direction (here coinciding with x̂). This is the picture that
has been adopted in almost all studies. Mathematically, this requires dropping vz and
vy everywhere and setting ~v · ~∂ → vx∂x and ~v · ~v ′ → vx v′x in Eq. (2.6). Thus, in most
studies, even when one solves the counterpart of Eq.(2.1) in some lower number of spa-
tial dimensions, say d = 1 assuming azimuthal symmetry about the radially outward
direction, what one has in mind is the higher dimensional version, say with D = 3,"
"and the solution is assumed to be strictly symmetric with respect to the remaining
D − d = 2 components of the velocity, vy and vz. In this approach vx does not have a
unit magnitude, and one only requires |vx| < 1. Although it is prevalent and appealing
as a modeling simplification, it is an uncontrolled approximation. In previous studies
on slow collective oscillations [16–19], it was shown that additional instabilities can
be generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking along the assumed-to-be-symmetric
dimensions."
"In this paper we will consider a neutrino gas in strictly two spatial dimensions, x
and y, with velocities restricted to a two-dimensional plane, i.e., ~v = vxx̂ + vyŷ with
v2x + v"
"2
y = 1. This should not be thought of as a projection of a three dimensional"
"problem on to two dimensions, as described in the paragraph above. In this way, the
velocity vector has a unit length and no instabilities are ignored by fiat. The downside
is that we are solving a two-dimensional toy problem, and it may not be obvious how
it applies to the three-dimensional real-world. Although our calculation in 2+2+1
dimensions is the state-of-the-art, it should really be taken as a step towards more
realistic studies in full 3+3+1 dimensions. Still, this set-up has its merits as discussed
above, and we will find important insights by undertaking this calculation."
2.2.2 ELN Models
"In this strictly two-dimensional approach, the ELNs in the figure are functions of a
single independent variable, say θ, and one writes G[~v] = G[θ], where vx = cos θ and
vy = sin θ. In the remainder of our study, we consider three out of the four zero crossing
scenarios shown in Fig.1. We ignore the case with no crossings because one finds no
instabilities in that case.4 We further simplify our ELNs to be piecewise constant or
sinusoidal, for concreteness, and consider"

of Type II. These choices are made to explore the dependence of the solution on the"
"4One point of semantics before we proceed further: For a three-dimensional but azimuth-symmetric
ELNs these correspond to one closed curve, two closed curves, and many closed curves worth of
crossings. For our strictly two-dimensional ELNs we will continue to call the above ELNs as having
one, two, or many crossings, though strictly speaking they have two, four, and twice as many crossings,
respectively."

2.3 Linear Stability Analysis
"Initially the transverse component of the Bloch vector is small, i.e., S⊥[vx, vy]� 1 [45],
as the neutrinos start out as flavor pure states. We then write its space-time evolution
to linear order as [21, 22]"

2.4 EoM Solver
"We developed our own numerical routines for solving Eq.(2.6). Our approach involves
discretizing the spatial directions into Nx and Ny uniformly spaced bins, resulting in
NxNy number of coupled nonlinear ODEs in time for each momentum mode labeled by
its (vx, vy) pair. A periodic boundary condition in each spatial direction is assumed. We
also discretize the velocity modes in one direction (either vx or vy) into Nvel uniformly
spaced bins, and due to the restriction v = 1 the binning of the velocity modes in
the other direction gets fixed resulting in total of (3× 2) NxNyNvel coupled nonlinear
ODEs. The factor of 3 comes from the three components of the polarization vector
and the factor of 2 comes from the fact that for each choice of vx one has two allowed
choices of vy."

The initial conditions are that all Bloch vectors S[~v] are equal to (0, 0, 1), i.e., a"
"flavor-pure state. Depending on the positive (or negative) sign of G[~v], the polarization
vectors P[~v] = G[~v] S[~v] points along (or opposite to) the vertical in flavor space. For
our chosen set of ELNs, as discussed in Sec. 2.2, this means that the P[~v] start with
one, two, or many crossings5 as a function of θ. Normally Hvacω would start the flavor
evolution by tilting the Bloch vectors away from their initial positions. However, for
our calculations, we have set Hvacω and H"
"mat to zero for numerical convenience, and
instead provide an external perturbation of O(10−6) to both transverse components of

2.5 Dispersion Relation Solver
"To understand the nature of the flavor evolution in the linear regime one needs to
know the behavior of ω as a function of ~k, which we represent by its magnitude k and
argument as β, i.e.,"
"k =
√
k2x + k"
"2
y , (2.21)"
"β = arctan
(
ky

")
. (2.22)"
"This ω[k, β] can only be obtained after solving the transcendental equation described
by Eq.(2.18). This is not easy, even numerically, as one needs to scan over a large
space spanned by (ω, k, β), and brute force root-finding is inefficient."
"To speed up our root-finding, we use the method of iterative solving where we
begin at a known solution (or initial guess) and then use it to propagate the solution
further in (ω, k, β) space. As our initial guess we use the k = 0 solution, ω0, which for
a given ELN can be determined easily from Eq.(2.19). This is simply the zero-mode
solution that was advocated in Ref.[25], and even in the most general case with 3+3+1
dimensions Eq.(2.19) is analytically tractable. Then we define a circular boundary of
radius r, chosen to be sufficiently small and close to k = 0 point in the k − β plane.
Using w0 as our initial guess we numerically solve Eq.(2.18) to calculate ω for different
β directions within the region 0 < k < r in the k−β plane. Then we proceed to a new
point on the boundary defined by r, where we already have a solution, to define another
circle of radius r. At each new point within this new circular region we can start with
previous solution as a starting guess, and find the updated solutions. Note that we
choose r in a way such that the previous guess works reasonably well. Repeating this,
we can find the solution on the entire k − β plane."
"The roots of Eq.(2.18) are obtained by Python’s fsolve package which uses
Powell’s conjugate direction method to find the local minima of a nonlinear equa-
tion. The method requires an initial guess, but does not require differentiability of
the underlying complex function because no derivatives are computed in order to find
the solution. The integrals in Eq.(2.13) are evaluated using the numerical routine for
adaptive quadrature implemented in Python’s quad solver."

"Eq.(3.6) can have complex solutions, in general, leading to the k = 0 mode becoming
unstable for Type I cases. For instance, in our numerical examples with A = 0 (resp.
A = 0.4) the LHS of Eq.(3.7) becomes −1 (resp. −0.6), and thus easily satisfies the
above condition. Once we have the k = 0 solution, ω0, we can compute ω for other
value of ~k using the iterative method described in Sec. 2.5. On the other hand, we can
also numerically simulate Eq. (2.6) to obtain S[~v] as a function of (x, y, t). We then
take spatial Fourier transforms of this solution, and ask how the amplitude of each
~k mode changes with time. For some modes, we find the mode-amplitude increases
exponentially, and we extract the imaginary part of ω(~k) from numerical data. These
two methods give results in excellent agreement, as shown in Fig. 2."
"For Type I ELNs, G[θ] is symmetric between the regions sin θ > 0 and sin θ < 0
or in other words there is a vy → −vy symmetry. This gives rise to a similar symmetry
in the angular variation of Imω with respect to β, i.e., Imω|ky>0 = Imω|ky<0 as can
be seen in the top left panel plot of Fig.2. The radial variation of Imω with respect
to k in the top right plot of Fig.2 clearly shows a much larger growth for the modes
very close to k = 0, and then the growth rate decreases as a function of k for all
β directions. The k = 0 mode being unstable for this case is understood from our
analytical arguments. We find the decrease is much slower along the ky axis, about
which there is a ky → −ky symmetry. Interestingly the position of the Fourier mode
with the maximum linear growth rate is aligned along kx axis, as shown in the black
starred point in top left plot of Fig. 2."
"Even for A 6= 0 a similar kind of ky → −ky symmetry in the angular variation of
Imω is shown in the bottom left plot of Fig. 2. The k = 0 mode is unstable for this"

"case as well. All the results for the radial and angular variation of Imω are similar
to the A = 0 case with only an exception that the overall growth rate as well as the
maximum growth rate decreases for larger (positive) A. This is seen in the bottom
left panel of Fig. 2, where the position of the maximum growth rate is indicated by
different starred points that correspond to specific choices of A, as indicated by the
color code. This effect of non-zero lepton asymmetry also results in a faster decrease
of Imω with larger k, as shown in bottom right plot of Fig. 2."

D[kx,−ky, ω] = D[kx, ky, ω] along with the previous one. These extra symmetries for

– 15 –
"in top-right plot of Fig.3, confirms our analytical claim. Already one finds that having
two crossings leads to less instability in some sense. Interestingly, the radial variation
of Imω for this case shows an approximately Lorentzian shape as a function of k,
i.e., large wavelength or small k modes are inert then the growth rate increases as we
increase k with a maximum around k = 30− 40 and then starts to decrease as a result
very small wavelength or very large k modes again become inert. The Lorentzian is
much wider closer to the β = π/2 direction than at β = 0. The Fourier modes close
to ky (β = π/2) axis have much larger growth rate compared to modes close to kx
(β = 0) for this case. In contrast with the Type I case, the Fourier mode with the
largest growth rate in this case lies along the ky axis (β ="

) about which there is a"

For A 6= 0, the angular variation of Imω shown in the bottom left panel of"
"Fig.3 shows a skewed symmetry. The non-zero value of lepton asymmetry breaks the
symmetry along kx and ky axes keeping the symmetry along the diagonals intact and
also tilts the overall angular distribution towards one of the diagonals. The non-zero
value of A also shifts the position of the Fourier mode with the largest growth rate
from the ky axis to along one of the diagonals. This plot also indicates that the Fourier
modes along β = π/2 have a much larger growth rate compared to modes along β = 0
direction but with an exception that in this case the overall growth of the system is
suppressed compared to zero lepton asymmetry case. The k = 0 mode is stable in this
case also, as shown in bottom right plot of Fig. 3. The same plot also indicates that
Imω as a function of k for specific β direction shows a similar Lorentzian nature but
it is slightly shifted towards k = 0 with lower width compared to A = 0 case. The
diagonal symmetry, the shift in the position of the maximum of Imω and the decrease
in overall growth of the system become more pronounced as we increase the value of
lepton asymmetry."
3.3 Many Crossings
"Type III ELN corresponds to a scenario where, e.g., due to fluctuations of the neutrino
distributions, the angular distributions of νe, νe are rapidly changing as a function of
θ and their difference can go through large number of zero crossings. To mimic this
scenario we considered the Type III G[θ] with m being quite large. We will show how
the maximum growth of such systems depends on the number of zero crossings, closely
related to m. To understand this let us consider Eq.(2.13) in terms of the angular
variable θ and the k − β coordinates,"

by numerically solving the dispersion relation and then locating the maximum of this
solution in the k − β plane. For Type III ELN with A = 0, c1 = 1, c2 = 6, and m in
the range 20− 40 for which the ELN has many zero crossings, this numerical result is
shown as the blue continuous line in Fig. 4. The black dashed line is the best fit of that

"This behavior clearly supports our analytical claim that a large number of crossings
leads to the instability growth being hindered as 1/m. This is of course obtained with
a very particular form of the Type III ELN, which is purely sinusoidal with a single m.
Based on numerical experiments, we conjecture that growth rates with many crossings
should be small in general, all else being equal. Generalizing the above analysis for an
arbitrary ELN, say written using a sine and cosine series in θ, does not seem straight-
forward."
4 Summary
"In this paper we explored, analytically and numerically, how the initial growth of flavor
instabilities of a dense neutrino gas depends on the number of zero crossings in the
ELN. Improving upon previous lower-dimensional studies, this is the first study in 2
(space) + 2 (momentum) + 1 (time) dimensions. We developed our own code that
solves for the flavor evolution of dense neutrinos. We also presented a new strategy to"
– 18 –
"solve the transcendental equations appearing in the dispersion relation for the linear
evolution of such systems. With these new tools we explored the linear behavior by
looking at the different radial and angular distributions of the dispersion relation in
the k − β plane. Our main results are"
"• The symmetries of the Imω in the k − β plane, its radial (i.e., vs. k) and
angular (i.e., vs β) variation, the stability of the k = 0 mode, overall linear
growth and the position of the Fourier mode with the highest growth rate, etc.,
all have an intimate connection with the various symmetries of the neutrino
angular distributions and one can analytically understand them in great detail.
Figs. 2, 3, 4 show the exquisite match between growth rates predicted by linear
stability analysis and fully numerical evaluation of the solutions. This matching
and understanding over a variety of lepton asymmetries, A, shapes of ELNs,
different wavelength k and directions β, shows the extraordinary power of linear
theory and a testament to the fidelity of our numerics."
"• ELNs with large number of zero crossings lead to a relatively smaller growth
rate, essentially decreasing as 1/m where m is the number of crossings. We
speculate that this may be important for many realistic environments where νe
and ν̄e distributions are close to each other and crossings occur in the ELNs due
to noise or fluctuations. It seems that the growth rates for such instabilities will
be relatively suppressed."

A Error Estimate for Numerical Solutions
"In Fig. 5 (left panel), we show the accuracy expected of our calculation. We check if
the length of the polarization vectors remain fixed at unity or not. The error we incur
on this is a lower bound on the error in our calculations. We find that our chosen
discretization, Nx = Ny = 500 and Nv = 64, does as well as finer discretizations,
incurring an error of O(10−10) at t ≈ 2 where the linear growth of the system ends.
Even in the far nonlinear regime, the error remains well under 10−3. For illustration,
here we have chosen a Type II ELNs with nonzero lepton asymmetry."
"In Fig. 5 (right panel), we illustrate the precision to be expected of our numerical
solutions of the equations of motion. We check for convergence by comparing the
length of the spatially averaged version of the polarization vector perpendicular to

other Nx = Ny = 1000. The computations are shown with Nvel = 64. Our results"
