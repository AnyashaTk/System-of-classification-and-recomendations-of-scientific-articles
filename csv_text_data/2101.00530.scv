ABSTRACT
"It has been proposed that spin-polarized cosmic radiation can induce asymmetric changes in helical biopoly-
mers that may account for the emergence of biological homochirality. The parity violation in the weak inter-
action has direct consequences on the transport of polarization in cosmic ray showers. In this paper, we show
that muons retain their polarization down to energies at which they can initiate enantioselective mutagenesis.
Therefore, muons are most likely to succeed in establishing the connection between broken symmetries in
the standard model of particle physics and that found in living organisms. We calculate the radiation doses
deposited by primary and secondary cosmic rays at various prime targets for the searches of life in the solar
system: Mars, Venus, Titan, icy moons and planetesimals, and discuss the implications for the enantioselective
mutagenesis proposed as to be the driver of homochiralization. Earth is unusual in that spin-polarized muons
dominate the cosmic radiation at its surface.

1. INTRODUCTION
"The origin of life is still a puzzle. However, it is a chiral
puzzle: living organisms use only one class of enantiomer
(molecule that has a mirror image) in the construction of pro-
teins and nucleic acids, a fundamental property of life known
as homochirality (see Avnir 2020, for a recent review). Ho-
mochirality allows biopolymers to adopt stable helical struc-
tures (Bada 1995; Nanda et al. 2007), a natural conformation
for biological macromolecules to adopt and one that plays a
key role in fundamental biological processes (Totsingan et al.
2012). While helical biopolymers have not been found, yet,
in extraterrestrial environments, enantiomeric excesses (e.e.)
of a few percent have been reported in the amino acids con-
tent of some meteorites (Pizzarello 2006; Burton & Berger
2018), but their relation to biological homochirality remains
a mystery."
"An important clue pertaining to the emergence of ho-
mochirality comes from studies of low energy, spin-polarized
electrons which can promote enantioselective chemistry
(e.g., Dreiling & Gay 2014; Rosenberg 2019). In addition,
the Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity, CISS, effect shows
that helical biopolymers, specifically double strand DNA and
α-helical peptide, can act as spin filters for sub-eV electrons
(Naaman & Waldeck 2012). This may be related to biolog-
ical function and may play a role in the emergence of ho-
mochirality."
"Cosmic rays, play a major role in generating mutation and
promoting evolution on Earth. They create pions in the upper"
"atmosphere which decay into highly polarized muons which
comprise the most prevalent high energy particles at ground
level. Muons decay into electrons and positrons which are
also polarized. In Globus & Blandford (2020), henceforth
GB20, it was proposed that this polarization could impose
a small chiral preference on the development of one set of
biological enantiomers over the other which could evolve to
homochirality over millions or even billions of generations.
Some mechanisms for expressing this preference were dis-
cussed, supplying a causal connection from a fundamental
physics asymmetry to an equally fundamental asymmetry in
biology."
"There are three stages to this scheme: I. Understanding
cosmic ray polarization in different environments, II. Esti-
mating the chiral preference present in the mutation rate with
a given irradiation and III. Translating this into an influence
on biological evolution. In GB20, the focus was on stage II
and some semi-classical models of the interaction between
cosmic rays and a chiral distribution of electrons in sim-
ple biopolymers were discussed. A quantity called lodacity,
L = µ̂ · v̂, was introduced because it is the cosmic ray mag-
netic moment, µ, not the spin, that mediates this interaction.
The effects were small; larger effects may be exhibited in a
quantum mechanical description. However it was also ar-
gued that the effects could have been sufficient to induce a
enantioselective biological response and establish homochi-
rality during stage III, especially if enantiomeric conflict is
present."
"In this paper, we focus on Stage I. We are most concerned
with cosmic rays on Earth today. However, there are many
quite different environments present within the solar system
and evidence for life could be found here too. Or not. Either
way, it is of considerable interest to understand the evolu-
tion of cosmic ray polarization under different circumstances
and so we also consider Mars, Titan, Venus, icy moons, and
smaller bodies as well as Earth."
"In Section 2, we explain the origin of the asymmetry in
cosmic radiation. In Section 3, we discuss the depolarization
effects for muons and electrons in water, before presenting
the different environments we consider in Section 4, and the
doses in section 5. We discuss the biological implications in
Section 6."
"2. ORIGIN OF POLARIZATION ASYMMETRY IN
SECONDARY COSMIC RADIATION"
"Before discussing the results of detailed shower simula-
tions, it is helpful to outline the development of the cosmic
rays and their polarization from relativistic to the atomic en-
ergies that may be of most interest biologically. The cos-
mic rays observed in the solar system predominantly con-
sist of hydrogen and ionized, typically stable nuclear iso-
topes (see the Particle Data Group (2020) and Gaisser et al.
(2016) for reviews). If the total flux of cosmic ray nuclei is
converted into a flux of nucleons, one finds that only 15%
are neutrons and the rest protons. This charge asymmetry
is conserved in the fluxes of secondary hadrons once pro-
tons interact with matter, since on average more π+ and K+"
"mesons are produced in the projectile fragmentation region.
Hence, particles that emerge from hadronic processes and
reach a “fount” (which we define as a location where trans-
biotic polymers can develop, to distinguish it from a “habi-
tat” where living organisms are well-established) will carry a
net positive charge whereas particles from electromagnetic
cascades have a charge ratio of one above the γ → e+e−"
"threshold. At Earth, today, most particles at ground level are
muons, which are tertiary cosmic rays predominantly pro-
duced through two-body decays of charged pions and kaons,
e.g. π+ → µ+νµ. Since neutrinos are effectively massless,
for our purposes, and produced with left-handed helicity and
in the pion’s rest frame its zero spin is conserved, the muon
is produced fully polarized with the opposite helicity of the
neutrino. These two factors, charge asymmetry and parity vi-
olation of the weak interaction, imply that helicity state and
charge have to be treated separately, resulting in four muon
components µ+L , µ"

minimal energy fraction the muon receives in the pion’s rest
frame is rπ = (mµ/mπ)2 ≈ 0.57, when it is emitted against
the direction of movement, or 1 when it coincides with the
pion’s direction. From this follows that the muon on average
receives 〈x〉 = 1 − rπ/2 ≈ 0.78 of the pion’s energy. The"

electrons together with two additional neutrinos. These also
retain a significant spin polarization and lodacity L, which
we define to be the average of µ̂ · v̂ and is always of the same
sign (GB20)."
3. DEPOLARIZATION EFFECTS
3.1. Muons
"Hadronic cascades produce muons which are subject to
ionization loss and decay into electrons and positrons. With
a vertical atmospheric grammage ∼ 1000 g cm−2 and a scale
height ∼ 10 km, the surface muon particle flux is broad in
energy but peaks at a few GeV. Lower energy muons mostly
lose energy and decay before reaching the ground. Fewer
high energy muons are produced and they are subject to ex-
tra radiative and pair losses."
"For illustration, we consider underwater fate of few GeV
muons and this elucidates what happens in other environ-
ments. Muons lose energy in water though ionization loss
on a timescale"
"tµloss ≡ |dt/d ln T | ∼20 T

G ns; 0.3 . TG . 100,"
"∼6 T 1.2M ps; 0.02 . TM . 300,"
"∼60 fs; 0.1 . Tk . 20 , (2)"
"where the kinetic energy TG,M, k ≡
T/(1 GeV, 1 MeV, 1 keV). Muon decay can be ignored
on these timescales and once they become subrelativistic,
muon ranges decrease ∝ T and so they essentially stop on
the spot."
"We show in Appendix A that, for a particle that slows
through ionization loss, the muon scattering is relatively
unimportant. This implies that muons continue in the same
direction and that they remain polarized because their spins
are much less deflected in encounters than their veloci-
ties. The muon lodacity will decrease according to L ∝
exp(−Kλ), where the “lethargy” λ = sech−1(v/c) and the de-
polarization factor K = 0.037 for muons in water (see Eq. A4
in Appendix A). This implies a lodacity reduction by a fac-
tor of only ∼ 0.83 as the muons cool to a kinetic energy"

different depths are figured by the solid lines; the polarized muons by dashed lines. The fraction of polarized muons is close to unity since they
mostly come from pion decay. In the right panels, the total e+ + e− spectra, i.e. those produced by all lepto-hadronic processes and also from
bremsstrahlung pairs, are shown by solid lines at different depths. The polarized e+ + e− from decay of muons are shown by dashed lines."
Tk ∼ 10.1
"Down to few keV, the depolarization is ignorable. Below
a few keV, there is a significant difference between positive
and negative muons. Positive muons capture electrons with
atomic cross sections (e.g. Kulhar 2004) when their speeds
are comparable with those of valence electrons, Tk ∼ 10, to
form muonium, Mu. This reduces the muon polarization by
by a half (Nagamine 2003). There will be further scatterings
and exchanges, leading to further depolarization as the Mu
thermalizes."
"Negative muons, by contrast, continue to cool through
atomic interactions mostly through excitation as they are too
slow to ionize valence electrons. However, their deflections
remain small and they retain their polarization until they
reach atomic energies, Tk ∼ 0.03. At this point, they form
muonic atoms and rapidly cascade into high energy ground"
"1 The degree of depolarization due to ionization during slowing-down can
also be estimated using a formula given by Akylas & Vogel (1977); they find
that depolarization is negligible."
"states very close to the host nuclei before decaying. The cap-
ture cross section is spin-dependent and may be sensitive to
the chirality M of the molecule (GB20). Modest depolar-
ization will occur within the atom through spin-orbit interac-
tion. For instance, negative muons stopped in carbon retain
about 15% of their initial polarization in the K-shell of spin-
zero nuclei before they decay (Garwin et al. 1957). The de-
excitation cascade to the ground state is accompanied by the
emission of Auger electrons and circularly polarized X-rays
which can also transfer some polarization."
"To summarize, muons retain almost complete polarization
until they form Mu or muonic atoms. They transport polar-
ization efficiently from high to low energies where they can
have a biological impact. This is not the case for the elec-
trons, as we discuss in the next section."
3.2. Electrons
"In Fig. 1, we show the underground fluxes of muons and
the accompanying electrons as a function of depth (in meter
water equivalent), on Earth and on a moon without an atmo-
sphere. While the muons are highly polarized, the electron"
"polarization is negligible. The basic reason is that electrons
scatter faster than they cool (Appendix B). This implies that
polarized electrons made in muon decays in the atmosphere
are rapidly depolarized and do not reach the surface. Elec-
trons produced in muon decays below the surface are also
unimportant."
"However, the muons cool by creating unpolarized, knock-
on electrons, an unavoidable “entourage” of high energy
electrons that must accompany the muons. High-energy
muons (T >> GeV) that dominate at larger depths emit pho-
tons through bremsstrahlung µ± → µ± + γ and initiate elec-
tromagnetic sub-cascades through γ → e+ + e−. These con-
tribute to the “entourage” of unpolarized electrons, hence di-
luting effects induced by the high-energy muon polarization.
A given biological molecule will evolve in the presence of
a spectrum of both particles. While we do not understand
their separate effects, a first step is to estimate their relative
densities. This is discussed more in Appendices B and C."
4. FOUNTS
"Now we have explored the effect of depolarization and di-
lution, we will calculate the polarized radiation doses at vari-
ous environments: Mars, Titan, Venus, and bodies without an
atmosphere (moons, asteroids). We are interested in founts,
that we defined in the introduction as places where trans-
biotic polymers can develop. The search for life in our so-
lar system has been focused on finding water, one of the key
prerequisites for life as we know it, in the form of subsurface
lakes or oceans. In some environments, geologic and hydro-
logic activity could have enabled physical processes neces-
sary for the growth of the first helical biopolymers (see Cam-
prubı́ et al. 2019, for a review)."
4.1. Worlds with a thin or negligible atmosphere
"Mars is a frozen world punctuated by periods of hydro-
logic activity (Cabrol 2018). Recently, a 20-km-wide lake
of liquid water has been detected underneath solid ice in
the Planum Australe region, at approximately 1.5 kilometer
depth (Orosei et al. 2018). Although there is still no evidence
for life on Mars, the red planet has once deployed environ-
ments characteristics of wet-dry cycling, a process thought
to have enabled the production of the first helical biopoly-
mers (Ross & Deamer 2016); the Mars Exploration Rover
Spirit reported 3.65-billion-year-old hot spring deposits, ap-
proximatively of the same age as the Dresser hot springs on
Earth that showed evidence for microbial life (Van Kranen-
donk et al. 2017; Damer & Deamer 2020). If microbial life
started in similar hot springs, it is likely that after Mars’ ge-
ological death and the loss of its atmosphere, microbial life
would have only be able to survive underground, since Mar-
tian subsurface seems to have the key ingredients to support
life for hundreds of millions of years (Michalski et al. 2018;
Checinska Sielaff & Smith 2019)."
Life on Mars could have originated when its atmosphere
"was much denser than today and comparable to the current
Earth’s atmosphere. In consequence, the radiation dose and
spectrum penetrating to the surface are likely to be quite dif-
ferent for Noachian and present-day Mars as discussed by
Lingam et al. (2018). Mars magnetic field could have been
larger in the Noachian (Mittelholz et al. 2018) but this would
not affect the muon polarization (GB20). As for the possible
(intermittent) variations in the cosmic ray flux, we consider
them in Section 5."
"Evidence has accumulated that subsurface liquid regions
(lakes or oceans) exist beneath the surface of the icy moon
of Jupiter, Europa, and the icy moon of Saturn, Enceladus
(Thomas et al. 2016). Mass spectrometers aboard the Cassini
spacecraft found that the plumes of Enceladus contain water,
salts, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and small and large organic
molecules, suggesting that Enceladus’ ocean may entertain
an organic chemistry (Khawaja et al. 2019). In these environ-
ments, the atmosphere is negligible or absent (as in asteroids,
comets or meteroids). Like on Mars, we will see that in these
worlds where the atmosphere is absent, the spin-polarization
transport is different than on Earth."
4.2. Worlds with a very dense atmosphere
"We also consider worlds with atmospheres denser than the
present Earth. Titan, Enceladus and Europa are among the
most geologically active worlds in our solar system but in
contrast to Enceladus and Europa, Titan possess a very dense
atmosphere. The essential chemical building blocks for life
are present in Titan’s atmosphere (Yung et al. 1984). Titan is
also thought to have a subsurface ocean of water (Iess et al.
2012)2. For Venus, the habitable region lies in the upper at-
mosphere (Morowitz & Sagan 1967)."
5. POLARIZED RADIATION DOSES
"The current absorbed dose rates from cosmic radiation in
different environments, are presented in Figure 2. It is an
interesting coincidence that for Earth, at ground, 85% of ion-
izing cosmic radiation is due to the polarized muonic com-
ponent that increases to almost 100% two meter water equiv-
alent (m.w.e.) below the surface."
"In other bodies of the solar system, the presence or ab-
sence of atmosphere leads to different results. For Mars
(middle panel of Fig. 2), cosmic rays are only slightly at-
tenuated by the thin Martian atmosphere and the polarized
muons become the dominant source of cosmic radiation at
∼ 10 m.w.e. with a dose of ∼ 0.01 mGy/yr, much lower
than the 0.2 mGy/yr on Earth. For planetesimals without
an atmosphere or smaller bodies of the solar system (bot-"
"2 It is possible that major impacts on a moon like Titan, Europa or Ence-
ladus could expel large, icy fragments with liquid, life-containing interiors
(or even surface oceans) into interplanetary space. Absent a heating source,
the water would soon freeze, fossilizing its contents. It is surely of long-term
interest to locate, visit and examine such bodies (Dyson 1997)."

"Figure 3. Dilution of polarized radiation by electronic entourage at
deep undergrounds. This figure extends the case of a ”large” plan-
etesimal from the bottom right panel of Figure 2. The depths of
several km.w.e. are more representative environments found in (for
example) Enceladus’ crust. At greater depths low energy muons
have stopped or decayed, and those which survive have increas-
ingly higher 〈Eµ〉 � GeV, as illustrated in middle panel. High-
energy muons lose energy predominantly by emitting high-energy
bremsstrahlung rather than through ionization. These gamma rays
convert into pairs that join the electronic “entourage”."
"tom right panel of Fig. 2), the polarized muons component
dominates at ∼ 15 m.w.e. and with only one tenth of the in-
tensity. In a dense, solid medium, the interaction length is
much shorter than the decay length, leading predominantly
to (re-)interaction of unstable hadrons rather than their de-
cay. This suppresses the production of high energy muons
and leads a swiftly decreasing polarized muon component as
a function of depth."
"In Titan and Venus, polarized muons dominate the radia-
tion at altitudes 40, 50 km. The surface irradiation, compara-
ble to that below ∼ 400 m of rock is negligible."
"Figure 3 demonstrates that the dose deposition in a large
icy body at km.w.e. depths is many orders of magnitude fee-
bler compared to the scenarios that we study at a few m.w.e.
The fraction of the polarised dose drops due to two effects:
1) kilometer depths are reached predominantly by the higher-
energy, unpolarized, prompt muons (Fedynitch et al. 2019),
i.e. from decays of unflavored mesons and heavy charmed
hadrons, or from electromagnetic pair production; 2) the av-
erage muon energy grows because low energy muons stop
or decay at shallower depths. The stopping power of high-"
"energy muons become increasingly radiative, which deposits
energy into the unpolarized electromagnetic entourage via
bremsstrahlung."
"The terrestrial polarized muonic dose has a maximum of
∼ 0.2 mGy/yr at the current epoch at ground level, but could
have been larger during the Hadean period where a young
sun could have accelerated cosmic rays beyond ∼ 10 GeV.
If the cutoff of stellar cosmic rays arises below that energy
(Stellar proton events (SPEs) or a young T Tauri cosmic ray
spectrum as modeled by Padovani et al. (2018), this would
only change the radiation dose by a factor ∼ 2, as we show
in Fig. 4. All environments harbor other natural sources of
radiation that may exceed the dose deposited by cosmic rays.
About 3.5 billion years ago, life was likely exposed to a back-
ground radiation field of ∼ 6 mGy/yr (Karam & Leslie 1999).
However, more energetic transient events such a nearby su-
pernova could increase the doses due to cosmic muons up
to ∼ 100 mGy/yr at ground level.We show in Fig. 4 the ab-
sorbed dose at Earth 100yrs after the explosion of a nearby
supernova (Melott et al. 2017) compared to the actual doses.
Since the muons retain their lodacity, higher radiation doses
from cosmic muons could have altered enantioselectively the
evolutionary trajectories in shorter timescales due to higher
mutation rates. The closest supernova explosion over the
age of the Earth was roughly ∼ 5 − 10 pc away (e.g. El-
lis & Schramm 1995). The prompt electromagnetic (UV, X-
ray, γ-ray) radiation could have had serious biological effects
but would not be significantly chiral. By contrast, the pulse
of freshly-accelerated cosmic rays is chiral and should have
delivered a fluence ∼ 10 − 100 MJ m−2 over several thou-
sand years, overwhelming the defenses presented by the solar
wind, the magnetosphere and the atmosphere. For compari-
son, this is ∼ 104 − 105 times the fluence associated with a
giant, ”Carrington”-strength solar flare, albeit delivered over
a much longer timescale. Activity associated with the nu-
cleus of our Galaxy, including tidal disruption events (Pacetti
et al. 2020), might also be biologically consequential. It is
therefore possible, though far from assured, that life was ini-
tiated, not terminated, by such cataclysmic events."
6. DISCUSSION
"So far, scenarios for the emergence of biological homochi-
rality involved two processes. The first one is the generation
of an initial enantiomeric excess (e.e.) in biologically rele-
vant but still simple chiral monomers, such as amino acids
or sugars. Various ways to achieve an initial e.e. have been
proposed: parity-violating energy differences at the molec-
ular level (Szabó-Nagy & Keszthelyi 1999, and references
therein), asymmetric destruction due to irradiation by beta
particles in radioactive decay (Vester et al. 1959), differential
absorption of circularly polarized light (D’hendecourt et al.
2019), asymmetric adsorption on chiral mineral surfaces like
clays (Hazen et al. 2001). Because the resulting enantiomeric
excesses are very small (only up to few percent, see review"

years after explosion at 50pc (Melott et al. 2017). Despite the high proton densities assumed in the Taurosphere, the impact on the underground
fluxes is negligible since most protons have energies below the particle production threshold and hence do not produce additional muons. In the
nearby supernova scenario the upper edge represents case A from Melott et al. (2017) and the lower case B, respectively. Shown is the maximal
fluxes expected 100 years after explosion that drop significantly within a few kyr."

up to 99.5% (Soai et al. 2000) but the validity of such chem-
ical processes in natural environments is still debated."
"In contrast, the scenario proposed by GB20 only involves
enantioselective mutagenesis, for which the timescale de-
pends on the mutation rates of the first trans-biotic polymers
and the magnitude of the bias. In order for the particular
enantiomeric choice observed in living systems on Earth to
be causally related to the choice expressed by the weak inter-
action and mediated by cosmic rays, we argued in GB20 that
there needs to be a coupling between the lodacity, L, of the
cosmic rays and the molecular chirality,M, of the molecular
structure. The mutation rate has to include a term propor-
tional to the product of these two pseudoscalars. The pos-
sibilities include an electromagnetic interaction in which the
scalar product of the electric and magnetic dipoles or, equiv-
alently E · B had a preferred sign. There is no good reason
for this to occur in an isolated atom. However, it is just what
is expected in a segment of a helical molecule containing a
conduction or a magnetization current. In this case < E ·B >
is negative (positive) for a right- (left-) handed helix, inde-
pendent of the polarity."
"We conclude with two thoughts. Firstly, Earth is the only
body in the solar system with an atmosphere just the right
density and scale height to ensure that muons dominate the
cosmic radiation at ground level and for ∼ 10 m.w.e. under-
ground. It is thick enough to stop the other constituents, thin
enough for the muons to survive. For worlds with thin or neg-
ligible atmosphere, such as Mars, polarized muons are the
dominant source of cosmic radiation at depths of 10 m.w.e.
while for worlds with dense atmospheres, like Venus or Ti-
tan, muons dominate below ∼40 km altitude but the radiation"
"doses are negligible at the surface. Now, muons are the one
constituent of cosmic radiation that is created with and re-
tains high polarization as it decelerates to speeds . αc when
it can promote mutation of trans-biotic biopolymers. Might
this be connected with the fact that Earth is the only body
known to harbor life? However, we know that Mars, Venus,
and Earth have undergone significant evolution. Early in the
Solar system’s history, Mars probably had an atmosphere of
0.5-1 bar (Lingam et al. 2018) and Venus may have possessed
an atmosphere of ∼1 bar until a Gyr ago or so (e.g. Way et al.
2016). However, if life originated in the early solar system,
conditions could have been different from those we experi-
ence today. Therefore the special character of Earth’s atmo-
sphere might be more relevant to life’s development than to
its origin."
"The second thought is that the relative importance of the
muons and their electronic entourage for mutation is not un-
derstood. In GB20, ionization was taken as a proxy for mu-
tation. If this is the case, then collisional ionization by elec-
trons is probably more frequent than muon capture, dilut-
ing the chiral effect of the cosmic rays. Muons have ad-
vantages of better depth-dose distributions. However, even
ionization may be reparable and not so conducive to genetic
alteration. There could be an appreciable chiral contribution
to the Hamiltonian for the formation of a muonic atom or
Mu in a helical molecule. The fact that negative muons re-
tain their polarization down to the energies where they can
undergo a spin dependent capture, may also have an effect
on enantioselective mutagenesis. A single muonic atom de-
cay will produce polarized X-rays and Michel electrons3 and"
"3 Michel electrons have a well known energy distribution with a sharp
peak at 52.83 MeV and an asymmetric angular distribution if the parent"
"will surely fracture the molecule. Even the pickup of an elec-
tron in Mu formation could be quite disruptive. Perhaps it is
muons, not electrons, that dominate mutation of trans-biotic
biopolymers, thereby increasing the chiral transfer and accel-
erating evolution to homochirality."
"These matters and the prospect of performing experimental
investigations will be discussed in a future paper."

A. SCATTERING AND IONIZATION LOSS

ionization of electrons and can be approximated by"

")2
ln Λ"
"Zi, (A1)"
"where v is the speed, the sum is over all the atomic numbers Zi of the nuclei in the molecule and Λ is the ratio of the maximum
to the minimum impact parameter given roughly by 2p2/meI, where p is the momentum and I is a mean ionization potential. As
the energy loss is dominated by distant encounters, the energy fluctuations are small and the kinetic energy can be regarded as
function of time."
"Nuclear recoils do not contribute to the stopping power but they dominate the scattering. Consider a cosmic ray with momentum
p making an angle θ with the direction of its magnetic moment, µ̂ which we can regard as fixed in space. The mean square rate
of change of the transverse momentum by nuclear and electron collisions can be similarly expressed as〈"
"d < ∆p2 >

Now, the lodacity, L ≡< cos θ >=< µ̂ · p > /p, and if we average over azimuth in the scattering, we find that ∆ ln < L >= − <
∆p2 > /2p2. Again the fluctuations will be small and can be ignored."
It is helpful to introduce a quantity

which we call the “lethargy” for a cosmic ray with rest mass m. We can then combine these three equations to obtain

and so, L = L0 exp(−Kλ) = L0(T/pc)K , where K is the depolarization factor. For cosmic ray muons, electrons in water,
K ∼ 0.037, 7.6."
B. KNOCK-ON ELECTRONS FROM COSMIC RAY MUONS UNDER WATER
"Consider, as a specific example, muons incident upon the surface of the ocean on Earth. We have argued that muons decelerate
through ionization loss while retaining most of their initial lodacity. For the energies that dominate the particle flux at the surface
of the earth, ∼ 1 − 10 GeV, they stop at a depth of tens of meters before they decay. When they become non-relativistic, their
range scales ∝ T 2. After they cool, they will be captured on atoms, (µ−), or capture an electron, (µ+). By contrast, electrons
scatter before they decelerate. Polarized electrons created through muon decay are rapidly depolarized and are unimportant
compared with the knock-on electrons which will cool and thermalize on the spot by creating more knock-on electrons, forming
an unpolarized “entourage”, accompanying the muons."
"The polarized muons and the unpolarized electrons will compete in creating mutations of trans-biotic molecules, diluting the
chiral transfer. In order to quantify this effect, we first consider a fixed number density high energy muons crossing a volume
that is large enough to allow the knock-on electrons to cool locally and small enough for the muons not to cool in traversing
it. Introduce a conserved number current in energy space of high energy muons Iµ, the number of particles cooling through a
kinetic energy T per unit volume and time. Let this be established at some moderately relativistic energy TCR ∼ 3 GeV. Next,
approximate the rate per unit volume, S µ e(T ′; T ), at which a muon, with kinetic energy T , produces electrons with kinetic energy
T ′ < T lying in dT ′. Now,"
"∫ T
dT ′T ′S µ e(T ′; T ) ∼ T/tµloss(T ) c.f. Eq. (1). Likewise we introduce the current of electrons in energy"
"space Ie(T ), with
∫ T"
"dT ′T ′S e e(T ′; T ) ∼ T/teloss(T ). I
e(T ) satisfies"
"T ′
[S e e(T ; T ′)teloss(T"
"′)Ie(T ′) + S µ e(T ; T ′)tµloss(T
′)Iµ] = 0. (B5)"
Next multiply Eq. B5 by T and integrate over dT . We find the approximate solution
Ie(T )T ∼ IµTCR (B6)
"In other words, the knock-on electron energy current in energy space at low energy is roughly the same as the energy current
for the muons at high energy."
"In this paper we are most interested in the muon and electrons spectra which can then contribute to the biological evolution
of trans-biotic polymers and introduce a chiral bias. Many processes contribute to the full picture as we shall discuss elsewhere.
For the moment, as an example, let us consider ∼ 10 keV electrons which are known to induce mutation in DNA. These are
produced by muons with energy T & 1 MeV. As the energy current in muons with energy ∼ 3 GeV is roughly the same as
the energy flowing through ∼ 10 keV as electrons, we can conclude that the number current of ∼ 10 keV electrons is roughly
3 GeV/10 keV ∼ 3 × 105 times the conserved number current of muons. The implications of this for biological processes then
depend on combining these rates with the relevant cross-sections."
C. COMPUTATION OF PARTICLE FLUXES
"We compute differential particle fluxes Φ(E, X), where E is the kinetic energy and X(h) =
∫
∞"
"h
d` ρ(`) is the slant depth in g/cm2,"
"using the one-dimensional cascade equation solver MCEq4 (Fedynitch et al. 2015) that is optimized for calculations of inclusive
atmospheric lepton fluxes at high energies above a few GeV (Fedynitch et al. 2019). We have extend the kinetic energy range
down to 10 MeV and for computations in different media, such as carbon-dioxide and water by using hadronic cross sections
and particle production tables from the DPMJET-III-19.15 event generator (Roesler et al. 2001). Electromagnetic cross sections
have been computed using the numerical routines from Meighen-Berger & Li (2019). Ionization losses 〈dE/dX〉 are based on
tables from (Particle Data Group 2020; Berger et al. 2017) and are tracked for each charged particle whereas energy deposition by
tertiary electromagnetic cascades from fast neutrons are neglected. MCEq adapts the notation and formulae for muon polarization
in the relativistic approximation from Lipari (1993) that we verified to be valid for Ekin,µ > 10 MeV."
"The flux of cosmic rays in the solar system is considered to be isotropic and represented by the Global Spline Fit (GSF)
(Dembinski et al. 2017), which is an modern parameterization of cosmic ray fluxes at Earth between rigidity of a few GV and the
highest observed energies at Earth. The rigidity cutoff due to the planetary magnetic field, the location within the solar system
and the Sun’s level of activity affects the low energy cosmic rays below a few GV/nucleon. The omission of magnetic fields and
solar modulation is considered as a source of uncertainty of this calculation but is not expected to qualitatively change the result,
in particular not at larger depths or underground."
The absorbed dose rate D in Gy/s is calculated from the differential fluxes Φ with the default units (GeV cm2 s sr)−1 using
"D(X) = 2π
∑"
"∫ 1
cos θmax"
"d cos θ
∫"
"dEp Φp(Ep, X)
〈"
"dEp
dX"
"〉
(Ep),"
"where θmax = max(π/2, π−arcsin (R/(R + h)), h the altitude above ground and R the radius of the planet. The index p iterates over
particle species. The expression for cos θmax takes into account that at higher altitudes, particle cascades can develop upwards
relative to the horizon."
"The models of the planetary atmospheres are the Standard Atmosphere (1976) for Earth, derived from Huygens Atmospheric
Structure Instrument measurements for Titan (Fulchignoni et al. 2005), from the Soviet VeGa-2 probe (Linkin et al. 1986; Lebon-
nois & Schubert 2017) for Venus, and from a fit of piece-wise barometric formulae to Mars Global Surveyor data Underground
fluxes are computed for a water target with the ionization loss computed computed with ESTAR and PSTAR (Berger et al. 2017).
Within the precision of this calculation and depths < 1 km, the difference in stopping power compared to a dedicated calculation
in standard rock is negligible for muons."
"In Figs. C1 and C2 MCEq is compared with FLUKA 4.06 (Battistoni et al. 2015) simulations in water for 1 TeV proton projec-
tiles. The technical low energy cutoff in MCEq is 10 MeV, which is sufficient to capture a good description for the total number
of muons (blue curve in Fig. C1 and right panel of Fig. C2). At tens of meters in depth, the differences between codes become
more pronounced since the particle cascade is increasingly affected by multiple subsequent interactions that amplify differences
in production and absorption cross sections between the models. To simulate water targets with MCEq it was necessary to include
ionization losses for all charged particles and obtain inelastic cross sections for water from the hadronic interaction models. None
the less the agreement is remarkably good since MCEq has not yet been employed for simulations down to low energies and
water targets. For electrons, simulated using MCEq and electromagnetic cross sections from Meighen-Berger & Li (2019), the
agreement is good except at around the cascade maximum. Since the majority of electromagnetic energy is of hadronic origin
through the π0 → γγ process, the hadronic model differences between DPMJET-III-19.1 and PEANUT/FLUKA have impact. An
estimate for the fraction of electrons that are lost due to the 10 MeV cutoff in MCEq can be made from the comparison between"

vs PEANUT in FLUKA. The hadronic model also affects the electromagnetic cascades, but differences at energies below 100 MeV may arise
from incomplete partially the case For electromagnetic cascades the differences are partly related to, For very low energy muons, MCEq tends
to predict lower fluxes than FLUKA. This is likely related to using DPMJET-III at energies close to particle production threshold, where it is
known to be incomplete."
"the pale and dark red triangles in Fig. C1. Since the gradient of the electromagnetic component is very steep after the maximum,
the differences between MCEq and FLUKA do not qualitatively alter our conclusions from the main text with respect to the depth
at which polarized muons constitute the dominant source of cosmic radiation."
