"ABSTRACT
At high redshift, the cosmic web is widely expected to have a significant impact on the mor-
phologies, dynamics and star formation rates of the galaxies embedded within it, underscoring
the need for a comprehensive study of the properties of such a filamentary network. With this
goal in mind, we perform an analysis of high-𝑧 gas and dark matter (DM) filaments around
a Milky Way-like progenitor simulated with the ramses adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
code from cosmic scales (∼1 Mpc) down to the virial radius of its DM halo host (∼20 kpc
at 𝑧 = 4). Radial density profiles of both gas and DM filaments are found to have the same
functional form, namely a plummer-like profile modified to take into account the wall within
which these filaments are embedded. Measurements of the typical filament core radius 𝑟0 from
the simulation are consistent with that of isothermal cylinders in hydrostatic equilibrium. Such
an analytic model also predicts a redshift evolution for the core radius of filaments in fair
agreement with the measured value for DM (𝑟0 ∝ (1 + 𝑧)−3.18±0.28). Gas filament cores grow
as (𝑟0 ∝ (1 + 𝑧)−2.72±0.26). In both gas and DM, temperature and vorticity sharply drop at the
edge of filaments, providing an excellent way to constrain the outer filament radius. When
feedback is included the gas temperature and vorticity fields are strongly perturbed, hindering
such a measurement in the vicinity of the galaxy. However, the core radius of the filaments as
measured from the gas density field is largely unaffected by feedback, and the median central
density is only reduced by about 20%."

1 INTRODUCTION
"Galactic surveys have revealed the presence of anisotropic structure
on scales ofMpc,made up of nodes, voids, sheets and filaments (e.g.
Davis et al. 1982; de Lapparent et al. 1986; Geller & Huchra 1989).
Cosmological simulations are able to reproduce this network, the
so-called cosmic web (Bond et al. 1996; Pogosyan et al. 1998), and
unveil its existence not just for the distribution of galaxies but also
for the underlying gas and DM density, as a consequence of the hi-
erarchical growth of structures in ΛCDM. Gravity amplifies small
anisotropies, resulting in a near homogenous background collapsing
to form sheets which can collapse again along another axis to form
filaments. Halos form at filament intersections where, according to
cosmological hydrodynamics simulations, galaxies at high redshift
grow in mass and angular momentum primarily by material trans-
ported along these filaments (Birnboim & Dekel 2003; Kereš et al."

Stewart et al. 2013)."
"While at large scale gas filaments closely follow the structure
of their DM counterparts in the cosmic web, at the scale of halos
they can penetrate deep into the virial radius and even connect to
galactic disks triggering star formation episodes (see e.g. Katz et al.
2003; Kereš et al. 2005; Woods et al. 2014; Stewart et al. 2017).
The erosion of these small-scale gas filaments at lower redshifts is
argued to be at least partly responsible for the bimodal distribution
in colour, star formation rates and morphology of galaxies (Dekel
& Birnboim 2006) (though quenching of the largest galaxies are
dependent on AGN feedback, see e.g. Croton et al. (2006)). Other
implicit evidence for the presence of inflows is the presence of
low metallicity G-dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood, as established
in the seminal work of van den Bergh (1962). As gas depletion
timescales are estimated to be on the order of a few Gyrs for local
disk galaxies (e.g. Bigiel et al. 2011; Leroy et al. 2013; Rahman et al.
2012), replenishment by inflow of pristine gas is required to match
the observations. This finding is also supported by observations"

"of extended gas disks around galaxies (co-rotating with the stellar
disk), either directly in emission (e.g. from Lyman-𝛼, Prescott et al.
2015) or indirectly in absorption (e.g. from galaxy-quasar pairs,
as studied in Zabl et al. 2019; Ho & Martin 2019), all suggesting
filamentary accretion from the cosmic web."
"Rather than directly pursuing the filament properties them-
selves, it is possible to infer them through indirect methods. On
large-scales, many authors have measured halo or galaxy spin align-
ment with cosmic filaments both in simulations (see e.g. Aragón-
Calvo et al. 2007; Codis et al. 2012; Dubois et al. 2014; Laigle et al.
2015; Ganeshaiah Veena et al. 2018; Kraljic et al. 2019) and low-𝑧
spectroscopic observations (e.g. Tempel & Libeskind 2013; Chen
et al. 2019; Krolewski et al. 2019, among others). These results
highlight a redshift and mass dependence of the alignment signal,
with halos with masses above 𝑀h > 1012M� displaying spins per-
pendicularly oriented with respect to the nearest filament, whereas
spins of halos with masses below 𝑀h < 1012M� align with the
nearest filament. At low masses this is thought to be due to accre-
tion of vorticity rich gas that drive spins to align with the filament.
At high masses this behaviour is overcome by mergers, or as Laigle
et al. (2015) argues, the accretion of material from multiple vortic-
ity domains. This dichotomy in galaxy spins shows the profound
impact of cosmic filaments on the galaxies embedded within them.
The inverse problem has also been studied (Pandya et al. 2019) at-
tempting to use the alignment of galaxies to detect the cosmic web
with the CANDELS survey (Grogin et al. 2011; Koekemoer et al.
2011). The non-detection of the alignment signal is likely due to
the number of prolate galaxies with spectroscopically determined
redshifts with stellar masses 9 < log(M∗/M�) < 10 in the survey,
as well as these galaxies’ nearest neighbours. ."
"On smaller scales, the misalignment of gas and DM angular
momenta in simulations has been attributed to different redistri-
bution processes during halo virialisation (e.g. Kimm et al. 2011;
Stewart et al. 2013). However, it has also been argued that instabili-
ties within the filaments could develop, leading to their fragmenta-
tion and breakup, thereby preventing cold gas from being smoothly
accreted by the host galaxy. In such a scenario, the angular mo-
mentum segregation between DM and gas could be construed as an
artefact of poor numerical resolution in filaments. Several authors
(Freundlich et al. 2014; Mandelker et al. 2016; Padnos et al. 2018;
Mandelker et al. 2019; Berlok & Pfrommer 2019) carried out ide-
alised simulations of filaments entering a halo, and concluded that
they should be stable, given their width and velocity. Cornuault et al.
(2018) used a phenomenological model of a gas stream to explore
the possibility of a turbulent, multi-phase filament. The accretion ef-
ficiency of such a filament would be reduced, but it remains unclear
as to whether such a multi-phase model constitutes an acceptable
description of cosmological filaments. Using a cosmological zoom
simulation tailored to achieve maximum resolution in the filaments,
Rosdahl & Blaizot (2012) find that they remain stable within halos
with masses of up to a few 1011M� at least as to low as 𝑧 = 3,
whilst they show more disruption within halos of larger masses (in
line with arguments made in Birnboim & Dekel 2003)."
"Ultimately, to distinguish between these scenarios and better
assess the role played by filaments on galaxy evolution, quantitative
direct measurements of their properties need to be made. How-
ever, these have proven notoriously elusive so far (see e.g. Kimm
et al. 2011, for a more detailed discussion). Indeed, direct obser-
vations of the distant cosmic web suffer from the steep scaling of
surface brightness with redshift, which makes the cold filaments
extremely hard to detect in emission (though not impossible, see
e.g. Giavalisco et al. 2011; Ribaudo et al. 2011; Kacprzak et al."
"2012; Martin et al. 2016; Gallego et al. 2018; Elias et al. 2020), and
thus rely on stacking, or back-lighting by a bright source. Future
surveys using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) (Gardner
et al. 2006) while being insensitive to the smoothly accreting gas
itself, the telescope will be sensitive to a range of associated phe-
nomena. Filaments are typically traced by Lyman-𝛼 blobs (LABs)
and emitters (LAEs) (e.g. Kikuta et al. 2019; Umehata et al. 2019),
which will be observable by the NIRspec instrument (Latif et al.
2011). In addition, LAEs should be detectable with the proposed
BlueMUSE instrument. On larger scales, filamentary gas can be
detected in the radio with the Square Kilometer Array (Kooistra
et al. 2019). Lyman-𝛼 forest tomography also allows the probing of
the cosmic web in the IGM, with the feasibility of observations for
the Very Large Telescope investigated by (Lee et al. 2014) and the
European Extremely Large Telescope by (Japelj et al. 2019). This
will enable the detection and exploration of the full 3 dimensional
structure of the cosmic web."
"Efforts to understand observed filament properties are corre-
spondingly mirrored by simulations (e.g. Gheller et al. 2015, 2016).
On large scales, filaments of the cosmic web are reported to have
a radial power law profile in density with a power law index com-
prised between -1 and -2 (see e.g. Colberg et al. 2005; Dolag et al.
2006; Aragón-Calvo et al. 2010). Smaller scale studies have been
performed by e.g. Ocvirk et al. (2016), who determined the outer
radii of filaments in their simulation to be about 50ℎ−1kpc at 𝑧 = 4.3
by looking at the separation between temperature peaks caused by
the accretion shock, although these authors acknowledge that they
did not separate edge-on sheets from filaments in their sample. Us-
ing cosmological simulations, Dekel et al. (2009) found that DM
filament radii are comparable to the virial radius of the halos they
connect, and that the cold gas streams residing within the halos are
considerably narrower, typically a few percent of the virial radius.
The scale free nature of CDM results in progressively smaller fila-
ments feeding into larger ones at all scales, down to the numerical
resolution of the simulation in this case. However, alternative DM
theories could result in different DM structures, (e.g. Warm DM
Gao & Theuns 2007). This produces filaments down to Mpc-scales,
while erasing smaller scale structure. Mocz et al. (2019) studied
filaments under the Fuzzy DM regime, where an additional quan-
tum pressure prevents the formation of lower mass filaments. Both
WDM and FDM result in higher density filaments at earlier times,
with the formation of population III occurring within them (Mocz
et al. 2019), further distinguishing these versions of DM fromCDM.
It is possible that the supernovae of these stars will be detectable
with JWST (Hartwig et al. 2018)."
"To date, the rich complexity of the filamentary network con-
necting halos of various masses and its evolution with redshift has
yet to be investigated systematically. In this paper we argue that
to do so, it is pivotal to work on a cosmological sample of well-
resolved filaments and take a step in this direction by measuring
filament profiles from the density, vorticity, and temperature field
information available in a zoom-in cosmological simulation. Our
focus is on intermediate-scale filaments, that is, those connecting to
a M★ galaxy, at moderate to high redshift (𝑧 ≥ 3). We also inves-
tigate how stellar feedback can perturb these filaments. Given the
limited sample considered in this work, it should be considered a
pilot study. In an upcoming paper, the methods developed here will
be applied to New-Horizon, a larger volume simulation (∼ 4200
(Mpc/h)3) with similar resolution (Park et al. 2019, Dubois et al.
in prep), where a statistical sample of filaments can be obtained,
connecting a more diverse ensemble of galaxies."

2 NUMERICAL METHODS
2.1 Simulations
"The analysis is performed on two simulations of the nut suite (Pow-
ell et al. 2011), a series of cosmological zoom-in simulations of a
Milky Way like galaxy designed to study the effects of resolution
and various physical processes on its formation and evolution us-
ing the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) code ramses (Teyssier
2002). Initial conditions are generated at redshift 𝑧 = 499 using the
MPGrafic code (Prunet et al. 2008) with cosmological parameters
set in accordance with the WMAP5 results (Dunkley et al. 2009).
The simulation volume is a cubic box 9ℎ−1Mpc on a side and a
coarse root grid of 1283 cells. A series of three nested grids are then
centred on a sphere with radius 2.7ℎ−1Mpc which encompasses the
Lagrangian volume occupied by the galaxy (host dark matter halo
mass of 𝑀vir = 5 × 1011M� by 𝑧 = 0). AMR refinement is then
enabled within that sphere using a quasi-Lagrangian refinement cri-
terion to achieve a maximal spatial resolution of 10pc at all times
whilst forcing the mass of each individual cell to remain roughly
constant. The collisionless fluid in this high resolution region con-
sists of dark matter (DM) particles each with mass 5.6 × 104𝑀� ,
whereas the gas evolution equations are solved on the AMR grid
by means of a Godunov method (HLLC Riemann solver) with a
MinMod limiter to reconstruct variables at cell interfaces. The gas
density field in the simulation is shown in Fig. 1 at 𝑧 = 4, gradually
zooming in from the full box onto the central galaxy itself."
"In this paper, we use a nut simulation with no feedback, and
one with mechanical supernova feedback as defined in Kimm et al.
(2015). In the following,we refer to these two simulations as the “no-
feedback"" and “feedback"" runs respectively. The feedback recipe of
Kimm et al. (2015) ensures that the appropriate energy or momen-
tum is deposited into the cells around the supernova, depending on
whether the Sedov-Taylor phase of the blast wave is resolved or not.
This prevents the supernova energy from being artificially radiated
away, as would happen if solely thermal energy was injected (the
so called over-cooling problem described in Katz 1992). Both runs
under study use cooling tables calculated by Sutherland & Dopita
(1993), down to 104 K, and the Rosen & Bregman (1995) approxi-
mation for temperatures below this threshold. A UV background is"

region of the computational domain at 𝑧 = 4, with each colour representing
a different resolution level as indicated on the figure. At this redshift, the
filament is uniformely sampled at 1.2 kpc resolution (AMR level 11: green)
and partly at 0.61 kpc (AMR level 12: yellow) around the most massive
halos embedded in it. Even though the highest spatial resolution reached in
the simulation is 10 pc, which corresponds to AMR level 20, levels above
13 are not shown as they are confined to the galaxies themselves and their
immediate vicinity."
"instantaneously turned on at 𝑧 = 8.5 to account for the re-ionisation
of the Universe, while star formation is allowed to proceed when
gas densities become greater than 4×102H.cm−3 with an efficiency
of 1% per free-fall time, calibrated on observations by Kennicutt
(1998). A detailed description of the implementation of star for-
mation used in this version of ramses may be found in Rasera &
Teyssier (2006) and Dubois & Teyssier (2008). For the feedback
run, a Chabrier initial mass function Chabrier (2003) is adopted,
with 31.7% of the mass fraction of each star particle ending up as
a single type II supernovae and releasing 1050 ergM−1� of energy
after a 10 Myr time delay and expelling heavy elements with a 5%
yield."
2.2 Filament Identification
"As we aim to measure the properties of the cosmic web filaments,
both in the DM and gas density fields, we now describe how we
identify these structures in the simulations."

solid line) on the column density maps. The virial radii of the 50 largest halos are marked as circles. The differences between the feedback and no-feedback
skeletons are caused by small differences in the noise level associated with DM particles: they yield slightly different paths which have a very similar length,
so that either path can be chosen by the algorithm described in the text. The colour bar for the density represents the gas. To estimate it for the DM, one
simply needs to divide the numbers shown by the universal baryon fraction. For the DM temperature, velocity dispersion is used as a proxy, with dark blue
corresponding to regions of ∼ 0.02 km s−1 and deep red with ∼ 100 km s−1. In the vorticity panels, red represents matter swirling counter clockwise around
the filament, and blue is for matter rotating in the opposite direction."
2.2.1 Method
"The DM particle distribution is tessellated using the Delaunay Tes-
sellation Field Estimator tool (Schaap 2007) and fed to the code
DisPerSE (Sousbie 2011). DisPerSE computes stationary points
(maxima, minima and saddle points) of the density field using the
Hessian matrix and assigns to each pair of critical points (e.g.
maxima-saddle) a persistence, namely a measure of how signifi-
cant it is with respect to a Poisson distribution. The persistence
threshold is the single parameter that determines which features are
considered as noise and which robustly pertain to the topology of
the underlying density field. From this set of stationary points that
characterize the topology of the field,DisPerSE connects saddles to"
"maxima following the direction of least gradient to create a network
of filaments which will be referred to in this paper as the “skeleton”,
and we will call “nodes"" the maxima of the density field."
2.2.2 Extraction of the skeleton from the simulations
"For each simulation, filaments are extracted from the Delaunay tes-
sellation reconstruction of theDMdensity field, setting a persistence
threshold of 10𝜎. This persistence threshold is chosen such that the
observed skeleton is in good visual agreement with the DM density
field. Our results are in fact insensitive to the exact value chosen for
this threshold, aswe are only studying themain filaments feeding the"

"galaxy (see Section 2.2.3). The skeleton is additionally processed
with skelconv (seeDisPerSEmanual1) using the breakdown and
smooth functions. breakdown removes duplicate segments enter-
ing a node from two different starting points. These segments can be
so close as to be indistinguishable from one another and as such are
removed to prevent their over-representation in the final skeleton.
The skeleton is then smoothed by averaging over the positions of the
30 nearest neighbours of each segment. This mitigates the effects
of Poisson noise on the skeleton, ensuring that individual segments
locally follow the global direction of the filament they belong to.
In both the feedback and no-feedback runs, 1.22 physical kpc is
the maximum spatial resolution reached in filaments, defined as
the size of an individual cell on the highest AMR grid level that
entirely maps the filament (see Fig. 2). As is clear from Figure
2, higher refinement levels are triggered within filaments but their
coverage is patchy, and mostly concentrated around halos/galaxies
embedded within these elongated structures. As we argue in our
convergence analysis (Section 3), we believe 1.22 kpc is enough to
resolve the radial structure of filaments, at least those that connect
to halos/galaxies with masses similar (or larger) to the one we study
in this paper (roughly M★). We emphasize that this is a much higher
resolution than that currently reached in large-scale cosmological
hydrodynamics simulations, where ' 1 kpc resolution is only at-
tained within galaxies (e.g. Dubois et al. 2014; Vogelsberger et al.
2014; Nelson et al. 2018; Davé et al. 2019; Schaye et al. 2015;
Nelson et al. 2019a). The main drawback of our study is that such
resolution is obtained at the cost of simulating a much smaller vol-
ume, and thus focuses on a single object. Filament extraction is per-
formed at the maximum level of resolution thus defined. However,
as highlighted by Rosdahl & Blaizot (2012) and in our convergence
study (Section 3), increasing the resolution does not seem to affect
the filament properties much, and we thus expect that our results
only weakly depend on resolution.
Finally, we note that DisPerSE applied to the DM particle distri-
bution, as is done in this paper, only allows the extraction of the
filaments down to a scale comparable with the virial radius of DM
halos. Below this scale, DMfilaments (at least in standard 3D space)
are washed out by the virialisation process at the origin of halo for-
mation and evolution. Therefore, we restrict our measurements of
filament properties to filament segments located outside of the virial
radii of embedded DM halos."
2.2.3 Identifying the main filament
"The gas and DM distributions differ significantly even for the no-
feedback run (compare left and middle panels of Fig. 3), with the
gas density field presenting much fewer filamentary structures than
the DM2. In addition, even though dwarf galaxies residing within
filaments are affected by feedback, the impact of this feedback on
the growth of the central galaxy is minimal (it does not lead to
the disruption of the main filament) as the majority of the gas
feeding it at high redshift is accreted via filaments, and not from
mergers (Danovich et al. 2012; Tillson et al. 2015). However, the gas
density field in the run with feedback will be more perturbed due
to interactions with galaxy winds and shocks (see middle and right"
"1 http://www2.iap.fr/users/sousbie/web/html/index4f3e.html?category/Manual

preventing accretion into the shallow potentials of DM filaments (Katz et al.
2019)."
"panels of Fig. 3), making the comparison between feedback and no-
feedback runs difficult. Furthermore,DisPerSE is designed to work
with particle data, as it allows in this case a meaningful definition
of persistence (the very concept of which relies on quantifying the
significance of a feature with respect to Poisson noise). For these
reasons, and given that we are not interested in probing the existence
of filaments within the virial radius of DM halos in this work, the
DM density field seems more appropriate to carry out filament
extraction."
"We therefore elect to extract the skeleton from the DM density
field, but trim it in order to keep only the main filament, along which
most material flows onto the galaxy. For an M★ central galaxy, the
main filament traced in the gas clearly coincides with its DM coun-
terpart (see top panels of Fig. 3). As we are analyzing a filament
connecting to a single object, we identify the approximate region
where it begins and ends by eye, and select the highest density point
in this region as its starting/end point3. We then use Dĳkstra’s al-
gorithm (Dĳkstra 1959) to compute the shortest path (following the
skeleton) between the start and end points. This works by assigning
to each segment a distance from the start point, travelling along all
the various possible paths of the skeleton. Whenever a shorter path
to a given segment, 𝑠, is found, then the selected path is updated
up to 𝑠, and the distances to all segments connected to 𝑠 along this
path which have a longer path length, are updated. This process
is iterated until the network is traversed, yielding the shortest path
between the given start and end point. The method is valid provided
the main filament flows mostly straight onto the galaxy, which, in
turn, holds until the filament gets close to the galaxy disk (Powell
et al. 2011)."
"In order to avoid the filament passing through halos, filament
segments located in regions with densities higher than 130 times
the mean density of the Universe were excluded4. This density
threshold is chosen empirically, but the resulting skeleton does not
depend very sensitively on the chosen value provided this latter is on
the order of 100 times the mean density of the Universe. The entire
initial filamentary network and the resultingmain filament extracted
after post-processing are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 3 highlights that the
skeletons extracted from the DM density fields of the feedback
and no-feedback runs are slightly different. In this Figure, one can
clearly see a pair of filaments on the left side of the central galaxy,
which are in the final stages of merging. As a result, our algorithm
identifies two possible paths along which the main filament would
have essentially the same length. Small changes in the noise level
associated with the DMparticles in the two different runs change the
exact way that segments connect, resulting in the algorithm picking
one of these paths in one run and the other path in the other run.
Our results are, by and large, independent of such small randomly
induced differences."
"3 For larger volume cosmological simulations where an ensemble of fila-
ments is available one can forgo the inspection by eye and simply use the
closest pair of galaxies with similar masses which are linked by the skeleton
as the starting and end points of a filament.
4 This value is lower than 200 times the critical density of the Universe
which is commonly used in the literature to define virialised structures. This
reflects the fact that the density of halos at the virial radius is lower than
their average density by about a factor 3."

filament segments from regions with densities greater than 130 times the mean density, resulting in gaps around virialized halos and sub-halos (indicated by
circles enclosing their virial radii on Fig. 3). In both panels, the skeleton is overplotted on a 𝑧 = 4 projection of the DM density field."
2.3 Cross-section measurements
2.3.1 Calculating DM temperature and vorticity fields
"Due to the discrete Lagrangian nature of the numerical technique
used to evolve the DM density field, a simple cloud-in-cell interpo-
lation onto a reasonably sized regular grid generates a non-smooth
density field in poorly sampled, low density regions. To get around
this difficulty, a Delaunay tessellation (Schaap & van de Weygaert
2000) is computed from the DM density and velocity fields (see e.g.
Schaap 2007), which ensures their spatial continuity. The Delaunay
grid is then projected onto a regular uniform grid, coinciding with
AMR grid level 11, which corresponds to the maximum resolution
mapping of the entire filament (cubic cells 1.22 kpc on a side, see
Fig. 2). This uniform grid is used for measurement of all quantities
in this paper unless otherwise stated. The DM velocity dispersion
field – used as a proxy for temperature – is then obtained by com-
puting the square of the difference between each particle velocity
and the value of its nearest neighbour grid cell and re-applying the
Delaunay tessellation with this dispersion as the weight. Every time
the Delaunay tessellation is projected onto the grid, we average all
the tetrahedra (or volume fractions of) that co-exist in each grid
cell. The vorticity, on the other hand, is simply calculated by taking
the curl of the velocity field on the uniform grid. As this latter is ex-
tremely noisy, a Gaussian smoothing is applied prior to computing
vorticity, with a width of 2 cells."
2.3.2 Cross-section extraction and radial profiles
"For each segment of the skeleton, a field (density, temperature or
vorticity) is linearly interpolated in a plane, the thickness of which
is equal to the skeleton segment length (typically 0.3 kpc, though
this depends on the local density). This plane is perpendicular to
the segment and centred on it. An example of individual cross-
sections in the density, temperature and vorticity fields is displayed
in Fig. 5. Note that the position of the DM or gas density peak
does not necessarily lie exactly at the centre of the plane due to
the smoothing of the skeleton. Smoothing is required to ensure that
individual segments point along the filament direction, and thus"
"that the extracted planes are truly perpendicular to the filament.
The gas density maximum is not tied to the DM density maximum
and thus is also unlikely to be at the centre of the plane. In order
to correct for such small offsets which nevertheless do affect pro-
file measurements, each plane is shifted using a method similar to
the ’shrinking sphere’ method outlined in Power et al. (2003). The
centre of mass of a circle centred (with a radius greater than the
truncation radius) on the initial guess from DisPerSE is calculated.
The circle is moved to the centre of mass before the procedure is
repeated with a smaller circle. This method is more robust to the
presence of additional substructure within the filament, particularly
as cells with 𝜌 > 40〈𝜌〉 have had their density reduced to 40〈𝜌〉 for
the calculation of the centre of mass. This prevents halos existing
within or near the filament from being chosen as the filament centre
and distorting the filament profile. DM and gas planes are there-
fore translated independently. This procedure allows us to align all
segments when stacking cross-sections."
"Vorticity and temperature fields interpolated onto the plane
perpendicular to the segments are then translated with the same
shift as the density field. When looking in the plane perpendicular
to them, filaments appear as strong peaks in the projected density
field (see top row of Fig. 5). Alongside this, the major walls asso-
ciated with these filaments is often visible extending out from the
peaks, forming thick elongated structures which are not necessarily
straight. In the temperature field (middle row and middle column
of Fig. 5), strong radial shocks are observed around the filaments
themselves, with weaker shocks also present at the wall boundaries
and where the walls intersect to form the filaments. In the vorticity
field (bottom row, middle column of Fig. 5) both filaments and walls
are identified with the regions of highest vorticity amplitude. The
DM filaments (left column of Figs. 3 and 5) appear wider than their
gaseous counterparts. Supernovae feedback (right column of Figs. 3
and 5) renders filaments and walls imperceptible in the gas vorticity
field (bottom right panels) although radial shocks are still present
at the filament edges (middle right panel) and the gas density peak
remains clearly visible (top right panel)."

on the filament profile, we take the median value for the distribution
of all filament segments at a given resolution and for each radius, as a
single profile is required. However, for the rest of the measurements
in this paper, we consider individual profiles fitted to each cross-
section over the entire radius range. In Fig. 6 the median profile
obtained in that way is indicated by the filled red disk symbols
joined by the red solid line, with the 1 𝜎 scatter around the median
profile indicated by the shaded area. The advantage of this second
method (fitting the whole profile) is that we can easily bin results
according to other filament properties, such as distance to the central
galaxy. This should more accurately reflect the underlying filament
property distribution."
2.3.3 The special case of vorticity cross-sections
"Vorticity being a vector, the structure of the vorticity field is farmore
complex than density or temperature (as illustrated by the bottom
panels of Figs. 3 and 5) and, as a result, it not easy to stack indi-
vidual vorticity profiles obtained for each skeleton segment. When
stacking is required, we therefore use the modulus of the vorticity
parallel to the direction of the filament and ignore azimuthal varia-
tions in vorticity. The vorticity field in the direction of the filament
is extracted in the same way as described in the previous section
for the density and temperature. As shown in the bottom panels of
Fig. 5, the vorticity has a multipolar structure, with several rotat-
ing and counter-rotating vortices surrounding the filament. Outside
the filament the amplitude of vorticity rapidly declines. Within fil-
aments, the geometry of the vorticity field is mainly quadrupolar
(see Laigle et al. 2015, though we found that dipoles and higher"
"MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2019)"
8 Marius Ramsøy et al.
"order structures are not uncommon reflecting that the flow have
shell-crossed several times). This larger diversity in the structure of
the vorticity field probably reflects the fact that the analysis in this
paper looks at smaller scale vorticity than Laigle et al. (2015), and
extends the measurement to gas. We recall that primordial vortic-
ity is destroyed in an expanding Universe, and therefore voids are
extremely vorticity poor. Vorticity can later be produced by shocks
or shell-crossing (respectively for gas and DM), and as result is
chiefly confined to walls, filaments and nodes (see e.g. Pichon &
Bernardeau 1999)."
3 RESULTS: MEASURING THE FILAMENT PROFILES
"In the following, we first derive analytically the radial profiles of
filaments under the assumption that they are in hydrostatic equilib-
rium, and then compare them to the profiles directly measured in
the simulation."
3.1 An analytic description of DM and gas filament profiles
"To obtain our analytic solution, we make the simple assumption that
filaments may be modelled as infinite self-gravitating isothermal
cylinders. Fig. 7 presents the sound speed and velocity dispersion
profiles in filaments. We have been careful to subtract the bulk ve-
locity of the material when extracting this data. Within the filament,
the sound speed and velocity dispersion are flat and dominate over
the accretion velocity onto the filament, which suggests – for the
centre of the filament at least – that the filament may indeed be
treated as an isothermal cylinder in hydrostatic equilibrium5 , i.e."
"∇𝜙 = −
∇𝑃
𝜌"
"where 𝑃 = K𝜌, and K = kB𝑇/(`mp), with 𝜌 the density, 𝑇 the
temperature, kB the Boltzmann constant,mp the proton mass and `
the mean molecular weight of the gas. Stodólkiewicz (1963) solved
this equation in the case of cylindrical symmetry (see also Ostriker
1964), and we will discuss the solution shortly. However, before we
do, we briefly outline why it also applies to the collisionless DM
fluid. Let us consider the time independent Jeans equations (Jeans
1915) for such a collisionless system:"
"𝜕𝑥𝑖
(𝑛𝑣𝑖) = 0 ; 𝑛𝑣𝑖"
"𝜕𝑥𝑖
= −𝑛"
"𝜕𝑥 𝑗
−"
"𝜕 (𝑛𝜎2
𝑖 𝑗
)"
"𝜕𝑥𝑖
. (2)"
"where 𝑣𝑖 are the velocities, 𝜎𝑖 𝑗 are velocity dispersions and 𝑛 is the
DM number density. Under cylindrical symmetry, we may neglect
all but the radial component of these equations. Further assuming
steady state (i.e. that 𝑣𝑟 = 0, such that accretion onto the filament is
negligible compared to internal pressure support) and that velocity
dispersion is isotropic, the equations simplify to:"
"𝑑𝑟
(𝑛𝑣𝑟 ) = 0 ;"
"𝑑𝑟
= −
1
𝑛"
"𝑑 (𝑛𝜎2)
𝑑𝑟"
"The second equation in (3) is entirely analogous to equation (1),
withK = 𝜎2, though it is clear that accretion flow onto the filament"
"5 At least in the plane perpendicular to the filament, as we know that
eventually, DM and gas flow along the filament into dark matter halos. In the
steady state regime however, such a flow should not perturb the equilibrium."
"cannot be ignored at large radii (see Fig. 7). The solution to both
equations is therefore that given by Stodólkiewicz (1963):"
"𝜌(𝑟) =
𝜌0("
"1 + (𝑟/𝑟0)2
)2 with 𝑟0 ="
"√︄
2K
𝜋𝐺𝜌0"
"where𝐺 is Newton’s gravitational constant, 𝜌0 is the central density
and 𝑟0 the core radius of the filament. Note however that it is the
gravitational potential common to both components which should
appear on the left hand side in both the second equation in (3) and
in eq. (1), so that technically speaking only the DM is truly close to
a self-gravitating isothermal cylinder, the gas being in hydrostatic
equilibrium in the potential well of the DM filament."
"As a preliminary test of the model, we can use a typical DM
filament central density of 𝜌0 ∼ 1.7×10−26g cm−3, i.e. ∼100 times
the mean density of the Universe (central filament density is subject
to significant variations but this is typical of themedian DMdensity,
see left panel of Fig. 6) at 𝑧 = 4 for our choice of cosmological
parameters, and a velocity dispersion 𝜎 ∼ 10 km/s (typical of the
median DM velocity dispersion we measure, see Fig. 7). Plugging
these values in the second equation (4), we find a scale radius
𝑟0 ∼ 8kpc, which is broadly in agreement with the typical radius
of the inner profile measured in the simulation, as shown in Fig. 6
(left panel) and in table A1. As the width of the gas filament is
set by the depth of the DM potential and the gas temperature, one
needs to artificially use the DM central density for 𝜌0 in equation
(4) rather than that of the gas to obtain an estimate of 𝑟0 for this
latter (as shown on Fig 6 the gas density is about a factor 5 lower
than that of the DM throughout the filament, in agreement with the
universal value ΩDM/Ω𝐵). As the DM velocity dispersion for the
particular filament we study is comparable to the gas sound speed
(i.e. ∼ 10 km/s or 104K which corresponds the bottom temperature
of the cooling curve for atomic hydrogen, see Fig. 7) we expect a
core radius for the gas similar to that of the DM, i.e. 𝑟0 ∼ 8kpc, and
this indeed seems to be within a factor of 2 of the measured value
(see right panel of Fig. 6 and table A1)."
"However, the isolated, infinite isothermal cylinder appears too
highly idealised a model in at least one aspect, as can be seen by
the failure of the yellow dashed curves (best fit obtained using the
first equation (4)) to match the measured median profiles (solid red
lines and red disk symbols) in Fig. 6. In reality filaments are born
from the intersection of walls (see Fig. 5 middle column panels),
the presence of which will modify the filament profile, especially in
the outer regions. Assuming that these walls may also be treated as
hydrostatic atmospheres, but this time confined to a plane containing
the filament, the equations governing their profiles are identical to
eqs. (1) and (3). These latter simply need to be solved in 1D instead
of 2D, yielding in the direction 𝑦 perpendicular to the plane (Spitzer
1978):"

the mid-plane (𝑦 = 0) of the wall. However, we need to integrate
this wall profile over concentric cylindrical shells to evaluate how
it modifies the filament profile. Unfortunately, this integral does
not possess a simple analytic closed form, so we approximate the
azimuthally averaged density of the wall by:"
"𝜌(𝑟) =
𝜌𝑦0"
"tanh(𝛼𝑟/ℎ)
𝑟/ℎ"
with 𝛼 = 𝜋/2. Such an approximation captures the asymptotic

"behaviour of the correct solution for 𝑟 � ℎ, and is accurate to better
than 14% for all values of 𝑟 . As can be seen in Fig. 6, the inclusion of
a wall modifies the shape of the outer filament. This might (at least
partially) explain the discrepancy between filament density profiles
previously reported in the literature, with power-law slopes ranging
between -1 and -2 (see e.g. Colberg et al. 2005; Dolag et al. 2006;
Aragón-Calvo et al. 2010). However we caution that these studies
were performed on much larger scales and so may not be directly
comparable to our work as they might potentially be affected by
different biases."
"One can easily show that in the case where the gas isothermal
sound speed 𝑐𝑠 ="
"√︁
kB𝑇/(`mp) equals the DM dispersion velocity"
"𝜎, the density profiles of the gas and DM have the same exact
shape, differing only by their normalisation, i.e. the value of the
central density. In the more general case where these two velocities
differ, one can write the gas density profile:"
"𝜌𝑔 (𝑟) = 𝜌𝑔0
(
1 + (𝑟/𝑟0)2"
")−2𝜎2/𝑐2𝑠
,"
"so that if 𝑐𝑠 > 𝜎, it is shallower than that of the DM, and vice-versa.
Katz et al. (2019) measured this effect by comparing two versions
of the same cosmological simulation with and without reionisation.
They find that narrow streams are widened by the photo-heating of
the gas, and that the gas counterparts of the lightest DM filaments
can even be entirely erased."
"Note that this reasoning also applies to the isothermal gas
density profile of a DM dominated isolated wall: when 𝑐𝑠 and 𝜎
differ, it becomes"
"𝜌𝑔 (𝑦) = 𝜌𝑔𝑦0 sech
2𝜎2/𝑐2𝑠 (𝑦/ℎ) ,"
3.2 Testing the simple model
"The first assumption we have made concerns the isothermality of
the filament-wall system and that accretion onto the filament pro-
vides it with negligible support. In Fig. 7 we can see that for the
no feedback run both the gas sound speed (black solid line and
solid disk symbols) and the DM velocity dispersion (red solid line
and solid disk symbols) stay constant over most of the width of the
filament, indicating that the isothermal approximation does indeed
hold rather well. In addition, the gas andDM accretion velocities are
considerably lower than the sound speed and velocity dispersion re-
spectively, and as such the dynamics of the system should be mainly
driven by the pressure support. Moreover, the accretion shock itself
is also non-adiabatic. Indeed, the upstream mach number (beyond
20 kpc) isM𝑢 ≈ 50/10 = 5, thus the Rankine-Hugoniot jump con-
ditions lead to a downstream Mach numberM𝑑 = 0.47, and it thus
follows that the downstream sound speed (within 10 kpc of filament
centre) should be 40 km s−1, i.e. twice the value of that measured.
This indicates that the filament accretion shock is radiative rather
than adiabatic. Finally, we also plot on Fig. 7, the circular velocity
𝑉𝑐 ≡ (𝐺𝑀/𝑟)1/2 (blue solid linewith solid disk symbols)measured
for the filament, where 𝑀 is the mass enclosed by a cylindrical shell
of radius 𝑟 . We find that it is comparable to or lower than the sound
speed/velocity dispersion, which further indicates that the filament
is chiefly supported by pressure rather than by rotation, contrarily
to what is argued in Mandelker et al. (2018)."
"In Fig. 6 we present 2 models, pure filament (Mfil), filament
with wall (Mfil+wall). In practice, this means that along each indi-
vidual skeleton segment, we fit the radial density using the formula:"

that in the inner filament region, one measures a near constant sound speed

radial inflow and falling sound speed and velocity dispersion."
"where 𝑟1 = ℎ, and 𝜌1 = 𝜌𝑦0𝛼
−1. In principle, the values for 𝜎 and"
"𝑐𝑠 could be different for the wall and embedded filament. However,
for sake of simplicity and since we expect these two quantities to
roughly behave in a similar manner, at least in the vicinity of the
filament, we ignore the possible change in the ratio of 𝜎2/𝑐2𝑠 in our
Mfil+wall model (see Fig 7 for the validity of this assumption). The
fit is performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm where
the wall is first fit to the outer half of the profile with the filament
contribution set to zero. The wall parameters are then frozen in
place while fitting the filament parameters. In the case of a pure
filament model (i.e. Mfil), the filament is fit to the entire profile,
setting 𝜌1 = 0. The procedure was tested by applying it to a sample
of artificial profiles, which typically returned radii within 1 cell of
the input radius, but does break down when the filament is too wide
(i.e. extends into the region where the wall is fitted). While this is a
suitable range for the purposes of this paper, filaments continue to
grow as time progresses, and this method may become unsuitable
at later times. In Fig. 6, we show how each of the two models fares
against the measured median density profile of the DM (left panel)
or gas (right panel) at 𝑧 = 4. Errors on the radius are estimated
by considering the full distribution of density profiles measured
from individual skeleton segments, and fitting this distribution with
the best matched normal distribution to evaluate the value of the
standard deviation. For errors on the density,we use the bestmatched
log-normal distribution instead, which is better suited to density
distributions in filaments (see e.g. Cautun et al. 2014)."
"Looking at Fig 6, it is not possible to distinguish the two
models, Mfil+wall (green curve) and Mfil (yellow curve), in the
inner region (𝑟 ≤20 kpc). When the profiles are stacked as in this
figure the fits work equally well with or without the wall. However
the size of the core radius that these models return are very different"
"when considering individual profiles: 𝑟0 = 19.34±7.15 kpc forMfil
compared to 𝑟0 = 8.39±3.82 kpc forMfil+wall for the DM filament.
This factor of 2 discrepancy is also present for the gas filament:
𝑟0 = 8.99± 1.86 kpc forMfil compared to 𝑟0 = 5.04± 1.96 kpc for
Mfil+wall. The core radii given by theMfil model can be rejected by
simple visual inspection of Fig. 3: they are comparable to the outer
edge radius of the filaments."
"Although we only show the 𝑧 = 4 median profiles, this be-
haviour of the two models holds for all redshift outputs examined
in this work (see table A1 for a list)."
"We now discuss how each model fits individual cross-section
density profiles (examples of these are shown as thin dashed curves
on Fig. 6) rather than the median. In this case, errors on the density
are estimated by calculating the gradient of the density profile and
multiplying it by the spatial resolution (size of cell). For the DM
density, a Poisson noise contribution is also added in quadrature to
the error estimate. We plot in Fig 8 the corresponding distributions
of reduced 𝜒2a which peaks at 3 for the DM density profile and
0.5 for the gas in the preferred modelMfil+wall (dashed and solid
green lines in Fig 8 respectively). For theMfil model these same
distributions are much less strongly peaked around 𝜒2a = 6 and
𝜒2a = 4 for the DM and gas density profiles respectively (dashed and
solid yellow curves). Note that themeasurement errors are relatively
large, especially at the centre of the filament for the gas, and overall
for the DM because of a significant Poisson noise contribution.
Though these values of 𝜒2 suggest a fit to the simulation data which
lies somewhat on the poor side, it is unclear that the validity of
the model should be measured by 𝜒2 statistics in the first place.
Indeed individual profiles deviations from the model are very likely
correlated with one another when substructures residing within the
filament perturb its density field."
"For sake of completeness, let us mention that at 𝑧 = 4, the fits
of the full set of skeleton segments using theMfil+wall model to the
DM component for the no feedback run returns 𝑟0 = 8.39±3.82 kpc
as the mode and width of the fitted gaussian for the core radius of the
filament (as previously mentioned), and 𝑟1 = 6.79±2.80 kpc for the
scale height of the wall. Similarly we fit a log normal distribution
to the DM central densities to obtain log10 (𝜌0/gcm−3) = −25.83±
0.49 for the filament and log10 (𝜌1/gcm−3) = −26.45 ± 0.45 for
the wall. As for the gas, we obtain 𝑟0 = 5.04 ± 1.96 kpc and 𝑟1 =
7.70±3.00 kpc, with densities of log10 (𝜌0/gcm−3) = −26.53±0.45
and log10 (𝜌1/gcm−3) = −27.12 ± 0.37. A list of values for the
filament radii and densities at other redshifts is provided in tables
A1 and A3."
"As gas filament temperature remains around 104 K at all times
after re-ionization, their density profile flattens rapidly as themass of
their DM counterpart decreases and the sound speed approaches the

"√
2𝜎. This means that low mass filaments will"
"only exist in the DM component (compare the top left and middle
panels in Fig 3), as a 104 K gas has too much pressure to be trapped
in the DM potential well in that case, and thus, talking about a gas
𝑟0 becomes quite meaningless. On the other side of the mass range,
we expect more massive filaments, where DM has a larger velocity
dispersion, to have better defined cores in the gas than DM, as this
former should still radiatively cool down to ∼ 104 K and thus have
a much steeper density profile than its DM counterpart. As a result
of this cooling, it is possible that the central gas density of massive
filaments will become comparable to that of the DM, in which case
our assumption that the DM sets the gravitational potential would
cease to be valid and the core radii of the two componentsmight then
differ substantially. However, for the filament system considered in"

curves, whilst the DM counterpart is shown as dashed lines."
"this paper, the approximation of similar DM and gas density profiles
seems to hold quite well (see Fig 6)."
"In light of the previous discussion, we interpret the difference
between the measured and predicted median values of 𝑟0 as a depar-
ture from the isothermal/hydrostatic approximations for the filament
(see Fig. 9, middle panels), rather than to asymmetry or a systematic
variation of core size as a function of distance to the galaxy (see
section 11 for more detail concerning this latter variation). For the
DM, the filament median velocity dispersion varies by 10% within
∼ 2 − 3 core radii. For the gas, where a shock is clearly visible
around 15 kpc away from the centre of the filament (middle right
panel of Fig. 9), the temperature varies by less than 60% between
the centre of the filament and the maximum of the shock."
"These discrepancies notwithstanding, it is striking how fila-
ments in our cosmological simulations resemble those obtained in
a much more idealised set-up with similar resolution presented in
Klar &Mücket (2012). More specifically, even though these authors
ignore the DM component as well as the fragmentation and merg-
ers of filaments, they find that their gaseous linear structures are in
radial hydrostatic equilibrium and exhibit an isothermal core sev-
eral kpc wide with central densities and temperatures remarkably
similar to those we measure in a more realistic context. They also
identify an outer shocked region with similar properties as ours, but
with a gravitational focusing which reduces 𝑟0 and increases 𝜌0 as
the filament approaches the DM halo to which it is connected. As
previously mentioned, we will come back to this latter point in sec-
tion 3.4 of our results devoted to the temporal and spatial evolution
of filament properties, but already note that such a focusing effect
is not as pronounced in our simulations."
"3.3 Vorticity, temperature and the radial extent of filaments"
"Having extracted the main filament from the simulation and mea-
sured the characteristic radius of its core through the use of a sim-
plified model of hydrostatic equilibrium for its density profile, we"
"now turn to the question of determining its outer size, or truncation
radius, as the analytic profile cannot extend to infinity in the radial
direction."
"Beyond a certain radius it is no longer true that sound and
dispersion velocities dominate over the accretion velocity, as can
be seen in Fig. 7. A failure of the hydrostatic model will thus oc-
cur, leading to a potential definition of the truncation radius, which
also coincides with the position of the accretion shock onto the
filament for the gas. We have opted not to use the peak tempera-
ture position as a definition of the truncation radius, as individual
skeleton segment profiles, both in temperature and vorticity are
often asymmetric and/or distorted by their environment, and may
contain multiple peaks when averaged over concentric radial shells
as a result (see Fig 5 for an example). Moreover, such a definition
would not apply to DM velocity dispersion profiles. We have there-
fore chosen to use a universal method for all physical quantities
and types of filament (gas or DM), which also has the benefit of
providing internal consistency between measurements. We thus de-
fine the truncation radius as the point where the steepest descent
in the temperature/vorticity/velocity dispersion profile is attained.
In the DM, this is analogous to the splashback radius for halos as
defined in Diemer et al. (2017), as vorticity and velocity dispersion
is only generated in the DM where shell crossing has occurred At
𝑧 = 4 this yields a truncation radius of 18.6 ± 4.0 kpc for the gas
temperature profile, while the gas vorticity profile gives 21.7 ± 6.6
kpc. The DM filament at the same redshift has a measured trun-
cation radius of 28.6 ± 6.5 kpc when using the velocity dispersion
profile, and 25.9 ± 4.5 kpc if we consider its vorticity profile (see
Table A1). It is interesting to note that the accretion shock of the gas
filament seems positioned well within the DM filament (roughly at
half the DM truncation radius). In order to check the robustness of
these measurements vis-à-vis resolution the data was extracted at
four different spatial resolutions. Note that this is not a study where
we change the resolution and re-run the simulation, but simply a
post-processing of the same simulation at different resolutions, so
we expect to achieve better agreement than if we had done a proper
resolution study. As resolution increases progressively from 10 kpc
to 1.22 kpc (level 8 to 11), the profiles are seen to converge across
every panel of Fig 9. Note that for comparison, our lowest level
of resolution, i.e. 10 kpc roughly corresponds to the highest level
of resolution available to capture filaments in current cosmological
simulations with volumes on the order of 100 Mpc on the side, like
Mare Nostrum (Ocvirk et al. 2008), Horizon-AGN (Dubois et al.
2014), MassiveBlackII (Khandai et al. 2015), Eagle (Schaye et al.
2015), IllustrisTNG (Nelson et al. 2018) or SIMBA (Davé et al.
2019)."
"Looking first at the density profiles both of the DM and gas
filaments (top panels of Fig. 9), one can see that in going from the
highest resolution level to the lowest one, the central density (inside
the core) is underestimated by about an order of magnitude, and
one becomes unable to measure the core radius of the profile with a
reasonable accuracy. On the other hand, the DM velocity dispersion
profiles (middle left panel of Fig 9) seem to converge faster than
the density ones, with the lower resolution estimates compatible
with the higher resolution ones at all radii. This seemingly rapid
convergence is induced by the shape of the isothermal profiles which
are, by definition, flat, especially in the case of the DM. For the

of the presence of the accretion shock: the low resolution data

"the core temperature by a similar amount.Having said that, the shock
position is fairly robust to resolution changes despite being radially
asymmetric, which leads to its ‘smearing’. A minimum resolution
of 2.4 kpc is required to correctly capture both the temperature of
the accretion shock and that of the gas filament core."
"3.4 Evolution of filament profiles over cosmic time and
distance from central halo"
"Having focused, so far, the discussion of the filament profile at
𝑧 = 4, we now address the issue of its temporal evolution. Since
𝑟0 ="
"√︁
2K/𝜋𝐺𝜌0, we naively expect that 𝑟0 ∝ (1+ 𝑧)−3/2, provided"
"the filament central density scales with that of the background Uni-
verse — which we measure to be the case (see Table A3) — and
its central temperature/velocity dispersion remains roughly con-
stant with redshift. Conversely, we can deduce the scaling of fil-
ament temperature/velocity dispersion with redshift by measuring
the departure of 𝑟0 from this specific power law scaling. In our
simulation, we find that for the gaseous filament, the central ra-
dius grows as 𝑟0 ∝ (1 + 𝑧)−2.72±0.26, which means that the sound
speed should scale like 𝑐𝑠 ∝ (1 + 𝑧)−1.22±0.12 whereas we measure
𝑐𝑠 ∝ (1 + 𝑧)−1.41±0.28, i.e. an evolution quite consistent with the
naive expectation."
"For the DM filament counterpart, the growth of 𝑟0 is faster,
with a measurement of 𝑟0 ∝ (1 + 𝑧)−3.18±0.28 (see Fig 10), a faster
rate than the approximate size of the central galaxy (𝑟gal = 0.2𝑟vir,
blue solid line on the Figure). This implies that𝜎 ∝ (1+𝑧)−1.68±0.15
as redshift decreases, whereas we measure in the simulation that 𝜎
scales as (1 + 𝑧)−1.46±0.39. The evolution of both gas and DM fila-
ment core radii are therefore consistent with the naive expectation
at a ∼ 1 𝜎 confidence level. Strictly speaking, any evolution of the
central sound speed and velocity dispersion is in contradiction with
the underlying assumption of isothermality used to derive the fila-
ment profiles, as this latter requires no change in either quantity with
redshift. However, as the evolution is slow compared to the sound
crossing time of the central region, an instantaneous isothermal
profile fits the data fairly well."
"The explanation for the somewhat faster growth of the core
radius of the filaments than the radius of the central halo to which it
is connected is that the ’old’ core material is preferentially drained
by halos residing within the filament, while a ’new’ core forms out
of more freshly accreted matter onto the filament (see e.g. Pichon
et al. 2011). As a result, the filament core radius is more sensi-
tive to the recent accretion history onto the filament than the halo.
Such a behaviour is reminiscent, at least qualitatively, to that of
the Navarro–Frenk–White density profile scale radius, 𝑟𝑠 , found by
e.g. Muñoz-Cuartas et al. (2011) whose time evolution also differs
significantly from that of the virial radius of the DM halo (except
in that case it is the opposite: 𝑟𝑠 , which is less sensitive to the halo
recent accretion history, starts decreasing with redshift earlier than
𝑟vir, see their Figure 5). As the gas can be considered, to first order,
in hydrostatic equilibrium in the DM filament potential well, we
expect the evolution of its core radius to be somewhat influenced
by that of the DM, i.e. that its growth also be sped up. We intend
to explore this effect in more detail and with a larger sample of
filaments to better assess the universality of this behaviour."
"As for the truncation radius for the gas/DM filaments, deter-
mined from either the vorticity or the temperature/velocity disper-
sion, it represents the locus where fresh material is accreting, and
as such is the rough equivalent of the halo virial radius. Fig. 10
shows the evolution of this radius as a function of redshift, along"
"with the size of the main halo embedded in the filament (𝑟vir, or-
ange solid line). For the DM filament, the truncation radius evolves
as 𝑟𝜔 ∝ (1 + 𝑧)−1.99±0.09 or 𝑟𝑇 ∝ (1 + 𝑧)−2.16±0.12, depend-
ing on whether ones uses vorticity or velocity dispersion to de-
fine it. This is a growth rate very similar to that of the halo size
𝑟vir ∝ (1 + 𝑧)−2.11±0.02 in this range of redshifts. However, the
gas truncation radius, either derived from the vorticity or temper-
ature of the gas filament which scale as 𝑟𝜔 ∝ (1 + 𝑧)−2.85±0.17
and 𝑟𝑇 ∝ (1 + 𝑧)−3.36±0.12 respectively, grows significantly faster
than its DM counterpart. This is reminiscent of the stability driven
argument for the propagation of a radiative shock within DM halos
advanced by Birnboim & Dekel (2003), but this time applied to
the filament: as time progresses and density drops the shock is able
to propagate outwards and ends up filling the entire DM filament
volume. Practically, this means that even though the gas filament
starts off being smaller than the central halo embedded within it
(see Fig. 10) at high redshift, the truncation radius rapidly catches
up with the virial radius. In our specific case, they are essentially
the same size by 𝑧 = 3.5."
"We now go back to 𝑧 = 4 to explore the effect of distance
to the galaxy on the width of the filament. As can be seen in Fig.
11 (top panel), both the core and truncation radii of the gas fila-
ment decrease by less than a factor 2 as a function of the distance
to the main galaxy embedded within it. This decrease is progres-
sive, from a maximum radius at 300 kpc away, which corresponds
to the distance of either ends of the filament (see Fig. 1), to the
virial radius of the central galaxy. We caution the reader that this is
somewhat different to the reported behaviour of the filament once
it enters the virial radius of the embedded DM halo (e.g. Danovich
et al. 2012). Indeed, within the virial radius, one expects the gas
filament to undergo more important gravitational focusing (Klar &
Mücket 2012). The reason why this does not happen as strongly
in our case very likely has to do with the fact that, as previously
mentioned, we chose to excise embedded DM halos to focus our
analysis on filament properties. However, while the filament radii
do not decrease much as the gas approaches the halo, it is still
enough to increase the central density, rising by a factor of a ∼ 5
(dark solid line and symbols in the bottom panel of Fig. 11). Note
that such a behaviour is not specific to the gas as the DM central
density (green solid line in the bottom panel of Fig. 11) undergoes
a similar change with distance to the galaxy, which is consistent
with an interpretation in terms of mild gravitational focusing but
also of the progressive draining of the filament core draining by
the halo, as previously mentioned. Finally we want to emphasize
that the nut galaxy, essentially connected to one (two if counting
each direction as an individual object) filament(s) could be some-
what of a peculiar case. In Mpc scale filaments Galárraga-Espinosa
et al. (2020) using the Illustris-TNG (Nelson et al. 2019b) found
filament properties to be dependent on filament environment, with
longer filaments typically (and therefore more distant from dense
structures) hosting colder gas. Once again, further high resolution
work on a much larger sample of filament/galaxies is required to
investigate the influence of connectivity and/or halo mass on the
results for filaments on kpc scales."
3.5 The impact of stellar feedback on filaments
"Stellar feedback has a profound impact on the region surrounding
the galaxy and filament. Given enough time, the superbubbles it
generates extend most of the way up the filament, as can be seen in
the central and bottom right panels of Fig. 3. These galactic winds
inject vorticity on large scales, and as such, this physical quantity is"

virial radius is shown in orange and the approximate extent of the central galaxy (20% of virial radius) in yellow. Finally, the spatial resolution of the simulation
in the filament is indicated by the solid blue line at the bottom of each panel."
"no longer confined to the filamentary gas. Note that, in spite of this,
larger scale cosmic web filaments (i.e. larger than the superbubble)
could still have well defined vorticity quadrants. More importantly,
vorticity in the dark matter filament counterpart (bottom left panel
of Fig. 3) remains by-and-large unaffected, to the point that we do
not deem it necessary to plot it on Fig. 11 for the run with feedback."
"The CGM/IGM gas is also strongly heated by this stellar feed-
back, and so the temperature signature of the accretion shock onto
the filament is lost as well, as the middle right panel of Fig 3 demon-
strates. Once again, this signature survives in the velocity dispersion
of the DM component (middle left panel of Fig 3). Despite such
significant perturbations, the presence of a DM filament potential
well coupled to the relatively high density of the gas ensures that
the cooling time within the filament remains short. As a result, the
filament is still visible as a cold stream cutting through the hot
superbubble in the middle right panel of Fig. 3."
"Due to these consequent perturbations induced by the stellar
feedback, we cannot use either the temperature or vorticity to define
the gas filament truncation radii in the feedback run. It should also be
noted that our assumption of isothermality of the filaments becomes
less valid than in the no stellar feedback case as stronger temperature
gradients develop between core and outer envelope. To be more
specific, in the no feedback case, the temperature varies between
core and truncation radius by about a factor of two, but in the
feedback case in can reach an order of magnitude. However, most
of this gradient is localised in the outer parts of the filament, so that
the central region retains a significantly large isothermal core. This
can be understood by performing the following simple calculation.
Neglecting the presence of the wall, we may integrate both the gas
and DM density profiles (from Eq. 4) to obtain the filament mass"
"per unit length, `, and its half-mass radius:"
"`(𝑟) =
𝜌0 𝜋𝑟"
"1 + (𝑟/𝑟0)2
and 𝑟1/2 = 𝑟0. (7)"
"The fact that the (small) core radius contains half of the mass
makes the filamentary material relatively impervious to the stellar
feedback/filament interaction: provided the core is shielded from
it, there can only be a minor change in the amount of gas mass
the filament carries. It has been suggested in the literature that
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities could be triggered at the interface
between cold filament gas and the feedback powered, hot, galac-
tic wind (e.g. Mandelker et al. 2016, and subsequent work). These
will depend non trivially on redshift and the distance of a fila-
ment segment to the central galaxy, so it is quite difficult to de-
fine a unique characteristic timescale, 𝑡KH. Nevertheless, writing
𝑡KH (𝑟) = (𝑟/𝑣𝑤 )"
"√︁
𝜌(𝑟)/𝜌𝑤 where 𝑣𝑤 is the relative velocity be-"
"tween the wind and the gas filament and 𝜌𝑤 the density of the wind,
we can see that given the steepness of the filament density profile we
measure, 𝑡KH becomes larger as the perturbation progresses deeper
in the filament. This means that the timescale is ultimately set by
𝑡KH (𝑟0). Plugging in typical numbers for our feedback run at 𝑧 = 4,
i.e. 𝑟0 ∼ 5 kpc, 𝜌(𝑟0) ∼ 3 × 10−27g cm−3, 𝑣𝑤 ∼ 100 km/s, and
𝜌𝑤 ∼ 3 × 10−28g cm−3, we thus get 𝑡KH ∼ 20Myr which is about
an order of magnitude shorter than the infall time from the virial
radius of the embedded halo. The conclusion is thus that our gas
filaments should not survive the interaction."
"Notwithstanding that this does not happen in our simulations,
which might admittedly be of too low a resolution to capture the
instability properly, the calculation ignores both the importance
of radiative cooling within the filament which might confine the"

"perturbations at the surface Vietri et al. (1997), and the important
fact that, as we have previously discussed, gas filaments are not
self-gravitating but are located within a dominant DM filament
potential well. Because of this, it is unclear as to whether Kelvin-
Helmholtz instabilities can impart to the gas a radial velocity (as in
perpendicular to the filament axis) larger than the escape velocity
necessary to climb out of this potential well. Should they not, they
would simply render the gas flow within the filament turbulent
without affecting the filamentary nature of gas accretion onto halos."
"In the feedback case, we measure that the core radius of the gas
filament evolves with redshift as 𝑟0 ∝ (1 + 𝑧)−2.24±0.34, i.e. with a
scaling very similar to the no feedback run (see Fig 10). Neverthe-
less, given the importance of the stellar feedback perturbations, one
expects gas accretion onto the filament to be reduced in their pres-
ence. To quantify this effect, we plot the ratio of median feedback to"

feedback runs, 𝜌fb/𝜌nofb, as a function of distance to the filament center.
Curves of different colours represent different redshifts, as indicated on the
figure. Very early in the simulation (𝑧 = 8) feedback enhances the density
of gas in the filament. However, at almost all other redshifts, the reverse
happens: the filament is depleted of gas in the feedback run as compared
to the no-feedback run. The amplitude of the effect is not monotonic with
redshift."
"no feedback gas density profiles along the filament as a function of
redshift in Fig. 12. From the figure, one can see that while the size
of core radius is not significantly affected by feedback, the central
density is, to a larger extent. At 𝑧 = 7 a 40% reduction is measured,
though this falls to 20% at 𝑧 = 3.6, at which point the feedback
ceases to have an effect on the filament core. We emphasize that
contrary to the growth of the core/truncation radii, the impact of
feedback does not scale monotonically with redshift, as it depends
both on the global properties of the IGM/filament and the star for-
mation history of the galaxy which drives the feedback. Indeed, as
shown on Fig. 12, at early times (𝑧 ∼ 8) the filament core density is
even enhanced by the action of feedback. It is possible that some of
this extra gas will be entrained in the filament, but another possibil-
ity is that it will act as a shield from fresh feedback at later times. In
a future paper, we plan to use tracer particles developed in Cadiou
et al. (2019) to distinguish between these two situations. Outside the
filament, the density is seen to be enhanced in the simulation with
feedback, which is somehow expected from mass conservation of
the filamentary gas and the presence of the extra material brought
by the galactic winds."
"It should be noted that the stellar feedback implemented in
our simulation is the supernova prescription of Kimm et al. (2015),
which ensures that the correct energy/momentum is given to the gas
irrespective of whether the Taylor-Sedov phase of the supernova
is spatially resolved. As such if the filaments are not destroyed
by this supernova feedback then they are unlikely to be destroyed
by any ’realistic’ supernova feedback. Yet, other types of stellar
feedback are also present which could alter filament properties,
whether by direct action of the feedback on the filaments or through
suppression of star formation and thereby the supernova feedback
(e.g. resonant scattering of Lyman alpha photons in high redshift
dwarf galaxies Kimm et al. 2018). There is, of course, photo-heating
due to ionising radiation which can induce an important gas density
depletion especially in filaments connecting low mass halos (see
Katz et al. 2019, for detail). We believe that this effect is, by-"
"MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2019)"

"and-large, captured by the UV background model implementation
present in both the stellar feedback and no-feedback runs. However,
another mode of stellar feedback which we do not account for, might
be more effective at filament disruption as it is less confined to the
galaxy: cosmic rays (see e.g. Pfrommer et al. 2017), . Finally, for
filaments connecting halos of higher mass, Dubois et al. (2013)
showed that AGN are also very effective at disrupting filaments,
and can even destroy their cores."
4 CONCLUSIONS
"Theory suggests (e.g. Kereš et al. 2005; Dekel & Birnboim 2006;
Pichon et al. 2011) that filaments play an extremely important role
in the evolution of galaxies at high redshift. However, their basic
characteristics are, as yet, not completely understood, and they are
extremely hard to detect observationally. We used a suite of high
resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations, progressively includ-
ing more of the relevant physics, to place constraints on the physical
properties of such a filament, from large (Mpc) scales to the point
where it connects to the virial sphere of the central galaxy. Our main
findings are as follows:"
"• The filament in both DM and gas simulations can be described
fairly accurately by a universal density profile 𝜌 = 𝜌𝑜(1+(𝑟/𝑟0)2)2
corresponding to a cylinder in isothermal equilibrium
• the filament core radius evolves for the gas grows as 𝑟0 ∝ (1 +
𝑧)−2.72±0.26, with the DM filament core evolving as 𝑟0 ∝ (1 +
𝑧)−3.18±0.28. This evolution of 𝑟0 for the gas closely tracks that of
the size of the galaxy (0.2𝑟vir).
• The filament has a second characteristic radius, the truncation
radius, which is detectable (at least in simulations) in the temper-
ature/velocity dispersion or vorticity fields. This radius scales as
𝑟tr ∝ (1 + 𝑧)−2.07±0.07 for DM and 𝑟tr ∝ (1 + 𝑧)−3.10±0.10 for the
gas. The DM truncation radius closely matches the virial radius of
the galaxy. The gas truncation radius is generally thinner at early
times.
• The filament properties are mildly affected by stellar feedback
from the central galaxy. The core radius of the gas filament hardly
changes, but its central density is generally reduced by ∼20-30
percent, but this does not happen monotonically with redshift. The
DM filament properties hardly undergo any change."
"Our simulations also establish that filaments need to be re-
solved with a minimum of ∼ 2 kpc for a Milky Way sized halo
in order to capture the filament properties. This might have impor-
tant consequences for the angular momentum content of the gas
transported to the galaxy. Still higher resolution will be required to
capture the filaments around dwarf galaxies, though these are far
more vulnerable to photoionisation and so probably do not need
be resolved in detail beyond 𝑧 = 6. While the mass brought by the
inflowing filament gas is affected to a level of ∼20-30 percent as a
result of stellar feedback from the central galaxy, a further reduction
is likely to occur as the filament enters the virial radius. We plan to
tackle this issue using tracer particles in the near future. The inter-
action of the filament with galactic winds and the virialised halo hot
atmosphere will also be a function of the halo mass, and therefore
our results need to be extended to a larger sample."
"Indeed, our analysis was performed on the filament feeding
one galaxy at high resolution. We thus plan to apply the techniques
developed in this paper to the New-Horizon simulation (Park
et al. 2019, Dubois et al, in prep), a cosmological zoom of the
Horizon-AGN (Dubois et al. 2014) which will have tens of galaxies"
"of a similar stellar mass to the one we studied in this paper, along
with several more massive objects. New-Horizon also features
AGN feedback and has reached 𝑧 = 0.25, which also allows to
comprehensively extend the redshift range of the analysis. Such
a simulation will thus permit the extraction of a large sample
of filaments fromwhich to derive statisticallymeaningful quantities."
