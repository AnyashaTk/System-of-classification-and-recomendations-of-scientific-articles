ABSTRACT
"Context. H i filaments are closely related to dusty magnetized structures that are observable in the far infrared (FIR). Recently it was
proposed that the coherence of oriented H i structures in velocity traces the line of sight magnetic field tangling.
Aims. We study the velocity-dependent coherence between FIR emission at 857 GHz and H i on angular scales of 18′.
Methods. We use HI4PI H i data and Planck FIR data and apply the Hessian operator to extract filaments. For coherence, we require
that local orientation angles θ in the FIR at 857 GHz along the filaments be correlated with the H i.
Results. We find some correlation for H i column densities at |vLSR| < 50 km s−1, but a tight agreement between FIR and H i orientation
angles θ exists only in narrow velocity intervals of 1 km s−1. Accordingly, we assign velocities to FIR filaments. Along the line of sight
these H i structures show a high degree of the local alignment with θ, as well as in velocity space. Interpreting these aligned structures
in analogy to the polarization of dust emission defines an H i polarization. We observe polarization fractions of up to 80%, with
averages of 30%. Orientation angles θ along the filaments, projected perpendicular to the line of sight, are fluctuating systematically
and allow a characteristic distribution of filament curvatures to be determined.
Conclusions. Local H i and FIR filaments identified by the Hessian analysis are coherent structures with well-defined radial velocities.
H i structures are also organized along the line of sight with a high degree of coherence. The observed bending of these structures in
the plane of the sky is consistent with models for magnetic field curvatures induced by a Galactic small-scale turbulent dynamo."

1. Introduction
"The interstellar medium (ISM) is shaped by many processes. En-
ergy is injected by sources such as supernovae and stellar winds.
This energy affects the dynamics of the ISM: It stimulates tur-
bulence that cascades down from large to small scales. These
processes have an imprint on the dynamics and the distribution
of diffuse neutral hydrogen (H i) as well as on the physical state
of the H i, which is characterized by the composition in differ-
ent phases. Gas traced by H i emission is not completely neutral;
as a consequence, the neutral phase is coupled to ions and the
dynamics of the H i is linked to the magnetic field. This process
is usually described as flux freezing (Heiles & Crutcher 2005).
Gas and dust are well mixed (Clark et al. 2019 and Kalberla et al.
2020). One of the most important tracers of the magnetic field is
polarization from aligned dust grains, which emit the absorbed
starlight in the far infrared (FIR; Heiles & Crutcher 2005). A
close relation between H i and FIR emission and the magnetic
field is expected (Clark & Hensley 2019)."
"Recent investigations have shown that the H i at high Galac-
tic latitudes is organized in thin filamentary structures, some-
times described as fibers (Clark et al. 2014). These filaments are
associated with FIR filaments (Kalberla et al. 2016). The mor-
phology of these filaments suggests that the structures have been
shaped by the magnetic field, and it has been shown that they are
indeed extremely well aligned with the plane-of-sky magnetic
field as probed by both starlight polarization (Clark et al. 2014)
and polarized dust emission (Clark et al. 2014 and Kalberla et"
"al. 2016). Thus, H i and FIR structures are coupled to the mag-
netic field, and the morphology of these structures may be used
to study magnetism in this environment. The most recent pub-
lications in this field have shown that H i filaments are coher-
ent structures, indicating ordered polarized emission analogous
to FIR polarization (Clark 2018 and Clark & Hensley 2019). In
turn, these coherent FIR and H i structures can be used to con-
strain models for the three-dimensional orientation of the inter-
stellar magnetic field and the twisting of the magnetic flux tubes."
"Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations by Planck in-
termediate results. XX. (2015) are based on a large-scale
anisotropic component of the magnetic field, with an additional
turbulent component due to velocity perturbations imposed on
converging flows that drive turbulence. A different assumption
is that there is a uniform magnetic field with isotropic turbulent
fields in different three-dimensional layers (Planck 2018 results
XII. 2020). We observe a systematic bending of the filaments
that can be used to probe models on turbulence. Magnetic fields
exert a tension force that opposes bending; they behave like elas-
tic strings threading the fluid. Accordingly, the field strength and
the field-line curvature are affected. Field tangling in the case of
a small-scale turbulent dynamo, also called a fluctuation dynamo
(St-Onge & Kunz 2018), leads to distinct predictions for the cur-
vature distribution (Schekochihin et al. 2002 and Schekochihin
et al. 2004) that can be verified."

"use of the Rolling Hough Transform (RHT), a technique from
machine vision for detecting and parameterizing linear struc-
tures (Clark et al. 2014). This method, as applied by Clark &
Hensley (2019), measures the linearity of structures in a region
of diameter 75′ around each pixel, and so the effective resolu-
tion is rather limited. These authors considered angular resolu-
tions between 80′ and 160′. Here we study the relations between
H i and FIR structures at the highest possible resolution. We use
HI4PI survey data (HI4PI Collaboration et al. 2016) that have
beam widths between 10.′8 and 14.′5, the best currently avail-
able resolutions for all-sky data. However, our Hessian analysis
is pixel based and therefore by construction limited to a reso-
lution of 18′. This is still an improvement by about a factor of
four to nine, and we present, for the first time, an all-sky high
resolution study of H i filaments. In Sect. 2 we explain our data
reduction, the Hessian analysis, and the comparison of filamen-
tary structures in H i and FIR at 857, 545, and 353 GHz. We find
coherence between H i and FIR and explore the physical con-
ditions of these H i filaments in Sect. 3. Curvatures in the case
of magnetized filaments imply a magnetic tension with back re-
actions on the filament shape. We determine the distribution of
filament curvatures in Sect. 4 and relate our results to predictions
for the small-scale turbulent dynamo. Changes in curvatures be-
tween the central parts of the filaments and their environment are
discussed in Sect. 5. We summarize our results in Sect. 6."
2. Observations and data reduction
"We use HI4PI H i observations (HI4PI Collaboration et al.
2016), combining data from the Galactic all sky survey (GASS;
Kalberla & Haud (2015)), measured with the Parkes radio tele-
scope and the Effelsberg-Bonn H i Survey (EBHIS; Winkel et al.
2016) with data from the 100 m telescope. The H i data from
both surveys have been gridded to independent nside = 1024
HEALPix databases, retaining the original resolution for each
of the telescopes (14.′5 for the GASS and 10.′8 for the EBHIS).
Subsequently these H i profiles were decomposed into Gaussian
components (Haud 2000, Kalberla & Haud 2015, and Kalberla
& Haud 2018)."
"To compare the H i data with the FIR emission we used
the most recent maps from the Public Data Release 4 (PR4)
(Planck intermediate results. LVII. 2020) at frequencies of 857,
545, and 353 GHz1. These maps have been generated using the
NPIPE data processing pipeline, a natural evolution of previous
Planck analysis efforts. PR4 data need to be corrected for the
Solar dipole. We used parameters from Planck intermediate re-
sults. LVII. (2020) with longitude 263.◦986 ± 0.◦035 and latitude
48.◦247 ± 0.◦023 and amplitude of 3366.6 ± 2.7 µK. The maps are
published on an nside = 2048 HEALPix grid. We downgraded
the maps to an nside = 1024 grid using the ud_grade software
from the HEALPix software distribution. As detailed later, we
smoothed some of the maps using the HEALPix smoothing pro-
gram."
"Our aim is to characterize filamentary structures that are
common to the H i and FIR emission. Several different methods
have previously been used to detect filamentary structures. Clark
et al. (2014) applied RHT to data from the Galactic Arecibo L-

"GASS data. Clark & Hensley (2019) applied the same approach
to HI4PI data. Kalberla et al. (2016) applied unsharp masking
(USM) to suppress large-scale structures in HI4PI data on scales
below 30′. In addition they used the Hessian matrix to work out
the all-sky distribution of filamentary structures in analogy to
similar investigations by Schisano et al. (2014) and Planck in-
termediate results XXXVIII. (2016) in the FIR and submillime-
ter range. Recently Soler et al. (2020) used the Hessian analy-
sis to analyze the filamentary structure in the disk of the Milky
Way. These authors have shown that results from alternative al-
gorithms, FilFinder (Koch & Rosolowsky 2015) and RHT (Clark
et al. 2014), are consistent with those from the Hessian matrix.
In the following we describe the Hessian analysis and the data
processing as applied by us."
2.1. Hessian analysis
"We classified filamentary structures as enhancements in intensity
that are organized as elongated regions with a preferred spatial
orientation. Such features on scales of arc minutes up to more
than 20 degrees are often approximated as one-dimensional
structures and termed fibers (Clark et al. 2014), but they may
also be bent, resembling worms (Heiles 1984 and Kalberla et al.
2016). Filaments may also be caused by projection effects from
two-dimensional structures, such as sheets or walls, seen edge
on."
"As a tool to classify structures as filament-like, we used the
Hessian operator H, which is based on partial derivatives of the
intensity distribution"
"H(x, y) ≡
("
"Hxx Hxy
Hyx Hyy"
")
. (1)"
"Here x and y refer to true angles in longitude x = l cos b and
latitude y = b . The second-order partial derivatives are Hxx =
∂2I/∂x2, Hxy = ∂2I/∂x∂y, Hyx = ∂2I/∂y∂x, and Hyy = ∂2I/∂y2."
"The eigenvalues of H,"

"describe the local curvature of the features; λ− < 0 is in di-
rection of least curvature and indicates filamentary structures or
ridges. Alternatively λ+ < 0 highlights blobs. Equation 2 with
λ− < λ+ implies that the blobs are not independent but located
as enhancements along the filaments."
"The Hessian operator H has first been used for the analysis of
H i data by Kalberla et al. (2016) but for consistency with Clark
et al. (2014), Clark & Hensley (2019), Jow et al. (2018) and
Soler et al. (2020) we follow here the definition x = l cos b. The
derivatives are calculated by us from symmetric differential quo-
tients. Due to the interleaved structure of the HEALPix database
it is necessary to interpolate the HEALPix data in Galactic lon-
gitudes and we use a cubic spline interpolation for this purpose.
The Hessian matrix is symmetrical, Hxy = Hyx but to minimize
possible numerical artifacts we calculate both ways indepen-
dently. All calculations are done in double precision. The nu-
merical procedure takes only a few seconds for an nside = 1024
data slice."

"that can be derived from polarimetric observations that provide
the Stokes parameters U and Q."
"This analogy between these two relations is intriguing but
before we use angular orientations θ from Eq. 3 we need to un-
derstand the meaning of this measure in comparison to θS . Re-
sults according to Eq. 4 need independent observations of U and
Q, two of the four Stokes parameters. In the case of Eq. 3 we are
limited to a single observation of the Stokes parameter I. The
orientation angle θ is derived merely from the morphology of
the intensity distribution. The advantage in this case is however
the high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of I, while the polarization
information entering Eq. 4 is typically much closer to the noise
level."
"The derivatives in Eq. 1 are calculated over a fixed grid of
5x5 pixels, centered on x, y. This implies that θ from Eq. 3 is
a measure for the local intensity fluctuations within this grid
only. The Stokes parameters U and Q from polarimetric mea-
surements are integrated along the line of sight and depend on
the telescope beam. The 5x5 pixel filter of the Hessian opera-
tor is only meaningful if it is matched to the spatial scale un-
der consideration, in our case defined by the resolution of the
data product. The sensitivity to structures on scales that are large
compared to the 5x5 pixel filter is low. For a more general ap-
plication a multi-scale morphology approach may be necessary
(Aragón-Calvo et al. 2007)."
"We analyzed HEALPix databases with nside = 1024; there-
fore, the effective pixel resolution is 3.′44 (Górski et al. 2005)
and, accordingly, the H(x, y) filter acts on a scale of 18′. The
FIR data, in comparison to the H i channel maps, are sensitivity
limited (see, e.g., Figs. 3 and 4 of Kalberla et al. 2016). To avoid
unnecessary noise amplification when deriving first and second
derivatives, we smoothed the Planck 857 GHz data to an effec-
tive resolution of 18′. Thus we matched the full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of the smoothing filter to the 5 pixels of the
grid used by the Hessian analysis. Such an adapted smoothing
leads to significant reduction of the uncertainties (see Sect. 2.3).
In Fig. 1 we display the resulting distribution of eigenvalues that
characterize filaments and blobs for FIR structures at 857 GHz."
"For the H i data we used Gaussian components from Kalberla
& Haud (2019) with a FWHM beamwidth of 14.′5 for the GASS
and 10.′8 for the EBHIS. In comparison to the FIR databases
there is a slight mismatch in spatial resolution but we intend to
analyze correlations between FIR emission and H i at the high-
est possible resolution. A smoothing would disable the use of
the Gaussian database since the fitting is a nonlinear process.
Our analysis is hierarchical in the sense that we always use the
857 GHz FIR data as a template to search for structures at other
frequencies. A slightly smaller FWHM width for the H i data
does not violate the Nyquist theorem since both databases are
on the same HEALPix grid. Tests with several different smooth-
ing kernels indicated anyway that the derived eigenvalues do not
depend critically on the smoothing kernel used."
"2.2. Comparison of filamentary structures in different
databases"
"To compare different data sets we apply simultaneously a Hes-
sian analysis to both data sets. According to our definition of
filaments as intensity enhancements that are organized and have"
"a preferred spatial orientation we demand that both databases
have at the same position significant eigenvalues λ− < 0. If this
is the case we calculate and compare the orientation angles θ."
"Clark & Hensley (2019) and Jow et al. (2018) have previ-
ously considered similar comparisons and developed different
strategies to measure the alignment of filamentary structures. For
a deeper discussion we refer to the original publications; we use
these measures but define them below only briefly."
"According to Planck intermediate results. XXXII. (2016) and
Clark & Hensley (2019), the angular difference between the ori-
entation angles θ1 and θ2 at each position of two data sets can be
calculated by"

can be defined for

and the uncertainty of this measure can be estimated from

2.3. Proof of concept
"To test our data processing and the performance of the different
alignment measures we use two neighboring Planck frequency
channels. Both probe essentially the same dust foreground spec-
tral energy distribution at slightly different frequencies. Data
collected close in frequency should have the highest degree of
similarity and thus the best spatial correlation of two indepen-
dently measured data sets. For a quantitative comparison we
compare first FIR data at 857 and 545 GHz. These data have
been processed with the NPIPE pipeline and are claimed to have
currently the best internal consistency between the various fre-
quency channels (Planck intermediate results. LVII. 2020). How-
ever, despite noise and differences in instrumental performance,
we expect deviations when comparing 857 and 545 GHz data.
For frequencies ν > 217 GHz the contribution of the Galac-
tic foreground is dominated by the ISM, at lower frequencies
the Galactic synchrotron and free-free radiation contribute sig-
nificantly. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) contribu-
tion is increasing for lower frequencies and the relative contribu-
tion from the cosmic infrared background (CIB) can be consid-
ered as a significantly fainter and spatially unrelated offset to the
H i emission (Odegard et al. 2019, their Fig. 3). In general, for
Planck 545 GHz and 857 GHz frequency channels the Galactic
foreground dominates across the sky. The total emission for the
different grain models is highest at 857 GHz (Draine & Fraisse
2009, Fig. 7). Despite the fact that across the sky some fluctu-
ations in the spectral energy distributions are expected, a good
agreement is observed at 545 and 857 GHz (Irfan & Bobin 2018,
Fig. A1). These two data sets are best suitable to test how far the"

fit. In the case of broad distributions the F fit was found to
diverge while the Gaussian fit was still stable. For this reason"
"we plot Gaussian approximations and cite Gaussian parameters
only. The shapes of the δθ distribution in Figs. 2 and 3 are diffi-
cult to fit. We also considered a simple estimate by measuring the
width of the δθ distributions at half maximum without fitting, but
such a measure seriously underestimates the width in the case of
a strong central peak (central panels of Fig. 3). Central peaks and
extended wings are best taken into account by a Voigt function
and we found that the Voigt function approximates noisy data

"2.4. Alignment between FIR and H i column density

"We aim to determine the degree of alignment between FIR and
H i structures. In the following we use only smoothed 857 GHz
data for the FIR since these have among the Planck observa-
tions the best S/N (Planck intermediate results XVII. 2014, Fig.
C.1). In contrast to the H i distribution the 857 GHz data are
noise limited (Kalberla et al. 2016) but, as shown in Fig. 2,
smoothing helps to improve our analysis significantly. For the
H i we chose first a velocity range of −50 < vLSR < 50 km s−1.
This range comprises about 75% of the total HI emission. It
also accounts for the phenomenon of dusty intermediate-velocity
clouds (Röhser et al. 2016) and thus is complete in the sense that
it samples all H i emission that is associated with FIR emission.
For a first comparison we calculate the integral across this ra-
dial velocity range (the moment zero map) and derive column
densities NHI. As mentioned before we do not smooth H i data."

"Table 1 shows the resulting alignment measures for two
cases, using all sky data and restricting the analysis to high
Galactic latitudes, |b| > 20◦. The high latitude comparison shows
the best agreement, the distribution function for angular devia-
tions is best fit with a Voigt profile with a dispersion of about
20◦. We display this distribution in Fig. 3 (top right) for com-
parison with alignment deviations between FIR at 857 and 353
GHz (Fig. 3 top left). There is some alignment between FIR fil-"
"aments and H i but apparently the NHI filaments fail a detailed
correlation with the FIR."
2.5. Alignment between FIR and H i in single channels
"Cold H i filaments are observed to have average FWHM line
widths of 3 km s−1 (e.g., Clark et al. (2014) or Kalberla et al.
(2016)). This empirical result, typical for a cold neutral medium"
"Article number, page 6 of 25"
"P. M. W. Kalberla, J. Kerp & U. Haud: Coherence in H i filaments"
"(CNM), may imply that coherence between FIR and H i can ex-
ist only for a restricted range in radial velocity. The filamentary
CNM structures are embedded in a more diffuse and warmer en-
vironment, the warm neutral medium (WNM). Dust and gas are
well mixed and the CNM is in any case found to be associated
with WNM (e.g., Kalberla & Haud 2018). The question arises
whether we can distinguish between different H i phases that can
be related to the FIR filaments. Hence it is mandatory to consider
the line-width of possible H i counterparts of FIR filaments. For a
turbulent medium it is in addition a matter of debate whether fil-
aments are real density structures or just velocity caustics, fluc-
tuations imprinted by the turbulent velocity field (Clark et al.
2019). In the case of velocity caustics it is assumed that density
and velocity fields are completely uncorrelated. Sufficient large
velocity channel widths of ∼ 17 km s−1, typical for a WNM,
need accordingly to be used to characterize the density field."
"To verify the different hypotheses we modify our analysis
and probe the alignment between FIR and H i structures depend-
ing on both, radial velocities and velocity channel widths. In five
independent runs we generate separate HEALPix databases with
101, 51, 25, 13, and 7 velocity slices in the range −50 <∼ vLSR <∼
50 km s−1, each slice with a width of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 km s−1,
respectively. We apply the Hessian operator individually to each
of these slices and calculate λ±(l, b, vLSR) and associated angles
θ(l, b, vLSR). Next we compare for all HEALPix positions the
angular alignment between FIR at 857 GHz and H i at each of
the velocity channels with different channel widths. The Hessian
analysis is performed in all cases over a 5x5 pixel region cen-
tered on (l, b). For each of the five different setups independently
the velocity with the minimum scatter in the δθ distribution (or
alternatively the best alignment) defines the best fit filament ve-
locity vfil at this position. Selecting then λ±(l, b, vfil) we reduce
the three-dimensional λ±(l, b, vLSR) distributions to two dimen-
sions. For each of the five velocity channel widths we obtain this
way an H i distribution that can be tested for internal coherence
in velocity (discussed in Sect. 2.6) but also for consistency with
FIR at 857 GHz."
"The derived alignment measures are summarized in Table
1. During our investigations we preferred to inspect the distri-
butions of the angular alignment deviations, characterized by
σVoigt, but found none of the listed alignment measures to be
superior over the others. However, all of these parameters show
a common trend. To our understanding the collapsed filamentary
H i distribution that was extracted for the velocity slice with a
width of 1 km s−1 results in the best fit. However, we also note
opinions that the 8 and 16 km s−1 integrated maps might be most
appropriate for this kind of analysis and should be preferentially
analyzed. In the following we consider both solutions, for 1 and
8 or 16 km s−1 channel widths in some detail."
"Figure 3 shows examples of the derived distribution func-
tions for angular alignment deviations, all sky and restricted to
high latitudes |b| > 20◦. Approximating the alignment distribu-
tions with Voigt functions we obtain σVogit < 3◦ at high latitudes
and σVoigt < 2◦ all sky in the case of 1 km s−1 broad channels
(Fig. 3 center). This comes even close to the correlation of the
two neighboring Planck frequency bands, inspected in Sect. 2.3.
We conclude that there is a very well-defined coherence between
FIR and H i filaments at the narrowest velocity interval. Figure 3
shows at the bottom the distribution of angular alignment devia-
tions for a channel width of δvLSR = 16 km s−1 with significantly
larger dispersions."

2.6. Velocity dispersion along H i filaments
"In this subsection we consider the problem of whether the cor-
relation between Planck and H i data might be manufactured by
the data processing. The correlation could be an artifact of se-
lecting only the best of many noisy channels. In other words, the
question is whether one could generate a map with a high cor-
relation coefficient by using just N realizations of random noise
given the number N is large enough."
"To investigate this question we consider the general case of a
three-dimensional distribution of H i filaments that may be corre-
lated with FIR structures that are observable only in two dimen-
sions. To establish a correlation, we strictly demand that such H i
filaments are not only coincident and aligned with the FIR in po-
sition but are also homogeneous in the third dimension, thus uni-
form without irregularities in velocity. A distribution is usually
considered to be uniform if its parameters are not arbitrary but
lie between certain narrow bounds. Irregularities are then mea-
surable as deviations."

nition of the Hessian operator with adapted Gaussian smoothing
over five pixels we select an inner radius δinner = 9′. For the
outer radius we chose δouter = 1◦, a value that appears to be ap-
propriate as discussed below in Sect. 5.2. We also tested smaller
δouter values and found no significant biases when changing this
parameter. We count only pixels along filaments and determine
thus the local velocity dispersionV only along the filaments."
"Figure 4 shows the distributions of velocity dispersions V
for three different settings with channel widths of 1, 8, and 16
km s−1. For 1 km s−1 the filament velocities have a typical scat-
ter V ∼ 6 km s−1 all sky and V ∼ 5.5 at high latitudes. Close
to the Galactic plane there is evidence for some confusion, caus-
ing the bump in the distribution function at V ∼ 15 km s−1 (see
also Fig. 18, top).V includes systematical effects from linear ve-
locity gradients. The measured velocity dispersions contain also
statistical uncertainties in the determination of vfil caused by the
limited velocity resolution of 1 km s−1 (Sect. 2.5). V can there-
fore only partly be caused by fluctuations in the velocity field,
the FIR and H i filaments are rather well defined and coherent in
velocity space."
"Numerical studies of the condensation of the WNM into
CNM structures under the effect of turbulence and thermal in-
stability by Saury et al. (2014) indicate that the velocity field of
the CNM reflects the velocity dispersion of the WNM. These au-
thors estimate a CNM cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersion of 5.9
km s−1, in good agreement with Fig. 4 in the case of a 1 km s−1
channel width. The velocity dispersion distributions for the 8 and
16 km s−1 integrated maps deviate by construction significantly
from these theoretical estimates."
"It remains to be discussed whether the correlation between
FIR and H i filaments at 1 km s−1 channel width could be flawed
because the S/N in individual H i channel maps is much lower
than in the integrated map. The Hessian analysis of individual
channel maps may increase the uncertainties even more and with
101 opportunities a channel with a concordant angle can nearly
always be found."
"To verify this assertion we consider how far noise degrades
the H i data (Kalberla & Haud 2019, Sect. A2.3). The system
noise Tsys contains several independent contributions. Most im-
portant is the thermal noise from the receiver system and the
elevation-dependent ground radiation including spill-over. These
components are variable, but we use here an average thermal
contribution Tsys = 30 K. The line signal TB(vLSR) adds to
the noise contribution TNoise(vLSR) that can be approximated as
(Haud 2000)"
"TNoise(vLSR) = σav[Tsys + TB(vLSR)]/Tsys, (12)"
"where σav is the average noise level in the baseline, determined
at velocities without H i line emission. We use this approxima-
tion of the radiometer equation to increase artificially the noise
for all observed H i line profiles step by step by a factor of two.
For each of these cases all steps of the data processing pipeline
are then repeated. Figure 5 shows the results. The velocity dis-
persions increase significantly and V is already unacceptable
large for a noise enhancement by a factor N f = 2. Likewise
we are unable to get lucky imaging with higher additional noise
injection."
"Figures 4 and 5, using the dispersions V, are somewhat ab-
stract and it may be difficult to realize the consequences. In Fig. 6
we demonstrate therefore that the derived coherent velocity field
in the upper panel is degraded significantly when enhancing the"
"Article number, page 8 of 25"
"P. M. W. Kalberla, J. Kerp & U. Haud: Coherence in H i filaments"
"telescope noise level by a factor of N f = 4. In the lower panel of
Fig. 6 it is just possible to recognize a few H i filaments as co-
herent structures. Considering a noise amplification by a factor
N f = 8 (not shown), the image is completely decorrelated. Like-
wise it is not possible to generate or improve coherent structures
for larger values of N f . This result reflects a well known physical
experience; the additional noise that we consider here is inco-
herent (independent in position and velocity) and by adding in-
coherent events it is not possible to generate coherent structures
with a high correlation coefficient. Generating a coherent result
in N random realizations as a sum of incoherent events demands
N to be virtually infinite. In other words: the H i structures that
are derived from Hessians at 1 km s−1 resolution are not random
but highly correlated, not only in position but also in velocity.
Observers are working hard to get significant data. The average
noise term in Eq. 12 scales with the integration time τ for indi-
vidual positions as σav ∝ τ−1/2. The velocity field presented at
bottom of Fig. 6 simulates observations that are therefore unac-
ceptable short in observing time by a factor of 16."
"Observers common experience is also that it is necessary to
resolve structures to be analyzed. In the case of H i lines, CNM
structures with an approximate FWHM width of 3 km s−1 are
common and according to the Nyquist sampling theorem (Shan-
non & Weaver 1975) a spectral resolution of at least 1/2 of
this value is necessary, independent of any other requirements
concerning the noise level. The possibility that averaging over
broader channels would increase the correlation by reducing
noise violates the sampling theorem. Applying such an averag-
ing causes a loss of information about the H i structures and does
according to Fig. 4 not improve the velocity dispersion along
the filaments. Also from Fig. 3 and Table 1 we find for none of
the different alignment measures any evidence for an improved
correlation with increasing channel width."
"This subsection on the velocity dispersion summarizes one
of the most important results from our investigations. Compar-
ing local orientation angles θ in the FIR at 857 GHz along fila-
ments with H i orientation angles for 101 channels it is no sur-
prise to find some agreement at one of these velocity channels.
For structures that are unrelated this should result in a more or
less random velocity distribution. Along the filaments we find
however a surprisingly close agreement of the orientation angles
with a well-defined coherence in velocity space (see Figs. 6 and
18, top), a necessary condition for alignment between FIR and
H i structures along magnetic field lines as conjectured by Clark
(2018) and Clark & Hensley (2019)."
2.7. FIR and H i alignment conditions
"To clarify conditions that lead to a good alignment between FIR
and H i filaments, we need to sort out several effects that influ-
ence the data analysis."
"First of all we need to consider data processing and obser-
vational uncertainties. The application of the Hessian operator,
thus the calculation of first- and second-order derivatives, leads
unambiguously to an amplification of uncertainties. In addition
the definition of the 5x5 Hessian matrix, applied to a HEALPix
data cube introduces a spatial filtering, depending on the dimen-
sion defined by the nside parameter."
"To minimize the uncertainties, also to minimize the calcu-
lation efforts, it is reasonable to use Gaussian derivatives for
the calculation of the Hessian matrix (e.g., Soler et al. 2020).
We do not follow this track but apply smoothing and calcula-
tion of the Hessian matrix independently, allowing H(x, y) to
be determined for smoothed FIR and unsmoothed H i data with"
"the same software. We adapt a Gaussian smoothing to the FIR
data only, but with a FWHM smoothing kernel that matches the
5x5 pixel size of the Hessian operator. Assuming that the 857
and 545 GHz Planck FIR data are essentially a representation
of similar ISM structures we reproduce the angular orientation
of filamentary structures in 857 and 545 GHz FIR data accord-
ing to Eq. 3 within σVoigt ∼ 4.◦3 all sky and σVoigt ∼ 7.◦5 to-
ward high latitudes. The scatter in δθ decreases by about a factor
of four if we apply a Gaussian smoothing. Applying the same
alignment test to smoothed 857 and 353 GHz FIR data, we find
that the dispersions σVoigt between both FIR data sets increase
roughly by a factor of 3.5; we explain this by sensitivity limita-
tions, caused by the significant total intensity difference of the
CMB and CIB in both frequency bands (Odegard et al. (2019),
Fig. 3). Using angular orientations from Stokes parameters at
353 GHz in comparison to those from 857 GHz we find also an
increased mismatch. As mentioned above, this mismatch is only
partly due to sensitivity limitations. The application of the Hes-
sian matrix causes a reduced sensitivity to low spatial frequen-
cies but in Sect. 4.1 it will become clear that spatial filtering does
not affect our analysis severely."
"Considering similarities between 857 GHz FIR and H i we
find some alignment for column densities but the correlation is
weak. Searching for an angular alignment between FIR and H i
in single channels we obtain a far better agreement but only for a
velocity resolution of δvLSR = 1 km s−1 the agreement is perfect.
The alignment measures are close to that of our test case at 857
and 545 GHz. Such an alignment can only be meaningful if the
coherence between FIR and H i can be verified also in velocity
space. Continuity in velocity along the filaments is discussed in
Sect. 2.6 and later in Sect. 3.6. For the rest of this paper we con-
sider only the best fit H i filaments with a velocity resolution of
δvLSR = 1 km s−1."
"To demonstrate the small-scale structure of orientation an-
gles θ in filaments we show in Fig. 7 in the top and middle pan-
els the distributions of θ for FIR at 857 GHz and for the H i in
narrow velocity intervals. Both distributions are almost indistin-
guishable. At the bottom we display θS from Eq. 4, calculated
from 353 GHz U and Q Stokes maps. Still, there is some corre-
lation of this with maps in the upper panels (see also Table 1) but
it is obvious that parameters derived from the Stokes maps differ
from those derived by a Hessian analysis. Large-scale structures
are suppressed by the Hessian analysis despite the fact that all
maps in Fig. 7 have a similar spatial resolution. Some of the
narrow structures resemble chromospheric fibrils that tend to be
aligned with the magnetic field (Asensio Ramos et al. 2017). For
the interpretation we need to be careful with respect to spatial
filtering caused by the Hessian operator (Aragón-Calvo et al.
2007). Only at the very end of our paper in Sect. 4.1 it will be-
come clear that neither sensitivity limitations nor biases caused
by spatial filtering are affecting our conclusions severely."
"The focus of our discussions in this section went from data
processing to more physical influences like velocity widths and
scale sizes. In the following we intend to explore astrophysical
issues."
3. Coherence conditions
"The close angular alignment between FIR emission and H i fila-
ments at narrow velocity intervals implies that the FIR emission
of such filaments has to come from regions where gas and dust
are well mixed and in dynamical equilibrium. The best fit lo-
cal H i velocities vfil(l, b) are accordingly characteristic for the"

3.1. H i Doppler temperatures
"H i filaments are cold with median Doppler temperatures of 220
K (e.g., Clark et al. (2014), Kalberla et al. (2016)). For single
dish observations we cannot determine excitation temperatures,
we can only use a Gaussian decomposition to derive Doppler
temperatures TD as upper limits of the true exitation tempera-
tures of individual H i components. In the case of several such
components, we need to use harmonic mean Doppler tempera-
tures defined as the brightness temperature (TB) weighted aver-
age Doppler temperature for all Gaussian components along the
line of sight,"

"This 〈TD(vLSR)〉 definition is analogous to the definition of op-
tical depth weighted average spin temperatures 〈TS(vLSR)〉 (e.g.,

tion of 〈TD(vfil)〉 for H i filaments at high latitudes |b| > 20◦ and
all sky. While the all sky distribution may suffer from confusion
caused by the Galactic plane, the high latitude data indicate that
most of the gas in the filaments belongs to the CNM with low
Doppler temperatures."

the Doppler temperature TD = 21.86 ∆v2 of this component, here
∆v is the FWHM velocity width of this Gaussian."

component fit to the TD distribution. At high Galactic latitudes
we find the CNM as the dominant component with a geometric

tral medium (LNM) TD,LNM = 567 K and TD,WNM = 2156 K for"

ues at high Galactic latitudes TD,CNM = 283 K, TD,LNM = 2014
K, and TD,WNM = 11879 K, as determined by Kalberla & Haud
(2018) from a Gaussian analysis, unconstrained to filamentary
structures. The formal errors of these values are low, around 1%.
We conclude that H i in coherent FIR and H i filaments is for all
phases significantly colder than the H i outside such filaments."
3.1.2. H i phase composition in blobs
"The Hessian operator allows two eigenvalues, representing fila-
ments and local enhancements (blobs) along the filaments, to be
distinguished with Eq. 2. Figure 1 shows that there are numer-
ous local enhancements at a resolution of 18′. Such structures
are well defined at the resolution of 14.′5 for the GASS and 10.′8
for the EBHIS. We repeat the analysis from Sect. 3.1.1 and de-
termine the phase distribution for these H i blobs."
"At high Galactic latitudes we find with Fig. 10 a TD dis-
tribution that is in its shape similar to Fig. 9 for the filaments.
The CNM with a geometric mean TD,CNM = 183 K is cold but
the LNM with TD,LNM = 282 K dominates the low tempera-
ture wing. This part is colder than the LNM of the filaments.
Opposite for the WNM, here we get with TD,WNM = 4766 K
somewhat higher temperatures in comparison to the filaments.
All sky we obtain TD,CNM = 207 K, TD,LNM = 360 K and
TD,WNM = 5528 K. In summary, local enhancements along fil-"

"aments contain also predominantly cold H i gas. The formal pa-
rameters for the phase decompositions in Figs. 9 and 10 may not
be very well defined but we clearly find in all phases significantly
lower Doppler Temperatures than the averages determined pre-
viously by Kalberla & Haud (2018). Comparing these blobs with
sources from the Planck catalog of Galactic cold clumps (Planck
2015 results. XXVIII. 2016) we find that only 2397 out of 13242
sources listed in this catalog belong to the population of blobs.
We conclude that most of the blobs shown in Fig. 1 share the
properties of the filamentary structures; they are just condensa-
tions along the filaments."

3.2. Velocity distribution
"Figure 11 shows the velocity distributions for H i in coherent
FIR and H i filaments. Filaments are local phenomena, they do
not share high rotational velocities from the rotation curve in the
Galactic plane. Using unconstrained all sky data we find that fila-
ments are mostly in the range |vLSR| <∼ 30 km s−1. At high Galac-
tic latitudes we find barely filaments with |vLSR| > 20 km s−1.
Our analysis covers the range |vLSR| < 50 km s−1 but this limited
range is complete and allows an unbiased description of filamen-
tary structures. A Gaussian fit to the velocity distribution leads
to a FWHM width of 16.6 km s−1 at high latitudes and to 19.1
km s−1 for the all sky case and confirms the narrow velocity dis-"
"tribution of small-scale filamentary structures derived previously
from USM by Kalberla et al. (2016)."
"To check whether filament velocities may depend on the
phase composition we distinguish velocity distributions accord-
ing to contributions from the CNM and the warmer phases. Fig-
ure 11 shows that the warmer contributions tend to be asymmet-
ric, indicating dynamical interactions."

3.3. Polarization: H i coherence in velocity
"Clark (2018) investigated the alignment of H i features with the
plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation. To quantify the correla-
tion between H i structures and the magnetic field as character-
ized by the polarization fraction of 353 GHz dust emission, she
proposed characterizing H i structures by their H i coherence or
H i polarization. This metric is defined for the degree of coher-
ence of the H i orientation as a function of velocity by Stokes-like
parameters UHI and QHI. Clark et al. (2014) and Clark & Hensley
(2019) use the orientation of H i structures with angles derived
from a RHT. Here we use angles θ according to Eq. 3, derived
after application of the Hessian operator. These are weighted by
the local H i brightness temperature TB and integrated over the
line of sight velocity vLSR,"

"Clark & Hensley (2019) applied this concept to map magnet-
ically coherent regions of space. They have proven the existence
of H i regions that are highly correlated with the 353 GHz Q and
U maps of polarized dust emission observed by Planck on scales
of 80′. Comparing 857 GHz data on scales of 18′ with H i emis-
sion from GASS and EBHIS we use this concept for our high
resolution analysis and display the distribution of derived H i po-
larization data pHI in Fig. 12. These distributions are close to
Gaussians with peaks at pHI ∼ 0.3 but with extended wings up
to pHI ∼ 0.8. As discussed below in Sect. 3.5 in more detail, the
dust polarization fraction is limited and pHI is not representative
for the dust."
"The derived distributions for the H i polarization pHI in Fig.
12 are remarkably well defined and the peaks appear only little
affected by confusion effects in the Galactic plane. On scales
of 18′ pHI is significantly enhanced in comparison to previ-
ous low resolution investigations. Planck intermediate results
XXXVIII. (2016) determine from 353 GHz data on multipole
scales 30 <∼ l <∼ 300 a mean polarization fraction of magnetized
filaments of 11%. Clark (2018) and Clark & Hensley (2019) re-
port H i polarizations around 15% on scales of 90′ and 80′, re-
spectively, with a maximum near 30%. From 353 GHz Planck
data at 1◦resolution Planck Collaboration Int. XIX. (2015) deter-
mine a maximum polarization of 19.8% and Planck 2018 results
XII. (2020) derive a maximum of 22% at 80′ resolution."
"For all these publications the spatial filters were chosen in
such a way that they highlight all the bright filaments. Our aim
is to compare FIR and H i filaments at the highest possible reso-
lution with the best sensitivity. Our data are matched to the 18′
resolution of the Hessian operator and can only be consistent
with previous results if there are significant small-scale effects
along the filaments and within the analyzed beam. The CNM as"
"the coldest and densest part of the H i distribution dominates the
structure of the filaments. The densest portions are in the very
centers of the filaments and the magnetic field strengths corre-
lates with volume density. These cold and dense parts cause the
local bending for both, FIR and H i filaments with fluctuations in
θ. Such a tangling must cause a de-correlation of the polarization
observed at larger scales."

lation between orientation angles θ at neighboring positions into
account. The observed orientation angels for neighboring posi-
tions are correlated due to systematic field curvatures with in-
creased tangling on small scales. The definition for S (Eq. 17)"

"disregards such effects. As shown in Sect. 4.1, the distribution
of curvatures is highly nonrandom, indicating that the filaments
follow a systematical bending of the magnetic field lines. The
peak at S ∼ 52◦ is consistent with an uniform distribution of ori-
entation angles without preferred orientation (e.g., Naghizadeh-
Khouei & Clarke 1993, Appendix A) but may not be mistaken
as a proof for a purely random distribution of filament struc-
tures. Here we consider only the question whether the extended
wings for S >∼ 90◦ could be caused by blending of unrelated fila-
ments. To check for effects from such a blending we excluded in
Eq. 17 positions with velocity deviations exceeding 10 km s−1.
We find no significant change in the histograms compared to the
unbiased distribution shown in Fig. 13. In presence of the nar-
row velocity distribution derived in Sect. 3.2 blending may be
unavoidable. At high Galactic latitudes on average 2.5 to 3 H i
clouds are expected along the line of sight (Panopoulou & Lenz
2020). In Planck 2018 results XII. (2020) it is assumed that the
polarization angle dispersion measure is characteristic for a tur-
bulence in layered structure of the magnetic field along the line
of sight."
"The unexpected strong peak of the polarization angle disper-
sion at S ∼ 52◦ in Fig. 13 is an intrinsic property of the small-
scale structures we observe along the filaments as a response to
the Hessian operator. To check the dependence of S on the cho-
sen confidence level λ− < −1.5 K/deg"

out this paper, we exacerbate this constraint by a factor of two.
In response only the most prominent filamentary structures are"
"considered. Toward high Galactic latitudes this constraint affects
50% of all filaments and all-sky 30% are discarded. However,
the peak of the polarization angle dispersion distribution in Fig.
13 remains at S ∼ 52◦ (blue and orange lines). On average about
109 positions along the filaments contribute to the measurement
of S, while in the case of λ− < −3 K/deg"

3.5. Polarization angle dispersion versus polarization fraction
"Planck Collaboration Int. XIX. (2015) report that at 353 GHz S
is in general anticorrelated to the observed polarization fraction.
This result was confirmed by Planck 2018 results XII. (2020)
and Clark & Hensley (2019) report a similar relation also for H i
polarization with a resolution of 160′. In the following we focus
on the polarization angle dispersion along individual filaments
at considerable smaller scales of 18′."
"The S from Eq. 17 essentially measures fluctuations of the
polarization angle perpendicular to the line of sight on scales of
3δ, three times the selected resolution and in our case on a scale
of ∼ 54′. Tangling causes fluctuations in the plane-of-sky mag-
netic field orientation. Figure 14 shows that, in this case, S does
not depend on the H i polarization pHI according to Eq. 16. The
H i polarization pHI is defined as a measure of coherence along
the line of sight, hence across the H i fibers. The dispersion S is
along the filament and both are apparently not correlated. Our
results clearly contradict Clark & Hensley (2019, Fig. 11), who"
"Article number, page 14 of 25"
"P. M. W. Kalberla, J. Kerp & U. Haud: Coherence in H i filaments"
"observe an anticorrelation between S and pHI similar to the anti-
correlation in the case of polarization fractions p353 from Stokes
parameters. H i polarization fractions and polarization angle dis-
persions on scales of 160′ and 18′are not compatible. The scale
differs by a factor of ∼ 9 and we conclude that just on angu-
lar scales of ∼ 18′ we are able to resolve details of the local
magnetic field structure manifested in the bending or tangling of
fibers perpendicular to the line of sight."
"In Fig. 15 we display dependences between polarization an-
gle dispersion along the same filaments as in Fig. 14, but now
for polarization fractions determined from Stokes parameters at
353 GHz. These two-dimensional distributions confirm the pre-
viously published anticorrelations between polarization angle
dispersion and polarization of FIR filaments. We also used the
molecular cloud sample as considered by Planck intermediate
results. XX. (2015) for an additional comparison between polar-
ization angle dispersions and polarization fractions. The result is
shown in Fig. 16. The only difference from the previously pub-
lished two-dimensional distributions for the diffuse ISM is the
larger fractional polarization at 353 GHz for the denser molecu-
lar clouds. In the case of the molecular clouds, a decrease in the
maximum polarization fraction with increasing column density
is reported by Planck intermediate results. XX. (2015). So we
would expect for the molecular cloud sample a trend to lower
p353 values but we find the opposite. Our investigations in Sect.
2.2 show that there is in general only a weak correlation for ori-
entation angles θ between FIR filaments and H i structures in
column densities. Accordingly we find only a weak and prob-
ably insignificant correlation between H i column densities and
polarization dispersions S and fractions pHI."
"Additionally, in simulations of MHD turbulence of polarized
thermal emission from Galactic dust by Planck intermediate re-
sults. XX. (2015), the polarization angle dispersion S is found to
anticorrelate with the polarization fraction. These authors con-
sidered a lag of δ = 16′, comparable to our resolution. The
model assumption is that there is a large-scale anisotropic com-
ponent of the magnetic field. Cold dense filaments and clumps
are condensing of the magnetized WNM. In this case a turbulent
magnetic field component is linked to turbulent velocity pertur-
bations caused by a converging flow. The high H i polarization
pHI, as well as the absence of a correlation with S from our in-
vestigations are inconsistent with these studies. Also, the case
for a strong turbulence, advocated by Planck 2018 results XII.
(2020, Sect. F.6) on basis of an anticorrelation between S an p
at 353 GHz, is not supported by our investigations if we consider
filaments with coherence in FIR and H i."
"The discrepancies between the polarization fractions derived
from the H i Hessians and the Stokes parameters at 353 GHz
indicate systematical differences caused by the data processing.
The derived polarization is certainly affected by the relative ori-
entation of the local magnetic field with respect to the line of
sight. When comparing gas and dust we assume that both are
affected in a similar way. But we need to take into account that
different parts of the ISM are sampled. Figure 17 shows the re-
lation between polarization measures p353 and pHI. For the full
sample of filamentary structures considered by us the polariza-
tion derived from Stokes parameters is on average only 10% of
the H i polarization. As detailed by Clark & Hensley (2019, Sect.
6.1), the observed polarization fraction is an important constraint
on the intrinsic polarizing efficiency. In the case of dust grains,
the size distributions and alignment functions are important, as
is the local orientation of the magnetic field (Draine & Fraisse
2009). This leads to a limited observable polarization of ∼ 22%
(Planck 2018 results XII. 2020). The H i polarization pHI reflects"

systematic effects. We interpret therefore the lower H i polariza-
tion fractions observed by Clark & Hensley (2019) with beam
depolarization due to tangling within their larger beam. In a sim-
ilar way the high polarization angle dispersions S, derived by us
from the Hessians, can be explained. The H i filaments are well
resolved structures in narrow velocity intervals of 1 km s−1, with
a previously unreachable spatial resolution. Our smaller beam
allows fluctuations in orientation angles to be observed on small
scales. We emphasize that the Hessian analysis is most sensitive
on such small scales."
3.6. Spatial distribution of coherent structures
"Figure 18 shows on top the spatial distribution of the velocity
field that we derive for the coherent FIR and H i filaments for the
dominant velocities −50 < vLSR < 50 km s−1, but to improve the
presentation we display only −30 < vLSR < 30 km s−1. Contri-
butions outside this velocity range are statistically unimportant
(Fig. 11). In the middle we present the distribution of the veloc-
ity dispersionsV along filaments and below the harmonic mean
Doppler temperatures in logarithmic scaling."
"H i filaments are local structures that are embedded in the dif-
fuse H i distribution. Derived harmonic mean Doppler tempera-
tures according to Eq. 13 are therefore upper limits to Doppler
temperatures for the H i gas that is directly associated with the
FIR filaments. Figure 18 bottom shows a general trend that co-
herent FIR and H i filaments are cold, at least for high latitudes.
Many structures close to the Galactic plane may be severely af-
fected by confusion. The velocity dispersions V for the most
prominent filaments are low. In some regions we find filaments
with significant velocity gradients, indicating either dynamical
interactions or overlap of unrelated filaments from different ve-
locity regimes."
4. Filament curvature diagnostics
"In Sect. 2.5 we determined FIR and H i filaments as coherent
structures with nearly perfect angular alignment. This concor-
dance is confined to the narrowest velocity interval and the con-
tinuity of the velocity field (Figs. 6 and 18) implies spatial coher-
ence for FIR and H i structures in the plane of the sky. We adopt
in the following the paradigm by Clark et al. (2014) and Clark
& Hensley (2019) that such coherent H i structures can be used
to probe the properties of the associated magnetic field, in par-
ticular the field tangling. We find that the FIR and H i coherence
is confined to particular cold gas and is best defined for small-
scale structures. The key for our understanding of the relations
between gas, dust and magnetic fields is therefore the small-scale
structure in narrow velocity intervals on arcmin scales despite
the fact that such structures are part of larger and more promi-
nent filaments (Kalberla et al. 2016) that appear to be more in-
teresting upon visual inspection. Clark et al. (2014) and Clark &
Hensley (2019) analyzed filamentary structures with a resolution
of 60′ to 80′ but we focus here on scales of 18′."
4.1. The filament curvature distribution
"The small-scale structure of MHD turbulence is characterized
by a folded structure of the fields, observable as transverse spa-
tial oscillation of the field direction, while the field lines remain
mainly unbent on large scales. Clark et al. (2014) and Clark &
Hensley (2019) analyzed the line of sight field tangling. Our high"
"resolution analysis allows us to focus on tangling as observed in
projection perpendicular to the line of sight, hence changes of
the orientation angle from θ0 at the beam center to θ1 at an offset
position."

"To parameterize the bending we need to consider that the
magnetic field points in the direction of the flux tube’s tangent
vector while a curvature is the response to a local perturbation
perpendicular to the field line. We determine for each position
with orientation angle θ0 along the filaments the local curva-
ture C = 1/R for a structure with a radius determined from
R = δ/(2 sin((θ0 − θ1)/2)). We select offsets δ = 9′ with orienta-
tion angle θ1 on both sides of the central position and average the
radii. We verified that our results do not depend critically on the
particular choice of δ. Figure 19 displays the distribution of cur-
vatures calculated from FIR filaments derived at 857 GHz. Nar-
row channel H i filaments (see Fig. 7 top and middle for compar-
ison) lead within the uncertainties to indistinguishable results.
Our observational findings are quantitatively consistent with a
power tail ∝ C−13/7 predicted by Schekochihin et al. (2002) for
curvatures of field line structures generated by a small-scale tur-
bulent dynamo. According to this model the small-scale mag-
netic turbulence is caused by folded structures of the magnetic
field B and the geometry of the tangled magnetic fields can be
studied in terms of the statistics of their magnetic tension forces
or curvatures K = b̂ · ∇b̂ with b̂ = B/B."
"Schekochihin et al. (2002) considered several model vari-
ants, the power tail ∝ C−13/7 remains valid in all cases for large
curvatures. After an initially exponential growth the dynamo sat-
urates and the fully developed, forced, isotropic MHD turbu-
lence is expected to be the final saturated state of the small-scale
dynamo. These authors derive with their Eq. 9 a curvature distri-

however not bias significantly the calculation of the orientation
angels compared to the straight forward calculation from Stokes
parameters using Eq. 4. The shapes of the curvature distributions
remain consistent with the Eq. 18."
"To estimate limitations from observational uncertainties we
repeated the calculations of the curvature distribution. To test
the hypothesis that the S map could be noise dominated, we re-
place the orientation angles derived from Eqs. 3 and 4 with a
cyclic uniform distribution. Repeating the complete data analy-
sis results in a flat curvature distribution. For a random uniform
distribution of orientation angles without any correlation of an-
gles between neighboring positions all curvatures have the same
probability. This is clearly inconsistent with observations. Our
simulations include beam effects, resulting in a decreased sensi-"
"tivity at high spatial frequencies. Accordingly all slopes in Fig.
20 at high curvatures are affected by sensitivity limitations. The
predicted tail ∝ C−13/7 shown in Fig. 19 is not useful to constrain
the model in this range. Comparing the 353 GHz and 857 GHz
curvature distributions, we do not find any obvious noise biases.
This is on the first glance surprising because the 353 GHz data
are affected by noise much more severely than the 857 GHz ones
but we show below that the S/N for the selected 353 GHz fila-
ments is high enough."
"We like to point out here first that the observed orientation
angles for neighboring positions are correlated due to systematic
field curvatures. The definition for S (Eq. 17) does not account
for such a systematic behavior. The distribution of curvatures is
highly nonrandom, indicating that the filaments follow a system-
atical bending of the magnetic field lines. The peak at S ∼ 52◦
in Fig. 13 is consistent with strongly fluctuating orientation an-
gles on small scales without directional preferences as expected
in the case of a tangled magnetic field. This peak does however
not imply a completely random and uncorrelated distribution of
orientation angles. Such a case requires the curvatures (derived
from orientation angels at adjacent positions along the filaments)
to also have a flat distribution."
"We emphasize further that the derived distribution of ob-
served local H i filament curvatures is far from noise dominated.
Using Eq. 12 we determine the S/N at each of the selected fila-
ment positions for all H i channels with δvLSR = 1 km s−1 consid-
ered by us throughout this paper as related to the FIR. These data
exceed an average S/N level of 87 all sky and 68 at high latitudes.
The Hessian operator is selective and most sensitive to H i data
with local S/N maxima (constant multiple rule). These are posi-
tions that are dominated by the CNM. The structures disclosed
this way are predominantly observed close to zero velocity. For
typical applications of a Hessian analysis a S/N of better than
five is considered to be sufficient (e.g., Polychroni et al. (2013)
or Soler et al. (2020), we refer also to the discussion in Sect. 2
of Schisano et al. (2014))."
"In a similar way we estimate the S/N for filaments at 353
GHz from the smoothed Planck intensity map. Following Planck
2015 results. XXVIII. (2016) we use a 12.◦5 x 12.◦5 field at
l = 90◦, b = −80◦ to determine the background noise. Accord-
ingly the 353 GHz FIR filaments used in our analysis exceed an
average S/N level of 30 all sky and 18 at high latitudes. This is
only about 1/4 of the S/N in H i but still high enough that we do
not need to be worried about hidden noise biases in Fig. 20 and
other parts of our analysis. Montier et al. (2015) consider un-
certainties on polarization fraction and angle measurements of
Planck polarization data and conclude that these measurements
are little affected by uncertainties for an intensity S/N level above
10. Skalidis & Pelgrims (2019) determined the dependences be-
tween beam depolarization and smoothing radius of 353 GHz
Planck data. They describe in their Appendix A that a smoothing
radius of 20′ results in the best compromise to mitigate the beam
depolarization and work with sufficiently high quality data."

(2004) dominates the curvature distribution only for such scales."
"For Kolmogorov turbulence the energy that feeds the turbu-
lence is injected at an outer scale of ∼ 100 pc (Kalberla & Haud
2019). The energy cascades then down to the viscous dissipation
scale (called Kolmogorov inner scale in purely hydrodynamic
systems). It is important to realize that the small-scale turbulent
dynamo can feed energy in the opposite way. It acts initially be-
low the viscous scale of ∼ 10−2 pc (Schekochihin et al. 2004) but
perturbations in the magnetic field can propagate to larger scales.
The dynamo leads initially to an exponential magnetic energy
growth. A sketch of scale ranges and energy spectra is given in
Sect. 1.2 of Schekochihin et al. (2004) with their Fig. 1. Folding
of the magnetic fields causes magnetic tension forces with a back
reaction on the turbulent flow. The system becomes increasingly
nonlinear. Geometrically, one observes that stretched structures
and flux sheets are converted to flux ribbons. In this so-called sat-
urated stage, low curvatures are more dominant and the peak of
the curvature distribution has shifted up and to small curvatures
(see Fig. 25 of Schekochihin et al. 2004). For 353 GHz Stokes
parameters (unaffected by biases from spatial filtering) the peak
is at |C| ∼ 0.4 deg−1, corresponding to radii R >∼ 2.5◦. The kinetic
energy on larger scales has to be fed in by external sources. It is
expected that the dynamo saturates with an equilibrium between
magnetic and kinetic energy. According to Schekochihin (2020,
Sect. 12) details about the final state of the saturated small-scale
dynamo remain however an unsolved problem, both numerically
(due to lack of resolution) and theoretically (due to lack of the-
oreticians). Beresnyak (2012, his Fig. 1) argues that most of the
magnetic energy may be concentrated at the scale correspond-
ing to the peak in the curvature distribution. Supernovae are the
dominant sources of turbulent energy in the ISM (Mac Low &
Klessen 2004) and may play a major role in this case. The size
distribution of H i shells in the outer Galaxy as potential sources
for diameters larger than 1.◦5 was studied by Ehlerová & Palouš
(2013) and is in good agreement with the observed distribution
of filaments at low and intermediate latitudes."
"According to Schekochihin et al. (2004) the timescale for
the growth of the small-scale magnetic energy is characterized
by the viscous eddy turnover time in the order of 105 years. The
mean-field dynamo theory predicts a large-scale galactic field
exponentiating timescale in a rotation time of ∼ 108 years. Thus
the small-scale dynamo is very fast. These timescales may be
compared to the typical cooling time of ∼ 1.4 105 years for the
CNM and ∼ 5 107 years for the WNM. Shocks due to super-
novae are expected to occur every ∼ 5 106 years (Kalberla &
Kerp 2009). In this situation the WNM can hardly be in equi-
librium while phase transitions to the CNM can easily be trig-
gered by a small-scale dynamo. In consequence, cold structures
in the diffuse ISM that are driven by a small-scale dynamo, must
evolve from small to large scales. Balsara & Kim (2005) studied
the magnetic field amplification in the ISM by supernova-driven
turbulence. They find a field amplification that increases with
volume density as |B| ∝ ρ0.386 and conclude that the field am-
plification takes place more vigorously in the lower temperature,
denser gas."
"Several authors have studied the role of the magnetic field in
molecular cloud formation and evolution. These investigations
have been reviewed by Hennebelle & Inutsuka (2019). From
MHD simulations the consensus is that the magnetic field is
strongly shaping the interstellar gas by generating a lot of fil-
aments. For the diffuse H i distribution with column densities
below NH = 1021.7 cm−2 the filaments are aligned with the mag-
netic field. Recent investigations of phase transitions by Falle"
"et al. (2020) emphasize that cooling behind a shock is affected
by the magnetic field. Even a small initial magnetic field can
lead to a magnetically dominated state on the unstable part of
the equilibrium curve. These authors conclude that the magnetic
field must dominate in the final state of shocks even for an im-
plausibly small initial magnetic field strength and derive filament
widths of ∼ 0.52 pc (Figs. 11 and 12 of Falle et al. 2020)."
"The coherence between cold CNM and magnetized filamen-
tary structures on small scales is explainable in the framework
of these investigations. For the case of a magnetic pressure con-
finement of CNM filaments Kalberla et al. (2016) derived a me-
dian filament thickness of 0.09 pc assuming that the distance to
the filaments is on average 100 pc. This estimate is consistent
with Clark et al. (2014) who use better resolved Arecibo tele-
scope observations and find largely unresolved structures, cor-
responding to a scale of 0.12 pc or below. Such structures have
so far not been related to the small-scale dynamo. Shukurov &
Sokoloff (2007) and Rincon (2019) consider the turbulent mag-
netic field as presumably confined to the WNM. If we, however,
think about the simplified case of a flux tube compression in
ideal MHD, we find that, in the case of phase transitions, the
gas density and the magnetic field strength in such tubes should
be amplified (Heiles & Crutcher 2005, Sect. 4.4). Phase tran-
sitions coupled to flux tubes may eventually lead to a balance
between magnetic and gaseous pressure with typical parameters
as used by Kalberla et al. (2016) in their Sect. 5.12 (see also
Heiles & Troland 2005, Sect. 7.2, for discussion). For a mag-
netically confined CNM it is necessary to have a sufficient large
magnetic field outside. Observational evidence for a flux tube
scenario was reported by Kalberla et al. (2020, Sect. 3.3). In this
context it may be worth to reconsider the equilibrium arguments
given by Beresnyak (2012) by including local interactions from
phase transitions."
"Power spectra for the local CNM distribution show a re-
markable power excess at multipoles l >∼ 100, corresponding
to scales below ∼ 180◦/100 = 1.8◦ (Kalberla & Haud 2019).
This is the range that we find to be occupied by the small-scale
dynamo in Fig. 20. Characteristic for this excess is a notable
shift to higher values of l when decreasing the width of the an-
alyzed velocity slices or decreasing the Doppler temperature of
the H i distribution under consideration (Fig. 15 of Kalberla et
al. 2020). The power excess for the coldest structures is at mul-
tipoles l >∼ 500, corresponding to scales of 180◦/500 ∼ 20′ (see
Fig. 15 of Kalberla et al. 2020)"
"The so far unexplained excess in turbulent CNM power spec-
tra (Kalberla et al. 2020) is compatible with the transition be-
tween large and small-scale turbulent driving from our current
analysis. On multipoles l >∼ 100 the small-scale dynamo is dom-
inant. Last but not least we need to take into account that λ+,
the second eigenvalue of the Hessian operator H from Eq. 2, dis-
closes numerous unresolved structures along filaments at simi-
lar scales (see Fig. 1). These sources are also cold (Sect. 3.1.2)
and belong therefore to the excess part of the exponential power
distribution for the CNM. The coherence between FIR and H i
filaments exists only for cold H i (Sect. 3.1.1) and turbulence is
in this case affected by the small-scale dynamo. The injection
of turbulent energy on small scales implies additional power at
large multipoles and correspondingly a flattening of the CNM
power spectra in comparison to multiphase H i power spectra.
Changes of the spectral index depending on the phase composi-
tion of the H i (Kalberla & Haud 2019) are expected."

4.2. Curvature versus filament strength
"In the saturated state of the small-scale dynamo the magnetic
field strength and the curvature are anticorrelated, |B| ∝ C−1/2
(Fig. 17 of Schekochihin et al. 2004, Figs. 5, 15, and 17 of
Schekochihin et al. 2004, and Fig. 5 of St-Onge & Kunz 2018).
Sharply curved fields (high C values or small radii) imply a high
field tension and the field strength is reduced. The anticorrela-
tion between field strength and curvature implies that the most
prominent straight filaments popping up in FIR or H imaps must
be indicating high values for the field strength and polarization
fraction (little depolarization by tangling). For a prominent ex-
ample we refer to a display of the Riegel–Crutcher cloud, Figs.
10 and 12 of Clark et al. (2014), as well as McClure-Griffiths et
al. (2006)."
"To allow a general comparison between curvatures C and
strength of filamentary structures we use the eigenvalues λ− as
proxies for the strength of the magnetic field. The relation be-
tween λ− and the intensity of a filamentary structure, hence the
strength of the magnetic field, is nonlinear. λ− depends on the
second-order partial derivatives but we expect that the promi-
nence of filaments is related to λ− (see Fig. 5 of Kalberla et
al. 2016). Figure 21 displays the two-dimensional distribution
of observed local filament curvatures C and eigenvalues −λ− on
a logarithmic scale, verifying the expected relation. The most
prominent filaments have low curvatures, leading to their de-
scription as fibers. Tangled worm-like structures have low inten-
sities, are less prominent and have therefore previously mostly
been discarded when discussing filamentary structures (e.g., by"

"pHI must be related to C. Here we must take geometrical effects
into account. The curvature |C| is derived from bending of fila-
ments in the plane of the sky while the H i polarization fraction
pHI is defined along the line of sight. Small curvatures imply
high magnetic field strengths with high internal coherence and
H i polarization fractions. Figure 22 shows on top the observed
relation between C and pHI at latitudes |b| > 20◦; all sky results
are similar but not displayed. The highest polarization fractions
are reached for filaments with the lowest curvatures as expected
for a small-scale dynamo."
"We repeat the calculations by modeling as in Sect. 4.1 a ran-
dom distribution of orientation angles. We consider the same
sample of positions along the filaments except that now the an-
gles θ from Eq. 3 are replaced by a random distribution in ve-
locity. The result is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 22. We
find nowhere an indication that a spurious polarization signal of
this kind could affect our results, the orientation angles θ in our
analysis are well defined"
"The FIR and H i coherence is not the only case that hints
to relations between H i filaments and magnetism. Three fields
that allow a detailed comparison of filamentary structures ob-
servable with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) as polarimet-
ric filaments in close connection to cold H i filaments have been
studied previously by Kalberla & Kerp (2016) and Kalberla et
al. (2017). The LOFAR observations revealed strikingly linear"
"coherent structures in Faraday depth, including some prominent
filaments several degrees in length. The orientations of the LO-
FAR structures are affected by magnetic fields in the warm ion-
ized medium. The observed alignment between magneto-ionic
structures and H i filaments in these fields implies that the H i
filaments are shaped by the magnetic field. The data from these
polarimetric studies are displayed in the middle of Fig. 22 for
comparison. This plot shows statistical uncertainties from the
restricted number of analyzed filaments but there are no indi-
cations for any noise biases as documented in the lower panel.
The two-dimensional density distribution of C against pHI shows
a similar trend as the distribution from FIR and H i structures at
high latitudes, except that the polarization fractions in the case
of the polarimetric filaments are somewhat lower. We question
that the lower polarization is significant; a part of the filaments
are close to the Galactic plane and may suffer from confusion.
The investigations on these radio-polarimetric structures indicate
anisotropies and systematic changes of turbulent power spectra
for those parts of the H i velocity distribution that are associated
with the magneto-ionic medium, we refer to Kalberla & Kerp
(2016) and Kalberla et al. (2017) for details."

5. Curvature changes across flux tube envelopes
"The determination of filament properties and curvatures in the
previous sections was limited either to FIR filaments or to H i
structures in narrow channels with best fit velocities vfil as de-
termined in Sect. 2.5. We adopt here the working hypothesis
that these filaments stand for structures of magnetized flux tubes
in the diffuse ISM. Coherent FIR and H i structures at positions
with the best fit velocities vfil (Fig. 18) represent in such a model
the central parts, the bones of the flux tubes. We intend in this
section to determine the properties of filament envelopes along
the flux tubes at positions deviating from the central parts. We
distinguish structures with positional offsets in the plane of the
sky but also entities along the line of sight with velocities that
differ from vfil."
5.1. Structural changes at offset velocities
"Curvatures that we discussed in the previous sections depend
on positions and orientation angles that are defined only along
the filaments at velocities vfil. Considering deviating velocities
∆vLSR = |vLSR − vfil| we may expect that on average structures
with increasing offsets ∆vLSR are also offset increasingly in dis-
tance. For a turbulent medium the characteristic velocities vl and
v0 at scales l and l0 are related according to vl/v0 = (l/l0)1/3"
"(e.g., Frisch 1996, Sect. 7.6). Considering H i channels at ve-
locities offsets from vfil would accordingly allow the flux tube
properties far from the central parts to be determined, though an
exact scaling between velocity and distance is missing."
"We extend the calculation of curvatures to all individual H i
channels and consider at each filament position also the veloc-
ities vfil ± ∆vLSR for |∆vLSR| < 25 km s−1. To avoid any noise
biases we use identical criteria as in Sect. 2.5 for the signif-
icance of filamentary structures. We characterize systematical
changes in curvature between envelope and center of the flux
tube by the ratio RC(∆vLSR) = C(vfil + ∆vLSR)/C(vfil). Figure 23
displays two-dimensional histograms of curvatures C and curva-
ture ratios RC at velocity offsets of ∆vLSR = 1, 4, and 16 km s−1.
We observe the general trend that for increasing velocity offsets
∆vLSR the curvature ratios RC increase. In other words, the fila-
ment curvatures increase systematically when considering outer
filament layers that are characterized by increasing velocity off-
sets |∆vLSR|. Considering the prognosis that the magnetic field
strength and curvature are for a small-scale dynamo anticorre-
lated, |B| ∝ C−1/2 (Schekochihin et al. (2004), Schekochihin et
al. (2004), and St-Onge & Kunz (2018)), we conclude that the
magnetic field of the low curvature segments in the centers of
the flux tubes must be enhanced relative to the more curled en-
vironments. These central parts are most significant (see Sect.
4.2). The eigenvalues λ− increase systematically with increasing"

5.2. Structures offset in position
"Changes in filamentary structures for narrow H i channels can
also be observed at positions offset from the central parts of
the filaments. However, the disadvantage of such an analysis is
that we can no longer track curvatures along the bones of the
filaments. Curvatures in the previous sections were determined
along the filament ridges but for offset positions this orientation
is lost. We can only determine average local curvatures that can
be related to the curvature at the closest filament position with

"that the most significant structure with the lowest λ− value at
the position l, b is found at a velocity that deviates from vfil at the
nearest position l f , b f . Accordingly we need to change definition
for the curvature ratios to RC(D) = C(l, b, vLSR)/C(l f , b f , vfil).
In Fig. 24 we display these ratios for H i layers in the velocity
ranges |vLSR − vfil| ≤ 1, 4, and 16 km s−1. RC(D) can in most
cases only be traced to D <∼ 1◦. Searching for related filamentary
structures up to distances D ∼ 10◦ needed lots of CPU time but
remained without success."
"The plots in Fig. 24 are not directly comparable to those in
Fig. 23 but they tell the same. Curvatures for structures offset
in velocity-position space from the central parts of flux tubes
increase significantly in comparison to curvatures along cen-
tral bones of the filaments. Increased curvatures imply increased
curling of magnetic field lines with decreasing field strengths
according to predictions for the small-scale dynamo. Such struc-"
"tures have lower H i intensities and the λ− values are less signif-
icant."
5.3. Structures in H i column densities and FIR
"We repeated the analysis from the previous subsection but sub-
stituted the individual channel maps with a single H i column
density map for |vLSR| < 50. The result is shown in Fig. 25 on
the left. In this case we find no evidence for systematic changes
of the curvature distributions with significant preferences in cur-
vature radius as observed in Figs. 23 and 24. Averaging across
numerous filaments smears out any information on the curvature
of the ISM. Structures along the line of sight but outside the fil-
aments are weaker, accordingly tangling causes de-correlation
when integrating in velocity. The same effect occurs if we con-
sider the distribution of FIR intensities. Figure 25 shows that the
curvature distributions in FIR (right) replicate the distributions
for NHI on the left hand side."
"As discussed in Sect. 2.6, a coherent velocity field along the
filaments is only detectable if we recognize that the FIR fil-
aments are associated with H i structures on small scales. We
demonstrated in Sect. 3 that these features are cold. Accordingly
they need to be analyzed with narrow channel spacings. Inte-
grating in velocity smears out structures caused by the CNM.
The differences between Figs. 23 and 24 on one side and Fig.
25 on the other side demonstrate impressively observer’s obliga-
tion to obey the sampling theorem (Blackman & Tukey (1958)
and Shannon & Weaver (1975)). Otherwise sensitive informa-
tion about cold turbulent structures on small scales, imprinted
on the velocity field, gets lost. This information is available in
full resolution three-dimensional spectral H i data with sufficient
sensitivity but not in two-dimensional Planck FIR observations"

"or H i data that are missing the third dimension. The necessity to
consider the three-dimensional distribution in the ISM was also
demonstrated recently by Pelgrims et al. (2021) when studying
the line of sight frequency decorrelation of polarized dust emis-
sion along the line of sight."
6. Summary and discussion
"Filamentary H i structures are known to be well aligned with the
plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation as measured with optical
starlight polarization and polarized thermal dust emission (e.g.,
Clark 2018). This tight correlation exists for narrow velocity in-
tervals only, and the orientation of these features is found to be
coherent in velocity space. Clark (2018) and Clark & Hensley
(2019) propose using this H i coherence to define for such struc-
tures an H i polarization along the line of sight. Analogous to
optical polarization that can be produced by transition through
aligned structures in refracting media, this H i polarization is
indicative of coherence and alignment in H i filaments. It was
shown by Clark & Hensley (2019) that H i Stokes parameter
maps are comparable to the Planck 353 GHz Q and U maps
of polarized dust emission. At a resolution of 80′, many of the
large-scale features are reproduced in H i."
"Here we study the FIR and H i coherence in more detail with
a better spatial resolution. We consider the more sensitive Planck
857 GHz FIR data smoothed to 18′ resolution. For the H iwe use
unsmoothed HI4PI data at resolutions of 10.′8 for EBHIS and
14.′5 for the GASS survey. Using the Hessian operator, we ex-
tract filaments simultaneously for both data sets and determine
alignment angles along the filaments. We consider several mea-
sures for the alignment of the filamentary structures, and these
indicate in all cases that the alignment on small scales improves
significantly with respect to previous determinations on scales
of around one degree. For H i in narrow velocity intervals of 1
km s−1, we obtain an excellent alignment between FIR and H i
filaments, indicating a close coherence between FIR and CNM.
These filamentary structures are also coherent in velocity space
and, in general, are cold. Following Clark (2018) and Clark &
Hensley (2019), we determine in Sect. 3.3 the H i polarization
along the line of sight and find for filamentary structures an av-
erage H i polarization fraction of 30% with peak values around
80%. This is a factor of two to three more than reported in previ-
ous determinations. Since we did not apply any smoothing to the
H i data, we probe, at an assumed distance of 100 pc (e.g., Sfeir
et al. 1999), regions of about 0.3 pc."
"We probed the velocity structure of the H i counterparts for
the FIR filaments and discovered a well-defined coherent veloc-
ity field. Filaments are local phenomena with center velocities
around 0 km s−1. The FWHM width of this distribution is 16.6
km s−1. Along the filaments the typical velocity dispersion is
V = 5.5 km s−1. Most of the H i filaments are associated with the
CNM. Toward the structures investigated here we also observe
Doppler temperatures that are lower by up to a factor of six for
the accompanied LNM and WNM gas, implying a CNM in cold
cores of a multiphase medium in phase transition. Low Doppler
temperatures imply that FIR and H i coherence is best defined in
narrow velocity intervals and probably also in small and dense
regions in the centers of the filaments. The spatial distribution
of the velocity field in comparison to velocity dispersionsV and
harmonic mean Doppler temperatures shows common structures
for most of the prominent filaments, indicating that velocity dis-
persions and Doppler temperatures are correlated along these fil-
aments."
"The polarization angle dispersion S introduced in Planck
Collaboration Int. XIX. (2015) measures fluctuations of the po-
larization angle along FIR filaments. The total angular scale
probed by us is four times the 18′ FIR resolution, hence five
to six times the H i beam, or about 2 pc at an assumed distance
of 100 pc. At such a scale we find, for a large fraction of the po-
sitions, significant fluctuations in the position angles relative to
the center position. Contrary to previous investigations by Clark
& Hensley (2019), we find no indications for a negative corre-
lation between S and the polarization fraction pHI. We confirm,
however, the inverse correlation between S and p353 at 353 GHz
from Stokes parameters, derived previously mostly on angular
scales between 80′ and 160′ (Planck Collaboration Int. XIX.
2015, Planck intermediate results XXXVIII. 2016, Clark 2018,
Clark & Hensley 2019, and Planck 2018 results XII. 2020)."
"The high spatial resolution of our analysis allows us to pa-
rameterize the bending of filamentary structures in terms of
a curvature distribution P(C). We find a distribution that is
well approximated by curvatures, as predicted in the frame-
work of a small-scale turbulent dynamo by Schekochihin et al.
(2002). From our data we derive an excellent agreement with
the predicted curvature distribution (Schekochihin et al. 2002
and Schekochihin et al. 2004). This agreement is, however, lim-
ited to curvatures |C| >∼ 1 deg"
"−1, corresponding to tangling radii
of R <∼ 1◦. While the small-scale turbulent dynamo acts be-
low this scale, the turbulent energy on the largest scales must be
fed by external sources, most probably by supernovae. We con-
firm the prediction that for a small-scale dynamo field strengths
and curvatures are anticorrelated (Schekochihin et al. 2002 and
Schekochihin et al. 2004). The most prominent parts of the fila-
ments have the lowest curvatures, and, accordingly, these struc-
tures should have the strongest fields. The curling in envelopes
around the filaments increases significantly, implying a decay of
the field outside the central parts of the flux tubes. Furthermore,
we find that curvature is in general correlated with filament co-
herence along the line of sight, characterized by the H i polariza-
tion fraction."
"Our results on coherent FIR and H i structures are for |C| >∼
1 deg−1 incompatible with simulations of anisotropic MHD tur-
bulence in several of the fields selected by Planck intermedi-
ate results. XX. (2015). Throughout those simulations there is a
large-scale anisotropic component of the magnetic field, as well
as a turbulent component linked to the velocity perturbations im-
posed on converging flows. From our results we conclude that
the spatial coherence of magnetized FIR and H i filaments is
shaped by magnetic fields that were amplified by a small-scale
turbulent dynamo. Turbulence emerging from small scales can
change the spectral index of the turbulent flow at those veloci-
ties, which are characteristic for FIR and H i coherence. In the
framework of a small-scale turbulent dynamo, it is also easy to
support, on a Galactic scale, phase transitions in a magnetically
dominated state, as considered recently by Falle et al. (2020)."
"One of the main conclusions by Schekochihin et al. (2004)
is that the fully developed, forced, isotropic MHD turbulence is
the saturated state of the small-scale dynamo. In this case the
kinetic energy spectrum is dominated by the outer scale and has
a steeper-than-Kolmogorov scaling in the inertial range, while
the magnetic energy is dominated by small scales, at which it
substantially exceeds the kinetic energy. The strongest part of
the local Galactic H i emission extends over large fractions of
the sky at velocities close to zero. Assuming that this emission
is representative of a fully developed MHD turbulence driven
by a large-scale dynamo, we expect steep power spectra for this
part of the multiphase H i. Focusing our attention on the coldest"
"Article number, page 24 of 25"
"P. M. W. Kalberla, J. Kerp & U. Haud: Coherence in H i filaments"
"part of the CNM, with volume filling factors at a 5% level (e.g.,
Murray et al. 2020), we find coherence between H i structures
and the distribution of magnetic field lines. We find evidence that
this range is dominated by the magnetic energy and the small-
scale dynamo. Cold neutral medium power spectra are expected
to be shallow in comparison to the large-scale, dominating part
of the warmer H i distribution with excess power from structures
on small scales."
"In addition to filamentary structures, we find local condensa-
tions – numerous blobs – located along the filaments. These are
cold coherent FIR and H i structures, point-like at 18′ resolution,
but they share the properties of the filaments. This additional
cold small-scale emission is consistent with the excess power
observed in power spectra of the CNM at the highest spatial fre-
quencies (Kalberla & Haud 2019). Since filaments are in general
cold and restricted locally to small scales, it is also plausible that
the CNM power spectra are shallower compared to multiphase
power spectra since the power at high spatial frequencies is in-
creased by the small-scale dynamo. Cold structures, driven by a
small-scale dynamo, must evolve from small to large scales. Tur-
bulence in the local diffuse ISM has to be related to phase tran-
sitions, but observational evidence currently appears to be disre-
garded in many theoretical investigations (Clark et al. 2019).
