ABSTRACT
"The observed features of the radio sources indicate complex propagation effects em-
bedded in the waves of solar radio bursts. In this work, we perform ray-tracing simula-
tions on radio wave transport in the corona and interplanetary region with anisotropic
electron density fluctuations. For the first time, the variation of the apparent source
size, burst duration, and source position of both fundamental emission and harmonic
emission at frequency 35 MHz are simulated as the function of the anisotropic param-
eter α and the angular scattering rate coefficient η = �2/h0, where �"
"2 = 〈δn2〉/n2 is
the density fluctuation level and h0 is its correlation length near the wave exciting site.
It is found that isotropic fluctuations produce a much larger decay time than a highly
anisotropic fluctuation for fundamental emission. By comparing the observed duration
and source size with the simulation results in the parameter space, we can estimate the
scattering coefficient and the anisotropy parameter η = 8.9× 10−5 km−1 and α = 0.719
with point pulse source assumption. Position offsets due to wave scattering and refrac-
tion can produce the co-spatial of fundamental and harmonic waves in observations of
some type III radio bursts. The visual speed due to the wave propagation effect can
reach 1.5 c for η = 2.4 × 10−4 km−1 and α = 0.2 for fundamental emission in the sky
plane, accompanying with large expansion rate of the source size. The visual speed
direction is mostly identical to the offset direction, thus, for the observation aiming at
obtaining the source position, the source centroid at the starting point is closer to the
wave excitation point."

1. INTRODUCTION
"The imaging and spectroscopy observations of the solar radio bursts can provide information on
the non-thermal electrons associated with the transient energy release in the solar active region and
parameters of the background plasma. For example, McCauley et al. (2018) inspected the background
density of the solar corona with the interferometric imaging of Type III radio bursts in the frequency
range of 80-240 MHz. High-cadence radio imaging spectroscopy shows evidence of the existence of
particle acceleration by solar flare termination shock (Chen et al. 2015; Yu et al. 2020). The combined
observations of radio imaging and extreme ultraviolet /white-light imaging indicate that the particle
acceleration occurs at the flank of coronal mass ejection shock (Chrysaphi et al. 2018; Morosan et al.
2019; Chen et al. 2014). The imaging spectroscopy study with LOw Frequency Array (LOFAR)
reveals that the velocity dispersion of the electron beams is a key factor for the duration of type III
radio burst (Zhang et al. 2019)."
"The corona plasma is an in-homogeneous refractive media for solar radio waves, so the refraction
and scattering can cause the deformation of the observed radio source including the expansion of the
source size, the offset of the visual source position from the wave generation position (Wild et al.
1959; Kontar et al. 2017; Bisoi et al. 2018), and the duration broadening in the dynamic spectrum
(Zhang et al. 2019). Generally, the refraction can cause the inward offset of the visual source from
the position of wave excitation (Mann et al. 2018). The visual source could be shifted outward if the
scattering is considered (Stewart 1972, 1976; Arzner & Magun 1999; Kontar et al. 2019). For the wave
of solar radio burst with fundamental-harmonic (F-H) pair structure, the H-emission is generated at
a higher height than the F-emission with the same frequency due to the plasma emission mechanism,
while imaging result indicates that the source of F and H emission can have a similar position for
some bursts (Stewart 1972; Dulk & Suzuki 1980). This seems to indicate that the waves of F-emission
and H-emission have experienced different amounts of refraction and scattering."
"For a given frequency, the Langmuir wave excitation responsible for type III emission is limited to
the cross-section of the guiding magnetic field line for the electrons and the layer with local plasma
frequency close to 1 or 1/2 times of the radio wave frequency. The structure of the magnetic field and
the distribution of the background density is stable within the time scale of electron beam transit
time. Thus the excitation site at a fixed frequency is stable in both size and position. While the
visual velocity and expansion rate of the observed sources can be very large. Kontar et al. (2017)
observed 1/4 c radial speed with LOFAR beamformed observation of the fundamental part of a type
IIIb striae, where c is the speed of light. Kuznetsov et al. (2020) observed 1/3 c at 32 MHz in a drift
pair radio burst. The interferometric imaging with the remote baseline of LOFAR finds about 4 c
visual speed for the fundamental part of a type III-IIIb pair event source at 26 MHz (Zhang et al.
2020). The observed source size of the radio burst is also considerably larger than the size estimated
from the bandwidth of the striae (Kontar et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2020). The fast variations of the
source is believed to be due to the wave propagation effects."
"The ray-tracing simulation is an effective method to investigate the wave propagation effects, which
can help us interpreting the imaging and spectroscopy observation and diagnosing the solar corona
properties from the observation results (Steinberg et al. 1971; Riddle 1974). The ray-tracing method
is introduced to the solar radio study by Fokker (1965) to investigate the source size of type I radio
burst due to the scattering effect. Bougeret & Steinberg (1977) indicated that the over-dense fiber
structures in the coronal should be considered to understand the position of the radio source, the"
Wave propagation effects on the source of solar radio bursts 3
"moving bursts, and the great variety of space-time shapes observed within the same storm center,
and Robinson (1983) introduced fiber in-homogeneity into the ray tracing simulation and find that
the in-homogeneity of the medium can account for the source displacement. It has been pointed
out that the anisotropic scattering of the wave due to the statistical inhomogeneity is essential to
interpret the observed radio source properties (Arzner & Magun 1999; Kontar et al. 2019; Bian et al.
2019). Recently, Kontar et al. (2019) developed a model to include the anisotropic scattering of the
wave in the ray tracing process. It was found that the duration of type III radio burst decrease
with the anisotropy level of the background, and the anisotropic density fluctuations are required to
account for the source sizes and decay times simulaneously. The theory of anisotropic scattering has
been successfully used to interpret the source properties of the drift pair bursts(Kuznetsov & Kontar
2019; Kuznetsov et al. 2020)."
"These case studies of observation with the corresponding simulation have shown that the ray-tracing
is an effective method to analyze the wave propagation effect, while the detailed dependency relation
between the observed source characteristics and the density fluctuation properties of the medium
is still unclear. A further understanding of the physical process behind the visual source variation
requires more detailed simulation-observation comparison study."
"In this work, for the first time, we performed a large set of Monte Carlo simulations of the radio
wave propagation by ray tracing to explore a parameter-space study on the radio source properties
with various background plasma parameters. The paper is arranged as flows: in Section 2, the model
used in the simulation is introduced. Section 3 shows the simulation results of the radio source
size, duration, and position for fundamental waves and harmonic waves at 35 MHz. The results are
discussed and compared in Section 4, and a brief summary is given in Section 5."
2. SIMULATION MODEL

3. SIMULATION RESULTS
"With the anisotropic scattering model, we can perform ray-tracing simulation for the photons
launched at a given position. After sufficient steps forward, when the majority of the photons
reached 0.95 AU of heliocentric distance, the final positions (r) and wave vectors (k) of the photons
near the direction of observation are collected to reconstruct the radio image. The observed position
of each photon in the sky plane is estimated by back-tracking the wave vector. The apparent source
intensity map I(x, y) is the weighted photon number density distribution in the sky plane, and the
spread of photon arrival times determines the temporal variation of the source."
"In the simulation, the background density function n(r) is assumed to be spherically symmetric,
the same as the model used in Kontar et al. (2019). The source of radio emission is considered to be
a point pulse source, the photons are launched at the starting point at the same time. The initiate
wave vectors are randomly distributed in an outward direction (r · k > 0), namely, a burst source
with isotropic emission is considered."
"As a case study, Figure 1 shows the flux intensity map reconstructed from all collected photons for
fundamental emission, representing the time integral imaging of the observed source. Figure 2 shows
the time-intensity profile and the temporal variations of the source position and size, which is obtained
from photons with arrival times within the corresponding time segment. In this simulation case, the
radio waves are fundamental waves initiated at the position angle (θ0, φ0) = (20"
"◦, 0◦), where θ is the
longitude and φ is the latitude. The density fluctuation level is � = 0.28 and the anisotropy parameter
is α = 0.72. The equivalent correlation length (h0) at the starting point r0 = 1.750Rs is about 860 km,
and the corresponding value of the angular scattering rate coefficient is η ' 9× 10−5 km−1 near the
wave generation site."
"In Figure 1, the source centroid offsets 0.11Rs in x direction from the starting point (marked as
green ‘+’ in the figure). The offset in y direction is negligible. This is because the centroid offset
is in the radial direction due to the spherical symmetry of the density model used, which is in the
x direction in the sky plane for the case shown in this figure. The blue line in Figure 1 shows the
full width half maximum (FWHM) estimation of the reconstructed source. The statistical results
of time duration, FWHM size, the visual speed, and size expansion rate can be extracted from the
reconstructed imaging and its variation."
"The FWHM of the time-intensity profile can be divided into two phases, namely the rising and
decay phase. We fitted the flux variation with a double Gaussian function (Zhang et al. 2019):"

is the decay phase. The duration of the rising phase and decay phase are τR = 0.4 and τD = 2.0
seconds for this case."
"The source offset measures the vector distance between the observed centroid and the starting point
of the photons in the sky plane. In this case, the average offset is 0.105Rs during the rising phase
and 0.115Rs during the decay phase, the offset in y direction is negligible (less than 0.002Rs)."

direction is 0.538Rs (0.143"

"source FWHM size in y direction is slightly larger than that in x direction.

"fit of the variation of the source position and size with time. From Figure 2, we can see that, the
source behaves differently in movement and expansion during the rising and decay phase, for this
case, the moving speed and the expansion rate are both larger in the rising phase. The source size
has a positive expansion rate in both x and y direction."

lines. The simulation parameters are the same as Figure 1."
"In order to study the properties and variations of the source in different parameter sets, namely
the density fluctuation level and the anisotropic scale, we run the above simulation process in the
parameter space of α ∈ [0.05, 0.99] and � ∈ [0.03, 0.45]. We uniformly select 36 × 36 points in the
parameter space. For each case of parameter set (�, α), a simulation of 3× 105 photons is conducted.
In each case, the frequency of the wave is assumed to be 35 MHz, the frequency ratio between the
wave and local plasma frequency at the starting point (f0/fpe) is 1.1 for fundamental emission and
2.0 for harmonic emission. The photons are launched at the center of the solar disk (θ0 = φ0 = 0),
for fundamental emission r0 = 1.750Rs and h0 = 860 km, for harmonic emission r0 = 2.104Rs and
h0 = 1010 km. The angular scattering rate coefficient η changes in the range between 8.9×10−7 km−1
to 2.4× 10−4 km−1 for � ∈ [0.03, 0.45]. The statistical result of the source properties is presented in
the following subsections."
3.1. Source size and duration
"The source size and duration are the most common information that can be extracted from the
imaging and spectroscopy observations of solar radio bursts. In this subsection, the source size is"
8 Zhang et al.
"measured as the intensity weighted FWHM size for all collected photons in the simulation as done
in Figure 1. The decay time is measured as the time of intensity decreasing by 1/e from the peak,
namely, τD."
"The source size and decay time of the fundamental emission (f0/fpe = 1.1) is shown in Figure 3.
Within the parameter space, the source size varies from 0.2 to 0.95 solar radii and the decay time
varies from about 0 to 7 seconds. The source size is largely determined by the fluctuation variance
value (or the scattering coefficient η), the tendency of contour lines in Figure 3a is nearly parallel
to y-axes in the range of α > 0.1. The decay time is sensitive to both α and � (or η). The decay
time increases with the density fluctuation level and the anisotropy parameter, thus decrease with
the anisotropy degree in the density fluctuation."

source size varies from 0.1 to 0.9 Rs and the decay time varies from 0 to 0.7 seconds within the

harmonic emission is slightly smaller than the size of fundamental emission with a value of about
0.1Rs, while the decay time of harmonic emission is significantly smaller than the fundamental
emission. Both the source size and duration are not sensitive to the variation of fluctuation anisotropy
for α > 0.2."

properties, compared with the corresponding observation. According to the previous fitted result of
multiple observations for the source size and decay time of type III radio bursts (Kontar et al. 2019),

3.2. Position offset of the source
"In Section 3.1, the starting point is set as in the center of the solar disk, and the centroid of the
reconstructed source is located near (0, 0). Thus, the offset of the source from the starting point is
close to zero when the position angle of the starting point θ0 is 0. When the position angle of the
starting point is away from zero, the offset is not negligible. Considering the sphere-symmetric of
the background parameters, the simulated observation for a given θ0 can be obtained by rotating
the result wave vector (k) and (r) of all photons to the reverse angle direction of θ0 and redo the
photon collecting and image reconstruction process. For simplification without losing generality, we
use y0 = 0 for the starting point so that the simulated offset is mainly in the x direction. We measure
the offset in the x direction as ∆x = xobsc − x0. The source centroid xobsc is measured as the weighted
average position in x axis for all collected photons as in Figure 1."
"Different density fluctuation variance and anisotropic scale can result in different offset amounts.

"For further study of the source offset, we selected four cases with the parameter of � = 0.102, 0.354,
and α = 0.157, 0.802. These four cases represent the relatively high and low value of angular scatter-
ing rate and a relatively large and small degree of anisotropy. Figure 7 shows the offset ratio (∆x/x0)
of the source centroid to the starting point. The four panels of Figure 7 show that for all these four
parameter sets, the offset of fundamental emission is more outward than the harmonic emission. For
relatively small anisotropy parameter α (high degree of anisotropy), the relative offset for both fun-
damental and harmonic emission decrease with the position angle θ0. For relatively larger anisotropy
parameter α (low degree of anisotropy), the relative offset is stable when sin θ0 < 0.8, and increase
with position angle when sin θ0 > 0.8. Comparing the upper and lower column of Figure 7, one can"
12 Zhang et al.
"find that the value of relative offset is larger when the density fluctuation (or angular scattering rate)
is larger."
"Assuming the wave of fundamental and harmonic emission with the same given frequency is gen-
erated at the same angular direction from the solar center. The visual distance between the starting
points of the fundamental and the harmonic is ∆R sin θ0 in the sky plane, where ∆R is the height
difference between the starting points of the fundamental and harmonic wave. The source offset due
to the refraction and scattering will cause the observed visual distance to deviate from ∆R sin θ0. In
this work, for the wave of 35 MHz, the fundamental wave is generated at RF = 1.750Rs by assuming
f0/fpe = 1.1, the harmonic wave is generated at RH = 2.104Rs by assuming f0/fpe = 2.0, ∆R for
this case is 0.354Rs. Figure 8 shows the distance between the reconstructed source centroids of fun-
damental and harmonic for 35 MHz. From Figure 8 we can see that the value of the distance between
the reconstructed sources is significantly smaller than the visual distance of the starting points of the
two waves. In other words, the apparent sources of the fundamental and harmonic emission will be
much closer with each other than their true source in the sky plane."

respectively."
"From Figure 9 one can see that, the contribution of the refraction is in the positive-x direction for
the wave vector, while the contribution of scattering is in the negative-x direction. The influences
of both refraction and scattering effect are stronger for the fundamental wave than for the harmonic
wave in all four cases. When the scattering is more isotropic (α = 0.802 shown as cyan lines in the
right panel), the influence of scattering is overwhelmingly larger than the refraction effect for the
fundamental wave, while the influences on the harmonic wave are insignificant. For high anisotropic
scattering cases with small α (left panels in Figure 9), the value of ∆Kx for refraction is comparable
to the scattering."
"It needs to note that projecting the wave vector back to the sky plane, a positive change of the wave
vector in the x direction indicates a negative offset of the source position, and vice versa. Comparing
Figure 8 and 9, one can get that a larger angular scattering rate and more isotropic scattering would
cause the apparent positions of the fundamental and harmonic emission being closer to each other."

3.3. Source expansion rate and the source speed in the sky plane
"As the evolution of radio observation technology, the radio imaging can be carried out with high
time resolution, enabling the study of radio source variation within a solar radio burst, namely the
visual speed and expansion rate of the source."
"For the simulation, the temporal variation of the source properties can be obtained from the series
of the reconstructed source frame sectioned according to the arrival time of the photons, as shown in
Figure 2. For each parameter set (�, α), we linearly fit the time-distance profile of the source centroid
for the frames within the flux FWHM in the x direction, the resulting slope of the linear-fit yields the
visual speed (Vx). The Vx is calculated in the parameter space of � ∈ [0.03, 0.45] and α ∈ [0.05, 0.99]

"◦ and θ0 = 60
◦. Accordingly, the angular scattering"
"rate coefficient varies in the space of η ∈ [8.9× 10−7, 2.4× 10−4] km−1 for � ∈ [0.03, 0.45].
As shown in Figure 4 and 6, the duration broadening and position offset due to the wave propagation"
"effects are small for harmonic emission. Therefore, there is large uncertainty in linearly-fitting the
source variation trend of harmonic emission. Observation also shows that at a given frequency, the"

"Figure 10 shows the visual speed of the source of the fundamental emission. The scattering makes
the apparent source moving outward from the Sun. The patterns of the visual speed are similar for
30◦ and 60◦, and the major part of the parameter space is divided into two parts. The source tends
to have a small visual speed for the more isotropic background (α > 0.5) and large visual speed
requires the background to be highly anisotropic (α < 0.4). The visual speed reach the maximum
at about α = 0.2 and � = 0.45 (corresponds to η = 2.4× 10−4 km−1) within the parameter space for
both 30◦ and 60◦ of starting position angle. The maximum visual speed is about 0.65Rs/s or 1.5 c
for θ0 = 30"
"◦ and about 0.5Rs/s or 1.2 c for θ0 = 60
◦. The visual speed of the source with 30◦ starting"

of offset is mostly identical to the direction of visual speed within the parameter space."
"For calculating the expansion rate of source size, we use the cases that the original source is located
at the solar disk center. The expansion rate is measured as the slope of linear-fitting the FWHM
width in x axis for the flux intensity frames, within the time period defined by the FWHM range
in the time-intensity profile. Figure 11 shows the expansion rate. The large expansion rate mainly
gathers in the high anisotropic part (α < 0.4) within the parameter space. The expansion rate can
reach 1.4Rs/s or 22 Arcmin/s. Comparing Figure 10 and 11, one can find that the high expansion
rate of the source size is often associated with the large speed of the source apparent motion."

4. DISCUSSION
"In this study, the source in the calculation is assumed as point pulse source, while the real source
could have finite size and duration. Assuming there are no interaction between the electromagnetic
waves generated at different time and position, the observed source can be expressed as the convo-
lution of the point pulse response and the time spatial distribution of the real source. The beam
electron generation process at energy release site is considered to be fragmented (Benz 1994; Bastian
et al. 1998), the intrinsic radio sources can have complex spatial and temporal structures. One should
be cautious when the simulation results presented in Section 3 are directly compared with the obser-
vation results. For a burst element of the fragments like a type III burst in a given frequency, the
decay time is determined by the duration of the local excitation decay phase, the velocity dispersion
of beam electrons, and the propagation effects (Li et al. 2008; Ratcliffe et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2019).
The observed size of the source is determined by the real size of the wave excitation regime and the
broadening due to the propagation effect (Kontar et al. 2017). Thus, the anisotropic degree and
angular scattering rate estimated from the simulation results shown in Figure 3 using Equation (13)
and (14) are the upper limits. The radio burst with fine structures and the short term narrowband
radio bursts can provide more constraint on the parameters of the background. For example, the
wave generation site of the type IIIb radio burst is believed to be in a compact regime. The apparent
source size may be determined mainly by the propagation effects. However, the observed source size
varies largely from case to case, indicating that the variation of the corona density fluctuations."
"The density fluctuation variance and its length scale determine the angular scattering rate of the
radio wave. In the simulation of this work, the tuning parameter for the angular scattering rate is �.
The length scale is described by the inner scale (li) and outer scale (lo) of the fluctuation spectrum.
Both li and lo are obtained from empirical models (Coles & Harmon 1989; Wohlmuth et al. 2001). The
inner scale is considered to be the inertial length of ion d = vA/Ωi (Coles & Harmon 1989; Spangler
& Gwinn 1990), where vA is the local Alfven speed, Ωi is the gyro-frequency of ion. The outer scale
represents the scale of energy containing in fluctuation. The density fluctuation spectrum and cutoff
scales in the corona may be largely different in active region and quiet region. Observations from"
Wave propagation effects on the source of solar radio bursts 17
"multiple methods like the interplanetary scintillation observations (Chang et al. 2016), remote and
in situ observations can help constrain li, lo and �, as well as the angular scattering rate, and benefit
the simulation model for the radio wave ray-tracing. Also the radio burst observation combined with
simulation results can help to derive the density fluctuation property of the corona (Krupar et al.
2020)."
"For a given frequency, the wave generation position of fundamental and harmonic emission is at
different height according to the plasma emission. While observational results indicate that the
apparent source of fundamental and harmonic emission have co-spatial relationship for some type III
radio bursts (Dulk & Suzuki 1980). One possible interpretation on this is that the waves are generated
and confined in an density depleted tube (Duncan 1979; Wu et al. 2002). Alternatively, this may be
caused by the refraction and scattering of the waves in their way propagating from the exciting site
to the observer (Steinberg et al. 1971). In this work, we inspect the source offset and the relative
position of the fundamental and harmonic emission of 35 MHz. The results show that the scattering
effect can cause the centroid of the fundamental emission close to that of the harmonic emission. For
the four parameter sets shown in Figure 8, the visual distance of the reconstructed sources is closer
in the case of larger density fluctuation scale. For the case of � = 0.354 and α = 0.157, the position
difference xH − xF is negative, meaning the source of fundamental emission can appear even slightly
higher than the harmonic emission."
"The position offset due to the scattering and refraction is not negligible for metric radio bursts
generated far away from the solar disk center. The relative error caused by neglecting the wave
propagation effects could be up to 50% for the fundamental and 10% for the harmonic as shown in
Figure 7. The correction of wave propagation effects is essential for the study concerning the position
of the source centroid, especially for the fundamental emission."
"From the LOFAR high-cadence imaging spectroscopy, it is found that the apparent sources of a
solar type IIIb striae move outward quickly from the Sun with a speed varying from 0.25 to 4 times
the speed of light (Kontar et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2020). Meanwhile the observed expansion rate of
the source size can be as high as 382 ± 30 arcmin2s−1. A commonly held belief in plasma emission
is that type IIIb bursts are generated in a source region with high density inhomogeneity. The
simulation results in Figure 10 and 11 show that both the visual speed and the expansion rate can be
very large, when the fluctuation variance � is large and the anisotropy parameter α is small. This is in
consistent with the observations and indicates that the density fluctuation may be highly anisotropic
in the source region of type IIIb bursts."
5. SUMMARY
"In this paper, we performed ray-tracing simulation of wave transport for point pulse source. For
the first time, we explored the parameter space of the scattering rate coefficient η (represented by
density fluctuation level �) and the anisotropy parameter α with massive number of ray tracing
simulation. We analyzed the simulation results to study the influences of wave propagation on the
observed source size, position, expansion rate, visual speed, and duration of solar radio bursts for
both fundamental emission and harmonic emission. The following are the major conclusions:"
"• For fundamental emission, both the source size and decay time increase with the scattering
rate coefficient or the density fluctuation variance. The isotropic fluctuation can produce much
larger decay time than a highly anisotropic fluctuation, while the source size is not sensitive to"
18 Zhang et al.
"the level of anisotropy. For harmonic emission, both the source size and decay time are largely
determined by the density variance. The decay time of harmonic emission is significantly
smaller than that of fundamental emission for the same background parameters."
"• By comparing the source size and decay time derived from simulation results to the observa-
tional statistics, we obtained the estimation of η = 8.9 × 10−5 km−1 and α = 0.719 near the
source region of fundamental emission at frequency 35 MHz."
"• We derived the position offset of the source and analyzed its dominant factor by decoupling the
scattering and refraction in the wave propagation. The statistical results of source offset show
that, the source of the fundamental emission is more outward shifted than that of harmonic
emission by the propagation effect, which could account for the co-spatial of fundamental and
harmonic emission in some observations."
"• The observed source position and size can have significant visual motion and expansion due
to the wave propagation effects. Both the visual speed and the expansion rate tend to be
large for highly anisotropic medium. For fundamental emission, the visual speed and the
expansion rate for FWHM of the source size can reach respectively about 1.5 c and 22 Arcmin/s
at η = 2.4× 10−4 km−1 and α = 0.2."
"A comprehensive comparison of the observed source characteristics and their corresponding values
simulated in the parameter space can help us precisely diagnose plasma properties near the wave
exciting site of the radio bursts."
"In this work, the simulation considers the radio emission of a single frequency (35 MHz) with the
frequency ratio of f0/fpe = 1.1 for fundamental emission and f0/fpe = 2.0 for harmonic emission.
The future work of simulation concerning the parameter space of frequency and frequency-ratio of
wave excitation can help to understand the dynamic spectrum of a complete radio burst event and its
beam electron property. The background density model is spherically symmetric in the present work,
while the solar corona is a non-uniform medium with a number of large structures. More specific
density models with helmet streamers, coronal holes, under-dense or over-dense flux tubes may be
also studied in future simulations."
