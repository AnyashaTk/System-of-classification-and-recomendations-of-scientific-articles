ABSTRACT
"The fourth orbit of Parker Solar Probe (PSP) reached heliocentric distances down to 27.9 R�, allowing solar wind turbulence and
acceleration mechanisms to be studied in situ closer to the Sun than previously possible. The turbulence properties were found to
be significantly different in the inbound and outbound portions of PSP’s fourth solar encounter, likely due to the proximity to the
heliospheric current sheet (HCS) in the outbound period. Near the HCS, in the streamer belt wind, the turbulence was found to have
lower amplitudes, higher magnetic compressibility, a steeper magnetic field spectrum (with spectral index close to –5/3 rather than
–3/2), a lower Alfvénicity, and a “1/ f ” break at much lower frequencies. These are also features of slow wind at 1 au, suggesting
the near-Sun streamer belt wind to be the prototypical slow solar wind. The transition in properties occurs at a predicted angular
distance of ≈ 4◦ from the HCS, suggesting ≈ 8◦ as the full-width of the streamer belt wind at these distances. While the majority of
the Alfvénic turbulence energy fluxes measured by PSP are consistent with those required for reflection-driven turbulence models of
solar wind acceleration, the fluxes in the streamer belt are significantly lower than the model predictions, suggesting that additional
mechanisms are necessary to explain the acceleration of the streamer belt solar wind."

1. Introduction
"One of the major open questions in heliophysics is how the so-
lar wind is accelerated to the high speeds measured in situ by
spacecraft in the solar system (Fox et al. 2016). Early mod-
els of solar wind generation, based on the pioneering work of
Parker (1958), were able to reproduce the qualitative properties
of the solar wind, although could not explain all of the mea-
sured quantities seen at 1 au (see, e.g., the reviews of Parker
1965; Leer et al. 1982; Barnes 1992; Hollweg 2008; Hansteen
& Velli 2012; Cranmer et al. 2015, 2017). Turbulence is now
thought to be one of the key processes playing a role in solar
wind acceleration, providing both a source of energy to heat the
corona (Coleman 1968) and a wave pressure to directly acceler-
ate the wind (Alazraki & Couturier 1971; Belcher 1971). Possi-
ble mechanisms for the driving of the turbulence include reflec-
tion of the outward-propagating Alfvén waves by the large-scale
gradients (Heinemann & Olbert 1980; Velli 1993) and velocity
shears (Coleman 1968; Roberts et al. 1992). Models that incor-
porate these effects are now able to reproduce most solar wind"
"conditions at 1 au (e.g., Cranmer et al. 2007; Verdini et al. 2010;
Chandran et al. 2011; van der Holst et al. 2014; Usmanov et al.
2018; Shoda et al. 2019), but more stringent tests come from
comparing their predictions to measurements close to the Sun."
"The nature of the turbulence in the solar wind and plasma tur-
bulence in general is also a major open question (Bruno & Car-
bone 2013; Alexandrova et al. 2013; Kiyani et al. 2015; Chen
2016). Initial results from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have re-
vealed many similarities, but also some key differences in the
near-Sun solar wind turbulence. Both the power levels and cas-
cade rates were found to be several orders or magnitude larger
at ∼ 36 R� compared to 1 au (Bale et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020;
Bandyopadhyay et al. 2020). The turbulence was also found
to be less magnetically compressible, more imbalanced, with a
shallower magnetic field spectral index of ≈ −3/2. The low com-
pressibility and polarisation is consistent with a reduced slow
mode component to the turbulence (Chen et al. 2020; Chaston
et al. 2020). Both the outer scale and ion scale spectral breaks
move to larger scales approximately linearly with heliocentric
distance (Chen et al. 2020; Duan et al. 2020), indicating that the"

"width of the MHD inertial range stays approximately constant
over this distance range. The steep ion-scale transition range,
however, is more prominent closer to the Sun, indicating stronger
dissipation or increase of the cascade rate (Bowen et al. 2020),
or perhaps a build-up of energy at these scales (Meyrand et al.
2020). The overall increase of the turbulence energy flux, com-
pared to the bulk solar wind kinetic energy flux, was found by
Chen et al. (2020) to be consistent with the reflection-driven tur-
bulence solar wind model of Chandran et al. (2011), showing
that this remains a viable mechanism to explain the acceleration
of the open field wind. Other comparisons of the early PSP data
to turbulence-driven models also report agreement (Bandyopad-
hyay et al. 2020; Réville et al. 2020a; Adhikari et al. 2020)."
"Much of the solar wind measured in the early PSP solar en-
counters has been of open-field coronal hole origin (Bale et al.
2019; Panasenco et al. 2020; Badman et al. 2020a,b), although
short periods of streamer belt wind near the heliospheric current
sheet (HCS) were also identified (Szabo et al. 2020; Rouillard
et al. 2020; Lavraud et al. 2020). Encounter 4, however, was dif-
ferent in that for the majority of the outbound portion, PSP was
consistently in streamer belt plasma (Bale et al. 2020). In this
Letter, the properties of turbulence during this encounter are pre-
sented. These are compared to the distance to the HCS to show
the differences between the streamer belt wind and the open field
wind. The turbulence energy flux is also compared to predictions
of reflection-driven turbulence solar wind models to investigate
the acceleration mechanisms of the streamer belt wind."
2. Data
"Data from PSP (Fox et al. 2016), primarily from its 4th solar en-
counter, but also from all of the first four orbits, were used for
this study. Magnetic field, B, and electron density, ne, were ob-
tained from the MAG and RFS/LFR instruments of the FIELDS"

scribed in Moncuquet et al. (2020). Ion (proton) velocity, vi, and
temperature, Ti were obtained primarily from from the SPAN-I
(Livi et al. 2020), but also the SPC (Case et al. 2020), instru-
ments of the SWEAP suite (Kasper et al. 2016). The SPAN-I
data consist of bi-Maxwellian fits to the proton core population,
described in Woodham et al. (2020), with the same selection cri-
teria used for excluding bad fits from the dataset, and this data
is used for vi and Ti unless stated otherwise. Since the fluctua-
tions investigated in this Letter are at MHD scales, the solar wind
velocity v is taken to be equal to vi."
"A time series of the data for Encounter 4 is shown in Figure
1. Additional quantities plotted include the distance-normalised
mass flux, 4πρvrr2, where ρ is the total mass density estimated
as ρ = mpne(1 + 3 fα)/(1 + fα), where fα = 0.05 is the assumed
alpha fraction of the ion number density, vr is the radial solar
wind speed and r is the radial distance of the spacecraft to the
Sun, the distance-normalised kinetic energy flux, 2πρv3r r"

tred at the Sun) of the spacecraft to the heliospheric current sheet
(HCS) estimated using the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model,
which consists of a PFSS model for the inner corona encased in
a Schatten current sheet shell (Arge & Pizzo 2000; Arge et al.
2003, 2004; Szabo et al. 2020). A zero-point corrected GONG
synoptic magnetogram was chosen for the model’s inner bound-
ary condition, which was found to produce solar wind predic-
tions that correspond well with the IMF polarity inversion ob-
served by PSP near the end of January. It can be seen that, unlike
the previous encounters, the inbound and outbound portions had
different solar wind properties: the outbound period had higher
density, lower speed and temperature, with a higher mass flux
and plasma beta. These differences can be accounted for by the
fact that PSP spent most of the outbound period close to the
HCS."

the outer scale (Chen et al. 2020; Parashar et al. 2020; Bandy-
opadhyay et al. 2020; Bourouaine et al. 2020), and in each a set

"In the definition of b, its sign is reversed if θBR < 90◦ so that

Sun. In addition, the MHD inertial range magnetic field spec-
tral index, αB, was calculated from the FFT of 2-hour intervals
and fitting a power-law function in the range of spacecraft-frame
frequencies 10−2 Hz < fsc < 10−1 Hz."
"A time series of these properties, along with the angular dis-
tance to the HCS, φHCS, is shown in Figure 2. As expected, there
is significant variability of all quantities, but there are also con-
sistent trends over the encounter. The outbound portion appears
to have lower fluctuations amplitudes, higher magnetic com-
pressibility, a steeper spectral index, and be less dominated by
pure outward Alfvénic fluctuations (σc is closer to zero and σr
further from zero). This does not appear to be a consequence of
radial distance (since the orbit is geometrically symmetric) or
the angle of the magnetic field: the distribution of θBR (reflected"

with a mean value of θBR = 26.8◦ ± 0.4◦ in both cases. One key
difference, however, is the proximity to the HCS, the effect of
which is explored in the rest of this Letter."
"One important consideration is whether the Taylor hypothe-
sis remains valid as PSP gets closer to the Sun (Klein et al. 2015;
Bourouaine & Perez 2018, 2019, 2020). Figure 2 also contains

velocity in the spacecraft frame. This is the same parameter as
in the model of Bourouaine & Perez (2019), in which perpen-
dicular sampling is assumed so vsc ∼ vsc⊥, and in which the
Taylor hypothesis is valid for � � 1. The model also assumes
Gaussian random sweeping and anisotropic turbulence k⊥ � k‖,
and is valid when tan(θBV) & δvrms/vA, where θBV is the angle
between B0 and the mean solar wind velocity in the spacecraft
frame. Points for which the model is valid are marked with blue
dots and points for which it is not are marked as red crosses.
Bourouaine & Perez (2020) determined that within this model,
frequency broadening caused by the breakdown of the Taylor
hypothesis does not significantly modify the spectrum as long as
� . 0.5, and as shown in Figure 2, the data points satisfy this
condition. Therefore, the differences in turbulence characteris-
tics investigated in this Letter are likely not due to the differences
in the validity of the Taylor hypothesis. A more detailed analy-
sis of the Taylor hypothesis for these first PSP orbits is given in
Perez et al. (2020)."
3.2. HCS Proximity Dependence
"In the outbound portion of Encounter 4, PSP spent significant
time in the streamer belt wind near the HCS (Bale et al. 2020).
The width of the streamer belt wind at these distances is not well
known, so the dependence of the turbulence properties on the
distance to the HCS was investigated. Figure 3 shows average
values close to and far from the HCS, as a function of the cut
value of the HCS angle used to define close and far, φcut. For ex-
ample, the first panel shows 〈δBrms〉|φHCS |<φcut as a function of φcut
in blue and 〈δBrms〉|φHCS |>φcut as a function of φcut in red. Because

"Figure 4 shows the distributions of the turbulence proper-
ties over the encounter both near to (|φHCS| < 4◦) and far from
(|φHCS| > 4◦) the HCS. A clear difference can be seen in each
property: near the HCS there are lower amplitudes, higher mag-
netic compressibility, a steeper spectrum, a lower level of im-
balance and a broader distribution of residual energy. The joint
distributions of σc with σr and rE with rA are shown in Figure 5.

"respectively, marked as solid black lines. In general, it can be

1, σr ≈ 0, rE � 1, rA ≈ 1), more so than in previous encounters
(Chen et al. 2020; McManus et al. 2020; Parashar et al. 2020) but
the near-HCS wind is less so than the wind far from the HCS."
"The averages for these different regions are given in Table 1.
Aspects to note are that near the HCS the wind is denser, slower,
cooler, with a higher plasma beta and mass flux, as expected for
the streamer belt wind. The kinetic energy flux, however, is very
similar, as has been seen previously across different wind types
(Le Chat et al. 2012). The difference in turbulence properties is
consistent with the differences between “fast” and “slow” wind
seen further from the Sun (e.g., Tu & Marsch 1995; Bruno &
Carbone 2013). Notably, the magnetic field spectral index in the
streamer belt wind is close to −5/3 whereas it is closer to −3/2
far from the HCS. This is consistent with observed dependen-
cies of the magnetic spectrum on the degree of Alfvénicity at 1"

"au (Podesta & Borovsky 2010; Chen et al. 2013; Bowen et al.
2018) and in the previous PSP orbits (Chen et al. 2020). A sim-
ilar difference of spectral index and Alfvénicity was also seen
when separating times of inverted and non-inverted magnetic
field (Bourouaine et al. 2020). The imbalance, however, is larger
than typically seen at 1 au, suggesting that the evolution towards
a more balanced state seen in the open field wind (Chen et al.
2020) also occurs in the streamer belt wind."
3.3. Spectra
"Spectra of representative intervals (marked by the vertical
dashed lines in Figures 1 and 2) are shown in Figure 6. The
lower panel shows the local spectral index, in which some impor-
tant differences can be seen. Firstly, the steeper magnetic field
spectrum in the near-HCS interval can be seen throughout the
MHD inertial range. But more significantly, the break between
the “1/ f ” range and the MHD inertial range is at very differ-
ent frequencies: fb ≈ 3 × 10−4 Hz in the near-HCS wind and
fb ≈ 4 × 10−3 Hz far from the HCS. The origin of the 1/ f break
is debated (Matthaeus & Goldstein 1986; Velli et al. 1989; Ver-
dini et al. 2012; Perez & Chandran 2013; Wicks et al. 2013a,b;
Chandran 2018; Matteini et al. 2018), but this difference is also
seen between the “fast” and “slow” wind at 1 au (Bruno et al.
2019), where both breaks are about a decade lower in frequency,
consistent with the radial evolution (Chen et al. 2020)."
3.4. Energy Flux
"Finally, the energy flux in the turbulent fluctuations was com-
pared to the Chandran et al. (2011) reflection-driven turbulence
solar wind model, following Chen et al. (2020). The Alfvénic
turbulence enthalpy flux was calculated as"

"These quantities are similar to those plotted in Chandran et al.
(2011) and Chen et al. (2020) except δb is used instead of δz+,
which allows greater data coverage and is valid due to the high
degree of Alfvénicity (Figure 5). Figure 7 shows the ratio FA/Fk,
calculated over 3 hour intervals, as a function of solar distance
over the first four orbits of PSP. The SPAN-I data were used for
vr for times when reliable fits could be made, and SPC data used
otherwise. Also shown are two solutions to the Chandran et al.
(2011) model as described in Chen et al. (2020)."
"It can be seen that for Orbits 1-3, the data, on average, fol-
low the model solutions (although with some degree of spread),
consistent with the findings of Chen et al. (2020). For Orbit 4,
however, there are a large number of points that fall well below
the model, originating from times during the outbound portion of
the encounter near the HCS when the turbulent amplitudes were
lower. Times when the spacecraft was close to the HCS during
Encounter 4 (r < 54 R�) are marked with green crosses. These
values are on average 3.0 times smaller than the slow wind model
(whereas the average ratio to the model for the other data points
over this distance range is 1.0). This suggests that the lower am-
plitude turbulence near the HCS does not contain sufficient en-
ergy for reflection-driven Alfvénic turbulence models to provide
an explanation for the acceleration of the streamer belt wind."
4. Discussion
"In this Letter, it is shown that the turbulence properties in the
near-Sun streamer belt wind, from ≈ 28 R� to ≈ 54 R�, are sig-
nificantly different to in the open field wind that has been mea-
sured for most of the previous PSP orbits. These differences
include lower amplitudes, higher magnetic compressibility, a
steeper magnetic spectrum (–5/3 rather than –3/2), a lower de-
gree of Alfvénicity, and a larger scale 1/ f break. The differences
are similar to the traditional fast/slow wind differences reported"
"Article number, page 5 of 7"

"at 1 au, suggesting the near-Sun streamer belt wind as the proto-
typical slow solar wind."
"The differences in turbulence properties occur at an angle
to the HCS of |φHCS| ≈ 4◦, suggesting the total width of the
streamer belt wind at these solar distances to be ≈ 8◦. This in-
terpretation is consistent with other studies of the streamer belt
wind during PSP Encounter 4, e.g., Badman et al. (2020b) found
a reduced magnetic flux during this period that did not fit the
general radial scalings seen in the rest of the PSP data. The in-
ferred streamer belt wind width is also consistent with coronal
images that show the streamer rays to have a width of around
10◦ to 20◦, which is likely a slight over-estimate due to the line-
of-sight integration (Rouillard et al. 2020; Poirier et al. 2020)."
"The Alfvénic turbulence energy flux measured on PSP’s
first three orbits is generally in line with that required for the
reflection-driven solar wind model of Chandran et al. (2011),
however, in the Encounter 4 streamer belt wind it is several times
lower than the model predictions. There are also occasional pe-
riods in the previous orbits where this is the case, identified by
Chen et al. (2020) as the periods of quiet radial-field wind seen
by Bale et al. (2019). This raises the possibility that these may
be small patches of streamer belt wind; investigating this pos-
sibility would be an interesting topic for further study. The dif-
ference to the model predictions implies that purely reflection-
driven Alfvénic turbulence solar wind models (e.g., Cranmer
et al. 2007; Chandran et al. 2011) may not be able to account
for the acceleration of the streamer belt wind, and additional
processes are taking place. One possible such processes is ad-
ditional turbulence driving by velocity shears (Usmanov et al.
2018; Ruffolo et al. 2020). One thing to note about this possibil-
ity, however, is that it would be expected to produce both inward
and outward Alfvén waves, resulting in σc ≈ 0 and rE ≈ 1 if
the shears dominate the energy input. In the streamer belt wind
measured here, σc = 0.55 and rE = 5.2 on average, meaning that
even though the imbalance is less than in the open field wind,
there is still 5 times more energy in the outward waves compared
to the inward ones, so such processes may play a role but cannot
be dominating the energy input overall. Another likely contribu-
tion to the generation of the streamer belt wind is reconnection
in the near-Sun HCS (Lavraud et al. 2020) triggered by a tearing
mode (Réville et al. 2020b). The chain of processes involved in
the acceleration of the streamer belt wind, however, remains an
open question. Future orbits of PSP closer to the Sun will allow
more to be learnt about the nature of both plasma turbulence near
the Sun and solar wind acceleration.
