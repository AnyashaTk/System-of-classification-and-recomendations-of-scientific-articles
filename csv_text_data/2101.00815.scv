"Abstract. We present the results obtained from analysis of two AstroSat observations of the high mass X-ray
binary pulsar OAO 1657-415. The observations covered 0.681–0.818 and 0.808–0.968 phases of the ∼10.4 day
orbital period of the system, in March and July 2019, respectively. Despite being outside the eclipsing regime, the
power density spectrum from the first observation lacks any signature of pulsation or quasi-periodic oscillations.
However, during July observation, X-ray pulsations at a period of 37.0375 s were clearly detected in the light
curves. The pulse profiles from the second observation consist of a broad single peak with a dip-like structure in
the middle across the observed energy range. We explored evolution of the pulse profile in narrow time and energy
segments. We detected pulsations in the light curves obtained from 0.808–0.92 orbital phase range, which is absent
in the remaining part of the observation. The spectrum of OAO 1657-415 can be described by an absorbed power-
law model along with an iron fluorescent emission line and a blackbody component for out-of-eclipse phase of the
observation. Our findings are discussed in the frame of stellar wind accretion and accretion wake at late orbital
phases of the binary."

1. Introduction
"OAO 1657–415 is an accreting high mass X-ray binary
pulsar, discovered with Copernicus satellite in 1978
(Polidan et al. 1978). The X-ray pulsations from the
neutron star were detected at 38.2 s using HEAO A-
2 observations (White & Pravdo 1979; Parmar et al.
1980). Later, the system was identified as an eclips-
ing binary by using 1991 and 1992 observations with
the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE)
onboard Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO;
Chakrabarty et al. 1993). This study also revealed
the orbital period of the system to be Porb = 10.4 days
along with the eclipse duration of about 1.7 days. De-
spite dedicated efforts in the optical band, no counter
part was detected up to a limitings magnitude of V<23.
A highly reddened B-type supergiant star was subse-
quently discovered as the optical companion of the pul-"
"sar within Chandra X-ray error box (Chakrabarty et al.
2002). The spectral class of the donor star was refined
to be a Ofpe/WNL type star which is thought as a tran-
sitional object between the main sequence and Wolf-
Rayet stars (Mason et al. 2009; Mason et al. 2012). Ob-
served X-ray eclipses and massive nature of the com-
panion established the binary system as an eclipsing
high mass X-ray binary. The source distance is mea-
sured to be 4.4–12 kpc (Chakrabarty et al. 2002; Ma-
son et al. 2009), consistent with the measurement of
7.1±1.3 kpc provided by Audley et al. (2006). The re-
cent Gaia data suggests a relatively lower distance of
2.2+0.5
−0.7 kpc based on the parallax angle of the optical"
"companion (Malacaria et al. 2020).
In most of the high mass X-ray binary (HMXB)"
"systems, a neutron star resides as the compact object.
The mass accretion onto the neutron star in these sys-
tems takes place either via stellar wind accretion, Be-"

"disk accretion, or Roche-Lobe overflow from the opti-
cal companion (see e.g. Reig 2011; Walter et al. 2015).
Based on the mass accretion mechanisms and the na-
ture of donor star, the HMXBs can be classified into
Be-X-ray binaries (BeXBs) and supergiant X-ray bina-
ries (SGXBs). The compact object in BeXBs co-rotates
around a non-supergiant companion of class III-V, and
accretes directly from a circumstellar disk of the Be
star. On the other hand, the SGXBs consist of a super-
giant optical companion of luminosity class I-II. The
mass accretion in SGXB systems occurs through the
stellar wind accretion (wind-fed accretion) or via an ac-
cretion disk formed after the capture of stellar wind or
Roche-Lobe overflow (disk-fed accretion). Some of the
SGXBs are also known to be eclipsing systems due to
edge-on periodic obscuration of the compact object by
the super-giant companion. Typical X-ray luminosity
of the neutron star in SGXBs is in the range of 1034–
1037 erg cm−2 s−1(Martı́nez-Núñez et al. 2017). The
source luminosity can also vary by a factor of 5-100
within a ks time-scale due to flaring activities (see, e.g.
Fürst et al. 2010, Naik, Paul & Ali 2011, Jaisawal et al.
2020)."
"Various sub-classes of HMXBs represent a unique
position in spin period vs. orbital period diagram (Cor-
bet diagram; Corbet 1986). The BeXB systems show a
strong correlation between the orbital and spin periods,
whereas the wind-fed SGXBs are distributed in a hori-
zontal line. There are, however, three disk-fed SGXBs
viz. Cen X-3, SMC X-1 and LMC X-4, that exhibit
an anti-correlation between the orbital and spin peri-
ods in the Corbet diagram. In exception to the known
pattern, OAO 1657-415 occupies an intermediate posi-
tion in the Corbet diagram, between the wind-fed and
disk-fed SGXBs (Chakrabarty et al. 1993; Jenke et al.
2012)."
"Since discovery, the pulse period of OAO 1657–
415 changes stochastically at a rate of ν̇ ∼
8.5×10−13 Hz s−1 (Baykal 1997; Bildsten et al.
1997; Baykal 2000). Steady spin-up and spin-down
patterns, as seen in Cen X-3, are also observed in the
system (Bildsten et al. 1997). The changes in the spin
episodes, however, can not be explained by the theory
of torque reversal without considering the formation
of a transient accretion disk (Baykal 1997). Based
on a positive correlation between X-ray luminosity
and the spin frequency during a spin-down phase in
1997, the presence of a prograde disk was suggested
(Baykal 2000). On investigation of almost two decades
of long-term spin evolution with BASTE and Gamma-
Ray Burst Monitor (Fermi/GBM) observations, two
accretion modes are inferred in this system (Jenke
et al. 2012). The first mode is due to the disk-wind
accretion (formation of an accretion disk after stellar"
"wind accretion) where a stable accretion disk produces
a correlation between flux and spin-up of the neutron
star. In the latter case, a direct stellar wind accretion
produces almost no correlation between the flux and
spin-down parameter of OAO 1657–415 at a lesser
accretion rate (Jenke et al. 2012). Recently, Kim
& Ikhsanov (2017) proposed a magnetic levitating
disk hypothesis to explain the spin evolution in
OAO 1657–415 ."
"Being located at a low galactic latitude, OAO 1657–
415 is highly absorbed with a column density of
1023 cm−2 (Polidan et al. 1978, Kamata et al. 1990).
The energy spectrum of the pulsar can be described
by a power law continuum with an exponential high
energy cutoff along with a soft excess and prominent
emission lines at 6.4, 6.7, and 7.1 keV (Kamata et al.
1990; Audley et al. 2006; Barnstedt et al. 2008; Prad-
han et al. 2014; Jaisawal & Naik 2014; Pradhan, Ra-
man & Paul 2019). ASCA observations were performed
on 1994 March 22 and 1997 September 17 between
orbital phase ranges of -0.001–0.074 and -0.21–0.11
(mid-eclipse time as phase zero), respectively (Audley
et al. 2006). Presence of a dust scattered X-ray halo in
OAO 1657–415 was suggested from these data. As ex-
pected, the observed source flux was very low near the
mid-eclipse region with a dominant 6.4 keV line com-
pared to the 6.7 keV line in the data from the first ASCA
observation. The second ASCA observation covered en-
tire eclipse along with out-of-eclipse phases before and
after eclipse. The energy continuum in this phase was
found to be absorbed along with detection of 6.4 and
7.1 keV iron emission lines (Audley et al. 2006)."
"Suzaku observation of the source in September
2011, covering 0.12–0.34 orbital phase range, revealed
flaring activities in the soft and hard X-ray light curves
(Jaisawal & Naik 2014; Pradhan et al. 2014). De-
tailed time-resolved spectroscopy of the Suzaku data
suggested the accretion of clumpy material as the cause
of flare-like episodes during the observation. Strong
6.4 and 7.1 keV lines were also detected. These lines
mostly originated from the neutral and ionized iron
atoms within the accretion radius of 19 lt-sec (Jaisawal
& Naik 2014). Using BeppoSAX observation, a pres-
ence of a cyclotron absorption line was suggested at
36 keV (Orlandini et al. 1999). However, later studies
with INTEGRAL and Suzaku did not confirm the feature
(Barnstedt et al. 2008; Pradhan et al. 2014; Jaisawal &
Naik 2014)."
"In the present paper, we study the properties of the
source by using two AstroSat observations, carried out
at mid and late orbital phases of the orbit (with mid-
eclipse time as phase zero) in 2019 . Data analysis is
presented in Section 2, followed by timing and spectral
results in Section 3 and 4. The discussion and conclu-"

2. Observations and Data Analysis
"AstroSat is the first Indian multi-wavelength astronomi-
cal satellite launched by Indian Space Research Organi-
zation on 28 September 2015 (Agrawal 2006, Singh et
al. 2014). It provides a broad-band coverage from op-
tical to X-ray bands for exploring the nature of the cos-
mic sources. There are five sets of instruments such as
Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT; Singh et al. 2017), Large
Area X-ray Proportional Counters (LAXPCs; Agrawal
et al. 2017, Antia et al. 2017), Cadmium Zinc Telluride
Imager (CZTI; Rao et al. 2017), a Scanning Sky Moni-
tor (SSM; Ramadevi et al. 2018), and Ultraviolet Imag-
ing Telescope (UVIT; Tandon et al. 2017), onboard
the satellite. In this paper, we study two observations
of OAO 1657–415 with SXT and LAXPC instruments.
These observations were performed on 31 March and
4 July 2019, covering orbital phase ranges of 0.681–
0.818 and 0.808–0.968, respectively. The orbital phase
range is calculated based on the ephemeris of the binary
system provided by Jenke et al. (2012). In our study,
the CZTI data from both the epoch of observations are
not used as the source was faint for the detector. The
UVIT was not operational during these epochs. The
log of the observations are given in Table 1."
"The SXT is a soft X-ray focusing telescope con-
sisting of a CCD detector and sensitive in 0.3–8 keV
energy range. The effective area and energy resolution
of SXT is 128 cm2 and 5–6% at 1.5 keV and 22 cm2
and 2.5% at 6 keV, respectively. The observations of
OAO 1657–415 were carried out with SXT operating
in photon counting mode, yielding a time resolution of
2.4 s. We used standard pipeline for SXT data reduc-
tion and merging tool sxtevtmergertool provided by
the AstroSat Science Support Cell (ASSC1). As the pul-
sar was faint for SXT during the first observation, the
data were used for spectral analysis only. The source"

in the 3–80 keV range and provide a total effective area
of 8000 cm2 at 15 keV. The time and energy resolu-

respectively. During both the observations, data from
LAXPC20 were considered in our analysis. The data
from LAXPC10 and LAXPC30 units were not used
due to the presence of high background and gain is-
sues with the instrument during observations (Antia et
al. 2017). Using the standard data analysis routines
(LAXPCsoftware), the event mode data are analyzed
to obtain the source light curves and spectral products.

"Swift/BAT (Burst Alert Telescope, Krimm et al. 2013)
and MAXI (Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image, Mat-
suoka et al. 2009) long term monitoring light curves
of OAO 1657–415 in 15–50 keV and 2–20 keV ranges,
respectively, are shown in Figure 1 to examine the over-
all activity of the pulsar during both the epochs of As-
troSat observations. During the first observation on 31
March 2019, OAO 1657–415 was observed in a low in-
tensity phase. However, during the second observation
on 4 July 2019, the pulsar was observed to be brighter
in the beginning and gradually entered the low flux
level in the later part. The orbital phases covered during
both the epochs of observations are 0.681–0.818 and
0.808–0.968 (Table 1). Background subtracted light
curves obtained from LAXPC20 data of both the ob-
servations of the pulsar are shown in Fig 2. The top
panel (a) and middle panel (b) represent the source light
curves in 3-10 keV and 10-80 keV energy ranges. The
hardness ratio (HR), the ratio between the light curves
in 10-80 keV and 3-10 keV ranges are also shown in
the bottom panels of the figure."

can be seen in the first, second and third segments of the observation. These peaks are, however, absent in the PDS
corresponding to the fourth segment (right bottom panel)."
"10–80 keV ranges (top two panels of both sides of
Figure 2), it can be noticed that the pulsar was in a
low intensity phase during the first AstroSat observa-
tion, compared to that during the initial part of the sec-
ond observation. During the first epoch of observation,
the pulsar did not show any significant time variabil-
ity in soft and hard X-ray light curves, despite being
observed away from the eclipse regime. The hardness
ratio was also found to be constant (∼1). However,
the second data set (right side of Figure 2) shows a
gradual evolution in the 3-10 keV and 10-80 keV light
curves observed between 0.808–0.968 orbital phase of
the binary. In the early part of this observation (out-of-
eclipse phase), the pulsar was relatively brighter than
that during the first AstroSat observation. The hardness
ratio also found to change during the second observa-
tion."
A search for X-ray pulsations was performed in the
"3-80 keV barycentric corrected light curves, binned at
0.1 s, from both the observations. For this, the power-
density spectra (PDS) were generated from the light
curves using the Fast Fourier Transformation technique
with the powspec task of FTOOLS. Absence of sharp
narrow peaks in the PDS from the first observation
(Figure 3) suggests the non-detection of X-ray pulsa-
tions in the light curve of the pulsar. Pulsations were
again searched in light curves in different energy bands
such as 3-10 keV, 3-25 keV, and 10-80 keV ranges.
However, we failed to detect any pulsating signal from
the neutron star during the first observation. The sec-
ond observation of OAO 1657–415 was carried out by
covering out-of-eclipse and eclipse phases of the bi-
nary orbit. For the pulsation search, the entire obser-
vation was divided into four different segments (Seg-I,
II, III, & IV) on the basis of source intensity. These
segments are marked in different colors in the top right"

segment (Seg-IV) represents the duration of the eclipse
of the neutron star during the second AstroSat observa-
tion. The PDS obtained from the 3-80 keV segmented
light curves show signatures of strong pulsations along
with its harmonics for Seg-I, II, & III (Fig. 4). The PDS
obtained from Seg-IV, however, did not show any such
signature at a frequency corresponding to the spin pe-"
"riod of the pulsar (right bottom panel of Fig. 4). This
suggests that pulsations are present in the light curves
during the out-of-the eclipse phase of the pulsar and ab-
sent during the eclipsing phase."
"We, then, applied the chi-square maximization
technique (Leahy 1987) using efsearch task to deter-
mine the pulsation period. From the PDS analysis and
the chi-square maximization technique, the spin period
of the pulsar is estimated to be 37.0375(8) s from the
out-of-eclipse phases (Seg-I, II, & III) of the second As-
troSat observation. We checked the long term spin fre-
quency history of OAO 1657–415 using Fermi/GBM2
data. The GBM instrument did not detect any pulsation
in the source from MJD 58571.37 to MJD 58574.35
during which the first AstroSat observation was carried
out. However, pulsations were detected during the sec-
ond AstroSat observation as well as with Fermi/GBM.
It is also worth to note that the count rate observed in
the first observation is relatively higher than the same
in third segment of second observation. The presence
of pulsations at lower source count rate in the third seg-
ment confirms that the source was not into the propeller
regime during the first observation."

"The background subtracted light curves in 3–80
keV energy range from the LAXPC20 data for Seg-I,
II, & III were folded at the estimated spin period of
the pulsar. The pulse profiles from these segments are
shown in the top panels of Figure 5 (left to right). A
single peaked profile with a dip at the peak is observed
in first three segments. Non-detection of pulsations in
the light curve from Seg-IV, as the neutron star entered
into the eclipsing phase of the binary (Figure 2), pulse
profiles for this segment were not generated."
"Evolution of the pulse profile with energy was in-
vestigated by generating profiles in different energy
ranges. The light curves were extracted in several en-
ergy ranges such as 3-10 keV, 10-25 keV, 25-50 keV,
and 50-80 keV, for Seg-I, II, & III. These light curves
were folded with the estimated spin period and pre-
sented in Figure 5 in second, third, fourth, and fifth pan-
els (from top to bottom) for respective segments. In our
study, pulsations are effectively detected up to 80 keV
in first and second segments. The dip in the peak of the
profile was also found to present up to higher energies.
The third segment which is in 0.89-0.92 orbital phase
range (out-of-eclipse phase), appears like the quiescent
phase of the pulsar (Figure 2, top right panel). Signif-
icant decrease in pulsar intensity during this segment,
affected the soft X-ray pulse profile more. A single
peaked structure with a dip appears only in the hard
X-rays above 10 keV. The pulsation is detected up to
∼50 keV in this case."
"To quantify the nature of these pulsating com-
ponents, pulse fraction from the pulse profiles of
OAO 1657–415 is calculated and shown in Figure 6.
In our study, the pulse fraction is defined as the ratio
between the difference and sum of maximum and mini-
mum intensities observed in the pulse profile. The pulse
fraction from Seg-IV is not estimated as the pulsation
was not detected in this segment. From the figure, a de-
creasing trend in the value of pulse fraction with energy,
from a maximum of ∼40%, was seen for Seg-I and II.
It suggests that the fraction of lower energy X-ray pho-
tons contributing towards pulsation is higher compared
to the hard X-ray photons. In contrast, a marginally
increasing trend between the pulse fraction and energy
was seen for the Seg-III. Though a decreasing trend in
the pulse fraction with energy can be clearly seen for all
segments, the pulse fraction values in 3-10 keV range
for Seg-II and Seg-III are found to be less than cor-
responding values in 10-25 keV ranges, whereas for
Seg-I, it is comparable. This can be due to the fact
that the soft X-ray photons are subjected to absorption
by the particles in the interstellar medium. The grad-
ual decrease in the values of pulse fraction with energy
is anticipated when the source gets obscured by dense
matter in the form of clumps of stellar wind, accretion"

"wake, or the binary companion (e.g. in Seg-III). Pulse
profiles of the pulsar were also generated from the SXT
data. However, as the source is heavily absorbed in soft
X-ray ranges, the profiles were not suitable to draw any
meaningful information and not shown here."
4. Spectral Studies
"To understand the cause of non-detection of pulsa-
tions in the first AstroSat observation and the inten-
sity variation during the second observation, we car-
ried out spectral analysis by using SXT and LAXPC20
data from both the observations. The spectral fit-
ting package XSPEC of version 12.10.0 (Arnaud 1996)
was used. In the beginning, we extracted ob-
served source+background and background spectra
using laxpc make spectra and laxpc find back
tasks of LAXPCsoftware package, respectively, from
LAXPC20 data of Obs-1. The observed, background,
and source spectra of the source from LAXPC20 of
Obs-1 are shown in Figure 7. It can be seen that the
source spectrum is limited up to ∼22 keV. As we aim to
carry out our spectral analysis using data from both the
observations, we restricted ourselves to fit the data up
to 20 keV in our fitting."
"In our analysis, we considered 0.5-7 keV spectrum
from SXT and 3.5-20 keV spectrum from LAXPC20.
The 0.5-20 keV energy spectrum obtained from the
first observation was fitted with several standard mod-
els such as power law, high energy cutoff power law,
power law with blackbody component etc., along with
the Galactic absorption column density TBabs (Wilms,"

"Allen & McCray 2000). Only an absorbed power law
with a blackbody component (bbodyrad in XSPEC) was
able to fit the spectrum better, though excess residuals
were observed in 6-7 keV range. This excess was re-
solved into two iron emission lines at 6.4 keV and 6.7
keV while fitting SXT data alone. Similar multiple iron
emission lines have also been seen in other accretion
powered X-ray pulsars such as GX 1+4 (Naik, Paul &
Callanan 2005; Yoshida et al. 2017), Cen X-3 (Naik,
Paul & Ali, 2011), Swift J0243.6+6124 (Jaisawal et al.
2019). In the present study, these lines could not be
distinguished in the LAXPC data due to relatively poor
spectral resolution of the instrument. Therefore, the
parameters of the Gaussian components for emission
lines were fixed at values obtained from fitting SXT
data alone, in the joint fitting of SXT and LAXPC data.
Because of poor energy resolution of LAXPC, these pa-
rameters were not allowed to vary. This resulted in im-
proving the goodness of fit per degree of freedom to
χ2ν=χ"
"2/ν ≈1. The best-fit spectral parameters obtained
from our fitting are quoted in Table 2. The iron line pa-
rameters quoted in Table 2, such as line energy, width,
equivalent width and line flux are obtained by fitting the
SXT data alone."
"The LAXPC20 light curve of the pulsar during
the second AstroSat observation shows different in-
tensity phases of the source (Figure 2). During the
normal phase (Seg-I), the source intensity was maxi-
mum which gradually decreased (Seg-II) to low inten-
sity phases (Seg-III & IV). As the source flux was ex-
tremely low during Seg-III & IV and the duration of
Seg-II is very short, spectral analysis was carried out
by considering Seg-I and added Seg-II, III & IV, sepa-
rately. While fitting the SXT and LAXPC spectra for
Seg-I, the absorbed power-law model with a blackbody
component provided acceptable fit. However, there was
no clear signature of iron emission line in the residu-
als. While fitting the spectra corresponding to added
Seg-II, III, and IV, a simple absorbed power-law model
or an absorbed power-law with blackbody model did
not fit the data well. Considering the low intensity na-
ture of the neutron star at late orbital phases, a par-
tial covering component was tried along with the ab-
sorbed power-law model. Addition of partial covering
component to the absorbed power-law model improved
the fitting. We also detected a 6.4 keV iron fluores-
cence line in the spectra for this added segment. The
best-fitted spectral parameters obtained from the spec-
tral fitting of data from both the AstroSat observations
are given in Table 2, whereas the energy spectra along
with corresponding residuals are shown in Figure 8. We
used cflux convolution model for flux estimation in
our study."

5. Discussion and Conclusions
"We studied two AstroSat observations of OAO 1657–
415 carried out in March and July 2019 covering 0.681–
0.818 and 0.808–0.968 phase ranges of the 10.4 day
orbital period of the binary system, respectively. Dur-
ing the first observation, no pulsation was detected in
the SXT and LAXPC data. In this observation, despite
being significantly away from the eclipse, the source
was found weak in the soft and hard X-ray light curves.
The 0.5-30 keV unabsorbed flux was estimated to be
1.6×10−11 erg cm−2 s−1, corresponding to a source lu-
minosity of ≈0.93×1034 and 9.4×1034 erg s−1 at a dis-
tance of 2.2 and 7 kpc, respectively. The spectral anal-
ysis of the data from this observation revealed a high
value of column density NH of about 1.5×1023 cm−2.
Strong iron lines at 6.4 keV and 6.7 keV were also de-
tected in the SXT spectrum obtained from the first ob-
servation. The equivalent width of the lines are esti-
mated to be as high as 1 keV. Detection of such strong
iron lines with high equivalent width suggests the pres-
ence of abundant material around the pulsar for repro-
cessing. A high value of equivalent width (∼1 keV)
is only possible when a dense absorbing medium faces
directly the X-ray source (Inoue 1985). There are at"
"least two possibilities of absorbing medium one can
presume in front of the neutron star. First one, is an
accretion wake. Using simulation study of accretion
onto neutron stars in wind-fed sources, Blondin et al.
(1990) suggested the formation of accretion wake at
the late orbital phases. The density inside the non-
steady accretion wake could be 100 times higher than
the undisturbed stellar wind (Blondin et al. 1990). The
dense wake can efficiently absorb the X-ray photons
and hence reducing the source flux to lower values as
observed in this case. Similar structure has been re-
ported in case of 4U 1700–37 during the out-of-eclipse
part of the binary between 0.63–0.73 phases (Boroson
et al. 2003; Jaisawal & Naik 2015). An increase in
the column density is usually observed in these orbital
phases. In contrast to the present study, Jaisawal &
Naik (2015) did not find any significant increase in the
iron line parameters in case of 4U 1700–37. The study
of OAO 1657–415 in 0.12–0.34 orbital phase range
with Suzaku revealed the presence of eclipse-like seg-
ment in the light curve. Time-resolved spectroscopy
of the Suzaku data corresponding to 0.19–0.23 phase
showed a high column density as well as strong 6.4 keV
and 7.1 keV iron lines with equivalent width of about 1
keV and 0.3 keV, respectively (Jaisawal & Naik 2014;
Pradhan et al. 2014). The presence of a dense blob
of material across the line of sight of neutron star was
speculated within an accretion radius (Jaisawal & Naik
2014). In the present study, the existence of a dense
blob of material or the accretion wake can not be de-
nied. If the material is dense, it can absorb the X-ray
photons, henceforth no pulsation is observed as seen
during the first observation. Nonetheless, the detection
of strong iron emission lines favors the hypothesis of
absorption through a clumpy stellar wind in our study."
"Alternatively, the cessation of the pulsations can be
possible in X-ray pulsars when the source enters into
propeller regime (Illarionov & Sunyaev 1975) at ex-
tremely low mass accretion rate (see, e.g., in case of
GX 1+4 and GRO J1744-28 reported by Cui 1997). If
this is the case, the observed X-ray luminosity can be
assumed as a limiting luminosity of the pulsar. How-
ever, it is unlikely that the pulsar was in the propeller
regime during first AstroSat observation. This is due to
the detection of iron emission lines during this obser-
vation. Considering the presence of high column den-
sity and iron emission lines at late orbital phases of the
binary orbit (first AstroSat observation), the disappear-
ance of pulsations can be interpreted as due to the pres-
ence of accretion wake."
"From the second AstroSat data, pulsations were
clearly detected in the out-of-eclipse data. The pulse
profiles of OAO 1657–415 were found to be singly
peaked with a dip like structure at the peak of the pro-"

"file. Usually this source is subjected to strong and dense
stellar wind of the supergiant companion as it is in a
close binary system. Inhomogenous distribution of stel-
lar wind as well as clumpy wind accretion in SGXBs
can affect the pulsed emission. The profile can be af-
fected mostly in the soft X-rays due to absorption. In
the present and previous studies of OAO 1657–415, the
presence of a dip in the profile is seen up to higher
energies (Pradhan et al. 2014). Such type of profiles
with absorption-like feature(s) at certain pulse phases
are common in transient BeXRB pulsars (Maitra, Paul
& Naik 2012; Naik et al. 2013; Jaisawal, Naik & Epili
2016). The complex shape of the pulse profiles in these
Be/X-ray pulsars is interpreted as an effect of coupling
between accreted material and magnetic field lines."
"We also carried out spectral investigation of the
source during the second AstroSat observation by di-
viding the data into two parts. The first part of the
data (Seg-I, Figure 2) was relatively brighter by a fac-
tor of 34 than the first AstroSat observation. We did
not detect any iron emission line in the data from this
segment. The SXT and LAXPC spectra from the sec-
ond part of the second observation (added Seg-II, III &
IV, Figure 2), covering 0.87–0.968 orbital phase range,
were highly absorbed. Only a weak iron emission line
at 6.4 keV was detected in this segment. As the spectral
fitting is limited to 0.5-20 keV range, detection of the
cyclotron absorption features (Jaisawal & Naik 2017;
Staubert et al. 2019) is not expected in the data."
"In summary, we have studied two AstroSat obser-
vations in March and July 2019 at late orbital phases of
the binary system. We did not detect any strong pulsa-
tion at the spin period of the pulsar in the first data set,
observed in 0.681–0.818 phase range. The presence of
relatively high column density and strong iron emission
lines at 6.4 keV and 6.7 keV with an equivalent width of
≈1 keV, suggest the clumpy wind material close to the
neutron star. A possibility of accretion wake can not be
denied at a late orbital phases of wind-fed SGXBs. The
pulsations are detected in the light curves obtained from
the second observation. From the energy and time re-
solved pulse profiles, it is found that the pulsations are
detected in the data before the source gets eclipsed by
the optical companion."
