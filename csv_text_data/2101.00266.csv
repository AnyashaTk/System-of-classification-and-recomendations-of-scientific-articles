Abstract
"We review spherical and inhomogeneous analytic solutions of the field equa-
tions of Einstein and of scalar-tensor gravity, including Brans-Dicke theory,
non-minimally (possibly conformally) coupled scalar fields, Horndeski, and
beyond Horndeski/DHOST gravity. The zoo includes both static and dy-
namic solutions, asymptotically flat, and asymptotically Friedmann-Lemâıtre-
Robertson-Walker ones. We minimize overlap with existing books and re-
views and we place emphasis on scalar field spacetimes and on geometries
that are “general” within certain classes. Relations between various solu-
tions, which have largely emerged during the last decade, are pointed out."

1. Introduction
"We have now known general relativity (GR) and its Schwarzschild solu-
tion describing a spherical isolated object for over a century, during which
GR has been put to the test and has found astrophysical applications that
were unconceivable at its beginnings. In the last few decades, other analytic
solutions of Einstein theory have been discovered and the theory itself has
been challenged (questioning GR, however, started early on with Weyl [1]
and Eddington [2]). Attempts to quantize gravity and one-loop renormal-
ization necessarily lead to deviations from the Einstein equations and to the
introduction of extra degrees of freedom, extra fields, or higher order cur-
vature terms [3, 4, 5]. Historically, the first model of inflation in the early
universe, the Starobinsky model [6], incorporated some of these quadratic
corrections by promoting the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian R (where R is the
Ricci scalar) to R+αR2. It is now known that this correction is equivalent
to introducing a massive scalar field in addition to gravity. So, at least the
Starobinsky inflationary scenario includes corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert
action [6]."
"The surprising discovery, made with Type Ia supernovae [7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12] that the present expansion of the universe is accelerated has led
cosmologists to postulate a completely ad hoc dark energy, which is possibly
a cosmological constant Λ suffering from the notorious cosmological constant
problems [13, 14]. Quintessence models of dark energy ([15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22], see [23] for a review) are not well-motivated theoretically. As a
consequence, although fitting most data, the standard model of cosmology,
the Λ-Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) model, appears unnatural. In fact, if
the cosmic acceleration is attributed to a cosmological constant, it suffers
from the fine-tuning and coincidence problems [23]. If ΛCDM is taken to
mean cold dark matter plus dark energy, it remains problematic because
dark energy was introduced ad hoc in the theoretical literature to explain
the cosmic acceleration and its nature is completely unknown, as testified
by the plethora of vastly different dark energy models in the literature. In
this sense, its introduction seems unnatural. In any case, the presence of a
speculative and exotic dark energy of completely unknown nature remains
deeply unsatisfactory."
"Starting in 2003 [24, 25], this situation has driven many authors to ex-
plain the present cosmic acceleration by modifying Einstein gravity at large
scales instead of invoking an ad hoc dark energy. This is the most press-
ing need to explore modified theories of gravity, among which the so-called
f(R) theories ([24, 25], see [26, 27, 28] for reviews) are very popular. This"
"fact has caused a resurgence of interest in modified gravity and in particular
in scalar-tensor gravity, a broader category known since at least 1961 [29]
in which f(R) theories fall as a subfamily. The discovery of gravitational
waves with the LIGO and VIRGO laser interferometric detectors [30, 31, 32]
in 2015 and the 2019 Event Horizon Telescope imaging of the near-horizon
region of the M87 black hole [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38] have provided unprece-
dented tools and motivation to study the detailed physics near black holes
and compact objects in both GR and alternative gravity. The comparison
of observations and theoretical predictions requires the knowledge of ana-
lytical solutions in these theories and of the phenomenology of test particles
(massive and massless) and fluids in these geometries. Without these back-
ground geometries it is impossible to compute strong field effects and these
solutions must necessarily be stable ones. What is more, due to the unex-
pectedly high black hole masses measured in the LIGO and VIRGO events,
primordial black holes have attracted again attention [39, 40]. Their impor-
tance is that, if they abound in the universe, they can be significant dark
matter components. This motivates the study of toy models (i.e., analytic
solutions) in which such objects, if they exist, evolve on time scales not
completely negligible with respect to the Hubble scale (e.g., [41, 42])."
"In summary, this renewed activity in cosmology and astrophysics has led
to the need of a better understanding of the physics of black holes and other
objects of astrophysical or mathematical interest in these theories, and to
deeper studies of their analytic solutions. The search for analytic solutions of
a physical theory unveils its physical aspects and promotes physical insight.
Exact solutions of the field equations of non-linear theories are difficult to
find, and they are usually found only by simplifying the problem which, in
practice, means by assuming symmetries. Free from as many complications
as possible, it is easier to gain physical insight by examining symmetric
solutions which allow one to focus on a few aspects of the theory at a time.
Certainly this has been the case for the Schwarzschild solution of GR, which
has led to the discovery of black holes and to the investigation of many
astrophysical and fundamental physics phenomena and, indirectly (through
black hole mergers), to the discovery of gravitational waves. When trying
to make sense of a theory of gravity, one of the first aspects to examine
consists of the available exact solutions of its field equations and, among
these, its spherically symmetric solutions describing black holes, stars, and
possibly other objects. It is unavoidable to compare these solutions with
the corresponding one of GR, i.e., the Schwarzschild geometry [43]."
"Historically, there have been attempts to find exact spherically symmet-
ric solutions of the field equations of theories of gravity describing increas-"
"ingly complicated physical situations: vacuum, vacuum with a cosmological
constant Λ, electrovacuum, perfect fluids, imperfect fluids, scalar fields in
the context of GR, and then situations in which the scalar field has grav-
itational nature and is an unavoidable ingredient of the theory of gravity,
as in scalar-tensor theories. In practice, solving the field equations directly
is challenging and many attempts to generate new analytic solutions have
relied on the knowledge of previously existing solutions in different physical
contexts. These studies have unveiled relations between different geometries
and between different theories (for example, solution-generating techniques
have employed conformal transformations relating GR with scalar-tensor
gravity through the use of different conformal frames)."
"Here we review analytic solutions of GR (part I) and of scalar-tensor
gravity (part II) which are spherically symmetric, asymptotically or non-
asymptotically flat, static or dynamical. We will not repeat the discussion
of the most well-known solutions that are found in standard books and
reviews (especially those sourced by a perfect or an imperfect fluid), nor
will we discuss at length the mathematical structure of the solutions, their
algebraic classification, conformal diagrams, or their causal structure. For
these aspects, we refer the reader to the monumental work [44] on analytic
solutions of the Einstein equations, and to [45, 46, 47, 48, 49] for other
aspects, more detailed discussions, and recent developments. Here, instead,
we focus on exact solutions within certain classes, pointing out the relations
between various families of exact solutions that have emerged during the
last few decades."
"Of course, one can write down a metric tensor and run the Einstein equa-
tions from left to right à la Synge, computing an effective energy-momentum
tensor which, in general, violates all the energy conditions [50] and is com-
pletely unphysical. We do not consider such solutions unless the effective
energy momentum tensor that sources them is physically reasonable."
"Solutions containing a scalar field occupy a prominent position in this
review. This scalar could be a matter field in Einstein theory (as would be,
for example, the recently discovered Higgs boson of the Standard Model of
particle physics [51, 52]). Alternatively, the scalar field could be a gravita-
tional field in an alternative theory of gravity, such as the Brans-Dicke or the
dilaton fields. Among the wide spectrum of alternative theories of gravity,
we restrict ourselves to Brans-Dicke gravity [29], its scalar-tensor general-
izations [53, 54, 55] including the wide class of f(R) theories [26, 27, 28],
Horndeski gravity [56], and degenerate higher order scalar-tensor theories
[57, 58]. We exclude torsion and, in order to keep the material contained,
we restrict to spherically symmetric solutions of the field equations and to"
"four spacetime dimensions (for higher-dimensional solutions, see [59, 60] and
the references therein)."
"Certain dynamical solutions in this review are believed to represent black
holes. In the dynamical case the black hole boundary, and the black hole
concept itself, are not defined by the usual notion of event horizon, which
is a null surface and a causal boundary (i.e., a connected component of the
boundary of the causal past of future null infinity [50]). The teleological
notion of event horizon requires the knowledge of the entire causal structure
of spacetime and is impractical in dynamical situations and in numerical
relativity. Instead, dynamical black holes are defined quasilocally by appar-
ent horizons and marginally trapped surfaces. A drawback of this definition
(see [61, 62, 47, 48] for reviews) is that apparent horizons depend on the
choice of the spacetime foliation, as exemplified dramatically by the fact
that the Schwarzschild spacetime admits non-symmetric foliations without
apparent horizons [63, 64]. However, in the presence of spherical symmetry
(to which we restrict here), all spherically symmetric foliations produce the
same apparent horizons [65]."
"We follow the notation of Ref. [50]. The metric signature is (−+++), we
use geometric units in which the speed of light c and Newton’s constant G
assume the values c = G = 1, κ ≡ 8πG, and � ≡ gab∇a∇b is d’Alembert’s
operator. The Riemann and Ricci tensors are given in terms of the Christof-
fel symbols Γdab by"
"Rabcd = Γdac,b − Γdbc,a + ΓeacΓdeb − ΓebcΓdea , (1)"
"Rac ≡ Rabcb = Γbac,b − Γbbc,a + ΓdacΓede − ΓdbcΓbda , (2)"
"and R ≡ gabRab is the Ricci curvature.
Let us define some terminology that will be used in this work. A perfect"
fluid is identified by the energy-momentum tensor
"Tab = (P + ρ)uaub + Pgab , (3)"
"where uc is the fluid four-velocity (normalized to ucuc = −1), ρ is its energy
density, and P is the isotropic pressure. In practice, P and ρ are not unre-
lated and there will be an equation of state relating them but, technically,
this is not required by the definition above. This fact opens the possibil-
ity that, when looking for formal analytic solutions of the field equations
sourced by a fluid, one can adjust P and ρ, which depend on the space-
time point, so that a certain geometry can be engineered to satisfy the field
equations. This procedure detracts from the physics, in the sense that it"
"would be much preferable to assign a priori an equation of state valid ev-
erywhere, for example a barotropic equation of state of the form P = wρ
with w = constant, and then solve the field equations. In practice, this
method is not always followed or does not produce new solutions. The less
than satisfactory procedure of determining the equation of state a poste-
riori is not unique to spherical solutions (it is used, for example, already
in cosmology where the field equations are simpler). There are instances
where this procedure does not cause harm, for example when one decides
to regard a minimally coupled scalar field as an effective perfect fluid. In
this case, the equation of state Peff = wρeff exhibits a dynamical equation
of state parameter w = w (xα) depending on the spacetime position. Other
times, the equation of state of the fluid does not originate in a field theory
but is derived in order to satisfy the equations and, while it may reduce to a
satisfactory equation of state in certain regions of spacetime, it will remain
rather ad hoc in other regions. This is the case, for example, for the McVittie
solution of the Einstein equations describing a central object embedded in
a cosmological space, that will be discussed in Sec. 7. But then it turns out
that the McVittie solution is a also a solution of a different theory of gravity
that does not require an ad hoc fluid equation of state. This new perspective
somehow rescues the McVittie geometry from the limbo of solutions with
questionable motivation (the borders of which are rather subjective). The
possibility of having different sources for a certain GR geometry, or that the
latter solves a different theory of gravity, remains unexplored for most of
the solutions reported in this review."

Part I
Spherical solutions of general
relativity
"We begin by reviewing spherical solutions of the Einstein equations. Pro-
ceeding in order of increasing complexity, one is naturally led to consider
vacuum, vacuum with a cosmological constant, and then simple forms of
matter: electrovacuum, a scalar field, a perfect, and then an imperfect fluid."
"Without loss of generality, the spherically symmetric line element in four
spacetime dimensions can be written in polar coordinates (t, r, ϑ, ϕ) as (see
Sec. 11.7 of Ref. [66])"
"ds2 = −A2(t, R)dt2 +B2(t, R)dR2 +R2dΩ2(2) , (6)"
"using the areal radius R as the radial coordinate, and where dΩ2
(2)"
"≡ dϑ2 +
sin2 ϑ dϕ2 is the line element on the unit 2-sphere."
"The situation A2B2 = 1 is of special interest [67, 68, 69] and high-
lights special algebraic properties of the geometry. Jacobson has shown [69]
(also in higher dimension) that it is equivalent to require that the double
projection of the Ricci tensor Rabℓaℓb onto radial null vectors ℓa vanishes.
Another characterization is that the restriction of the Ricci tensor to the
(t, R) subspace be proportional to the restriction of the metric gab to the
same subspace [69]. A third characterization is that the areal radius R is
an affine parameter along radial null geodesics [69]. GR geometries satisfy-
ing these conditions are varied, ranging from vacuum, electrovacuum with
either Maxwell or non-linear Born-Infeld electrodynamics, to the “string
hedgehog” global monopole [70]."
"A convenient form of the gauge (6) is [71, 72]"
"ds2 = − e−Φ(t,R)
("
"1 −
2MMSH(t, R)"
"1 − 2MMSH(t, R)/R
+R2dΩ2(2) , (7)"
"where MMSH(R) is the Misner-Sharp-Hernandez mass [73, 74] enclosed in a
sphere of radius R."
"In view of astrophysical applications, the motion of massive particles
and fluids around a black hole is of great interest. Since these motions can
be quite complicated, pseudo-Newtonian potentials have been introduced
that give an effective simplified description of timelike geodesics around
Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes [75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84,
85, 86, 87, 88]. The Paczynski-Wiita pseudopotential for the Schwarzschild
black hole (11) is simply [75, 77]"
"φPW(R) = −
m"
"R− 2m
. (8)"
"This potential reproduces exactly the radius of the innermost stable cir-
cular orbit (“ISCO” or “marginally stable orbit”), that of the marginally
bound orbit, and the form of the Keplerian angular momentum L(R). It
reproduces, accurately but not exactly, the Keplerian angular velocity and
the radial epicyclic frequency [75, 77]. Therefore, the structure of the phase
space of timelike geodesics in the Schwarzschild metric does not differ much
from the one obtained with the pseudopotential [89]."
"The motion of massive test particles and fluids around black holes offers
potential tests of the theory of gravity using observations of these motions
near a black hole horizon. A pseudopotential can be introduced for any
static and spherically symmetric metric of the form (6) with A = A(R) and
B = B(R), obtaining"
"φ(R) =
1"
"in the approximation of particle velocities v ≪ 1 [77]. If the further as-
sumption A2(R)B2(R) = 1 holds, then this pseudopotential can be written
as [90]"
"φ(R) = − MMSH(R)
R− 2MMSH(R)"
", (10)"
as follows immediately from the gauge (7) with Φ = 0.
"2. Vacuum: the Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem and its generalization to
Λ 6= 0"
"As is well-known from any GR textbook, the Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem
[91, 92] establishes that the unique vacuum, spherically symmetric, and"
"asymptotically flat solution of the Einstein equations is the Schwarzschild
geometry [43]1"
"ds2 = −

dt2 +"
"1 − 2m/R
+R2dΩ2(2) , (11)"
"and the generalization of the theorem to electrovacuum establishes the unique-
ness of the Reissner-Nordström solution under the same assumptions (see
[96] for a review of GR black holes). A weak form of the Jebsen-Birkhoff
theorem states that the solution is static for special forms of the matter
energy-momentum tensor [97, 98, 99, 100]. In the literature, one finds also
almost-Birkhoff theorems that study small deviations from spherical sym-
metry or from vacuum [101, 102, 103, 104]."
"The Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem can be extended to vacuum with a cos-
mological constant Λ in a straightforward way concluding that, in this
case, the unique spherical solution of the vacuum Einstein equations is
the Kottler/Schwarzschild-de Sitter (KSdS) geometry [105] if Λ > 0 and
the asymptotics are de Sitter, or is the Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter (SAdS)
geometry if, instead, Λ < 0 and the asymptotics are anti-de Sitter. In
the following, we refer explicitly to the KSdS case, but the discussion for
Λ < 0 and SAdS is straightforward. The standard textbook discussion of
the Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem is obtained as a special case by setting Λ = 0."
"In locally static (Schwarzschild-like or “curvature”) coordinates (T,R, ϑ, ϕ),
the KSdS metric reads"

"where H =

"Λ/3 and m are positive constants.
Surprisingly, modern relativity textbooks do not make reference to the"
"Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem when Λ 6= 0, and the literature is ambiguous to
this regard. Occasionally, there are explicit statements of the uniqueness of
the S(A)dS space (e.g., [106, 104, 107]) and a proof of the extension of the
theorem to Λ 6= 0 was given in Synge’s 1960 textbook [108] (without mention
of Kottler’s 1918 paper [105]). A simple proof in null coordinates was given
by Schleich and Witt [109] and there are mathematically more sophisticated
proofs [110, 111, 112, 113]. As for the Schwarzschild solution, uniqueness"
"1In spacetime dimension d > 4, the uniqueness of the corresponding “Schwarzschild-
Tangherlini” solution was proved by Bronnikov and Melnikov [93], and by Gibbons et al.
[94, 95]."
"is associated with stability of the KSdS and SAdS solutions with respect to
perturbations, as established in [114, 115, 116, 117]. However, the evidence
of the uniqueness of KSdS and SAdS is downplayed in the literature and
papers exist that erroneusly state the existence of spherical solutions of the
vacuum Einstein equations with Λ > 0 alternative to KSdS [118, 119, 120],
which would contradict uniqueness. The problem is that the line element
is written in rather complicated coordinates and is not recognized as the
KSdS line element, or an incorrect coordinate transformation leads to a
line element formally different from the KSdS one. Furthermore, there are
solutions of the Einstein equations that represent central inhomogeneities
embedded in Friedmann-Lemâıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spaces and
that apparently reduce to alternatives to the KSdS solution in the special
case when the FLRW “background”2 reduces to de Sitter [121, 122, 123,
124]. However, these are solutions with matter sources and not Λ-vacuum
solutions. These putative alternatives have been shown to be either KSdS
disguised by unconventional coordinates, or genuinely different solutions in
the presence of matter [125]."

"3The ϑ-ϑ and ϕ-ϕ components of the Einstein equations provide the same information
because of the symmetry."
2.2. Simultaneous baldness and cosmic baldness
"Well-known cosmic no-hair theorems state that, with a few exceptions
(i.e., overdense Bianchi models that collapse before the cosmological con-
stant has a chance to dominate the cosmic dynamics), de Sitter space be-
haves as an attractor in the late-time dynamics of the universe [126, 127,
128]. In an analogy, no-hair theorems establish the uniqueness of the Schwarz-
schild solution among GR black holes and exclude the possibility of fields
living in their exterior, since they would make the geometry deviate from
Schwarzschild [129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141].
Moreover, the KSdS solution is unique, as shown above, and is perturba-
tively stable [114, 115, 116, 117]. Since the KSdS geometry combines black
hole and de Sitter physics, it is natural to expect that simultaneous no-hair
and cosmic no-hair theorems exist and that the KSdS spacetime acts as a
late-time attractor for the dynamics of time-dependent spherical spacetimes
containing a central inhomogeneity in the presence of a positive Λ. This idea
has not been explored much, probably due to the difficulty of handling the
Einstein equations in the presence of matter. As a starter in this direction,
a non-perturbative result in the presence of an imperfect fluid was derived
in [125]."
Consider the Einstein equations with matter
"Gab = −Λgab + 8πTab (24)
and assume spherical symmetry, then the line element is (6). Further assume
that the geometry is asymptotically de Sitter, i.e., that there is a de Sitter-
like cosmological horizon (with areal radius RH) and the solution of (24)
reduces to (12) as R → R−H. Then, assume that the energy-momentum

at late times, in which case the vacuum uniqueness theorem for KSdS holds,
or else both ρ and P = wρ become subdominant and Λ comes to dominate
the expansion at late times while ρ and P become unimportant—then the
solution reduces to KSdS."
3. No-hair theorems
"No-hair theorems have a long history. Attempts to evade the Jebsen-
Birkhoff theorem include the possibility of a matter source in the black hole
exterior, for example a fluid or a scalar field. However, it is not so easy be-
cause this matter becomes physically pathological. For example, according
to an early no-hair result by Chase [129], a four-dimensional static, massless,
asymptotically flat scalar field solution with a simply connected event hori-
zon has the squared norm of the timelike Killing vector diverging there. The
only solution is Schwarzschild, corresponding to φ ≡ 0 outside the horizon, or
the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour-Buchdahl-Wyman (“FJNWBW”) solu-
tion containing a naked singularity, which is described below, see Eqs. (42)
and (43). The remaining possibility of the scalar field being singular on the
horizon is not mentioned explicitly by Chase [129], who views the central
naked singularity as a horizon shrunk to a point."
"Christodoulou has shown [142] that the naked singularity of the FJN-
WBW geometry is unstable to gravitational collapse.4 In numerical studies
of scalar field collapse to a black hole in spherical symmetry, the scalar field
either collapses below the Schwarzschild horizon forming a Schwarzschild
black hole, or disperses to infinity [144]. Exact scalar field solutions de-
scribing other configurations (i.e., naked singularities) exist, but they are"
"4See Ref. [143] for a version of Christodolou’s theorem with slightly relaxed assump-
tions."
"unstable and do not form in numerical collapse.5 They are discussed in the
next section."
"No-hair theorems for a scalar field with potential V (φ) that is monoton-
ically increasing and convex have been proved by Bekenstein [133, 131, 132].
A generalization to general positive potentials V (φ) was given in [147, 148],
followed by a version of the no-hair theorem for scalar multiplets [137] (and
by a no-hair theorem for nonminimally coupled scalars, which are discussed
later [149, 134]). The no-hair theorems, however, fail in Einstein-Yang-Mills
theory [150, 151, 152], in Einstein-Skyrme theory [153, 154], and in situ-
ations where the above scenarios couple with dilaton [155, 156] or Higgs
[157, 158] fields."
"From the physical point of view, the parameters charactering station-
ary black holes are conserved quantities associated with a Gauss law: mass,
angular momentum, electric and magnetic charges. Therefore, the Maxwell
field satisfying the Gauss law leads to the absence of Maxwell hair and to
the uniqueness of the Reissner-Nordström solution. Moreover, according to
theorems by Israel [159, 160], staticity implies spherical symmetry for elec-
trovacuum GR, from which the uniqueness of the Reissner-Nordström black
hole follows. More in general, Hawking’s strong rigidity theorem [161, 162]
states that a stationary black hole in GR is either spherical or axisymmetric
when the null energy condition is satisfied (this theorem underlies the proof
of Hawking’s original no-hair theorem [163] for Brans-Dicke black holes).
The Hawking and Israel theorems, however, do not extend to non-Abelian
Yang-Mills fields. In this respect a scalar field is similar: since it has no
associated Gauss law, it is in principle possible to have scalar hair."
"Non-Abelian gauge theories with gravity typically violate the no-hair
theorem, especially when they possess solitons in the limit to Minkowski
spacetime. Non-Abelian Yang-Mills fields in GR exhibit a short-ranged
gauge field which is not killed by setting to zero the conserved charges.
In addition, non-Abelian Yang-Mills black holes in GR can be static but
still deviate from spherical symmetry, thus evading the Israel theorems and
allowing for hair. Since these fields violate some of the ingredients neces-
sary for the proofs of the Hawking and Israel theorems, which in turn are
needed to prove no-hair results, it is not too surprising that they exhibit
hair. Skyrme fields exhibit some of these features of non-Abelian Yang-
Mills fields and admit hair as well (see [150, 151, 152, 153, 154] for more
detailed discussions)."
"5See Refs. [145, 146] for an overview of gravitational collapse."
"Even in scalar-tensor gravity with a simple Brans-Dicke-like field, it be-
comes more difficult to make statements when the black holes are not asymp-
totically flat. A no-hair theorem for asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes
has been proved when φ settles asymptotically in a global negative minimum
of the potential V (φ) [164]. Scalar field potentials not bounded from below,
although unphysical in GR and scalar-tensor gravity, can become physical
in supergravity and string theories [165]—the reader should bear in mind
that, in this review, we restrict ourselves to GR and scalar-tensor gravity."

"Their general solution which is static, spherically symmetric, and asymptoti-

173, 174] by authors who did not recognize it in different coordinate systems,
or were unaware of its previous derivation. A simple proof of its uniqueness
is given by Wyman in [170]. It does not describe a black hole: it has no
horizons and represents a central naked singularity at areal radius R = 0.

"The radial null geodesics of the FJNWBW geometry were studied in

holes and not to naked singularities ([183, 184], see8 [144] for a review),

from these numerical studies, the FJNWBW geometry is indeed unstable,
as shown long ago in [189]."

mass M and electric charge Q, keeping the ratio Q2/M finite, in which the

"The energy conditions satisfied by the scalar field source of the FJN-
WBW metric, and the nature of the naked singularity, were discussed in

ing image magnification and time delay between images, were studied in

"Various theorems were formulated which relate the existence of black
holes and wormholes with the potential V (φ) [134, 196, 197]; generally, they
place necessary (but not sufficient) restrictions on the shape or sign of V for
the existence of black holes and other static spherical solutions. Bronnikov

stars with finite radius, as well as regular black holes. For ǫ = −1, there is
no such restriction and classic wormhole solutions for free scalars [199, 200]
are recovered. In total, Bronnikov and Fabris classify the possible regular
configurations in sixteen different classes. These include solutions with a
regular centre at areal radius R0 and asymptotics that are Minkowski, de

of Bronnikov and Fabris [198] extends to more general k-essence theories
with Lagrangian L = P (X) − V (φ), where X ≡ −∇cφ∇cφ and the regular
function P is monotonic."
"Another analytic solution of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations that
is static, spherical, asymptotically flat, and has φ → 0, V (0) = 0, V ′(0) =
0 and V ′′(0) = 0 was proposed in [201]. It represents a black hole, but
the complicated potential V (φ) has a vertical asymptote where it diverges
to minus infinity, which makes the solution unphysical. Furthermore, the
asymptotic value φ = 0 of the potential is not a minimum but an inflection
point. For a particular value of a parameter, this geometry reproduces a
previous solution of Anabalón and Oliva [202] which has been shown to be
unstable with respect to radial linear perturbations [203]."
4.3. Time-dependent solutions
"In the cases when the solution of the Einstein-scalar field equations is not
asymptotically flat or is time-dependent, there is no known general spher-
ical solution and only special solutions are known. We report them in the
following."
4.3.1. Wyman’s “other” solutions
"In addition to the well-known FJNWBW solution, in [170] Wyman pre-
sented another class of static spherically symmetric solutions with a massless
free scalar field which depends on time. Instead of looking for static solu-
tions with scalar field φ = φ(r), the Einstein equations can also be solved by
assuming a static metric and φ = φ(t), which is what originates Wyman’s
“other” solutions. In the context of the equivalence between a scalar field
and a fluid, this class can be seen as stiff fluid solutions. In most of these
solutions, the metric coefficients are given in the form of power series, which
leads to formulae too clumsy to be useful in practice (for example, in curva-
ture calculations). The same consideration applies to their generalizations
to a non-vanishing cosmological constant given by Varela [204]. However, a
particularly simple solution is given explicitly by Wyman [170]:"
"ds2 = −κ r2dt2 + 2dr2 + r2dΩ2(2) , (67)"
φ(t) = φ0 t . (68)
"Substitution into the Einstein equations with a free scalar field as a source
yields φ0 = 1/"
"√
κ. This solution was generalized to the case Λ 6= 0 by"
"Sultana [205] and reproduces a special case of an older family of perfect
fluid solutions found by Ibanez and Sanz [206]. The geometry (67) is not
asymptotically flat and has a singularity at r = 0, where the Ricci scalar R =
8π∇cφ∇cφ = −1/r2 and the Ricci squared RabRab = 1/r4 diverge. Since
∇cr∇cr = 1/2, there are no horizons (which are the roots of ∇cr∇cr = 0)
and the central singularity is naked. The same conclusions apply to Sultana’s
generalization [205] with Λ 6= 0. The Misner-Sharp-Hernandez mass [73, 74]
MMSH = r/4 contained in a sphere of radius r is always positive."
"Both Wyman’s solution (67), (68) and its generalization by Sultana for
Λ 6= 0 were mapped into the Jordan frame of a conformally coupled scalar
field to generate exact solutions, following a technique made popular by
Bekenstein for a free scalar and adapted, e.g., by Abreu et al. [207] to
the case of a non-zero potential. The same conformal mapping tecnique
generates time-dependent spherical solutions of Jordan frame Brans-Dicke
gravity (see below) and of f(R) = R2 gravity [208]."
"The Wyman geometry (67) is reproduced as a special case of a more
general static line element obtained by Carloni and Dunsby [209], but for a
scalar-tensor theory in which the scalar field is only radius-dependent and
is subject to a power-law potential."
"The next two solutions of the Einstein equations describe spherical inho-
mogeneities embedded in a scalar field-fueled FLRW universe, the first for
a free field and the second for exponential potential. They have also been
used to generate solutions of scalar-tensor gravity using conformal transfor-
mations."

consequence, there is no analytic expression for this time t∗, which depends
on the mass parameter C and on A0. At t = t∗, two additional apparent
horizons appear, one of which expands forever, while the other (a black hole
apparent horizon) contracts, then merges with the first apparent horizon
which in the meantime has been growing. As they meet, these two apparent
horizons merge and disappear, causing a timelike naked singularity to appear
at R = 0 in the FLRW “background” [210, 47]. This naked singularity
inhabits the universe for the rest of its history and the scalar field is regular
on the apparent horizons. This dynamics of apparent horizon radii has been
dubbed “S-curve phenomenology” (because of the shape of the horizon radii
versus time) and recurs in solutions of GR and of Brans-Dicke theory [47].
The apparent horizons of the HMN solution are spacelike [210, 47]."
"Apparent horizons appearing or disappearing in pairs constitute a typi-
cal phenomenology of time-dependent black holes in GR and in alternative
theories of gravity [47]. Geometrically, it can be understood by the fact
that the surface RAH = RAH(t) defining the apparent horizons can intersect
more than once slices of comoving time, producing one, two, or three hori-
zon radii. For some critical value of time, two of these roots coincide and
the number of apparent horizons before and after t∗ differ by two, which is
associated with apparent horizons appearing (or disappearing) in pairs."

dimensionally reduced theories). Feinstein et al. provide five-dimensional
Fonarev spacetimes [215], while higher-dimensional solutions are obtained
with a solution-generating technique due to Buchdahl [216] and Tangen
[217], see also [218].9"
"The Fonarev solution contains, during different epochs of the “back-
ground” FLRW universe, a naked central singularity or a black hole ap-
parent horizon, and is asymptotically FLRW—it can be thought of as a
generalization of the FJNWBW solution (to which it is conformal) to a
FLRW background. The physical nature of the Fonarev class of solutions
was studied in [211] and [220]. At early times, there is no apparent horizon
and there is a naked central singularity embedded in a FLRW “background”,
but at a critical time (dependent on the parameters) a pair of apparent hori-
zons appears, one expanding (a cosmological horizon) and one contracting
and covering a central singularity located at a finite areal radius [211, 220].
The contracting apparent horizon asymptotes to this singularity [211, 220].
Conformal diagrams for the Fonarev spacetime are given in Refs. [211, 220]."

"10A phantom field is unstable and should not exist so, at best, it is a signature of a
truncated effective theory. Its recent popularity [222, 223, 224, 225, 226] arises from the
repeatedly coming and going claims that a phantom equation of state of the dark energy
is preferred by cosmological observations."

geometry [227] is a spherical, continuously self-similar spacetime within
this context admitting a homothetic Killing vector field ξc that satisfies
£ξgab = 2gab. The original form in [227] contained an error later corrected
in [228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233]. It constitutes a useful example in the
study of critical phenomena arising in the collapse of scalar fields to black"

subject of a large literature (over 300 articles at the time of writing, which we

are negative) and is not asymptotically FLRW, either (if it were, the limit"
"11Called a “dirty black hole” in current terminology, because it is surrounded by matter
and it Hawking-radiates as a graybody."
"m → 0 would reproduce FLRW space, which is not the case). The Kise-
lev solution is usually reported as describing a “black hole surrounded by
quintessence” but this terminology is extremely misleading. In fact, the
matter source is not a perfect fluid (or a mixture of perfect fluids if the
sum extends to n > 1) [245] because it exhibits anisotropic pressure. More-
over, the cosmologist’s notion of quintessence,12 i.e., a perfect fluid with
equation of state P = wρ with −1 < w < −1/3, belongs to accelerated
FLRW universes and the Kiselev geometry has no FLRW “background”.
Unfortunately, most of the literature follows the quintessence interpretation
and only recently ([245, 247], see also [248, 249]) clarity has been made.13"
"Furthermore, the anisotropic energy-momentum tensor sourcing the Kiselev
geometry can be split into a perfect fluid component plus either an elec-
tromagnetic or a scalar field [247]. Depending on the parameter values,
this stress-energy tensor can violate the null energy condition [247], which
means that great care is required in the use of the Kiselev spacetime as a
toy model. In the most physically viable of these pictures, an electrically
charged fluid is supported by the pressure gradient and by the electric field
that it generates [247]."

is not the Kiselev matter source with wq = 1/3 (a value which, strictly
speaking, is not allowed by the Kiselev condition −1 < w < −1/3 [244])
and describes an incoherent superposition of electromagnetic waves with
random phases, directions of propagation, and polarizations and not the
radial electrostatic field of the Reissner-Nordström geometry."
"12Even in cosmology, quintessence is usually an effective perfect fluid consisting of a
scalar field φ in a suitable potential V (φ). This effective fluid would have a constant
equation of state only for very special potentials (for example, two tuned exponential
terms [246]), which are not the usual ones encountered in the literature on quintessence.
Nevertheless, most articles on the Kiselev black hole keep referring to it as “a black hole
surrounded by quintessence” and, in this sense, this terminology is doubly misleading."

6. Fluid spheres
"The main motivation for considering fluid spheres in GR is to model
(static) relativistic stars. Sometimes it is of interest to consider dynamical
asymptotically flat fluid spheres instead of stars. The most common situ-
ation occurs in the study of spherical collapse to black holes, but expand-
ing solutions modelling, e.g., exploding wormholes, relativistic fireballs, or
explosive events have also been explored [253], although the literature is
naturally much smaller than the one on relativistic stellar configurations of
equilibrium."
6.1. Static fluid spheres in GR
"Stars are configurations of equilibrium and the search for static perfect
fluid spheres amounts to solving the Einstein equations for hydrostatic and
thermodynamic equilibrium. Aside from rotation, spherical symmetry is
not just a convenient approximation because static perfect fluid configura-
tions on stellar scales are expected to smooth out “mountains” and other
deviations from sphericity (see [254, 255] for a partial proof in GR)."

Exact solutions of the Einstein equations in spherical symmetry with"
"perfect fluids as the matter source have a long history, beginning with the
toy Schwarzschild interior solution with uniform density [43] now reported"
"in all GR textbooks, the Tolman solutions [257], and other classic ones
[259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265]. Existence and uniqueness of the solutions
are discussed in [266, 267, 268]. While it is possible to find analytic solutions,
the simplifying techniques used [269, 44, 270] very often make the solution
rather uninteresting from the physical point of view [250]."
"Buchdhal [216] proved that all static, spherical perfect fluid stars with
dρ/dr ≤ 0 satisfy the “Buchdhal bound” RS/r < 8/9, where RS = 2M is
the Schwarzschild radius and M is the star’s mass. Half a century later,
Andréasson [271] generalized this bound to the radius-independent upper
limit on the compactness 2m(r)/r < 8/9, assuming algebraic inequalities
(but not dρ/dr ≤ 0) on ρ and P ."
"Delgaty and Lake [250], Finch and Skea [270], and Nambo and Sarbach
[272] review perfect fluid interior solutions that are static, spherically sym-
metric, and asymptotically flat. Using computer algebra, Delgaty and Lake
[250] classified 127 candidate perfect fluid solutions of the Einstein equations
that had appeared in the literature by 1998. They required:"
1. isotropic pressure P (r);
2. regularity of the curvature scalars at the origin r = 0;
3. positive-definite energy density ρ(0) and pressure P (0) at the origin;
"4. vanishing pressure P (r0) at a finite radius r0 > 0 (this is a necessary
and sufficient condition to match the interior metric with a Schwarz-
schild exterior through the usual junction conditions on a spacelike
surface [273]);15"
"5. the energy density ρ(r) and pressure P (r) are decreasing functions of
the physical radius;"
6. the adiabatic speed of sound c2s = dP/dρ is less than the speed of light.
"Only 16 candidates satisfied all these physical requirements and, of these,
only 9 have monotonically decreasing sound speed [250]. A common failure
of satisfying the perfect fluid criterion is that solutions reported as perfect
fluid ones in the literature actually have anisotropic pressure instead (in
addition, several of the putative solutions reported in the literature do not
actually solve the Einstein equations, or were given with typographical errors
in the original articles reporting them). As usual with analytic solutions,
some of them have been discovered more than once, either because they were"
"15Star models with density and pressure vanishing asymptotically as r → +∞, which
are excluded by this requirement, are also considered to be physical provided that the
total mass is finite [274, 275, 276], which is the case of common boson star models."
"disguised by different coordinates (the most common ones are curvature and
isotropic coordinates, but Buchdahl, Synge isothermal, and Gaussian polar
coordinates have also been used, see [277] for a summary), or because authors
were unaware of previous discoveries.16"
"Lake [278] has provided an algorithm to generate all regular static spher-
ically symmetric perfect fluid solutions of the Einstein equations. This algo-
rithm is based on the choice of a single monotonic generating function which
is, however, unknown. In order to extract physically meaningful solutions,
the generating function must satisfy restrictive integro-differential inequal-
ities expressing physical requirements external to the algorithm [278]. A
similar algorithm was proposed in [279]; Martin and Visser [280] proposed
a revised version of the Delgaty-Lake algorithm.17 Solution-generating the-
orems are given in [44, 281, 282, 283, 277]. The general static and spher-
ical perfect fluid solution of the Einstein equations with equation of state
P = −ρ/5 was given by Semiz [284] using Buchdahl coordinates."
"Given that exact solution catalogues are extensive and evolving, online
databases of exact solutions, including perfect fluid spheres, are a better
heritage repository than journal articles. While the oldest repositories are
now inaccessible, grdb.org stores the metric tensor and performs calculations
interactively using the GRTensorII software [285]. Databases and computer
algebra are necessarily superseded by new versions."
6.2. Dynamical fluid spheres in GR
"The search for analytic perfect fluid solutions becomes more difficult
when the latter are dynamical. The first step consists of searching for the
analogue of the interior Schwarzschild solution with uniform density. Since
the interior metric must match the exterior Schwarzschild vacuum, in this
case the only possibility for the interior perfect fluid is a dust with vanishing
pressure throughout the star [286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292]. The most
well-known solution, which describes the gravitational collapse of a FLRW
dust is the one by Oppenheimer and Snyder [286], but other contracting
and expanding solutions with uniform density were studied over the years
[293, 287, 288, 289, 290, 294, 295, 291, 292], to which we refer the reader."
"Mathematical theorems can be useful not only in the search of exact,
but also numerical solutions. For example, it was demonstrated in [296]"
"16See Appendix C of [250] for a partial list.
17The existence of such algorithms was pointed out by Wyman in 1949, but they were"
found only relatively recently.
"that any arbitrary static anisotropic fluid sphere in GR can be mimicked by
a perfect fluid, plus an electromagnetic field, plus a scalar field."
7. Inhomogeneities embedded in a FLRW universe with fluid
"There are a few spherical and time-dependent solutions of the Einstein
equations that describe central objects (which could possibly be black holes,
as defined by the notion of apparent horizon instead of event horizon [61, 62,
48]) embedded in FLRW universes. The most well-known is without doubt
the 1933 McVittie solution, which has been the subject of renewed attention
during the past decade and is also a solution of alternative theories of gravity
[297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311,
312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322]. The charged version
of the McVittie solution is known [323, 324], as well as generalized McVittie
solutions [325, 326, 221, 121, 122, 123, 124]. A few other, qualitatively
different, solutions are known."
7.1. McVittie solutions
"In order to study the effect of the cosmic dynamics on local systems,
McVittie constructed a family of solutions of the Einstein equations [327]
describing a central inhomogeneity embedded in a FLRW universe. Al-
though there have been many studies of this family, mostly recently [328,
329, 297, 330, 331, 252, 301, 305, 332, 311, 312, 333, 308, 309, 303, 306, 307],
the latter has proved to be rather complex and it is not yet completely un-
derstood in all its aspects. The McVittie spacetime is the only perfect fluid
solution of the Einstein equations which is spherically symmetric, shear free,
and asymptotically FLRW with no radial energy flow [334]. This theorem
is stated explicitly by Raychaudhuri in [334] without giving a formal proof.
However, the proof consists of the step-by-step original derivation of this so-
lution by McVittie in [327]. Both electrically neutral and charged McVittie
solutions are special cases of the Kustaanheimo-Qvist family of shear-free
solutions of the Einstein equations ([335], see also [45]). It has been shown
that the McVittie metric cannot be generated as a scalar field solution of the
Einstein equations. However, it is a solution of cuscuton theory, a special
case of Hor̆ava-Lifschitz gravity [316]. The cuscuton theory is the only form
of k-essence that admits McVittie solutions [316]. The McVittie geometry
is also an exact solution of shape dynamics, which constitutes a possible
approach to quantum gravity [336], and is also a non-deformable solution of
f(T ) gravity, where T is the torsion scalar [337]."

to the Schwarzschild horizon if a ≡ 1) [329, 331, 297, 338]. The singularity is
spacelike [331, 297]; another singularity occurs at r̄ = 0. McVittie’s original
interpretation of his geometry (125) as describing a point mass at r̄ = 0 is
untenable because, in general, the latter would be surrounded by the second
singularity at r̄ = m/2 [338, 329, 331, 297], where also the pressure of the

"Conformal diagrams of the McVittie spacetime were obtained in [305,
332, 311, 312] for various FLRW “backgrounds”. These diagrams differ
considerably according to the choice of the scale factor a(t) of the FLRW
universe in which the central object is embedded. This variety of possibilities
has caused some debate in the literature, originating from different choices
of a(t) by different authors and from the fact that general statements for all
possible behaviours of the scale factor cannot be made."
7.1.1. Charged and generalized McVittie geometries
"The charged McVittie solution was introduced by Shah and Vaidya [323]
and generalized by Mashhoon and Partovi [324], then rediscovered many
years later by Gao and Zhang [341]19 and generalized to higher dimensions
[342]. The apparent horizons can be located analytically and explicity in
the extremal case and numerically otherwise, revealing that this geometry
contains a black hole or a naked singularity according to the values of the
mass and charge parameters [314]."
"The charged McVittie metric was used to disprove the universality of
certain quantization laws for quantities built from the areas of black hole
apparent horizons and inspired by string theories20 [310]."
"Generalized McVittie solutions allowing for a radial energy flux onto, or
from, the central object were introduced in [325]. While these are rather
cumbersome, they have a simpler late-time attractor [343] that is recognized
as the non-rotating Thakurta [344] solution (see later). A class of solutions of
Brans-Dicke gravity found in [345] has the non-rotating Thakurta solution
as its limit to general relativity (i.e., the limit in which the Brans-Dicke
parameter ω → ∞) [47]."
"7.2. Einstein-Straus, Lemâıtre-Tolman-Bondi, and Vaidya solutions"
"Apparently unaware of the 1933 McVittie solution, Einstein & Straus
approached the problem of cosmic expansion versus local systems more
than a decade later, matching a Schwarzschild vacuum to a FLRW uni-
verse [346, 347] on a finite radius sphere, while the McVittie solution inter-
polates smoothly between a local dynamical Schwarzschild-like object and
the FLRW universe. The Einstein-Straus model is strictly dependent on
the spherical symmetry and does not generalize to axisymmetric spacetimes
[348, 349, 350] (see Ref. [351] for a review of the old problem of local dy-
namics versus cosmic expansion). Nevertheless, it is still used occasionally
as a toy model to address cosmological questions [e.g., 352, 353])."
"Other well-known spherical and dynamical solutions of the Einstein equa-
tions are Lemâıtre-Tolman-Bondi geometries [354, 355, 288] that can de-
scribe the collapse of dust and can be used to address the problem of local
versus cosmological dynamics. The Vaidya solutions, intead, describe out-
going or ingoing spherical shells of null dust."
"19Beware of a typographical error in the line element of Gao and Zhang [341].
20Beware of the same typographical error present in [341]. The qualitative results are,"
"however, unchanged."
"The Einstein-Straus, Lemâıtre-Tolman-Bondi, and Vaidya solutions of
the Einstein equations have been analyzed in detail for decades and we refer
the reader to standard books for their discussion [44, 45, 46]."
7.3. Solutions generated by conformal transformations
"Certain spherically symmetric and time-dependent solutions of the Ein-
stein equations representing central objects embedded in FLRW universes
are generated by conformally transforming Schwarzschild, with the scale
factor of the FLRW “background” universe as the conformal factor. These
solutions include the non-rotating Thakurta [344] solution, the Sultana-Dyer
[356], and the McClure-Dyer solutions [339, 340, 357]. The matter sources
are usually complicated and it is common to have spacetime regions with
negative energy densities, making these regions unphysical. However, some
of these geometries may turn out to be acceptable in other theories of gra-
vity, and they could perhaps be acceptable solutions in GR with different
matter sources (an issue that has not yet been investigated)."
7.3.1. Non-rotating Thakurta spacetime
"The non-rotating Thakurta solution [344] is the zero angular momentum

[358, 359]). Conformal diagrams for the non-rotating Thakurta solution can
be found in Ref. [319] for various choices of the scale factor a(t)."

"horizon is not completely negligible in comparison with the Hubble radius
(the latter can be very small in the early universe). The time-dependent
black hole apparent horizon is not a null event horizon and the Misner-
Sharp-Hernandez mass of this black hole is time-dependent, contrary to
the Schwarzschild mass. These differences with respect to Schwarzschild
could be important for the evolution of primordial black holes, which can
in principle account for a substantial fraction (or, hypothetically, even all)
of dark matter, according to an old hypothesis that is seeing a new lease on
life due to the unexpectedly large black hole masses measured in black hole
mergers by the LIGO/VIRGO detectors [39, 40]."

Ferreira [122, 124, 121, 123] geometries. The former is a fluid solution with
radial mass flow and the latter is generated by a fluid with anisotropic pres-
sure and contains the McVittie metric as a special case. They are analyzed
in [125]. Other spherical solutions proposed in the literature include those of
Carr et al. [361], Chakrabarti and Banerjee [362], Firouzjaee and Mansouri
[363], Kastor and Traschen [364], and Sun [365]."
Part II
Spherical solutions of scalar-tensor
gravities
"Scalar-tensor gravity is the prototypical alternative to GR and contains the
popular class of f(R) gravities. The salient feature is that the gravita-
tional coupling constant is promoted to the role of a dynamical scalar field.
Scalar-tensor gravity, in particular f(R) gravity, is used as an alternative
to dark energy to explain the current acceleration of the universe. Theories
that achieve this goal contain a time-dependent effective cosmological “con-
stant” and it is interesting to understand how black holes in these theories
look like. If stationary and asymptotically flat, they are the same as GR
black holes (apart from mavericks), otherwise they are time-dependent and
characterized by apparent (instead of event) horizons, a subject of consider-
able interest already in GR. Another motivation to study analytic inhomo-
geneous solutions of scalar-tensor gravity is exploring the spatial variation of"
"fundamental constants, in this case the gravitational coupling. Furthermore,
there is hope that deviations from GR may be detectable at astrophysical
scales in processes involving strong gravity near black holes. Many theoret-
ical efforts are devoted to the possibility of detecting black hole hair, which
is forbidden in vacuum GR [159, 160, 129, 366, 367, 130, 162] but not in
the presence of matter or in other theories of gravity [368, 141, 369, 140].
Finally, bosonic string theory reduces to an ω = −1 Brans-Dicke theory in
its low-energy limit [370, 371], and Brans-Dicke spacetimes are often very
similar to exact solutions of dilaton gravity."

8.1. Black holes in scalar-tensor gravity: no-hair theorems
"All asymptotically flat, stationary, axially symmetric black holes of phys-
ical relevance in vacuum scalar-tensor gravity reduce to GR black holes. A
theorem [163] states that all vacuum, stationary, and asymptotically flat
black holes of Brans-Dicke gravity (i.e., with ω = const. and V (φ) ≡ 0)
must be Kerr black holes. The proof, performed in the Einstein frame, does
not go through the direct integration of the Brans-Dicke field equations,
but uses an integral technique. It can be repeated by allowing the coupling
ω to be a function of φ. A previous result of Hawking [162] states that a
stationary, asymptotically flat black hole in vacuum GR is necessarily ax-
isymmetric and must have spherical topology, if the weak or the null energy
conditions hold. The theorem by Hawking [163] extends this earlier result
to Brans-Dicke theory proving that the Brans-Dicke scalar field is static.
The advantage of using the Einstein frame is that the rescaled Brans-Dicke"

"The integrals over the Cauchy hypersurfaces S and S ′ cancel out because
they have the same absolute value due to time symmetry but opposite signs
because of the opposite directions that the outgoing unit normal has on these

Finally, the integral over the portion of the horizon H vanishes because the
projection of ∇̃aφ̃ along the null vector tangent to the horizon, which is
a linear combination of ta and ψa, vanishes due to the symmetries [163].
This argument fails if the Einstein frame scalar φ̃ or its gradient ∇̃cφ̃ are
not defined at the horizon. This is the case of maverick solutions violating
the Hawking theorem, in which φ̃ ∝ lnφ diverges on the horizon because
φ vanishes or diverges there; then the conformal transformation becomes"

"be used on this hypersurface. However, these situations are unphysical.
Hawking’s theorem [163] has been generalized, with the limitation of"
"spherical symmetry, to various scalar-tensor theories with varying ω [137,
134, 149, 375] and with potential V (φ), provided that V has a minimum
at the constant value φ0 at which the Brans-Dicke scalar stabilizes outside
the horizon, so that the dynamics of φ stops there [376]. A generalization
to asymptotically de Sitter spaces was given by Bhattacharya et al. [377].
Assuming again spherical symmetry, Hawking’s theorem can be proved also
in the Jordan frame [378]. Indeed, numerical studies of black hole collapse in
Brans-Dicke [379, 380] and scalar-tensor gravity [381, 382] find the Schwarz-
schild black hole as the final state."
"No-hair theorems for more general Horndeski and Galileon theories, and
ways to evade them, are the subject of a large literature ([383, 384, 141, 140]
and references therein) (see Sec. 13)."
"Weak forms of the Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem, analogous to those of [97,
98, 99, 100] in GR, state that the geometry is static if the scalar field φ (or its
effective stress-energy tensor) is static [385, 386, 378]. An error in Ref. [385]
is corrected in [386] and the extension of these results to cylindrical and
planar symmetries is studied by Bronnikov and Kovalchuk [100]."
25It is here that the assumption of asymptotic flatness becomes crucial.
"9. The general non-black hole, spherical, static, asymptotically
flat solution"
"Under the assumptions that: 1) the vacuum Brans-Dicke field equations
(with ω 6= −3/2) hold in the Jordan frame; 2) the geometry is spheri-
cally symmetric, static, and asymptotically flat; 3) the massless Brans-Dicke
scalar φ depends only on the radial coordinate r, does not have poles or ze-
ros (except possibly for a central singularity), and φ(r) becomes constant
as r → +∞, the general solution that is not a Schwarzschild black hole is
known [200, 387] and its nature depends on a scalar charge parameter. The
only possibilities for the nature of these spacetimes (apart from the Schwarz-
schild black hole) are wormhole throats and central naked singularities. This
is the closest known result to the Birkhoff theorem of GR in scalar-tensor
gravity."
"The history of this general solution is a bit confused. A theorem of
Agnese and La Camera [388] stated that the possible solutions describe
only wormholes or naked singularities, but it is wrong as this would exclude
the Schwarzschild black hole and contradict Hawking’s no-hair theorem and
its generalizations. The error of Agnese and La Camera [388] consists of

but it describes only wormhole throats or naked singularities instead [391]."
The general solution was instead obtained by Bronnikov [200] (see also26
"[387]). The main idea consists of going to the Einstein frame, in which the
Brans-Dicke scalar field becomes a standard, minimally coupled, massless,
matter scalar field and the general solution is well-known to be the FJN-
WBW metric (42), (43) of GR. The general Jordan frame solution is then
obtained by inverting the conformal transformation from the Jordan to the
Einstein frame."

parameters [404]."
"A special subcase of the Brans-Dicke solution conformal to Fonarev,
which is static but has time-dependent scalar field, was used to generate
new dynamical solutions using the symmetry (163)-(165) of the vacuum
field equations [409]."

"The nonminimal coupling of the scalar field to the Ricci scalar was orig-
inally introduced by Chernikov and Tagirov [410] in the context of classical
radiation problems. It became widely known when Callan et al. [411] used
it to renormalize a scalar with quartic self-interaction in curved space. A
nonzero ξ is generated by first loop corrections even if absent at the clas-
sical level [412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417]. At the classical level, conformal
coupling is necessary to avoid causal pathologies in the propagation of φ,
i.e., to avoid any possibility that a massive scalar field propagates strictly
along the light cone [418]. More precisely, waves propagating in a curved
spacetime suffer backscattering from the background curvature and sharp
propagation is the exception rather than the norm [419]. For scalar waves φ,

"It has been argued that nonminimal coupling is necessarily present at
high curvatures [415, 417], that the approach to a classical universe in quan-

solve potential problems of primordial nucleosynthesis [424]. Nonminimal
coupling has been used extensively in cosmology [e.g., 425, 426, 427, 428,

most well studied, also in terms of exact solutions of the field equations."
11.1.1. BBMB solution
"The Bocharova-Bronnikov-Melnikov-Bekenstein (BBMB) solution for gra-
vity, the conformally coupled scalar, and the Maxwell field was found early
on by Bocharova et al. [441] and rediscovered by Bekenstein [442].30 The

"where m and Q are the mass and electric charge and Fab is the Maxwell
tensor. The geometry is that of an extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole,
but the scalar field φ is singular on the horizon r = m. This property is
unphysical, as originally remarked by Bekenstein himself [442] and contrary
to what later argued in [444], but reconsidered in [445, 446, 136].31 It has
also been argued that, in advanced Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates ex-
tending beyond the horizon, the BBMB geometry fails to satisfy the field
equations at the horizon [136, 449]. The usual black hole thermodynam-
ics becomes impossible [450]. Moreover, the BBMB solution is unstable to
linear perturbations [451, 452]."
"Following the derivations of Bocharova et al. [441] and Bekenstein [442],
Xanthopoulos and Zannias [445], and later Klimćık [448], proved explicitly
that the BBMB construct is the unique solution of the Einstein-conformal
scalar field equations which is static, spherical, asymptotically flat, and does
not have constant φ. A new proof of the uniqueness of the BBMB solution"
"30It was rediscovered again by Frøyland [443] by integrating directly the Jordan frame
field equations instead of using the conformal mapping trick (a similar, but rather confused,
attempt was made in Ref. [173])."
"31Curiously, in higher dimension the (unique) analogue of the BBMB solution describes
a naked singularity [447, 446, 448, 219]."
"outside the photon surface (the surface composed of the unstable circular
photon orbits) was given in Tomikawa et al. [453, 454]. This proof shows
also that no static multiple disconnected photon surfaces exist, and it does
not assume the existence and connectedness of the photon sphere."
"Rotating extensions of the BBMB black hole are derived by Astorino
[455] (a previous attempt to build a slowly rotating BBMB solution in [456]
failed near the horizon because it was subject to the excessively restrictive as-
sumption of separability for the gtϕ metric coefficient). The BBMB solution
has also been generalized by including a cosmological constant plus a quar-
tic potential V (φ) = λφ4, a Maxwell field, and different horizon topologies
[457, 458, 459]. Adding a cosmological constant moves the horizon outward
and the scalar field singularity remains hidden within it [457], making ther-
modynamics meaningful again [460]. An accelerating BBMB black hole has
also been found by Charmousis et al. [461]. The Plebański-Demiański fam-
ily of solutions of the Einstein equations (the most general Petrov type D
solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations [462, 463], which describes an ac-
celerating and rotating black hole), generalized to include a scalar field [464],
contains the BBMB geometry and its accelerated version of Charmousis et
al. [461] as special cases. Since the geometry is that of an extremal Reissner-
Nordström black hole, the Penrose-Carter diagram is well known (see, e.g.,
Ref. [465]."
"The field equations for trace-free matter have been studied recently by
Carranza et al. [466]. The solution of the coupled equations for gravity,
a conformally coupled scalar field, and the source-free Maxwell field or a
radiation fluid is again the BBMB geometry (233) of the extreme Reissner-
Nordström black hole already discussed."
"The BBMB geometry is also a solution of a conformally invariant gra-
vity theory, in which different conformal frames are pure gauge choices and
the singularity of the conformal scalar field at the horizon is automatically
resolved by changing gauge [467]."
11.1.2. Abreu et al. generalization to scalar field potential
"Bekenstein’s solution-generating technique for a free conformally coupled
scalar field [442] was used by Abreu et al. [207] for a scalar subject to a non-
zero potential V (φ). Although their interest was in FLRW cosmology, the
technique can be used for inhomogenous spherical spacetimes. Starting from
a solution of the minimally coupled (ξ = 0) Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations(
g̃ab, φ̃, U(φ̃)"

11.2. Other time-dependent solutions
"Other time-dependent solutions of scalar-tensor gravity that we cannot
analyze here for lack of space include those of Shaw and Barrow [468, 469],
and Banijamali et al. [208]. A common generating technique for time de-
pendent Einstein-scalar solutions takes known seed solutions with minimally
coupled massless scalar fields and, using the conformal map to the Jordan
frame, produces solutions with a nonminimally coupled field and with a
perfect fluid interpretation (e.g., [470, 205, 208, 409, 471])."
12. f(R) gravity
"Quantum corrections to the Lagrangian density of GR introduce quadratic
terms in the curvature. The simplest such scenario is Starobinsky’s model
of inflation in f(R) = R + αR2 gravity [6]. This was the first inflationary
scenario proposed and is currently the one favoured by cosmological obser-
vations. Since 2003, there has been a resurgence of interest in f(R) gravity
as a way to explain the present acceleration of the universe without invoking
an ad hoc dark energy [24, 25] (see [26, 27, 28] for reviews). The idea is to
modify gravity at large scales and to model the universe in the context of
f(R) theories which incorporate an effective time-dependent cosmological
“constant”. This approach has the advantage of bypassing the extreme fine-
tuning associated with the standard cosmological constant Λ of the ΛCDM
model (but does not solve the cosmological constant problem, of course)."
"Metric f(R) gravity is nothing but an ω = 0 Brans-Dicke theory with a
potential in disguise. The action is [26, 27, 28]"
"16π
f(R) + S(m) , (237)"

"one can show [26, 27, 28] that the action (237) is equivalent to"
"16π
[φR− V (φ)] + S(m) , (240)"
"which is a Brans-Dicke action with Brans-Dicke parameter ω = 0 and the
potential (239)."
"Since the main motivation for f(R) gravity comes from cosmology, the
most well-studied analytic solutions of these theories should describe central
objects embedded in FLRW universes. Very often the locally static KSdS
geometry is a solution, but it is not the only one."
12.1. Black holes and no-hair theorems in f(R) gravity
"If a metric f(R) theory of gravity admits an electrovacuum solution
with R = 0 (i.e., if f(0) = 0), the no-hair theorems of scalar-tensor gra-
vity apply in vacuo. Strictly speaking, such a theory misses the motivation
of explaining the present acceleration of the universe without dark energy,
which motivated the resurgence of f(R) theories. In these theories and also
in theories with f(0) 6= 0, to the extent that the cosmological asymptotics
can be neglected, the usual scalar-tensor no-hair theorems apply and then
the only physical black holes which are stationary and stable are the Kerr
ones of GR. The argument relies on the equivalence between metric f(R)
gravity and an ω = 0 Brans-Dicke theory with a complicated potential. Fur-
thermore,32 it is performed in the Einstein conformal frame. An alternative
proof was obtained by Cañate [473] by analyzing directly the fourth order
electrovacuum field equations of f(R) gravity (with f a function continu-
ous with its first and second derivatives and satisfying f(0) = 0) without
resorting to the equivalence with Brans-Dicke theory. The proof mirrors the
standard one in scalar-tensor gravity using integrals, and does not apply to"
32With the exception of Ref. [472].
"the special theory f(R) = R2.33 This purely quadratic theory is pathologi-
cal since it exhibits a restricted conformal invariance and does not admit a
Newtonian limit [475], however it is a good approximation to the Starobin-
sky [6] inflationary scenario based on f(R) = R+αR2 in the early universe.
The special case f(R) = R2 was covered separately by Sultana and Kazanas
[476] (their proof uses the equivalence with ω = 0 Brans-Dicke theory and
generalizes the Jordan frame proof34 of Faraoni [472] for vanishing poten-
tial to the case of a quadratic potential, which is well-known to disappear
from the field equation for the Brans-Dicke scalar). More important, the
proof of Cañate [473] is extended to asymptotically de Sitter electrovacuum
stationary black holes in theories which admit constant curvature solutions
R = const. > 0."
"Separate no-hair theorems restricted to specific f(R) theories were given
earlier, including the Starobinsky model f(R) = R+αR2 [478] and f(R) =
Rn [479, 480, 481, 482, 483]."
12.2. Clifton-Barrow static solution of f(R) = R1+δ gravity

been shown to describe a black hole by Cognola et al. [486]."
"33Care must be taken, where the map between conformal frames breaks down (in R2"

12.3. Clifton’s inhomogeneous cosmology in R1+δ gravity
"A spherically symmetric and dynamical solution of vacuum f(R) = R1+δ
gravity is due to Clifton [481]. Solar System tests of gravity constrain the
parameter δ to the range δ = (−1.1 ± 1.2) · 10−5 [484, 480, 487]. Further-
more, it must be f ′′(R) ≥ 0 for stability [488], which implies δ ≥ 0 and we
take the mass parameter C2 > 0."

the geometry (244) reduces to the Schwarzschild one. The Clifton space-
time (244)-(248) is conformal to the Fonarev solution of GR which is con-
formally static [220], therefore it is also conformally static (they are both
conformal to the FJNWBW geometry). The presence of a central spacetime
singularity and of dynamical apparent horizons have been investigated in
[489]. At least for some values of the parameters C2 and δ, the phenomenol-
ogy of apparent horizons involves a cosmological horizon accompanied by
the creation of a pair of apparent horizons, which then merge and disappear
[489]. This apparent horizon phenomenology is qualitatively the same as
that of the Husain-Martine-Nuñez solution of the Einstein equations [210]."

12.5. Other solutions
"In addition to the previous spacetimes, various other analytic and spher-
ically symmetric solutions of various f(R) theories of gravity have been pro-
posed over the years. Sometimes the form of the function f(R) is not fixed
and is found together with the specific spherical solution, which means that
physical motivation is lacking—indeed many forms of f(R) are already ruled
out by the existing experimental constraints and other forms are overly com-
plicated. As a general rule, it is easier to find static solutions with constant
Ricci curvature, an avenue which has been explored (see [490, 491] for a
summary of approximate solutions with constant R) but the resulting cat-
alogue of physically motivated solutions is still surprisingly scarce. Due to"
"space limits, we can only list references without analyzing these solutions in
detail, including [492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503,
504, 505, 506, 507, 508]."
"Sometimes exact solutions can be obtained by matching interior and
exterior spacetime regions through appropriate matching conditions: these
matching conditions have been studied specifically for f(R) gravity by Deru-
elle et al. [509], Senovilla [510], Clifton [511], Reina et al. [512], and
Chakrabarti et al. [513]."
13. Horndeski gravity
"The problematic ultraviolet limit of GR and the need to include ad hoc
exotic forms of matter to account for the late-time acceleration of the uni-
verse suggest another generalization of Einstein gravity. A minimal modifi-
cation of GR is obtained by relaxing some of the assumptions of Lovelock’s
theorem [514, 515]. This can be achieved by adding new degrees of freedom
to the theory, altering the number of spacetime dimensions, including higher
order derivatives of the metric in the action, or adding non-local terms to
the theory. Nonetheless, most of these modifications of GR lead to effective
low-energy models that merely involve a scalar degree of freedom added to
the metric. This general result embodies the power of scalar-tensor theo-
ries, combining their (apparent) simplicity and minimality with the ability
to capture the main features of more complex scenarios as effective models."
"When formulating a classical field theory, it is necessary to avoid phe-
nomena that would make it ill-posed from the start. An example of such is-
sues is ghost-like instability. To this regard, a general theorem by Ostrograd-
sky [516] (see also [517]) states that, in classical mechanics, a non-degenerate
Lagrangian containing time derivatives higher than first order leads to a lin-
early unstable Hamiltonian. Likewise, higher order non-degenerate classical
field theories are affected by ghost-like (or Ostrogradsky) instabilities. Thus,
limiting ourselves to local theories with equations of motion containing field
derivatives not higher than second order constitutes a sufficient condition to
avoid Ostrogradsky instabilities."
"Horndeski gravity [56] is the most general scalar-tensor theory with sec-
ond order equations of motion. In its modern formulation, this theory is"
expressed in terms of the generalized Galileon Lagrangian that reads

(where bµ and c are constants) and leads to a second order field equation.
Deffayet et al. [520] extended the Galileon model to curved space (“covariant
Galileon”). For the covariant Galileon, the symmetry φ(x) → φ(x)+bµxµ+c
must be dropped in favor of general covariance. Kobayashi et al. [521]
showed that the generalized Galileon Lagrangian (255) of Deffayet et al.
[522], representing a natural extension of the covariant Galileon and pre-
serving the second order nature of the field equations, is equivalent to Horn-
deski’s old and forgotten theory."
"One of the main motivations for Horndeski’s theory is providing an alter-
native to dark energy for modelling the cosmic evolution. To this end, one
needs to make sure that such modifications of GR, while properly account-
ing for the cosmic expansion, do not affect the predictions for Solar System
experiments. In other words, Solar System physics should be screened from
the effects of the new scalar degree of freedom φ. In scalar-tensor theories,
this goal can be achieved by either making φ effectively massive at short
scales through the chameleon mechanism [523, 524], or else the theory itself
exploits its nonlinearities to screen physics below a certain scale from the ef-
fects of φ through the Vainshtein mechanism [525] (see also the review [526]
and the references therein). The latter, in particular, plays a fundamental
role for cosmological models in Horndeski gravity."
"Another important theoretical reason for studying more general scalar-
tensor theories relies on potential violations of the no-hair theorems of GR.
Indeed, while these theorems can be easily extended to simpler scalar-tensor
theories as discussed earlier, since most of these models turn out to be singu-
lar at the black hole horizon unless the scalar field is in a trivial configuration,
the situation is significantly more complicated in Horndeski gravity and its
generalizations. We refer the interested reader to the excellent review by
Kobayashi [527] for a discussion of the literature on this subject."
"It is also important to mention that the combined detection of grav-
itational waves (GW170817) and of a γ-ray burst (GRB170817A) from a
binary neutron star merger [528, 529] has put severe constraints on viable
scalar-tensor models (e.g., [530]) by setting the bounds"
−3 × 10−15 < cGW − 1 < 7 × 10−16 (260)
"on the speed of gravitational waves cGW ([527] and references therein).
From a field-theoretic perspective, Horndeski gravity is an effective field"
"theory (EFT) defined in such a way that certain higher derivative operators
become as relevant as lower order ones within the regime of validity of the"
"low-energy model. For such an EFT to be physically consistent one has to
require, within the regime of applicability of the model, that: a) the leading
higher derivative terms do not introduce ghost instabilities; b) quantum
corrections must be suppressed in order not to spoil the computation of
physical observables. While in the case of Horndeski gravity a) is fulfilled
by construction, the point b) requires the theory to exhibit some “non-
renormalization” properties. For a detailed discussion of the EFT approach
to higher-derivative scalar-tensor theories we refer the interested reader to
[531, 532, 533, 534, 535, 536] and the references therein."
"We begin by reviewing some generalities of the no-hair theorems in Horn-
deski gravity, focusing on the case of shift-symmetric theories and on possible
ways to evade them. We then discuss two important classes of non-trivial
hairy solutions exploiting the loopholes in the no-hair argument of Hui and
Nicolis [537]. This discussion is not meant to be an in-depth analysis of
the literature on exact solutions of Horndeski gravity (a topic that would
deserve to be surveyed on its own), but it is rather a summary of the results
capturing the main features of hairy black hole solutions within this theory.
We refer the interested reader to [140, 384, 527, 538] for a discussion of the
relevant literature."
13.1. Hair or no-hair?
"Shift-symmetric Horndeski theories are a subclass of Horndeski gravity
equipped with a residual Galileon symmetry from the flat space case. Specif-
ically, they preserve the invariance under the transformation φ→ φ+c (with
c a constant) even for curved manifolds. This class is defined by the La-
grangian (255) with the condition that G2, . . . , G5 be arbitrary functions of
X and do not depend explicitly on φ. Clearly, this shift symmetry is associ-
ated with a covariantly conserved current Ja (see, e.g., [384] for its explicit
form)."
"The most stringent theorem for shift-symmetric Horndeski theories [384]
states that assuming: (i) spherically symmetric spacetime with a static
scalar field; (ii) asymptotic flatness, φ′ ≡ ∂rφ→ 0 as r → ∞, and J2 ≡ JaJa
finite at the horizon; (iii) there is a canonical kinetic term X in the action
and the Gi are such that their X-derivatives contain only positive or zero
powers of X, then the scalar field is constant and the spacetime is isometric
to the Schwarzschild spacetime."
Taking a deeper look at (i–iii) one has that:
• (i) implies that the spacetime metric and the scalar field take the form
"ds2 = −A(r) dt2 + B(r)−1 dr2 +R2(r) dΩ2(2) ,
(261)"
"φ = φ(r) , (262)"
"with R(r) denoting the areal radius. Hence, the norm of the current
reduces to J2 = (Jr)2/B(r)."
"• Since the location r = rH of the horizon is determined by the largest
root of B(r) = 0, the requirement (ii) concerning the regularity of J2
at the horizon suggests that Jr should vanish at rH. Furthermore, the
conservation of Ja reduces to"
"(
R2 Jr"
")′
= 0 (with a prime denoting dif-"
"ferentiation with respect to r), leading to R2 Jr = constant. However,
since R2 Jr|r=rH = 0, then Jr(r) = 0, ∀r."
"• Specializing the general result for the conserved current Ja in [384] to
the symmetries of the problem, one has that Jr takes the general form"
"Jr = B φ′ F (φ′, g, g′, g′′) (263)"
"with F a function of the first radial derivative of the field and of the
metric and its first and second radial derivatives."
"• (iii) and the requirement of asymptotic flatness then imply that φ′(r) =
0, ∀r, leading to a solution isometric to the Schwarzschild spacetime."
"The first no-hair argument, by Hui and Nicolis [537], for black holes in
Horndeski gravity relied heavily on the idea that the function F in (263)
would approach a non-zero constant at infinity, provided that one requires
the theory to have a standard kinetic term in the weak field regime. Thus,
according to Hui and Nicolis [537], asymptotic flatness implies that A,B → 1
and φ′ → 0 at infinity. If one then moves continuously towards the hori-
zon, φ′ can become non-zero while B and F remain non-zero, contradicting
the condition Jr = 0 everywhere. This should then imply that φ′(r) = 0
everywhere, exploiting a much weaker condition than (iii). However, this
argument has two major loopholes allowing for hairy black hole solutions
[383, 539] as we discuss in detail in the following sections. Furthermore, one
can also find hairy solutions by relaxing some of the conditions in (i–iii)."
"To conclude this brief section on no-go results for black holes in shift-
symmetric Horndeski theories, we mention that black hole solutions of non-
shift-symmetric models have been obtained analytically as effective models"
"emerging from the Kaluza-Klein reductions of specific truncations of Love-
lock gravity [540]. Hence, one can arguably consider these solutions as pe-
culiar to Horndeski gravity and, for this reason, they will not be discussed
here."

"Ja =

"where the explicit form of G̃a is found by taking the general form of Ja for
a shift-symmetric Horndeski Lagrangian (reported in [384]) and setting the
functions G2, . . . , G5 as in (266)."
"With the ansatz (261) parametrized in terms of the areal radius R, one
finds that (270) reduces to [538]"

"where now the prime denotes differentiation with respect to R. Assuming
asymptotic flatness, JR vanishes at infinity, though now the second term
allows for a non-trivial φ′ when JR = 0."
"Because of the complexity of the field equations (267) and (268) even
assuming (261) and asymptotic flatness, no closed form expression is known
for the solution. The problem can be treated numerically and perturbatively.
A perturbative solution of stringy gravity found by Campbell, Kaloper, and
Olive [542] contains, as a special case, the more recent proposal of Sotiriou
and Zhou [541]. A close dilatonic gravity theory with exponential potential
has been solved numerically by Kanti, Mavromatos, Rizos, Tamvakis, and
Winstanley [543]. The Campbell-Kaloper-Olive-Sotiriou-Zhou solution har-
bours a curvature singularity at a finite areal radius and can be cloaked by
a horizon if the black hole is sufficiently massive [541]."
13.3. Babichev-Charmousis class of solutions
"Consider the subset of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories characterized
by the Lagrangian [539]"
"L = R− η∇cφ∇cφ+ β Gab∇aφ∇bφ− 2 Λ , (272)"
"where η, β,Λ are constants, which is obtained from (255) by setting G3 =
G5 = 0, G2 = −2Λ + 2ηX, and G4 = 1 + βX. This Lagrangian contains
an explicit non-minimal coupling between the Einstein tensor and the scalar
field in Gab∇aφ∇bφ, which corresponds to a specific realization of the “John

corresponding field equations are [384, 539]"

a constant scalar field or, more interestingly, by configurations such that
ηgRR − βGRR = 0 allowing for a non-vanishing gradient ∇cφ."
"Considering the ansatz (261), again parametrized in terms of the areal

of φ can be healed with the addition of a bare cosmological constant

14. Beyond Horndeski: DHOST gravity
"In the spirit of keeping only one scalar field φ in the theory in addi-
tion to the GR graviton (i.e., three degrees of freedom), attempts to gener-
alize scalar-tensor gravity beyond Horndeski theory were made by allow-
ing for derivatives of higher order than second. As expected, these at-
tempts usually run into the Ostrogradsky instability. However, it was discov-
ered that certain higher derivative theories are, rather surprisingly, healthy
in this respect [57, 58]. A wider class of theories with this feature was
then discovered, in which the Ostrogradsky ghost is exorcised by imposing
a phase space constraint which makes the Lagrangian density degenerate"
"[548, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554]. These Degenerate Higher Order Scalar-
Tensor (DHOST) theories have been the subject of much attention, espe-
cially in view of their confrontation with observations. The multi-messenger
event GW170817–GRB170817 [555] and, in addition, the study of stability
against perturbations36 [556, 557, 558, 559, 560] impose severe constraints
on DHOST theories (see Refs. [561, 527] for reviews)."

can also be applied to the more general scenario discussed here in order to
investigate the quantum stability of the proposed class of theories. Again,
we refer the reader interested in the details on this topic mostly to [535] and
references therein."
"Naturally, spherically symmetric solutions of DHOST theories describ-
ing compact objects (and, more recently, also cylindrical solutions describing
rotating objects [562, 563, 564, 565, 566]) have been studied. Compact star
configurations were discussed in Refs. [567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573].
Subject to certain hypotheses, no-hair theorems for black holes were stated"
"in [574], but soon conditions were found that allow one to circumvent them
and to construct hairy black holes. The most notable way to do this
consists of a scalar (hair) field that violates the staticity of the geometry
through a linear dependence on time, φ(t, r) = qt+ ψ(r), with q a constant
[384, 575, 576, 577] (a trick known from Horndeski [578, 546, 539] and be-
yond Horndeski [579, 580] gravity). Most of these DHOST geometries are
solutions of the Einstein equations with vanishing stress-energy tensor of the
scalar field, i.e., stealth solutions. The kinetic term X̄ is usually constant
[581, 582, 583, 584]. Some of these analytic solutions arise in the earlier con-
text of ghost condensation and are known to be immune from the strong cou-
pling problem [585, 586, 587, 588] that usually affects constant X̄ solutions.
Stealth solutions include the Schwarzschild and the Schwarzschild-(Anti-)de
Sitter spaces [582, 539, 580, 581, 559, 583, 557] (neutron star models were
also developed [569]). These stealth black hole solutions with constant ki-
netic term X̄ are plagued by the problem of the strong coupling of scalar
perturbations [560]."
"A step beyond stealth solutions was taken in Ref. [589] by using disformal
transformations as a solution-generating technique to map seed solutions
into new DHOST solutions. The new solutions thus obtained have non-
constant kinetic term X̄. The metric is transformed as"

"A third solution for a different quadratic DHOST model is provided in [590].
In all these models, the equation locating the event horizons ∇cr∇cr ="
"grr = 0 (where r is the areal radius) has a single root, identifying clearly a
black hole horizon (as is clear from the dimensions, the constant m is not
the black hole mass, but a power of it). However, these black holes are not
asymptotically flat [590], which can be seen as a consequence of the fact that
the black hole exterior is not vacuum but hosts the scalar hair. Stability
against odd parity perturbations is studied in [590], with the result that the
black hole (316) is stable, while the geometry (322) is not."
"The search for static and spherical DHOST solutions continues (e.g.,
[591, 592, 593, 594, 595, 596]). Non-constant X̄ solutions are useful when
attempting to confront DHOST theories with observations, which has al-
ready led to significant restrictions on these theories. The reader should be
warned that this area of research is very recent and developing fast."
15. Summary and conclusions
"It is apparent from our analysis that, even in the simplest theory of rel-
ativistic gravity, GR, and under an assumption as simplifying as spherical
symmetry (which is indeed, an oversimplification in most situations of astro-
physical interest), only a restricted number of analytic solutions have been
discovered, which leads to the usefulness of compiling a small catalogue.
This richness is due to the variety of matter sources and of possible bound-
ary conditions (asymptotically flat, FLRW, de Sitter, etc.). What is more,
our current knowledge of exact solutions is incomplete and there are very
few cases in which a geometry can be called “generic” in some sense, like
the Schwarzschild solution in vacuum and asymptotically flat GR. Here we
have refrained from entering into great detail about the concept of “generic”,
which will leave the more mathematically oriented reader dissatisfied, and
we have focussed on the physical aspects of these solutions. Likewise, we"
"have privileged the description of the geometries examined in the most well-
known and used coordinate systems and we have not entered the discussion
of special algebraic properties and classifications of the solutions examined,
as done instead in the well known book by Stephani et al. [44] discussing
solutions of the Einstein equations of many different natures. This kind of
book-length analysis is beyond the scopes of the present work and, although
necessary for an invariant characterization of the geometries, ultimately does
not serve well the purposes of the physicist or the cosmologist. Some of the
spacetimes described here have some kind of “generic” character as described
in the text, whereas those that do not have been reported as interesting ex-
amples that still show certain properties of the non-linear theories that they
solve. A curious feature of certain geometries is that they solve the field
equations of different theories, or of the same theory with different mat-
ter sources. This largely unexplored (beyond the KSdS and the McVittie
spaces) aspect deserves more attention in future analyses."
"Most likely, some of the analytic solutions presented here do not describe
objects found in nature. Nevertheless, they provide useful insight into the
nature of the field equations that they satisfy, for which it is difficult to build
intuition due to their non-linearity. Other times, these geometries are useful
as toy models for theoreticians (for example, the McVittie and non-rotating
Thakurta solutions as toy models for primordial black holes [41, 42], the
subject of renewed attention in relation with the dark matter problem and
black hole mergers detected by LIGO)."
"Given the enormous motivation for the study of alternative theories of
gravity coming from cosmology [23], quantum corrections to gravity [3, 4,
5], the low-energy limit of string theories [370, 371], and the experimental
efforts to test gravity at various astrophysical scales, we have included scalar-
tensor [29, 53, 54, 55], as well as Horndeski gravity and DHOST theories
beyond Horndeski in our discussion. The reasons for choosing those theories
include the fact that scalar-tensor gravity is the prototypical and longest
known alternative to GR. Furthermore, it includes f(R) gravity as a subclass
which is extremely popular to explain the current acceleration of the universe
without invoking dark energy [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] and is also intimately
connected with early universe inflation [6]. Whether f(R) gravity is a toy
model or, as many authors believe, a realistic model, or an effective field
theory [597, 598, 599], is an open question."
"Horndeski theory is arguably the most well studied recent extension of
“simple” scalar-tensor gravity which is still well motivated from the physical
point of view and useful for cosmology, while much work is presently being
done on the more recent DHOST theories, for which it is fair to say that"
"we do not yet have a complete picture. The recent opening of gravitational
wave astronomy [30, 31, 32] and the imaging of the near-horizon region of
black holes [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], together with the birth of multi-messenger
astrophysics [600] offer new tools to explore the nature of gravity, and a clear
picture of what one should expect beyond Einstein theory could help or even
guide these observational efforts."
"The presence of a scalar degree of freedom, either as a matter field or
as part of the gravitational field, has been a recurring element in this work.
Unfortunately, even for this simplest degree of freedom of field theory, our
knowledge is still limited. Matter scalar fields in GR can collapse to black
holes, which are then indistinguishable from any other black hole with the
same mass and angular momentum, according to the no-hair theorems. The
exact spherical, static, and asymptotically flat solution of the Einstein equa-
tions which does not contain a black hole, the FJNWBW solution, exhibits a
naked singularity. Generally speaking, asymptotically flat analytic solutions
of GR with non-trivial scalar field configurations tend to generate geome-
tries that contain only naked singularities or wormhole (horizon) throats,
but not black hole horizons. This conclusion seems to apply to both static
and time-dependent geometries, when gravitational collapse does not oc-
cur. Non-asymptotically flat solutions can have a rich structure of apparent
horizons which can change in number and usually appear/disappear in pairs.
The same conclusions apply, in general, to scalar-tensor gravity, although
there is no specific theorem to this regard. A sore point is the lack of gen-
eral theorems for GR or scalar-tensor (including Horndeski and DHOST)
solutions which are spherical and asymptotically FLRW."
"Changing source type, many exact solutions sourced by perfect or im-
perfect fluids are known, especially in the form of perfect fluid stellar con-
figurations, but only relatively few are physical. Then, there are families
of solutions of GR and scalar-tensor gravity interpreted as central objects
embedded in FLRW universes, some of which are black holes (as defined by
their apparent horizons) at least part of the time. Other solutions contain
naked singularities for at least part of the history of the universe. Appar-
ent horizons that are also the throats of (non-traversable) wormholes are
ubiquitous."
"We have pointed out existing relations between many pairs of geometries
listed here. Usually, these relations are conformal dualities, due to the fre-
quent use of conformal transformations as solution-generating techniques.
Other times, researchers have sought to generalize previously known solu-
tions, which results in some of the spacetimes examined being special cases
of previous ones."
"In spite of the fact that, in the space available, it is impossible to make
justice to all the physical and mathematical aspects involved, or even to
compile a complete list of all related references, this review is meant to
provide a reference for the researcher and an introduction to the subject for
the less experienced reader. A review can never replace a thorough study
of the references relevant to a particular aspect or a specific geometry. The
usefulness of simpler situations is that they can be kept in mind and used
as paradigms, or for contrast, when studying more complicated ones. They
are particularly useful in the attempt to discover what a new theory of
gravity adds to the existing ones, and as examples or counterexamples. We
have learned much physics in the past decades of studying analytic solutions
of GR and scalar-tensor gravity but, remarkably, there are many areas in
which we still know very little. We hope that highlighting them will renew
research efforts that will bring a better understanding of important aspects
of gravity."
