"ABSTRACT
Understanding the relationship between the underlying escape fraction of Lyman continuum
(LyC) photons ( 𝑓esc) emitted by galaxies and measuring the distribution of observed 𝑓esc
values at high redshift is fundamental to the interpretation of the reionization process. In
this paper we perform a statistical exploration of the attenuation of LyC photons by neutral
hydrogen in the intergalactic medium using ensembles of simulated transmission functions.
We show that LyC detected galaxies are more likely to be found in sightlines with higher-
than-average transmission of LyC photons. This means that adopting a mean transmission
at a given redshift leads to an overestimate of the true 𝑓esc for LyC detected galaxies. We
note, however, that mean values are appropriate for 𝑓esc estimates of larger parent samples that
include LyC non-detected galaxies.We quantify this IGM transmission bias for LyC detections
in photometric and spectroscopic surveys in the literature and show that the bias is stronger for
both shallower observations and for fainter parent samples (i.e. Lyman𝛼 emitters versus Lyman
break galaxies). We also explore the effects of varying the underlying probability distribution
function (PDF) of 𝑓esc on recovered values, showing that the underlying 𝑓esc PDF may depend
on sample selection by comparing with observational surveys. This work represents a first step
in improved interpretation of LyC detections in the context of understanding 𝑓esc from high
redshift galaxies."

1 INTRODUCTION
"Understanding the details of cosmic reionization, the epoch at
𝑧 ' 6 − 10 during which the hydrogen content of the intergalac-
tic medium (IGM) transitioned from neutral to mostly ionized (e.g.
Fan et al. 2006; Planck Collaboration et al. 2016; Greig &Mesinger
2017; Mason et al. 2018), is a major goal of the international as-
tronomical community. The general consensus currently favours
a picture in which ionizing, or Lyman continuum (LyC), photons
originating from young, massive stars and/or X-ray binaries and
Wolf-Rayet stars in star-forming galaxies are the primary driver.
This picture is supported by extensive theoretical (e.g. Wise & Cen
2009; Yajima et al. 2011; Paardekooper et al. 2015) and observa-
tional (e.g. Inoue et al. 2006; Ouchi et al. 2009; Robertson et al.
2015) efforts. Active galactic nuclei (AGN), though pridigious pro-
ducers of LyC emission, are expected to play only a minor role due"

"to their low number density at 𝑧 > 6 (e.g. Hopkins et al. 2007; Parsa
et al. 2018; Kakiichi et al. 2018)."
"Detailed modelling of the reionization process critically re-
quires an accurate census of the fraction of LyC photons (with
respect to ultraviolet, UV, continuum photons) produced in galaxies
that manage to escape into the IGM, typically referred to as the LyC
escape fraction ( 𝑓esc). The first major challenge in using 𝑓esc to un-
derstand reionization is the fact that no LyC photons from galaxies
during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) will ever reach a telescope
due to absorption from intervening hydrogen. The second is the
inherent faintness of LyC emission from galaxies (as demonstrated
by pioneering works of Giallongo et al. 2002; Fernández-Soto et al.
2003; Inoue et al. 2005),which is driven largely by two key factors."
"The first factor driving the faintness of LyC emission is that 𝑓esc
is typically found to be very low (or zero) as inferred from the lack
of LyC detections in (e.g. Boutsia et al. 2011; Japelj et al. 2017; Bian
& Fan 2020). This may, in part, be due to the fact that observations
of galaxies, and thus, their LyC emission, at high redshift (𝑧 ≥ 2.9)"

"are limited to relatively high stellar mass (𝑀∗ ≥ 109𝑀�) galaxies
that are likely to contain significant quantities of neutral hydrogen
(consistent with their high star-formation rates, SFRs, e.g. Steidel
et al. 2001; Iwata et al. 2009; Nestor et al. 2011; Grazian et al.
2016) that absorbs ionizing radiation before it can enter the IGM
and drive reionization. Indeed, for the small sample of such known
LyC emitting galaxies at 𝑧 & 2.8, the observed LyC flux is relatively
faint (e.g. Shapley et al. 2006; Micheva et al. 2017; Vanzella et al.
2018). Even if 𝑓esc is larger in lower mass galaxies, such galaxies
are inherently faint and their LyC emission will likely be at least
as difficult to detect as their higher mass counterparts (apart from
the rare cases of strong gravitational lensing, Bian et al. 2017;
Rivera-Thorsen et al. 2019). The most straightforward way past
this problem is to perform larger and deeper surveys targeting LyC
emission across a range of redshifts. A variety such surveys are
currently in progress."
"The second issue resulting in faint LyC emission is that the
IGM itself contains large fractions of neutral hydrogen above 𝑧 ' 3
(e.g. Inoue et al. 2014). This means that after LyC escapes from a
galaxy it is largely absorbed in the IGM before reaching Earth. For
any individual LyC detection, there is currently no reliable method
for inferring the IGM transmission (𝑇IGM) of LyC photons for that
particular sightline. This is troubling as observationally 𝑇IGM and
𝑓esc are degenerate meaning that, in order to estimate 𝑓esc, a value
of 𝑇IGM must be assumed that may or may not be appropriate for a
given IGM sightline. There is, however, hope of away forward as the
differential column density distribution of HI absorption systems is
well constrained (e.g. Meiksin 2006; Becker et al. 2013; Rudie et al.
2013), providing a statistical description of the probability that LyC
photons escaping galaxies will be absorbed by hydrogen in the IGM
at a given redshift."
"Such a statistical approach to estimate 𝑇IGM in a theoretical
context has been explored using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for
around three decades (e.g. Møller & Jakobsen 1990; Bershady et al.
1999; Inoue et al. 2014). Similarly, the application of such MC sim-
ulations of𝑇IGM to detections (and non-detections) of LyC radiation
has a long history (e.g. Shapley et al. 2006; Siana et al. 2007; Steidel
et al. 2018, S18 hereafter) In general, the most probable value of
𝑇IGM at 𝑧 > 3 is zero, though individual sightlines with 𝑇IGM >
0.8 can exist (see Section 2.1. The typical probability distribution
of 𝑇IGM (around _𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡 ∼ 910 Å) at 𝑧 = 2.9-4.0 can be described
as bimodal with a sharp peak at 𝑇IGM = 0.0 and a broader, less
prominent peak at higher values. Both the location and prominence
of this secondary peak decrease with redshift until 𝑧 ∼5-6, at which
point the presence of high 𝑇IGM sightlines is negligible. The result
is that LyC is unlikely to be observed from galaxies during the EoR."
"Using knowledge of the probability distribution of 𝑇IGM at
a given redshift, astronomers can put forward an estimate of 𝑓esc
for LyC detected galaxies. One method is to apply the full suite
of 𝑇IGM models to a given observation (or set of observations),
however this typically results in largely unconstrained 𝑓esc values
including a large number with the unphysical case of 𝑓esc > 1.0
(Shapley et al. 2016; Vanzella et al. 2016). Another method is
to assume the mean value of 𝑇IGM, 〈𝑇IGM〉, among all simulated
sightlines thus providing a single 𝑓esc value (S18, Bassett et al.
2019; Fletcher et al. 2019; Meštrić et al. 2020, hereafter F19 and
M20). The problem with this second method is that a single statistic
belies to complexities of the underlying 𝑇IGM distribution. Indeed,
the mean of a bimodal distribution will be found to lie between
the two peaks, and will not fall among the most likely values. This
issue has been highlighted in the context of Ly𝛼 transmission by
Byrohl & Gronke (2020) who find that assuming a median or mean"
"transmission curve “is misleading and should be interpreted with
caution”."
"There exist, however, important observational priors that can
provide more realistic constraints on the most likely value of 𝑇IGM
for LyC detected galaxies. First and foremost, the fact that a galaxy
has been detected at LyC wavelengths means that 𝑇IGM for that
galaxy cannot be zero. This fact automatically reduces the under-
lying bimodal 𝑇IGM distribution for all sightlines to a unimodal
distribution for sightlines with LyC detections. In this case, stan-
dard statistics such as the mean and median of 𝑇IGM may be more
applicable. Secondly, while the probability distribution function
(PDF) of 𝑇IGM is routinely considered, the underlying PDF of 𝑓esc
itself, which so far has been left out, may also be important. As
we have stated, low or zero 𝑓esc values seem to be preferred, which
is not reflected in current 𝑓esc calculations. It is possible that the
broad behaviour of the 𝑓esc PDF may be inferred through consid-
eration of the detection rates in LyC surveys (this intriguing idea is
explored further in Section 4.3). It is likely that a full understanding
of the underlying 𝑓esc PDF of galaxies will require a theoretical
underpinning through the careful analysis of high-resolution, hy-
drodynamical simulations employing radiative transfer of ionizing
photons (e.g. Trebitsch et al. 2017; Rosdahl et al. 2018; Ma et al.
2020)."
"In this paper, we explore in detail the probability distributions
of both 𝑇IGM and 𝑓esc in the context of known LyC surveys at
high redshift. Our goal is to provide a statistically sound framework
withinwhich astronomers can calculatemeaningful estimates of 𝑓esc
for both individual LyC detections as well as stacked samples. In
particular, we show that both the assumption of themean𝑇IGM value
and (to a lesser extent) a lack of consideration of the underlying 𝑓esc
PDF result in an overestimate of 𝑓esc for LyC detected galaxies. Here
we quantify the IGM transmission bias, 𝑇bias, as 〈𝑇det〉 − 〈𝑇IGM〉
where 〈𝑇det〉 is the average IGM transmission for LyC detected
galaxies for a given observational detection limit. We note that,
although a transmission value is not inherently an additive quantity,
our definition leads to a roughly redshift independent correction
to 〈𝑇IGM〉 as opposed to an alternative definition such as 𝑇bias =
〈𝑇det〉/〈𝑇IGM〉 (see Section 3 for further discussion)."
"This paper is organised as follows: in Section 2 we describe
our method of generating simulated IGM sightlines and spectra of
mock LyC emitting galaxies, in Section 3 we describe the results
of our various models, in Section 4 we explore the implications of
our results in the context of past and on-going LyC surveys, and in
Section 5 we provide a brief summary of our findings."
2 SIMULATING LYC LEAKING GALAXIES
"In this Section we describe our method of producing mock obser-
vations of LyC flux from high redshift galaxies. There are three
primary ingredients in creating an individual high redshift galaxy
observation for our simulation: an IGM transmission function, 𝑓esc,
and the input SED model. Our method for producing an IGM trans-
mission function is described in Section 2.1. Although the underly-
ing PDF of 𝑓esc for galaxies is largely unknown, we test two models
described in Section 2.2. Finally, we take our input SEDmodel from
BPASSv2.1 (Eldridge et al. 2017, described further in Section 2.3),
matching the assumed LyC to non-ionizing UV flux ratio from pre-
vious studies. In particular we compare with results from the Keck
Lyman Continuum Survey (KLCS, S18), the LymAn Continuum
Escape Survey (LACES, F19), and the ground based photometric
work of M20 based on deep 𝑢-band photometry from the Canada"

2.1 IGM Transmission Functions
"𝑇IGM functions are produced following the method outlined in S18,
Appendix B 1. We perform a Poisson sampling of the number of HI
absorbers in redshift intervals,Δ𝑧, from 𝑧 = 0 to a specified redshift,"
"1 All code for producing IGM transmission curves is open source and
available at https://github.com/robbassett/TAOIST_M C."
"𝑧𝑒𝑚. Following Inoue et al. (2014)we select a value ofΔ𝑧 = 5×10−5,
noting however that deviations from this value would not affect our
results. The value of 𝑧𝑒𝑚 for a given analysis is determined by the
redshift of the galaxy, or sample of galaxies, being considered. In
this work we create suites of 10,000 IGM transmission functions at
10 discrete 𝑧𝑒𝑚 values in the range 2.9-3.9 with Δ𝑧𝑒𝑚 = 0.1 (we
also explore IGM transmission bias at 𝑧 = 2.4 and 𝑧 = 4.4 for HST
F275W and F435W observations, respectively, in Section 4.5)."
"To generate a single 𝑇IGM function at a given 𝑧𝑒𝑚 we must
first produce a random sampling of hydrogen absorption systems in
redshift bins of Δ𝑧 = 5 × 10−5 from 𝑧 = 0 to 𝑧𝑒𝑚. This is achieved
assuming a differential HI column density distribution, 𝑓 (𝑁HI, 𝑋),
following the prescriptions outlined for the “IGM+CGM” model in
S18 Appendix B. In each redshift interval we derive the expected
number of absorption systems in each bin of 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑁HI) (sampled
from 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑁𝐻𝐼 ) = 12.0 − 21.0 with Δ𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑁HI) = 0.1) as:"
𝑁abs =
"∫ 𝑁HI,max
𝑁HI,min"
"∫ 𝑧+Δ𝑧
𝑧"
"𝑁
−𝛽
HI 𝐴(1 + 𝑧)"
"𝛾
𝑑𝑁HI𝑑𝑧 (1)"
"Where 𝑁HI,min and 𝑁HI,max are the lower and upper bounds, 𝛽 is
the slope of 𝑓 (𝑁HI, 𝑋), 𝐴 is a constant chosen to match observed
𝑁abs, and 𝛾 describes the redshift evolution of 𝑁abs. Values for 𝛽,
𝐴, and 𝛾 are taken directly from Table B1 of S18. We assume the
presence of absorption systems is a Poissonian process, thus for
each sightline the number of absorption systems at a given 𝑧 and
𝑁HI is calculated using numpy.random.poissonwith _ set to 𝑁abs."
"For each individual absorber in a given observed sightline, we
then apply the transmission function for LyC photons at _rest ≤
911.8Å and a transmission for Lyman series forest for photons with
_rest ≥ 911.8 Å, noting that in this case we are considering the rest
wavelength at the redshift of the absorption system and not the LyC
emitting galaxy. For LyC photons we apply the functional form:"
HI (arest) = 𝑁HI𝜎HI (arest) (2)
"where arest is the photon frequency at the rest frame of a
given absorbtion system and 𝜎HI (arest) is the frequency depen-
dent interaction cross section of HI to ionising photons given by
𝜎𝐿 (arest/a911.8)−3. Here𝜎𝐿 is a constantwith a value of 6.3×10−18
cm2 (Osterbrock 1989). For Lyman series lines we use the following"

𝑐 is the speed of light. The parameter 𝑓𝑖 is the oscillator strength
of Lyman transition 𝑖, which we take from tables provided with the
VPFIT package (Carswell & Webb 2014). In our calculation we
include the first 32 Lyman series transitions. a𝐷 = a𝑖 (𝑏/𝑐) is the
Doppler broadening of the Lyman line at frequency a𝑖 where 𝑏,
the Doppler parameter, is randomly sampled from (Hui & Rutledge
1999):"

−𝑏4𝜎/𝑏4 (4)"
"with 𝑏𝜎 = 23 km s−1 (e.g. Janknecht et al. 2006). Finally, 𝜙𝑖 (a),
the absorption profile, is taken as the analytic approximation of
the Voigt profile given by Tepper-García (2006). Here, as with 𝑓𝑖 ,
we also sample Γ𝑖 , the damping constant for transition 𝑖, from the
VPFIT values. The total optical depth of an individual absorber is
then taken as 𝜏(a) = 𝜏𝐿𝑦𝐶HI (arest) +Σ𝜏𝑖 (arest), where a refers to the
observed frame frequency, a = arest/(1 + 𝑧). The total 𝜏(a) for a
given sightline is the sum of the ensemble of 𝜏(a) for all absorbers
in that sightline."
"It is worth mentioning that our transmission curves are pro-
duced as a function of wavelength, rather than frequency, and we
employ a fixed resolution of Δ_ = 2.2 Å per pixel in the observed
frame. This choice is motivated by the fact that we compare ex-
tensively with LRIS spectroscopy of S18, who quote a spectral
resolution of 2.18 Å per pixel for their observations. Inoue & Iwata
(2008) note that spectral resolution can have a significant impact
on the resultant IGM transmission, we have tested the effect of
increasing the spectral resolution to 0.4 Å per pixel, finding no sta-
tistically significant difference compared to our standard 2.2 Å per
pixel transmission curves."
"Throughout this paper we consider values in terms of IGM
transmission, 𝑇IGM = 𝑒−𝜏 , rather than considering 𝜏 computed as
described above. The reasons being first that the value of 𝑇IGM is
typically included in calculations of 𝑓esc and second that 𝑇IGM has
a dynamic range between 0 and 1, which provides more intuitive
comparisons. We note that throughout this paper the symbol 𝑇IGM
may refer to a wavelength dependent transmission function or a
single value at some specified wavelength. We avoid introducing an
explicitly wavelength dependent symbol, i.e. 𝑇IGM (_), as the usage
here is consistent with the conventions in the literature (e.g. Inoue
& Iwata 2008)."
"Example IGM transmission functions at 𝑧 = 3.1 are shown in
Figure 1. In the left panel in black we show the mean transmission
curve of all 10,000 simulated sight lines at 𝑧 = 3.1 while gold and
cyan curves show two individual sight lines having the highest and
lowest _rest = 910 Å transmission, respectively. At a given redshift
the transmission of LyC in the IGM may vary from 0.0 to nearly
1.0. In the right panel we show the redshift evolution of the mean
Ly𝛼 and LyC transmission predicted byTAOIST-MC in comparison
with observational and theoretical estimates from the literature. In
all cases, our model agrees, within errors, with previously reported
results."
"We note that our measurements are systematically lower than
some previous results, which can be attributed to the inclusion of
the circumgalactic medium component introduced in S18. Further-
more, a single statistic (such as the mean) belies the complexity of
the underlying 𝑇IGM distribution as shown in Figure 2. Thus, we"
"Figure 3. A comparison of the two 𝑓esc PDFs used in this work. The “Flat”
distribution represents the case of no assumed prior when calculating 𝑓esc
and is representative ofmost studies in the literature. The alternative explored
here is an exponentially declining models of the form PDF ∝ 𝑒−1/[ , here
shown with [ = 0.50."
"do not place a large emphasis on differences between the average
values of𝑇IGM between different studies. For theoretical𝑇IGM func-
tions this behaviour may be, in part, attributed to the exact form of
the differential 𝑁HI distribution assumed and the details of the im-
plementation. For example, Inoue & Iwata (2008) and S18 assume
different behaviours for the exponent 𝛽 of 𝑓 (𝑁HI, 𝑋) producing
different relative numbers of low and high 𝑁HI systems. These dif-
ferences will affect the 𝑇IGM of LyC and Ly𝛼 differently and will
appear as complex systematic offsets between the mean 𝑇IGM at a
given redshift between the two implementations. It should also be
mentioned that, to our knowledge, no study employing MC simula-
tions of IGM transmission curves have accounted for the effects of
HI clustering, which may further alter the mean 𝑇IGM curve (see,
however, Kakiichi & Dĳkstra 2018, who demonstrate Ly𝛼 may be
more attenuated from galaxies in high density environments)."
"Differences in the behaviour between theoretical 𝑇IGM imple-
mentations are only apparent from the mean transmission curves
while individual IGM transmission curves are likely indistinguish-
able. The implications regarding the statistical behaviour of IGM
sightline ensembles, however, is precisely the topic of this paper. As
we will repeat, the absolute values of quantities calculated through-
out will be imprinted with the assumptions regarding our 𝑁HI dis-
tribution sampling and may change slightly if different implemen-
tations are used. Thus, it is key to keep in mind that the absolute
results are for our implementation only. Qualitatively, however our
results are independent of the various input parameters."
2.2 𝑓esc Distribution Functions
"One of the key unknowns in this study is the distribution func-
tion of 𝑓esc for galaxies at 𝑧 ≥ 2.9. While quantifying 𝑓esc from
galaxies has been a long standing goal in the astrophysics of reion-
ization, this parameter remains elusive. In a broad sense, a number
of studies have estimated the average 𝑓esc required for all galax-
ies in order to match the constraints on the timing of reionization,"

and LAE (gold) samples. Open histograms represent LRIS 1500 Å fluxes

tion of 10,000 sampled values for our mock galaxy spectra produced using
cdf_sampler.py (see footnote 2) with the open histograms as inputs. Values
on the left y-axis refer to observed samples (open histograms) and on the
right y-axis refer to mock samples (closed histograms), noting in the latter
case these values are based on an arbitrarily selected “parent sample” size."
"finding values in the range 0.05 < 〈 𝑓esc〉 < 0.20 (e.g. Bouwens
et al. 2015; Robertson et al. 2015; Finkelstein et al. 2019). From
hydrodynamical simulations of individual galaxies employing full
radiative transfer, however, the likelihood that all galaxies will have
a constant and/or single valued 𝑓esc over their lifetime seems van-
ishingly small (Kimm & Cen 2014; Paardekooper et al. 2015, see
also Section 4.6 for a brief discussion of the 3D versus line-of-sight
𝑓esc values).
Given the lack of strong constraints on 𝑓esc from the literature,"
"for the fiducial model of our analysis, presented in Section 3.1,
we simply uniformly apply values of 𝑓esc between 0.0 and 1.0 to
our mock spectra. This allows for mock spectra with the highest
possible LyC flux for a given IGM sightline, representing the most
likely galaxies to be detected in a LyC survey. As such, the results
of our fiducial model should be interpreted as the minimum level of
𝑇IGM bias expected for LyC detected galaxies."
"It seems most likely that allowing extremely high 𝑓esc is un-
realistic for the vast majority of real galaxies (e.g. Vanzella et al.
2010; Siana et al. 2015; Japelj et al. 2017). In Section 3.2 we test
the effects on our measured 𝑇IGM bias of applying an additional,
more realistic 𝑓esc distribution, to our simulations. For this test, we
assume an exponentially declining 𝑓esc PDF, i.e. 𝑃( 𝑓esc) ∝ 𝑒−1/[ ,
resulting in a model with the most probable value of 𝑓esc being
zero. For our exponentially declining 𝑓esc PDF we choose a value
of [ = 0.5, which is motivated by the observed detection rates of
KLCS (S18, see Section 4.3). We illustrate the relative PDF shapes
of our fiducial and exponentially declining models in Figure 3 for
clarity."
2.3 Producing Mock Galaxy Spectra
"As mentioned above, the process of producing mock galaxy spectra
for our simulations requires three inputs: an underlying SEDmodel,
an IGM attenuation function, and a value for 𝑓esc (𝐿𝑦𝐶). We note
that in much of this work we ignore the effects of dust attenuation
(see, however, Section 4.4, simply noting that most LyC detections
appear to originate from relatively dust free galaxies (e.g. S18)."
"Similar to S18 we construct our SEDs from the BPASSv2.1 (El-
dridge et al. 2017) models with 𝑍∗ = 0.001, IMF slope 𝛼 = −2.35,
and stellar mass limit of 300𝑀� . We employ a model with an expo-
nentially declining SFR with an 𝑒-folding time of 0.1 Gyr sampled
at an age of ∼200 Myr. This provides an input spectrum with an
intrinsic LyC to UV flux ratio, (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 , of 0.18 (e.g. S18).
Our SEDmodel corresponds to a LyC photon production efficiency,
b𝑖𝑜𝑛, of log10 (b𝑖𝑜𝑛) = 25.61 Hz erg−1, consistent with estimates
for high redshift star-forming galaxies (e.g. Bouwens et al. 2016).
We explore the effect of altering (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 on our results in
Section 3.3."
"Each mock spectrum is scaled such that the non-ionizing UV
flux matches a randomly sampled value characteristic of high red-
shift, highly star-forming galaxies. The sampling of UV fluxes is
one key factor in our analysis as this ultimately determines the in-
trinsic level of LyC flux from galaxies in our mock samples. In this
work we test samples taken two different UV flux distributions: one
based on the full sample of galaxies observed by the KLCS, which
is composed of a representative subsample of bright Lyman Break
Galaxies (LBGs) at 2.9 < 𝑧 < 3.2 from the flux-limited sample
of Reddy et al. (2012), and a second based on 𝑧 ∼ 3.1, narrow-
band selected Lyman 𝛼 emitters (LAEs) characteristic of galaxies
targeted by LACES (F19). For our LBG comparison UV values
used in our work are sampled from measurements of LRIS spectra
at _rest = 1500Å taken directly from reported values of S18. For
the comparison with LAEs, UV values are sampled based on the
histograms presented in F19, Figure 15, based on ground based
photometry. We compare the absolute magnitude distributions of
the two distributions in Figure 4, showing LAEs to be significantly
fainter than LBGs2. We note, however, that some LBGs have been
shown to also exhibit Ly𝛼 emission (e.g. Shapley et al. 2003), thus
LBG and LAE classifications are based on selection methodology.
Here, the important distinction is the relative non-ionizing UV flux
with LBGs being significantly brighter."
"The sample of S18 covers a redshift range of 𝑧 ' 2.8-3.5 and the
sample of F19 is at a roughly fixed redshift of 3.1. Themock galaxies
in our analysis, however, are produced at 10 discrete redshift values
with Δ𝑧 = 0.1 from 𝑧 = 2.9 to 𝑧 = 3.9. Thus, we must include
a method to account for cosmological dimming of each of these
samples when considering higher redshifts. In each case, we begin
with the absolute magnitude distributions shown in Figure 4 and
assume that this distribution is roughly representative of a similarly
selected sample in each Δ𝑧 = 0.1 redshift bin. We then sample
magnitudes from the above distributions then convert each value to
an observed 1500 Å flux at a given redshift. We note that this is
equivalent to a slight increase in depth with redshift, however we
expect this to have a negligible effect on our results as we are most
sensitive to the brightest galaxies at any redshift."
"For each of the 10,000 IGM sightlines in a given redshift bin
we produce 100 mock spectra for both the LBG and LAE compari-
son samples. For each trial we randomly sample a 1500 Å flux (as
described above) and a value of 𝑓esc, the latter following Section
2.2. The current 𝑇IGM function is applied to the input BPASSv2.1
spectrum, then at all wavelengths shortward of 911.8 Å it is scaled
uniformly by the randomly selected 𝑓esc value. The resulting spec-
trum is then scaled to match the randomly selected 1500 Å flux."
"2 In both cases sampling of UV fluxes is achieved using
the histogram_oversampler class of the code cdf_sampler.py

remove sharp edges of the histogram bins"

3 RESULTS
"The primary results of this paper concern quantifying the obser-
vational bias in IGM transmission for samples of LyC detected
galaxies. We reiterate that the initial results are based on tests per-
formed on a fiducial dust-free, exponentially declining SFR SED
models at fixed metallicity, IMF slope, and age (see Section 2.3
for a full description). We have selected our fiducial model to have
(𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡∼0.18 (comparable to other studies in the literature,
e.g. S18, F19), which is expected to be representative of young, star-
forming galaxies responsible for driving reionization."
"Additionally, as described in Section 2.2, our fiducial model
assumes the unrealistic case of a flat probability distribution for 𝑓esc"
"between 0 and 1.0. High 𝑓esc will correspond to a bright LyC flux,
thus, we expect a preference towards detections at high 𝑓esc in our
fiducial model. 𝑓esc for real galaxies will be, on average, lower than
the average of our fiducial model given the typically low value for
observed LyC emitters (e.g. S18). This means that the level of bias
in 𝑇IGM for detections seen in our fiducial model can be seen as a
lower limit to the true bias for observed galaxy samples."
"We explore the quantitative effects of both altering the input
PDF of 𝑓esc and changing the value of (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 in Sections
3.2 and 3.3, respectively. In the case of SED variations we test SEDs
with b𝑖𝑜𝑛 values covering the range for exponentially declining SFR
models using BPASSv2.1 spectra over available range of stellar
population ages provided."
3.1 Fiducial IGM Bias
"Here we quantify the bias in𝑇IGM affecting samples of LyC detected
galaxies when compared with the average𝑇IGM of all random sight-
lines. Formally, we define this bias as:"
𝑇bias = 〈𝑇det〉 − 〈𝑇IGM〉 (7)
"where 〈𝑇det〉 is the average 𝑇IGM for galaxies with LyC detected
above a specified detection limit and 〈𝑇IGM〉 is the average 𝑇IGM
for all sightlines. It is worth noting that transmission values are not
inherently additive quantities and it could be argued that the def-
inition 𝑇bias = 〈𝑇det〉/〈𝑇IGM〉 is more sensible, and possibly more
physically motivated as it relates directly to a difference in optical
depth/HI column density. Our choice of definition is motivated by
the fact that the resulting 𝑇bias values are roughly redshift indepen-
dent at fixed observational detection limit (see, e.g., Section 3.1.3),
providing a simplified framework for applying 𝑇bias to a given set of
observations. We also point out that, by definition, such a correction
will never result in an unphysical transmission value for LyC detec-
tions > 1.0. Furthermore, any evolution in 𝑇bias with redshift when
assuming a fractional definition is primarily reflective of the red-
shift evolution of 〈𝑇IGM〉 as one is dividing by a value increasingly"
"MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2021)"
The IGM Transmission of LyC Detections 7
"close to zero. Regardless, either 𝑇bias definition mentioned here
will provide an equivalent correction, thus the choice is somewhat
arbitrary."
"In this work, the calculation of𝑇bias is performed at 11 discrete
redshifts in the range 2.9 ≤ 𝑧 ≤ 3.9 with Δ𝑧 = 0.1. We also note
that, similar to 𝑇IGM and 〈𝑇IGM〉, 𝑇bias can refer to a wavelength
dependent function, a single value at a specified wavelength, or an
average value across a specified wavelength range. Due to tech-
nical differences between LyC searches employing spectroscopy
(e.g. S18) and photometry (F19, M20), we present the two cases
separately: spectroscopic biases are presented in Section 3.1.1 and
photometric biases are presented in Section 3.1.2. In all cases, we
have performed this experiment twice: once for an LBG-like sample
and once for a fainter, LAE-like sample (see Figure 4). Due to the in-
herent faintness, our mock LAE samples are typically only detected
deep HST F336W observations, which compare to F19 (particu-
larly in our higher redshift bins) who achieve a depth of 30.24 mag.
Thus, in most cases we only provide 𝑇bias measurements for this
comparison (as opposed to spectroscopy or CFHT 𝑢 photometry).
We provide a summary of our fiducial model in Section 3.1.3."
3.1.1 Spectroscopic Detections
"Spectroscopic detection of LyC radiation provides a key advantage
over photometric detections in terms of interpretation in the context
of estimating 𝑓esc. The reason being that spectroscopy allows one to
probe the same rest frame wavelengths just shortward of the Lyman
limit, typically probed between 880-910 Å, independent of redshift
in theory. In practice, of course, the redshift range in which LyC can
be probed by a given set of spectroscopic observations is defined by
the wavelength coverage of the instrument used. Furthermore, the
detection limits of a given instrument will be wavelength dependent
due to response variations of the detector. Thus, the experiment
presented here should be considered as a simulation of an idealised
spectroscopic instrument with uniform sensitivity to LyC radiation
at 880-910 Å across the entire redshift interval from 2.9 < 𝑧 < 3.9.
The black 〈𝑇IGM〉 functions in Figure 6 show that this wavelength
range exhibits the largest 〈𝑇IGM〉 values at _rest < 911.8Åmeaning
that at all redshifts spectroscopic observations probe LyC emission
at the highest 〈𝑇IGM〉 and, thus, the highest probability of detection
(at fixed depth). This is simply due to the fact that the redshift
interval of LyC absorption systems that affect a given wavelength
increases with decreasing wavelength. This means that at lower
wavelengths the probability of encountering a high column density
system in any individual sightline is higher."
"As we discuss later, this is not the case for photometric obser-
vations which instead probe a fixed _obs range, thus a decreasing
_rest with increasing redshift. Another important and related point
is that ionizing radiation escaping from galaxies will be completely
absorbed by intervening, high HI column density systems, result-
ing in rapid drops in flux based on the redshift of that intervening
system (e.g. the drop at ∼810 Å in Figure 1). This means that es-
caping ionizing radiation from high redshift galaxies may only be
visible in a very small wavelength range and this behaviour will
be difficult to capture and interpret from photometric observations,
but will be seen clearly in spectroscopy. As a caveat, however, we
note that, without ancillary, high spatial resolution, space-based
photometric data, it can be difficult to rule out the possibility of
low redshift contamination from ground-based spectroscopic LyC
detections (Vanzella et al. 2010, 2012)."
"The fact that spectroscopy probes the most transparent portion
of the emitted spectrum from high redshift galaxies also suggests"
"Figure 6. Left column: 〈𝑇IGM 〉 for spectroscopically detected LyC emission.
Shown are results at 𝑧 = 3.1, similar to the average redshift of S18 of ∼3.05.
The Lyman limit is indicated with a vertical dotted line, and in all cases
the detection limit is fixed at 0.025 `Jy (∼27.9 mag), equivalent to a 1-5𝜎
detection, dependent on individual targets, in the sample of S18. The mean
and median 〈𝑇IGM 〉 functions for detected LBG-like galaxies are shown
with cyan and gold lines with the gold shaded area enclosing 68% of 𝑇IGM
values for detected galaxies at a given wavelength. Thus, the lower bound of
the gold shaded region is not representative of the transmission curve shape
for any individual sightline. 〈𝑇IGM 〉 for LyC detected, LAE-like galaxies is
shown in green, significantly higher than for the LBG-like sample due to
their relative faintness. The increased dispersion seen for LAE samples is a
result of a smaller number of detections for such galaxies. Themean𝑇IGM for
all sightlines is shown in black for comparison. Right column: Normalised
histograms of 𝑇IGM for all sightlines (black), detected, LBG-like galaxies
(cyan), and detected, LAE-like galaxies (green). The mean for all galaxies
and detections are shown with corresponding vertical, dotted lines (matched
to corresponding open histograms), and the median for LBG-like detections
is shown with a gold dotted line, noting that this line corresponds to the gold
line of the left panel and has no matching histogram in the right panel."
"that spectroscopic detections of LyC may suffer from relatively
low 𝑇bias at fixed detection limits (noting however that photometric
detections are significantly deeper for the same exposure time). We
show this in Figure 6wherewe show 〈𝑇IGM〉 for all 10,000 sightlines
in black and 〈𝑇IGM〉 for those where galaxies are detected with a flux
above 0.025 `Jy, equivalent to ∼27.9 mag, at 𝑧 = 3.1, with coloured
lines. It should be clarified here that this detection limit is chosen
to be roughly matched to the faintest LyC detection reported in S18
for the galaxy Westphal-MM37 (0.026 `Jy). Considering the full
parent sample of S18, 0.025 `Jy corresponds to a 1-5𝜎 detection as
the observational limits and noise characteristics exhibit complex
dependencies on factors such as observational depth and source
redshift (i.e. the observed wavelength of emitted LyC radiation).
Thus, we reiterate that our results are representative of an idealised
version of the S18 survey as we have not attempted to simulate the
full complexity of their spectroscopic observations."
"Returning to Figure 6, the cyan and gold lines indicate the
mean and median 𝑇IGM curves for LyC detected, LBG-like galaxies
(comparable to the S18 sample) while the green line shows the
mean 𝑇IGM curve for LAE-like detections (comparable to the F19
sample). Here we measure 〈𝑇IGM〉 in the rest frame wavelength
range 880 ≤ _rest ≤ 910 Å (indicated in Figure 6), also following
S18. We note that LAE-like galaxies are not representative of the
S18 sample and are only detected at these spectroscopic limits in our
lowest redshift bins. In fact, overall detection rates at all redshifts
is lower for the more faint sample of LAEs, which accounts for
the increased dispersion seen in the 〈𝑇det〉 curve for LyC detected"
"MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2021)"
8 R. Bassett et al.
"LAEs. Given this comparison is to S18 who focus on LBGs, we do
not place a large emphasis on this mock sample for spectroscopic
observations."
"Also shown in Figure 6 is the median and 68 percentile range
for LyC detected LBGs in gold for comparison. The median value
of 𝑇IGM for detections is seen to be larger in the Ly𝛼 forest and
lower beyond the Lyman limit, with a cross-over value around 880
Å. The significant differences between the mean and median IGM
transmission functions for detected galaxies is a reflection of the
non-Gaussian nature of the underlying𝑇IGM distribution (see Figure
2). Regardless, the median and mean values of 𝑇IGM for detected
galaxies are similar and throughout the remainder of this work we
focus on the mean value."
"In the right column of Figure 6 we compare the histograms
of 𝑇IGM at 880-910 Å between all sightlines (black) and those
associated with LBG-like galaxies detected above 0.025 `Jy (cyan).
We can see that the underlying distribution is bimodal with the
most probable value of 𝑇IGM being ∼0 while the distribution for
detections is unimodal with the most probably value being close to
the upper mode of the underlying distribution (the distribution for
fainter, LAE-like samples, shown in green, is skewed towards even
higher values). This is not surprising as for galaxy to be detected at
LyC wavelengths the value of 𝑇IGM must not be zero. It is clear that
the mean value of 𝑇IGM for all sightlines falls between the peaks of
the underlying 𝑇IGM distributions and is thus not among the most
probably values for detected galaxies."
"The fact that LyC detections can not occur at 𝑇IGM = 0 may
occasionally be overlooked in calculations of 𝑓esc for LyC detected
galaxies, and is key to the narrative of this work. Careful con-
sideration of 𝑇IGM variation in the estimate of 𝑓esc for individual
detections is common practice (e.g. Shapley et al. 2006; Inoue et al.
2011; Vanzella et al. 2016). Ultimately, the goal of this paper is to
provide a clear quantification of this effect. A primary application
of our results will be for estimating 〈 𝑓esc〉 for larger samples of LyC
detected galaxies that may be returned by future, extremely deep
surveys (see 5). It should also be mentioned that, when estimat-
ing upper limits in 𝑓esc for samples including LyC non-detections,
〈𝑇IGM〉 considering all simulated sightlines is appropriate (i.e. in-
clusion of 𝑇bias is unnecessary)."
"The level of 𝑇bias for LyC detections will also be sensitive
to the detection limits, 𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑚, of a given set of observations. We
explore the dependence between 𝑇bias and spectroscopic detection
limits in Figure 7. In the top panel of Figure 7 we show the value of
〈𝑇IGM〉 for galaxies with spectroscopically detected LyC emission
as a function of detection limit at redshifts in the range 2.9 ≤ 𝑧 ≤ 3.9.
For each redshift, we also show the corresponding 〈𝑇IGM〉 for all
sightlines with a dotted line of the same colour. The detection limit
assumed in Figure 7 of 0.025 `Jy is shown with a green, vertical,
dotted line. We find that at low detection limits the dependence
between 〈𝑇IGM〉 and 𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑚 is similar in all redshift bins apart from
the expected vertical offsets due to the drop in 〈𝑇IGM〉 with redshift
(reiterating, however, that the definition 𝑇bias = 〈𝑇det〉/〈𝑇IGM〉 will
result in a clear redshift dependence). At each redshift the curve can
be well fit by a power law of the form 𝑇IGM ∝ 𝐹"
"𝑙𝑖𝑚
with 𝛽 in the"
"range ∼0.26-0.35. These fits for each redshift are shown in Figure 7
with corresponding dashed lines, noting that these relationships will
change for inputs that vary from our fiducial model (e.g. different
values of (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 or a different input distribution of 1500 Å
fluxes). It is also worth reiterating that sensitivity variations across
real spectroscopic detectors will result in detection limit variation
with redshift at fixed exposure time."
In the bottom panel of Figure 7 we show 𝑇bias as a function
"Figure 7. The dependence of 𝑇bias on the detection limit of spectroscopic
observations (𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑚) for LBG-like detections. Top: 〈𝑇IGM 〉 as a function
of 𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑚 at redshifts between 2.9 and 3.9 (see lower panel for legend).
Horizontal dotted lines show 〈𝑇IGM 〉 of all sightlines at a given redshift, and
the vertical dotted line shows the 𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑚 assumed in Figure 6. At each redshift
we fit the curve of 〈𝑇IGM 〉 for detected galaxies with a power law of the form
〈𝑇IGM 〉 (𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑚) = 𝑎𝐹 𝑘𝑙𝑖𝑚 + 𝜖 . Bottom: 𝑇bias as a function of 𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑚 for the
same redshift interval. We show a power-law fit, 𝑇bias (𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑚) = 𝑎𝐹 𝑘𝑙𝑖𝑚 + 𝜖 ,
to the combined data for all redshifts as a black dashed line."
"of 𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑚 at the same discrete 𝑧 values between 2.9 and 3.9 with
Δ𝑧 = 0.1. Overall we find a very small scatter in 𝑇bias with the
difference between the maximum and minimum 𝑇bias at fixed 𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑚
less that 0.01 at all redshifts in the range considered. Given the
smooth curves seen in Figure 7, it is tempting to provide the power
law fits (of the form 〈𝑇IGM〉(𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑚) = 𝑎𝐹𝑘𝑙𝑖𝑚 + 𝜖 , dashed lines in
Figure 7, top panel) at each redshift giving an analytical function for
estimating𝑇bias as a function of 𝑧 and 𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑚, however we refrain from
doing so as we would consider any application of such a function as
an overinterpretation of Figure 7, which results from our particular
implementation for producing 𝑇IGM functions as well as the various
inputs of our fiducial model (e.g. here we have only shown results
for LBG-like samples). For illustrative purposes we have fit a power
law to the combined 𝑇bias vs 𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑚 curves 𝑇𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠 ∝ 𝐹0.29𝑙𝑖𝑚 . This fit is
shown in the bottompanel of Figure 7with a black dashed line. Here,
the choice of a power law is ad hoc, and no specific significance is
assigned to the fit parameters."
"It is useful here take a step back and recall two important
points: first there is significant variation in 𝑇IGM for individual
sightlines at any redshift (see, e.g., Figure 1) and second the fact
that we allow high 𝑓escvalues (up to 1.0) in our fiducial model
meaning𝑇bias observed in our fiducial model represents the absolute
minimum 𝑇bias for a given detection limit. Thus, we caution the
reader from applying values of𝑇bias calculated using a similarmodel"

including these caveats."
3.1.2 Photometric Detections
"While spectroscopic detection of LyC radiation from galaxies pro-
vides distinct advantages in terms of 〈𝑇IGM〉, achieving this for
large samples of galaxies is inefficient. Photometric surveys have
the potential for detecting large samples of LyC emitting galaxies
simultaneously. Another important benefit of photometric surveys
when compared to spectroscopy is that photometry is significantly
more sensitive (i.e. deeper) for the same exposure time. Further-
more, in the case of space-based LyC detections, ancillary data is
not necessary to rule out the possibility of low redshift contamina-
tion. Photometric LyC surveys must be performed in well studied
fields in which targeted galaxies already have accurate photometric
redshift estimates (e.g. ZFOURGE fields Straatman et al. 2016) or,
ideally, secure spectroscopic redshifts (e.g. 3DHST, DEIMOS10K,
VANDELS, MUSE-wide, Momcheva et al. 2016; Hasinger et al.
2018; Pentericci et al. 2018; Urrutia et al. 2019). In fields such as
these, specific redshift windows can be targeted using photomet-
ric bands probing LyC emission such as HST F336W at 𝑧 ∼ 3.0
or CFHT 𝑢 at 𝑧 ∼ 3.4 (e.g. F19, M20). There are two key draw-
backs in the case of photometric LyC surveys when compared to
spectroscopy, however (see also S18, Section 7.2)."
"The first drawback in photometric searches for LyC emission
when compared to spectroscopic studies is that the ionizing radia-
tion may only be observable in a narrow wavelength range just short
of 912 Å as shown in Figure 5. This is due to intervening, high HI
column density systems at redshifts corresponding to the Lyman
limit occuring at the wavelength of the drop in flux of our simulated
spectra. The fact that such a drop may occur in the middle of the
wavelength sensitivity of a given filter will result in an underesti-
mation of the flux level of the emergent LyC radiation. This results
from the fact that calculation of the reported photometric flux in-"
"herently assumes a flat flux density across the filter. Of course, the
interpretation of the photometric flux can include more complex
spectral behaviour, e.g. extreme [OIII]+H𝛽 emitters presented in
Forrest et al. (2017)."
"The second drawback is that the observed wavelengths of pho-
tometric bands are fixed. This means that the ideal redshift for such
surveys is at the point where the red cutoff of the filter in question
falls just below the Lyman limit (thus filter dependent). LyC radia-
tion can be detected to higher redshifts (more likely for extremely
deep observations), however at high redshift the filter moves to
bluer rest wavelengths where 〈𝑇IGM〉 is significantly lower. This
fact causes significant complications when making comparisons of
LyC escape from photometric detections at different redshifts. We
also mention briefly here that some photometric filters suffer from
so-called “red leak” with a small amount of radiation at wavelengths
longer than the optimal cutoff of the filter being transmitted (though
this is minimized for the new CFHT 𝑢 filter used in M20, Sawicki
et al. 2019). As such features will be included in the filter curves
used in our analysis, this effect is implicitly accounted for."
"With these two drawbacks in mind we present the simulated
𝑇bias for LyC detected galaxies for HST F336W and CFHT 𝑢 de-
tected galaxies in Figure 8. Here we use fixed detection limits of
30.24 and 27.82mag for F336WandCFHT 𝑢, respectively (matched
to the limits of F19 and M20). The two panels in Figure 8 show
the mean 𝑇IGM for all sightlines (black), for F336W LBG-like de-
tections (gold), CFHT 𝑢 LBG-like detections (cyan), and F336W
LAE-like detections (green) at redshifts of 3.2 and 3.6 (LAE-like
detections for CFHT 𝑢 are not shown as such detections are ex-
tremely rare due to the relative shallowness of M20 photometry).
We find that 𝑇bias for LBG-like galaxies is significantly lower for
F336W detections, however this is simply reflective of the greater
depth of our F336W comparison rather than any intrinsic advantage
of HST observations over ground-based for LyC detections. Com-
paring F336W LAE-like versus LBG-like detections, we find that
𝑇bias for the former is ∼0.1 larger owing to the relative faintness of
LAEs compared to LBGs (see Figure 4)."
"In Figure 8, F336W and CFHT 𝑢 filters are shown with dashed
gold and cyan lines, highlighting the fact that the F336W and 𝑢
filters exclusively probe LyC radiation at 𝑧 > 3.1 and 𝑧 > 3.4,
respectively. This explains why we see a significantly lower 𝑇bias
for the CFHT 𝑢 filter at 𝑧 = 3.2 as the transmission of this filter
peaks redward of the Lyman limit, meaning that it is more sensitive
to non-ionizing radiation at this redshift. In such a case where a
filter straddles the Lyman limit the interpretation of any observed
flux in the context of 𝑓esc is significantly complicated (e.g. Bassett
et al. 2019) and such cases should be avoided where possible."
"𝑇bias for photometry is also sensitive to observational detection
limits. The variation in 𝑇bias with detection limit (in magnitudes,
𝑚𝑙𝑖𝑚) is demonstrated in Figure 9 for the HST F336W filter. Solid
lines show results for LBG-like detections and dashed lines for
LAE-like detections. Similar to spectroscopic results presented in
Figure 7, we find that, at fixed 𝑧, 𝑇bias decreases linearly with an
increasing magnitude limit. When compared to the spectroscopic
results of Figure 7, with Δ𝑇𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠 . 0.01 for all redshifts, we find
more variation with redshift. This is due to the changing rest-frame
wavelengths probed by the F336W filter with redshift. Again, a
more significant redshift evolution will be observed assuming the
definition 𝑇bias = 〈𝑇det〉/〈𝑇IGM〉. For LAE-like detections, the fact
that very few LyC fluxes reach magnitudes brighter than 28.5 (and
only in the lowest redshift bins) means that detections occur in only
those sightlines with the highest 𝑇IGM(F336W). Thus the trends
shown for LAE samples in Figure 9 exhibit more scatter due to an"

functions. The dashed lines in Figure 9 also demonstrate why we
find so few LyC detected LAEs for our mock spectroscopic and
CFHT 𝑢 observations given the depth of these two comparisons are

3.1.3 Fiducial Model Summary
"The results of our fiducial model for fixed detection limits of 0.025
`Jy (∼27.9 mag), 30.24 mag, and 27.82 mag for spectroscopy,
F336W, and CFHT 𝑢, respectively, are summarised in Figure 10
for mock observations of galaxies with 1500 Å flux distributions
characteristic of LBGs (F336Wresults for fainter, LAE-like galaxies
are also shownwith dotted lines). As described in Sections 3.1.1 and
3.1.2, spectroscopic detections at this depth (targeting a fixed rest
wavelength window at 880 < _rest < 910 Å) experience a roughly
constant 𝑇bias of ∼0.15-0.17 (∼0.32 for fainter, LAE-like samples).
We find a slight redshift dependence on 𝑇bias, which increases from
0.157 at 𝑧 = 2.9 to 0.173 at 𝑧 = 3.7 then decreases slightly to 0.169
at 𝑧 = 3.9. This change in 𝑇bias of less than 2% is significantly
smaller than the variance seen at any given redshift and is driven
entirely by our cosmological dimming (see Equation 6). Thus, we
conclude that 𝑇bias is effectively constant at 3.0 < 𝑧 < 3.9 for our
chosen definition."
"The fact that 𝑇bias is found to be constant with redshift is
somewhat counterintuitive. Instead, one may expect a monotonic
increase in 𝑇bias with redshift due to the fixed detection limit and
linear decrease in 〈𝑇IGM〉. For our additive definition of 𝑇bias, the
constant 𝑇bias observed can be explained by a decrease in detection
rate with redshift where only the brightest galaxies contribute to
𝑇bias at the high 𝑧 end. This is illustrated in Figure 10 with the
detection percentages for spectroscopy at each redshift indicated in
black."
"Condsidering photometric detections, 𝑇bias is seen to increase
while the Lyman limit passes through the filter in question. At red-"

which decreases significantly with redshift, across the top of the bottom
panel. In both panels, open symbols for photometric observations indicate
redshifts at which a given filter probes (parially or entirely) wavelengths
redward of the Lyman limit (i.e. non-ionizing photons)."
"shifts where a given filter has passed fully blueward of the Lyman
limit, the level of 𝑇bias is seen to level off (within errors) at a value
dependent on the photometric depth. For our fiducial depths, this
plateau level is ∼0.11-0.14 and ∼0.22-0.31 for the F336W (magni-
tude limit = 30.24) and CFHT 𝑢 filters (magnitude limit = 27.82),
respectively. In the case of LAE-like 1500 Å flux distributions, we
show results only for F336W as this comparison has significantly
deeper flux limits compared with spectroscopy and CFHT 𝑢 (where
detections of LAE-like samples are vanishingly rare). In the case
of LAEs, we find that 𝑇bias is roughly 0.1 higher than for LBGs
at fixed redshift, with values in the range ∼0.21-0.24 across the
redshift range sampled."
"We also observe a slight dip in 𝑇bias for photometric detections
at the highest redshifts in the bottom panel of Figure 10. Unlike
spectroscopic detections, by 𝑧 ∼ 3.8 our photometric filters are
probing very blue _rest where 〈𝑇IGM〉 is near zero. Furthermore, as
seen in Figure 2, the 𝑇IGM distribution at these wavelengths is a
skewed, unimodal distribution peaked at 𝑇IGM = 0. This means that
the probability of finding a sightline with 𝑇IGM much higher than
zero is very low. This could explain why 𝑇bias for photometry dips
at high 𝑧, as even those small number of detected galaxies will be
found in sightlines approaching zero transmission at wavelengths
probed by a given filter. This means that the level of 𝑇bias seen at
lower redshifts simply can not be maintained given the underlying"
"MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2021)"
The IGM Transmission of LyC Detections 11
"𝑇IGM distribution for thewavelengths probed.At higher redshifts the
𝑇IGM distribution becomes so strongly peaked at 𝑇IGM = 0.0 that no
detections are expected, thus we do not expect the results presented
here for 2.9 < 𝑧 < 3.9 to be generalizable towards higher redshifts.
This is not necessarily the case for spectroscopic detections as the
𝑇IGM distribution at 880 < _rest < 910 Å remains bimodal even at
high redshift, thus no obvious dip in 𝑇bias is seen. Regardless, in all
cases 〈𝑇IGM〉 is decreasing with redshift, thus detections become
rarer. This manifests as a decreasing 68 percentile range for 𝑇bias,
a reflection of the drop in the numbers of detected galaxies with
redshift."
"Finally, as mentioned at the start of Section 3.1, the definition
𝑇bias = 〈𝑇det〉/〈𝑇IGM〉 is equally valid to the definition adopted in
this work. Under this alternative definition, a very clear trend be-
tween 𝑇bias and redshift is apparent increasing from ∼1.3 to ∼1.8
for spectroscopic observations and from ∼3 to ∼35 for F336W ob-
servations for LAE samples. We reiterate that, although a fractional
definition may be more physical (in the sense that it relates directly
to a ratio of HI column densities), the redshift evolution of 𝑇bias in
this case reflects primarily the fact that 〈𝑇IGM〉 moves increasingly
close to zero with redshift while the actual difference in the mean
IGM transmission between detections and all sightlines is roughly
constant, as our chosen definition illustrates. Thus, our definition
provides a simplified correction when calculating 𝑓esc for LyC de-
tected samples from an observational point of view."
3.2 An Alternative 𝑓esc Distribution
"It is expected that if LyC emission is detected from a given galaxy, it
must have a high 𝑓esc and/or a high𝑇IGM. From current observations
of LyC emitters (particularly considering the large number of non-
detections), it seems that 𝑓esc values, i.e. 0.0-0.2, are most common
(e.g. Boutsia et al. 2011; Grazian et al. 2016; Smith et al. 2018).
The results presented for our fiducial model in Section 3.1, however,
allow for 𝑓esc values from 0.0 to 1.0 with no preference. This means
that a large number of detections from our fiducial model exhibit a
large 𝑓esc and are detected in sightlines with relatively low 𝑇IGM. If
we instead choose an underlying 𝑓esc distribution skewed towards
low 𝑓esc, we might expect that the average 𝑇IGM for detections will
increase, thus increasing 𝑇bias."
"In this Section, we explore how altering the PDF of selected
𝑓esc values affects the level of 𝑇bias and the distributions of 𝑓esc for
LyC detections. For comparison, the fiducial model can be treated
as a flat PDF between 0 and 1. Here we test an alternative 𝑓esc PDF
model designed to give more weight to lower 𝑓esc values. In this
cases we choose an exponentially declining 𝑓esc PDF of the form:"
𝑃𝐷𝐹 ( 𝑓esc) ∝ 𝑒− 𝑓esc/[ (8)
"where [ represents an exponential cut off in 𝑓esc. Here we test the
value [ = 0.50 (see Figure 3) motivated by LyC detection rates
from S18 (see Section 4.3). For brevity our fiducial model will be
described as “flat” and our alternative model will be referred to as
[ = 0.50. As with our fiducial model, for our [ = 0.50 model we
recreate 100 mock spectra for each of our 10,000 IGM transmission
functions at each discrete redshift value as described in Section 2.3."
"We show example 〈𝑇IGM〉 curves at 𝑧 = 3.1 for detected LBG-
like galaxies in each of our two models in Figure 11. Though not
shown here, results for LAE-like galaxies are qualitatively similar.
Here we see that the flat 𝑓esc PDF exhibits a lower 𝑇bias than the [ =
0.50 as expected. The increases in 𝑇bias for both spectroscopic and
photometric detections are found to be only 0.01 and 0.02, respec-
tively. These increases in𝑇bias are essentially negligible considering"
"Figure 11.𝑇IGM curves for galaxies detected with F336W (top) and spectro-
scopically, (bottom). Both panels show the results at 𝑧 = 3.1 with detection
limits of 30.24 mag for F336W and 0.025 `Jy (∼27.9 mag) for spectroscopy.
In both cases, the [ = 0.30 model exhibits only slightly higher 𝑇IGM than
the fiducial model. Spectroscopic (F336W) values of𝑇bias increase modestly
from 0.16 (0.10) for the fiducial model to 0.17 (0.13) for the [ = 0.50 model."
"the spread in 〈𝑇IGM〉 for LyC detections seen in Figure 10. Thus, in
the case of our [ = 0.5 model, we find no significant difference in
𝑇bias when compared to the fiducial, flat 𝑓esc PDF and note that this
behaviour is the same in all redshift bins. In cases where the un-
derlying 𝑓esc is more strongly skewed towards 𝑓esc = 0 (i.e. smaller
values of [), the difference in 𝑇bias when compared to a flat PDF
is certain to increase. Such a low [ model (or any other similarly
skewed 𝑓esc PDF) may be appropriate for galaxy samples with se-
lection biases different from the LBG and LAE samples considered
here if 〈 𝑓esc〉 does indeed vary with galaxy properties (see Section
4.3 for more discussion)."
"The fact that 𝑇bias for our [ = 0.5 model is only negligibly
larger than our flat 𝑓esc PDF does not mean the two models are
interchangeable in regards to estimates of 𝑓esc from observed sam-
ples. To illustrate this, we show in Figure 12 the histograms of 𝑓esc
for detections only vs all trials at 𝑧 = 3.1 for spectroscopy (left)
and F336W (right). Filled histograms show the underlying 𝑓esc dis-
tributions and open histograms show the 𝑓esc distribution for LyC
detections. We find that the 𝑓esc distributions of LyC detections (i.e.
the posterior) for both observational methods is skewed towards 𝑓esc"
"MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2021)"

and the right for F336W. In each panel the underlying 𝑓esc distribution is
shownwith a filled histogram, the 𝑓esc distribution of detectionswith an open
histogram, and the mean value for detections is shown with a vertical dotted
line and indicated in the top left of each panel. Note that each histogram has

"= 1.0, inconsistent with the low values typically seen in observa-
tions. The posterior for the [ = 0.5 model, on the other hand peaks
at lower values, more consistent with estimates in the literature. We
show the mean values for posterior distributions in each panel with
a vertical dotted line. When assuming an [ = 0.5 model, the in-
ferred average 𝑓esc value is lower by 0.07 and 0.12 for spectroscopy
and F336W detections, respectively. Thus, although 𝑇bias is roughly
the same between the two 𝑓esc PDF models, the differences when
considering the inferred 𝑓esc for galaxy samples is significant."
"We note that the posterior distribution for the [ = 0.5 model
for a given detection method is equivalent to the posterior for the
flat 𝑓esc PDFmodel multiplied by the input [ = 0.5 distribution (the
prior) in line with the framework of Bayesian statistics. This is true
in general, thus one can simply determine the posterior distribution
for any arbitrarily defined 𝑓esc PDF once the posterior for a flat
distribution is determined for a given observational method and
detection limit without the need to run a separate analysis. We stress
again that the actual distribution of 𝑓esc is essentially unknown,
however we discuss possibilities for placing some constraints on
this in Sections 4.3 and 4.6."
3.3 Dependence on SED Variations
"In this Section we briefly explore the effects that varying the SED
shape will have on our estimates of 𝑇bias presented in Sections 3.1
and 3.2. In regards to detecting LyC from a given galaxy above a
specified limit, the key difference resulting from a change in SED
shape will be a change in the flux ratio of the LyC and UV (_rest ∼
1500 Å) portions of the observed spectrum, (𝐹900/𝐹1500)𝑜𝑏𝑠 , at a
fixed 𝑇IGM. The factor that will affect (𝐹900/𝐹1500)𝑜𝑏𝑠 (in addition"
"to 𝑇IGM) considered here is variation in the intrinsic ratio of LyC
and UV emission, (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 ."
"To test the effect of altering (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 on our results we
rerun the analysis described in Section 2.3 for each age of our ex-
ponentially declining BPASSv2.1 models (with 𝑒-folding timescale
of 0.1 Gyr) in the range 6.0 < log(age) < 9.0 in steps of Δlog(age)
= 0.1. The models produced exhibit (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 in the range
∼0.07-0.77, with corresponding values of b𝑖𝑜𝑛 from ∼25.4-26.0.
For each aged model we again create 100 mock spectra for each of
the 10,000 IGM transmission functions produced at each redshift
(2.9 < 𝑧 < 3.9, Δ𝑧 = 0.1) with 1500 Å fluxes sampled from an LBG-
like distribution. We then repeat our measurements of LyC flux as
in previous sections and adopt the flux limits of our fiducial model:
𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑚(spectroscopy) = 0.025 `Jy (∼27.9 mag) and 𝑚𝑙𝑖𝑚(F336W) =
30.24. The CFHT 𝑢 comparison is not considered here as the rela-
tively shallow nature of these observations results in prohibitively
few detections at low (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 . For a similar reason, we also
do not consider LAE-like samples in this section."
"We show the resulting (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 versus𝑇bias for spectro-
scopic, LBG-like LyC detections in the left panel of Figure 13. Sim-
ilar to the results for our test on detection limits we find only slight
variation in 𝑇bias with redshift with a total spread in values of ∼0.03
for all redshifts at a fixed (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 above (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 =
0.15 (again, a fractional definition of 𝑇bias will result in significant
redshift variation). For reference, we show the location of the fidu-
cial model presented in Section 3.1.1 with the dotted green line and
shaded regions. Slight differences can be attributed to stochasticity
as the analysis here represents and independent sample of 1500 Å
fluxes and 𝑓esc values at the same (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 value. Regard-
less, the results of Figure 13 are consistent with those of 3.1.1 within
errors."
"Results for F336W detections are shown similarly in the right
panel of Figure 13. We show results at redshifts where F336W
partially probes non-ionizing photons with dashed lines (i.e. 𝑧 <
3.2). Qualitatively the curves are similar to those in the left panel,
with the difference in 𝑇bias again attributed to the increased depth
of the F336W observational comparison."
"Finally, we note that none of the models presented to this point
have considered the effects of dust attenuation on the observed LyC
flux from mock galaxies. The effect that dust will have on LyC will
be to further reduce the observed value of 𝐹 (𝐿𝑦𝐶)/𝐹 (𝑈𝑉) relative
to (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 . In this way, dust attenuation is a third level
of degeneracy between 𝑓esc and 𝑇IGM. Given the low attenuation
for LyC detections (e.g. S18), we ignore the effects of dust simply
noting that detections should be biased towards galaxies with low
dust attenuation (or even none in the case of LAEs, e.g. Fletcher
et al. 2019; Nakajima et al. 2020)."
4 DISCUSSION
4.1 Correlation between 𝑇IGM (𝐿𝑦𝐶) and 𝑇IGM (𝐿𝑦𝛼)
"One major difficulty in accurately measuring 𝑓esc from high red-
shift galaxies is the unknown value of 𝑇IGM. So far, there is no
clear observational indicator of 𝑇IGM (LyC), which has necessitated
statistical methods such as those explored in this paper. In the work
of Inoue & Iwata (2008), however, it was argued that the 𝑇IGM at
Ly𝛼 wavelengths may correlate with 𝑇IGM (LyC) (their Section 4.4,
Figure 10). This claim is in direct contrast with previous results of
Shapley et al. (2006) who found no such correlation at 𝑧 = 3.06.
Inoue & Iwata (2008) suggest that the lack of correlation seen in"

"Shapley et al. (2006) was due to those authors exploring 𝑇IGM at
only one redshift. Here we test for a correlation between𝑇IGM (LyC)
and 𝑇IGM (Ly𝛼) for our simulated IGM transmission functions, not-
ing that our simulations differ from those of Shapley et al. (2006)
and Inoue & Iwata (2008) in that we include a CGM component to
our HI column density distributions following the work of S18 and
Rudie et al. (2013)."
"To perform this test, we assess all one million IGM sightlines
we have produced in Section 2.1, measuring 𝑇IGM for LyC at 880
< _rest < 910 Å and for Ly𝛼 at 1050 < _rest < 1170 Å following
Shapley et al. (2006) and Inoue & Iwata (2008). We note, however,
that the LyC and Ly𝛼 wavelength ranges used in these works are
not probing the same redshift range. Thus, we also measure an
alternative Ly𝛼 wavelength range 1173 < _rest < 1213 Å, matched
to the redshift of LyC in the specified range. In each redshift bin, we
measure the spearman rank-order correlation coefficient between
𝑇IGM (LyC) and 𝑇IGM (Ly𝛼) in both wavelength ranges and also the
correlation coefficient of the combined data from all redshift bins."
"Figure 14 shows 𝑇IGM (LyC) vs 𝑇IGM (Ly𝛼) for all one million
sightlines colored by their redshift. Overall there appears to be a
correlation between the two values (albeit with large scatter), how-
ever at any individual redshift such a correlation is less apparent.
For𝑇IGM (Ly𝛼) at 1050-1170 Åwemeasure correlation coefficients
at individual redshifts finding values in the range 0.05-0.08 indicat-
ing no correlation with 𝑇IGM (LyC) at fixed redshift consistent with
Shapley et al. (2006). Considering all redshift bins together we find
a drastic increase in the correlation coefficient to 0.34. This is still
lower than the correlation of 0.86 quoted by Inoue & Iwata (2008),
however, in this work the authors tested a much wider redshift range
from 0.2 to 6.0. Our results combined with those of Inoue & Iwata
(2008) suggest that any apparent correlation between 𝑇IGM at LyC
and Ly𝛼 wavelengths is driven only by the fact that both values
correlate similarly with redshift (e.g. Figure 1). For any individual
galaxy (or sample) at a given redshift, however, 𝑇IGM (Ly𝛼) pro-
vides no useful prediction for 𝑇IGM (LyC). Indeed, this is apparent
from the contours shown in Inoue & Iwata (2008) Figure 10."
"Figure 14. A comparison of 𝑇IGM for LyC (880-910 Å) and Ly𝛼 (1070-
1170Å) for all onemillion simulated sightlines. Points are coloured based on
their source redshift. We find that the apparent correlation seen between the
IGM transmission of LyC and Ly𝛼 radiation is driven by the fact that both
values exhibit individual redshift dependencies rather than any correlation
between these two values. Indeed, there is no apparent correlation between
𝑇IGM(LyC) and 𝑇IGM(Ly𝛼) at fixed redshift."
"As we have pointed out, however, the Ly𝛼 wavelength range
considered in Shapley et al. (2006) and Inoue & Iwata (2008) is
not well matched to the LyC wavelength range they considered. If
we instead use our alternative Ly𝛼 range, 1173-1213 Å, we find
a significant increase in the correlation coefficient at fixed redshift
range to 0.32-0.37. Combining the values for all bins we find a
modest increase to 0.45. Thus, we find a weak correlation between"

are selected at random (comparable to the number detected in S18) from
among the one million mock galaxies produced at each redshift as decribed
in Section 2.3. We calculate the average (𝐹900/𝐹1500)𝑜𝑏𝑠 among the 15
galaxies and use this value to estimate 〈 𝑓esc 〉 using Equations 9 and 10.
The 1-to-1 relation is shown with the thick dotted line while the thin dotted

roughly linearly with increasing the mean 𝑓esc for a given trial."
"𝑇IGM for LyC and Ly𝛼 at fixed redshift where the wavelength ranges
for these two are well matched. We note that a direct comparison to
the results of Inoue & Iwata (2008) and Shapley et al. (2006) may
be slightly tenuous as the IGM transmission curves produced there
do not include a CGM component while our models do. Indeed,
this may be the reason that we find such a large increase in the
correlation coefficient at fixed redshift when the wavelength ranges
of LyC and Ly𝛼 are properly matched. Given the large scatter and
the fact that 𝑇IGM (LyC) is found to be 0 for a range of 𝑇IGM (Ly𝛼)
at fixed redshift, however, we would be hesitant to try and estimate
one from the other regardless of the apparent weak correlation."
4.2 Effects of 𝑇bias on 𝑓esc Estimates for Samples
"The analysis presented in Section 3.1 was designed to predict the
average bias for a sample of LyC detected galaxies, which in turn can
be used to estimate the average 𝑓esc of the sample (e.g. S18, F19).
Thus, it may not be appropriate to blindly apply values measured
here to individual galaxies. Herewe test the discrepancy between the
average value of 𝑓esc for a sample of LyC detections estimated with
and without including 𝑇bias when compared to the true average 𝑓esc.
This should be seen as a highly simplified test as all mock galaxies
represent dust-freeBPASSv2.1modelswith a fixed (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡
of 0.18 (log10 (b𝑖𝑜𝑛/[Hz erg−1]) = 26.51). Real galaxy samples are
likely to exhibit a range of (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 , and will thus decrease
the accuracy of 𝑓esc estimates when compared to this test."
"The typical method of estimating 𝑓esc is to employ an equation
of the form (or similar to):"
"𝑓esc =
(𝐹900/𝐹1500)𝑜𝑏𝑠
(𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡"
"〈𝑇IGM〉
(9)"
"noting that the effects of dust attenuation are ignored here. In order to
estimate 𝑓esc for a given level of 𝑇bias, Equation 9 must be modified
in the following way:"
"𝑓
𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟
esc ="
"(𝐹900/𝐹1500)𝑜𝑏𝑠
(𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡"
"〈𝑇IGM〉 + 𝑇bias
(10)"
"Our test of the recovery of 〈 𝑓esc〉 for a sample of spectroscopically
LyC detected galaxies is performed on the mock observations de-
scribed in Section 2.3. We first select those mock galaxies with
output 880 < _rest < 910 Å fluxes above the detection limit of 0.025
`Jy. We then perform 5000 trials in which we randomly select 15
mock LyC detections (matched to the number of detections in S18)
and measure 〈(𝐹900/𝐹1500)𝑜𝑏𝑠〉 of this subsample. For each trial
we calculate the average 𝑓esc using Equations 9 and 10 and compare
this with the true 〈 𝑓esc〉 for the 15 selected detections."
"The results of this test at 𝑧 = 3.0 and 𝑧 = 3.1 for our [ = 0.5
𝑓esc PDF model are shown in Figure 15, though we find similar
results for the flat 𝑓esc PDF of our fiducial model. Here we plot
the true 〈 𝑓esc〉 versus two estimated values. Gold and cyan contours
show the distribution for 〈 𝑓esc〉 estimated using Equations 9 and 10,
respectively. The thick dotted green line shows the 1-to-1 relation.
The thin green lines are meant to be representative of the average
68 percentile spread of the 15 galaxies from any individual trial. To
produce these lines we measure the 68 percentile lower and upper
bounds and the average values of 𝑓esc for the 15 galaxies from each
of the 5000 trials.Wefind that the upper and lower bounds for a given
trial decrease roughly linearly with increasingmean 𝑓esc (albiet with
significant scatter), thus we fit each bound with a straight line as a
function of mean 𝑓esc. In this way, we are attempting to illustrate,
roughly, the expected speard in 𝑓esc values for a random selection
of 15 LyC detected galaxies having a given mean 𝑓esc value."
"At both redshifts there is good agreement between 𝑓 corresc and the
true value,while failing to account for𝑇bias results in an overestimate
of the average 𝑓esc. The level of overestimation is lower at 𝑧 = 3.0
due to the fact that 𝑓esc in Equations 9 and 10 depends on the
reciprocal of 𝑇IGM, which is decreasing with redshift towards 0. At
𝑧 = 3.1, Only ∼1.4% of the estimated 〈 𝑓esc〉 values calculated using
Equation 9 fall within the range of typical “true” 𝑓esc values for
our detected sample (noting this percentage is stochastic). At higher
redshifts this falls to 0%. Considering 𝑓 corresc , we find that, typically,
less than 1% of trials fall outside of the rough confidence intervals
presented in Figure 15. This test illustrates that not accounting for
𝑇bias when estimating the stacked 𝑓esc for detected galaxies can
result in a significant overestimate of the true value."
"Of course, as has been repeated throughout this work, the ab-
solute differences between 𝑓esc and 𝑓 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟esc (as well as the fractional
decrease) will have some dependence on the details of our method
for producing IGM transmission curves (e.g. 𝑁HI distributions), the
assumed value(s) of (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 , the assumed 𝑓esc PDF, the
input distribution of 1500 Å fluxes, etc. In addition, the inclusion
of dust, choice of dust curve, and any assumed dependence be-
tween E(B-V) and 𝑓esc will further affect these results. Although
not shown, we also performed the test presented here with dust
attenuation included following the method outlined in Section 4.4
(where E(B-V) values are sampled from a distribution characterised
by the observed values from S18) and find similar results with a
similar level of scatter. This of course assumes that both the average
𝐸 (𝐵 − 𝑉) for detected galaxies as well as the exact form of the
attenuation curve is precisely known. Inevitably, these values will
be highly uncertain for real observations resulting in a higher level
of scatter. Providing more realistic tests of the associated effects
on our stacking, while possible, would be highly model dependent,
thus not particularly useful."
"The fact that 𝑇IGM for LyC detected galaxies is expected to
be larger than 〈𝑇IGM〉 at a given redshift will be true regardless
of the exact implementations, however. Thus, the purpose of the
illustration presented here is simply to highlight the fact that the
assumption that 〈𝑇IGM〉 is representative of IGM sightlines towards"

The IGM Transmission of LyC Detections 15
"LyC detected galaxies will result in an overestimation of 𝑓esc. Given
that 𝑇bias increases with decreasing observational depth, the over-
estimation of 𝑓esc will be the higher for shallower LyC surveys."
4.3 Survey Detection Rate vs 𝑓esc PDF
"As we have shown in Section 3.2, the value of 〈 𝑓esc〉 inferred for
stacked samples of LyC detections will depend on the PDF assumed
for 𝑓esc. It has been repeated throughout this work that, observation-
ally, there appears to be a preference for low (or zero) 𝑓esc from high
redshift galaxies (e.g. Japelj et al. 2017; Smith et al. 2018; Bian &
Fan 2020). This creates a chain of circular reasoning, however, as
accurate measurements of 𝑓esc thus requires knowledge of the PDF
of 𝑓esc, which seemingly requires accurate measurements of 𝑓esc to
determine. The way forward is to determine an observational metric
that can help to determine the PDF 𝑓esc that is independent of the
individual values of 𝑓esc."
"In this Section we propose that the detection rates of LyC
from dedicated surveys can be used to probe the parameters of a
given 𝑓esc PDF. We construct two mock versions of the surveys
of S18, F19, and M20, one with a flat 𝑓esc PDF and one with
an exponentially declining 𝑓esc PDF. In the latter case we tune
the value of [ (see Equation 8) to match the observed detection
rate of a given survey (more description to follow). In each case,
we again use the same fixed input BPASSv2.1 SED model as our
fiducial model with (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 = 0.18. In all cases the input
1500 Å fluxes are sampled from a distribution matched to the fluxes
reported by each of those surveys. Thus, in this case, the F19 sample,
which is made up of LAEs, have a characteristic 1500 Å flux that
is lower than that of the LBG samle of S18 at the same redshift
resulting in a lower relativeLyCflux (see Figure 4). This is important
as the selection method of a given sample strongly influences the
distribution of galaxy properties included (e.g. typical 1500 Å flux,
(𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 , among others), which ultimately determine the
output LyC fluxes, and thus the detectability of a given galaxy.
Therefore, the toy model presented here is primarily for illustrative
purposes."
"The set of inputs described above is combined with our 𝑇IGM
sightlines to produce an output sample of LyC fluxes. In the case of
S18 and F19 we simply use the 𝑇IGM functions already produced,
noting that this requires all of our mock galaxies to be at discrete
redshifts with Δ𝑧 = 0.1. For S18 we match the observed redshift
distribution in each bin from that work and for F19 all galaxies
are simulated at 𝑧 = 3.1. As M20 explores significantly higher
redshifts we simply randomly sample values across the full redshift
range (matched to the observed distribution from that work) and
create new 𝑇IGM functions each time. For each survey we produce
10,000 mock observations. We then randomly draw subsamples
from these mock observations with sizes matched to the observed
sample sizes in each paper and measure the detection rates of LyC
for each subsample with detection rates of 0.025 `Jy (∼27.9 mag),
30.24 mag, and 27.82 mag for S18, F19, and M20, respectively. We
perform this test with a few different [ values for the exponential 𝑓esc
PDF, and coarsely tune the model such that the average detection
rate falls within the range quoted for each survey."
"The results of our test for KLCS and LACES are shown in
Figure 16. In each panel the detection rate distribution for the tuned,
exponentially declining model is shown in cyan (with the tuned
[ value in the legend) and the distribution for the flat model is
shown in gold. For LACES the observed detection rate range is
defined by either only considering their “gold” sample (low) or
considering the “gold” plus “silver” samples (high) and for KLCS"
"Figure 16. Detection rate distributions for our mock LACES (top) and
KLCS (bottom) surveys. In each case we create 50 thousand mock spectra
at the respective survey redshifts following Section 2.3, however we now
include the effects of dust attenuation for the S18 comparison (see text).
The observed detection rates are shown in gray while the detection rates
assuming a flat and exponentially declining 𝑓esc PDF are shown in gold and
cyan, respectively. In each case, the value of [ for the exponentially declining
PDF is coarsely tuned to match the detection rate of a given survey."
"we take their detection rate of 15/124 ∼ 0.12. In the case of KLCS,
the flat 𝑓esc PDF model is seen to predict a detection rate that
is too large to reproduce the survey in question. While the [ =
0.5 model is well matched to the observed detection rate. In the
case of LACES, however, though the average detection rate for the
flat model is close to the upper limit for the detection rate of that
suvey, it is difficult to rule out a flat PDF. The coarsely matched
exponential model requires a relatively high value of [ = 0.75.
From Figure 12 we expect that the inferred 𝑓esc values from this
model will not differ significantly from a flat distribution. In the
case of our mock M20 test, we were unable to reproduce the high
detection rate reported in the paper, which falls in the range 0.02-
0.11 (1-5 out of 44) depending on the reliability cut for the LyC
emitting galaxy candidates from that work. For our mocks we find
an overall detection rate from the flat 𝑓esc PDF (which will give
the highest detection rate) of 0.005, thus only a small fraction of
random selections of 44 galaxies will even contain one detection."
"Taken together, this toy model test for our three comparison
samples provides strong evidence that the underlying 𝑓esc PDFs will
be sensitive to the selection bias of the galaxy sample in question. In
the case of KLCS and LACES, the former probes the bright end of
the UV luminosity function characterised by LBGs while the latter
significantly fainter LAEs. The fact that the detection rate of KLCS
requires the 𝑓esc PDF to be skewed towards 0 while LACES is not
inconsistent with a flat 𝑓esc PDF points towards a scenario in which
faint galaxies, on average, have a 𝑓esc PDF less biased towards 0
(similar to the results of Finkelstein et al. 2019). Our inability to
reproduce the high detection rate of M20, even employing a flat 𝑓esc
PDF, suggests that this sample may be biased towards high values
of 𝑓esc (though we have not tested such a model here). Interestingly,
the goal of M20 was to provide a methodology for preferentially
selecting high 𝑓esc galaxies, consistent with the toy model presented
here. The key point highlighted here is that we have shown the
calculation of 𝑓esc to be sensitive to the underlying PDF (e.g. Figure
12), which is in turn appears to depend on sample selection. Thus,"
"MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2021)"
16 R. Bassett et al.
"a consideration of the 𝑓esc PDF should be considered in particular
when comparing inferred 𝑓esc values between disparate samples
(e.g. LAEs vs LBGs)."
"We reiterate that the exponentially declining 𝑓esc PDF favoured
here is simply an ad-hoc solution chosen for its bias towards low
𝑓esc values and a preference for 𝑓esc = 0. This selection was moti-
vated by the low detection rate of such emission and the, generally,
low estimates of the average 𝑓esc for large galaxy samples (e.g.
Vanzella et al. 2010; Grazian et al. 2016; Smith et al. 2018). The
true functional form of the PDF of 𝑓esc is very likely more complex
and may include dependencies on galaxy properties such as, e.g.,
stellar mass (Finkelstein et al. 2019; Naidu et al. 2020). Further
clarification of this issue will require larger samples of LyC de-
tections at 𝑧 > 3 which would be greatly aided by more sensitive
instrumentation at 𝑢-band wavelengths. It is also likely that inputs
from high-resolution, hydrodynamics simulations of high redshift
galaxies that include full radiative transfer can help greatly with
the interpretation of detections (and non-detections), though run-
ning such simulations is computationally expensive. Regardless, we
show here evidence that the most likely PDF for 𝑓esc for LBG like
galaxies favours a model with a reasonable bias towards low 𝑓esc."
4.4 Dust Attenuation
"To this point, we have avoided one key topic in the study of opti-
cal and UV radiation from star-forming galaxies: dust attenuation.
In general, the level of attenuation at fixed E(B-V) increases with
decreasing _rest such that UV wavelengths experience the highest
levels of attenuation (i.e. lowest transmission) irrespective of the
functional form of the assumed attenuation curve (e.g. Gordon &
Clayton 1998; Calzetti et al. 2000; Reddy et al. 2016, etc). This
statement, of course, assumes that extending the chosen attenuation
curve to short wavelengths (.1500 Å) is reasonable. We acknowl-
edge that Buat et al. (2002) have investigated dust attenuation at 900
Å in a handful of local star-forming galaxies and Weingartner &
Draine (2001) have explored theoretical models of dust attenuation
in a similar regime (based on the Magellanic clouds), however there
applicability to high redshift galaxies is also uncertain. Regardless,
the expected high level of attenuation at LyC wavelengths may lead
one to expect that galaxies with a high enough LyC flux to be de-
tected in current surveys should be biased towards low attenuation.
Indeed, LyC detections from KLCS all have 〈𝐸 (𝐵 − 𝑉)〉 = 0.045
(and 0.129 for full LBG parent sample, S18), and those of LACES
all exhibit negligible attenuation (𝐸 (𝐵 − 𝑉) < 0.07, 〈𝐸 (𝐵 − 𝑉)〉 '
0.01-0.03, F19, Nakajima et al. 2020)."
"Regardless, to expect all LyC emitting galaxies to contain neg-
ligible amounts of dust is likely too simplistic. Thus, some con-
sideration of the effects of dust in the interpretive framework for
𝑓esc calculations outlined in this paper is warranted. We advocate
a methodology similar to that outlined in F19. First, a determina-
tion of the stellar E(B-V) value should be computed based on the
available photometric data for a given sample of objects. This can
be achieved through full SED fitting or through calibrations such
as those based on the UV slope, 𝛽 (e.g. Meurer et al. 1999). In
the case of SED fitting, we advocate a method only incorporating
bands redward of Ly𝛼, as shorter wavelengths are strongly affected
by IGM attenuation (e.g. effects not intrinsic to the galaxy) that
should be treated independently to avoid added degeneracy in the
SED model. The effects of including or omitting flux with wave-
lengths shortward of Ly𝛼 during the SED fitting process will be
tested in future work (Bassett et al., in prep). The computed E(B-V)
is combined with a choice of dust attenuation curve, 𝑘 (_), to correct"
"the observed 1500 Å flux to the “intrinsic”, dust-free, value. Finally,
the chosen input SED template for a given sample (either computed
through SED fitting or simply selecting a template with a reasonable
value of (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 ) is scaled to match the corrected 1500 Å
flux. Through this process, the intrinsic LyC flux can be determined,
noting this value will be dependent on the selection of the intrinsic
SED."
"From the intrinsic LyC flux calculated in this manner, one can
then determine the expected value of 𝑓esc by comparing with the
observed value. In this way, any attenuation of LyC flux due to dust
is incorporated into the definition of 𝑓esc, as pointed out by F19 (i.e.
there is no distinction between dust attenuation and absorption of
LyC by neutral hydrogen). We also follow the methodology of F19
who allow 𝑓esc for a given value of 𝐸 (𝐵 −𝑉) to only be as large as
the transmission allowed by the extrapolated dust attenuation curve.
This is reasonable as, in the case of a galaxy with relatively large
𝐸 (𝐵 − 𝑉), a value of 𝑓esc = 1.0 would imply zero dust attenuation
for LyC and high attenuation at 1500 Å. We note, however, that
such a case is not entirely impossible given LyC emission is often
dominated by stellar populations with ages < 10 Myr while stellar
populations as old as a few hundred Myr can provide significant
flux at 1500 Å (e.g. Eldridge et al. 2017), thus the emission at each
wavelength may originate from different locations within a given
galaxy."
"We do note, however, that this maximum 𝑓esc allowed by the
assumed attenuation curve is highly model dependent. For example
a SmallMagellanic Cloud attenuation curve (e.g. Gordon&Clayton
1998) will have amuch higher attenuation at LyCwavelengths when
compared to either a Calzetti et al. (2000) or Reddy et al. (2016)
attenuation curve with the same 1500 Å attenuation. This results
from the fact that the extension of the functional form of either a
Calzetti et al. (2000) or Reddy et al. (2016) 𝑘 (_) is significantly
flatter at _ < 1500 Å than that of Gordon & Clayton (1998). This
caveat is important to keep in mind when considering the possible
“maximum” 𝑓esc allowable for a given value of 𝐸 (𝐵 −𝑉)."
4.5 LyC Detections at Other Redshifts
"The study of LyC escape from galaxies in ground-based studies is
limited to redshifts & 2.8 due to the low atmospheric transmission of
UV photons. This limitation is not suffered by space-based instru-
mentation, thus, studies of LyC at lower redshifts can be performed
at significantly lower redshifts with satellite instrumentation. In par-
ticular LyC has been detected at 𝑧 ∼ 2.5 by Bian et al. (2017) using
the HST-WFC3 F275W filter, and recently at 𝑧 = 1.42 by Saha
et al. (2020) with the Ultra-Violet-Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on
board AstroSat. We also note that there has been significant activ-
ity in spectroscopic detection of LyC from green pea galaxies at
𝑧 ∼ 0.3 − 4 with HST COS (e.g. Izotov et al. 2016, 2018). At such
low redshifts, however, IGM transmission should be negligible, thus
these studies are not of particular relevance to the study of 𝑇bias."
"Here we focus on providing predictions for detection of LyC
within the Ultraviolet Imaging of the Cosmic Assembly Near-
infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey Fields (UVCANDELS;
PI: Teplitz, PID 15647), a ∼430 arcmin2, 164-orbit Cycle 26
UV HST program. UVCANDELS will provide 3-orbit depth of
WFC3/275W and parallel ACS/F435W in four CANDELS fields:
GOODS-N, GOODS-S, EGS, and COSMOS."
"For our predictions we follow a similar procedure outlined in
Section 4.3, however here we have produced 10,000 IGM trans-
mission curves at both 𝑧 = 2.4 and 𝑧 = 4.4 for the purpose of
providing mock observations of LyC using the WFC3/F275W and"

and from the 𝑧 ∼ 4.0 UV luminosity function of Bouwens et al. (2015)
with depths matched to UVCANDELS. Top row: LyC vs non-ionizing UV

free, exponentially declining SFR BPASSv2.1 SEDs with (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡
= 0.184, and assuming a flat 𝑓esc PDF. We note that a larger value of
(𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 can produce a handful of individual LyC detected galaxies."
"ACS/F435W filters, respectively. To sample the input 1500 Å fluxes
or this comparison we sample from UV luminosity functions of
Moutard et al. (2020) derived from the CLAUDS survey for 𝑧 = 2.4
and from fits to B-band dropouts (𝑧 & 3.8) from Bouwens et al.
(2015) for 𝑧 = 4.4. In both cases we use luminosity functions de-
scribed by a Schechter function with 𝛼 = -1.4, 𝜙∗ = 2.708×10−3,
and 𝑀∗ = −20.623 at 𝑧 = 2.2 and 𝛼 = -1.64, 𝜙∗ = 1.97×10−3, and
𝑀∗ = −20.88 at 𝑧 = 4.4. For all mock galaxies we assume a value
of (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 of 0.18."
"To sample the _rest ∼ 1500 Å flux for mock galaxies we mea-
sure our SED with the ACS/F435W and WFC3/F814W for 𝑧 = 2.4
and 𝑧 = 4.4 respectively. The 5𝜎 depths of each filter are matched
to the observations at 27.0 mag for F275W, 28.0 for F435W, and
28.4 for F814W. For the best chance of detecting LyC emission
we produce roughly 100,000 mock observations of galaxies at each
redshift, significantly more than should be expected in the UVCAN-
DELS volume. We also assume a flat 𝑓esc PDF, to further increase
the possibility of producing galaxies with very bright LyC flux."
"The results of this test are shown in Figure 17. The top row
shows the non-ionizing UV versus LyC magnitudes (observational
band is redshift dependent) and the bottom row show the his-
tograms of F275W and F435W magnitudes in logscale. In both
panels we show the magnitude limits of UVCANDELS for respec-
tive LyC probing bands with a vertical dashed line. For galaxies
with (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 = 0.18, the 5𝜎 limits of UVCANDELS are
too shallow to detect individual galaxies within the UVCANDELS
footprint as the brightest. In the event that UV bright galaxies with
significantly higher (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 exist within the UVCANDELS
footprint, it may be possible that one or two individual detections
will be found. We conclude that pushing observations to a depth of"
"30mag and beyond in small, targeted fields (i.e. similar to the 𝑧 = 3.1
observations of Fletcher et al. 2019) is likely to be more fruitful than
shallow searches over large areas such as UVCANDELS."
"Given the expected faintness of LyC emission, wide area sur-
veys such as UVCANDELS will likely rely on stacking analysis in
order to estimate the average 𝑓esc for galaxy subsamples. In this sce-
nario, prior information regarding the likelihood of escaping LyC
emission (e.g. evidence of a hard ionizing spectrum or high Ly𝛼
escape, if available) will be useful. This is due to the fact that,
although high LyC flux is more common for UV bright galaxies,
galaxies with the same UV brightness are also commonly found
with relatively low LyC flux (as shown in Figure 17). Similarly, we
find galaxies with relatively faint non-ionizing UV flux with rela-
tively high LyC flux. Thus, simply stacking the galaxies with the
highest 1500 Å flux does not guarantee that the galaxies with the
highest LyC flux have been chosen."
"Finally, we note a few caveats to this analysis. First, this analy-
sis has been performed using 𝑇IGM curves produced independently,
while UVCANDELS covers 4 individual fields. In the event that
there is strong correlation in 𝑇IGM across the field, the resulting
LyC fluxes may be systematically higher (in the case of high 𝑇IGM)
or lower (in the case of low 𝑇IGM) for one particular field. Consider-
ation of the correlation of𝑇IGM between sources in individual fields
of a given area may require dedicated analysis of large scale simula-
tions of the HI distributionns and is beyond the scope of this work.
And second, this analysis has ignored variation in (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡
(as noted), assumed no dust attenuation, and employed a flat 𝑓esc
PDF, all three of which will affect our resulting LyC fluxes."
4.6 Observed vs True 𝑓esc
"Ultimately the ongoing search for LyC emission from high redshift
galaxies is closely connected with our understanding what types of
galaxies are responsible for reionizing the universe. Characterising
the population of strong LyC emitters will be key to informing our
picture of the topological evolution of ionized regions during the
EoR (Seiler et al. 2018). There exists, however, an inherent difficulty
regarding the interpretation of 𝑓esc values measured observationally
due to the complex geometry of LyC escape from galaxies, inde-
pendent of 𝑇IGM. Indeed various models have been hypothesised
that may provide slightly different interpretations of the detected
LyC flux in the context of measuring 𝑓esc. A detailed discussion of
various LyC escape models can be found in Section 9.4 of S18."
"Crucially, it has been pointed out (e.g. Bassett et al. 2019;
Barrow et al. 2020) that the detection of LyC from any individ-
ual galaxy is reflective of only the fraction of LyC that is able to
escape into our single line-of-sight. There is still no reliable way
of inferring if the observed 𝑓esc value is reflective of 𝑓esc in all
directions, i.e. the 3D 𝑓esc (though intriguing indirect measurement
techniques for the 3D 𝑓esc have been proposed, which warrant fur-
ther exploration within an anisotropic LyC escape scenario, e.g.
Zackrisson et al. 2013; Yamanaka et al. 2020). Similarly, the lack
of LyC emission from any individual galaxy is not evidence of 𝑓esc
= 0.0 as large quantities of LyC photons could be escaping in di-
rections other than our line-of-sight. As we have shown, the value
of 𝑓esc is dependent on the assumed underlying PDF and current
detection rates may disfavour a flat distribution. One way to provide
a theoretically sound basis for our assumptions on the PDF of 𝑓esc
for galaxies or galaxy samples is through the careful consideration
of high resolution hydrodynamical simulations."
"LyC escape can be measured in such simulations by applying
full radiative transfer, then measuring 𝑓esc from a large number of"
"MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2021)"
18 R. Bassett et al.
"sight lines towards the galaxy. This method provides the full three
dimensional 𝑓esc at a given time and has shown that even for indi-
vidual galaxies 𝑓esc is highly variable and can swing from 0 to 1
within 100 Myr (Paardekooper et al. 2015; Trebitsch et al. 2017;
Rosdahl et al. 2018) though there may be some mass dependence
on the 3D 𝑓esc PDF. It has been shown, however, that for a galaxy
with given 3D 𝑓esc value the value of 𝑓esc in any particular sight-
line may vary from 0 to values larger than the true 3D value (e.g.
Paardekooper et al. 2015, Figure 13). Thus, to construct the un-
derlying 𝑓esc PDF for a given sample of galaxies may require the
combination of the 3D 𝑓esc of galaxies (with possible dependencies
on mass or other properties) with the probability distribution of 2D
𝑓esc (line-of-sight) for a given 3D 𝑓esc value. Disentangling the var-
ious dependencies on these underlying PDFs will require suites of
high resolution simulations with full radiative transfer, but is of the
utmost importance in interpreting the 2D 𝑓esc values from observa-
tions with the true 3D 𝑓esc distributions. Ultimately it is the full 3D
𝑓esc values from galaxies that are of interest in the context of the
EoR, which can only be connected to our 2D observational results
through such a complex line of reasoning as is described here."
5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
"In this paper we have explored the level of bias in the IGM trans-
mission, 𝑇IGM, for galaxies with LyC detections at 𝑧=3-4 under the
observational limits imposed by current instruments and surveys.
Our tests were performed by simulating one million IGM transmis-
sion functions in our redshift range of interest and applying these
to empirically motivated mock galaxy spectra constructed from the
BPASSv2.1 models (Eldridge et al. 2017). We have also tested how
the level of IGM transmission bias, 𝑇bias, depends on both the as-
sumed probability distribution function, PDF, of 𝑓esc and SED shape
(which controls (𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 , a key value for measuring 𝑓esc).
Our analysis has included modeling designed to approximate both
spectroscopic and photometric LyC detections from recent surveys
of Steidel et al. (2018), Fletcher et al. (2019), and Meštrić et al.
(2020)."
"Broadly, we find that, in all cases the average value of 𝑇IGM
at LyC wavelengths for galaxies with LyC detections is found to
be larger than the average 𝑇IGM for all simulated sightlines at the
same redshift. This results from the fact that the underlying 𝑇IGM
distribution at 880 Å < _rest < 910 Å is bimodal with the stronger
peak at 𝑇IGM = 0, but the simple fact that the galaxy has been
detected means that 𝑇IGM ≠ 0. Thus, the 𝑇IGM distribution for LyC
detected galaxies is unimodal with a peak at relatively high 𝑇IGM,
while the mean for all sightlines falls below this due to the inclusion
of the 𝑇IGM = 0 peak. The result is that the assumption of a mean
𝑇IGM for all sightlines when calculating 〈 𝑓esc〉 for a sample of LyC
detected galaxies results in an overestimate of the true value. This
result is similar to the recent results of Byrohl & Gronke (2020) for
Ly𝛼 transmission. Thus, it is becoming clear that, while tempting,
using a single statistic (e.g.median ormean)when considering𝑇IGM
for individual objects provides misleading results for LyC detected
samples. Considering sampleswhich include (are composed entirely
of) LyC non-detected galaxies, the use of 〈𝑇IGM〉 when calculating
upper limits on 〈 𝑓esc〉 is appropriate, however. The remainder of our
conclusions can be summarised as follows:"
"• Assuming the an LBG-like UV flux distribution and applying
detection limits of Steidel et al. (2018), Fletcher et al. (2019), and
Meštrić et al. (2020) we estimate minimum levels of 𝑇bias to be
∼0.15, ∼0.11, and ∼0.22 for each survey, respectively."
"• In the case of aUVflux distributionmore characteristic of LAE
sample (e.g. those of Fletcher et al. 2019) a higher 𝑇bias should be
expected. In this case, mock HST F336W observations similar to
Fletcher et al. (2019), the minimum 𝑇bias increases to ∼0.21."
"• We have shown in Section 3.2 that, although 𝑇bias does not
increase significantly assuming an 𝑓esc PDF mildly biased towards
0, there may be a slight decrease in the recovered 𝑓esc value in such
a model."
"• We have also demonstrated that the current detection rates of
LyC radiation from surveys may reflect information regarding the
underlying 𝑓esc PDF. Our simplifiedmodel presented in Section 4.3,
for example, appears to slightly disfavour a flat 𝑓esc PDF for LBGs
(e.g. Steidel et al. 2018), though this may not be the case for LAE
samples (e.g. Fletcher et al. 2019)."
"This final point may suggest that fainter galaxies, represented
by LAE samples, are more likely to exhibit a higher 𝑓esc than bright
galaxies, represented by LBGs. Such a scenario is in agreement with
other recent studies (e.g. Finkelstein et al. 2019). Our comparisons
in this context in Section 4.3 with the detection rates of Steidel
et al. (2018) and Fletcher et al. (2019) are still in the realm of
low statistical significance. Thus, confirmation of these results will
require larger samples of LyC detected galaxies onwhich to perform
a similar analysis."
"Of course, all of our results will depend on the various input
parameters of our models including the assumed distribution of
1500 Å (rest-frame) fluxes, our treatment (or lack thereof) of dust
attenuation, our assumptions regarding the intrinsic luminosity ratio
((𝐿900/𝐿1500)𝑖𝑛𝑡 ) of galaxies, and even the details of our methods
for producing 𝑇IGM functions (e.g. HI distribution functions). Thus,
we do not claim that the absolute values of 𝑇bias from this work to
be in any way definitive. The purpose of this work is to highlight
the ways in which different assumptions regarding the underlying
distributions of 𝑇IGM and 𝑓esc affect our attempts to estimate 𝑓esc
from galaxies. It is clear that significant theoretical work is still
required to better understand these PDFs that are critical to our
interpretation of LyC detections from observations."
"From an observational point of view, it is also clear that larger
samples of LyC detections will be essential in disentangling the var-
ious dependencies on 𝑓esc (e.g. stellar mass, SFR, etc). It is possible
that more efficient searches can be conducted in the near future with
a focus on increasing both depth and field-of-view (FOV). Indeed,
we find the highest detection rates among our mock surveys for our
mock LACES survey (Fletcher et al. 2019, Section 4.3), primar-
ily due to those observations reaching 30.24 mag. The drawback
is that this study is performed with WFC3, an instrument with a
relatively small FOV. One possible future instrument that may push
LyC surveys to the next level is the KeckWide Field Imager (KWFI,
Gillingham et al. 2020) that is expected to achieve a signal to noise
of ∼2 at 30th magnitude in the 𝑢-band across a 1 degree diameter
FOV in just under 8 hours of exposures (private communication).
From our mock LACES survey, we estimate that ∼50% of all simu-
lated galaxies fall in the magnitude range between 30 and 32. Thus,
the era of large samples of known LyC emitting galaxies may be
near."

programming language (Van Rossum & Drake 2009) and, in par-
ticular, the authors wish to acknowledge the the numpy (Oliphant
2006), matplotlib (Hunter 2007), and scipy (Virtanen et al. 2020)
packages. MR and LP acknowledge support from HST programs
15100 and 15647. Support for Program numbers 15100 and 15647
were provided by NASA through a grant from the Space Telescope
Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universi-
ties for Research in Astronomy, Incorporated, under NASA contract
