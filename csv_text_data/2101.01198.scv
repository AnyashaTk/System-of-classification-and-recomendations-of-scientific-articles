"ABSTRACT
We study the evolving environment dependence of mass accretion by dark haloes in
simulations of cold and warm dark matter (CDM and WDM) cosmologies. The latter
allows us to probe the nature of halo growth at scales below the WDM half-mode mass,
which form an extreme regime of nonlinear collisionless dynamics and offer an excellent
test-bed for ideas relating to hierarchical growth. As environmental proxies, we use
the local halo-centric matter density δ and tidal anisotropy α, as well as large-scale
halo bias b1. Our analysis, while reproducing known trends for environment-dependent
accretion in CDM, as well as the comparison between accretion in CDM and WDM,
reveals several interesting new features. As expected from excursion set models, WDM
haloes have higher specific accretion rates, dominated by the accretion of diffuse mass,
as compared to CDM haloes. For low-mass WDM haloes, we find that the environment-
dependence of both diffuse mass accretion as well as accretion by mergers is almost
fully explained by α. For the other cases, δ plays at least a comparable role. We detect,
for the first time, a significant and evolving assembly bias due to diffuse mass accretion
for low-mass CDM and WDM haloes (after excluding splashback objects), with a z = 0
strength higher than with almost all known secondary variables and largely explained
by α. Our results place constraints on semi-analytical merger tree algorithms, which in
turn could affect the predictions of galaxy evolution models based on them."

1 INTRODUCTION
"The growth of gravitationally bound haloes of collisionless
cold dark matter (CDM) through accretion and mergers is
one of the primary physical processes of interest in the hi-
erarchical structure formation paradigm. The stochasticity
inherent in the initial cosmological seed fluctuations, coupled
with the nonlinearity of gravitational evolution of a colli-
sionless fluid, renders this problem analytically challenging,
although considerable insights may be gained through simpli-
fied models of structure formation (Bond et al. 1991; Lacey
& Cole 1993; Musso & Sheth 2014). Since dark haloes are
expected to be the cradles of galaxy formation and evolution
(White & Rees 1978), understanding the evolving nature of
halo mass accretion and its dependence on the local and
large-scale environment of haloes is expected to yield impor-
tant clues into corresponding correlations in the observed
distribution and evolution of galaxies in the Universe."

"(Lacey & Cole 1993, see also below) suggests a useful tool
for investigating the nature of mass accretion, in the form
of CDM-like power spectra which are suppressed at small
scales (large k), mimicking the effects of a thermally pro-
duced warm dark matter (WDM) particle. The steep cut-off
in power in such models creates an extreme situation where
haloes forming close to the corresponding mass scale experi-
ence dramatically enhanced growth, and haloes below this
scale simply do not exist (e.g., Angulo et al. 2013). Simu-
lations performed with WDM-like power spectra, therefore,
offer ideal test-beds for the environment dependence of mass
accretion: any physical model that purports to explain the
nature of mass accretion in CDM must also do so for WDM,
since the physics of a self-gravitating collisionless fluid is com-
mon to both (Hahn & Paranjape 2014). Of course, WDM
models are physically interesting in their own right, from the
point of view of small-scale challenges for the CDM frame-
work (see Bullock & Boylan-Kolchin 2017, for a review),
although this is not the focus of the present work."
"There has been considerable work to date studying mass
accretion by haloes via mergers and smooth (or diffuse)
accretion (Fakhouri & Ma 2010; Genel et al. 2010; Benson
et al. 2013; Elahi et al. 2014), as well as its dependence on halo"

"environment (defined typically in terms of halo-centric dark
matter density using different smoothing schemes, see Genel
et al. 2010; Fakhouri & Ma 2009, 2010; Maulbetsch et al.
2007; Borzyszkowski et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2017, see also More
et al. 2015). The overall understanding that has emerged
from these studies, regardless of the exact choice of definition
of halo-centric density, is that denser environments tend to
promote mergers while underdense environments are more
conducive to diffuse accretion. There are also stark differences
between accretion in CDM and WDM, particularly at low
mass, as expected from the discussion above, with low-mass
WDM haloes accreting rapidly and primarily through diffuse
accretion."
"A related line of study is that of halo assembly bias
or secondary bias, i.e., the correlation (at fixed halo mass)
between secondary halo properties other than mass and halo-
centric density (or bias) measured at cosmological scales
(Sheth & Tormen 2004; Gao et al. 2005). Although assembly
bias has been studied over a wide range of halo mass and
redshift using many choices of secondary variables such as
age (Sheth & Tormen 2004; Gao et al. 2005; Jing et al. 2007),
concentration (Wechsler et al. 2006; Angulo et al. 2008),
shape (Faltenbacher & White 2010; van Daalen et al. 2012),
angular momentum or spin (Gao & White 2007) and veloc-
ity dispersion structure (Faltenbacher & White 2010), the
correlation between halo bias and mass accretion rate has
thus far been limited to massive objects at z = 0 (Lazeyras
et al. 2017). Moreover, recent work on assembly bias at z = 0
has revealed the importance of the local tidal environment of
haloes (Hahn et al. 2009; Borzyszkowski et al. 2017; Paran-
jape et al. 2018) in explaining the assembly bias of many
secondary variables, including concentration, spin, shape and
velocity dispersion structure over a wide range of halo mass
(Ramakrishnan et al. 2019, see also Han et al. 2019). It is
therefore very interesting to ask whether the halo tidal envi-
ronment plays a similar role in explaining any assembly bias
trends with mass accretion."
"In this work, we perform a detailed study of the nature
of the environment dependence of mass accretion by haloes,
segregated into contributions due to mergers and diffuse
mass, as a function of redshift and for a range of halo masses.
We will do so using N -body simulations of both CDM and
WDM cosmologies; as mentioned above, the latter will allow
us to better resolve the multi-scale environment dependence
of mass accretion due to its sensitivity to the shape of the
initial matter power spectrum. We will connect these results
to the assembly bias literature by performing, for the first
time, a comprehensive study of assembly bias due to mass
accretion across cosmic time, along with its connection to
the evolving local halo environment, for both CDM and
WDM. Our results reproduce previously observed trends
while extending these to new local environmental variables
such as the tidal anisotropy, and are expected to place useful
constraints on semi-analytical models of halo formation and
growth (e.g., Somerville & Kolatt 1999; Parkinson et al. 2008;
Jiang & van den Bosch 2014), which in turn form the bedrock
of several semi-analytical models of galaxy formation and
evolution (e.g., Benson & Bower 2010; Benson 2012; Barausse
2012; Dayal et al. 2014; Birrer et al. 2014; Somerville et al.
2015; Yung et al. 2019)."
"The paper is organised as follows. We describe our simu-
lations and analysis techniques in section 2. We present our
results along with a discussion in section 3, with section 3.1
focusing on environment-independent evolution, sections 3.2"
"and 3.3 focusing on trends with local environment and sec-
tion 3.4 devoted to assembly bias. We discuss some of these
trends in the framework of the excursion set approach in
section 4 and conclude with a summary of our main results
in section 5. Throughout, the base-10 logarithm is denoted
by ‘log’ and the natural logarithm by ‘ln’."
2 SIMULATIONS AND TECHNIQUES
"Here we describe our simulations and analysis tools for iden-
tifying haloes and measuring their accretion rates and local
as well as large-scale environments."
2.1 Simulations
"We have used N -body simulations of CDM and WDM per-
formed using the tree-PM code gadget-2 (Springel 2005)1"
"in a cubic, periodic box of comoving length 150h−1Mpc sam-
pled with 10243 particles, corresponding to a particle mass
mp = 2.4 × 108h−1M�, with a 20483 PM grid and comov-
ing force resolution 4.9h−1kpc corresponding to 1/30 of the
Lagrangian inter-particle spacing."
"The CDM transfer function Tcdm(k) for generating initial
conditions was computed using the code camb (Lewis et al.
2000)2 with a spatially flat ΛCDM cosmology having total
matter density parameter Ωm = 0.276, baryonic matter den-
sity Ωb = 0.045, Hubble constant H0 = 100h kms"
−1Mpc−1
"with h = 0.7, primordial scalar spectral index ns = 0.961
and r.m.s. linear fluctuations in spheres of radius 8h−1Mpc,
σ8 = 0.811, consistent with the 7-year results of the Wilkin-
son Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP7, Komatsu et al.
2011)."
"For the WDM model, we additionally suppress small-
scale power in the linear transfer function as appropriate for
the free-streaming of a thermally produced WDM particle
with mass mdm = 0.4 keV according to the fitting function
of Bode et al. (2001) (with parameters taken from Viel et al.
2005)"

The resulting “half-mode” mass-scale (c.f., e.g., Schneider
et al. 2012) of Mhm ' 3 × 1011h−1M� is resolved with
∼ 1200 particles (see below).3 Although a WDM particle with
mdm = 0.4 keV is completely ruled out by Lyman-alpha forest
observations as being the dominant component of dark matter
(Viel et al. 2013; Iršič et al. 2017; Palanque-Delabrouille
et al. 2020), it allows us to resolve the entire initial power
spectrum up to the truncation scale with sufficient particles,
thus providing a useful test-bed for studying mass accretion"

"and its environment dependence in the absence of small-scale
perturbations."
"Initial conditions for both CDM and WDM were gener-
ated at z = 99 with the same random seed using 2nd order
Lagrangian perturbation theory (Scoccimarro 1998) with the
code music (Hahn & Abel 2011).4 Snapshots were stored
starting from z = 12 to z = 0 at time intervals equally
spaced in the scale factor with ∆a = 0.004615 (leading to
201 snapshots), which provides sufficient time resolution for
the accretion and merger analysis described below. The sim-
ulations and analysis were performed on the Perseus and
Pegasus clusters at IUCAA.5"
2.2 Halo identification and masses
"Haloes were identified using the code rockstar (Behroozi
et al. 2013a)6 which implements a Friends-of-Friends algo-
rithm in 6-dimensional phase space and provides information
on gravitationally bound haloes as well as their substructure.
Merger trees were constructed using the 201 snapshots in each
simulation (CDM and WDM) using the code consistent-
trees (Behroozi et al. 2013b).7 Since we wish to focus on
the accretion rates of well-resolved haloes in this work, we
exclude all subhaloes and further consider only those ob-
jects for which the virial energy ratio η = 2T/|U | satisfies
0.5 < η < 1.5, which mitigates the effects of unrelaxed
objects and numerical artefacts (Bett et al. 2007)."
"We further exclude splashback objects, which spatially
mimic genuine haloes at the redshift of interest but have
passed through a larger host in the past and hence are
physically closer to subhaloes. We do so using the value
of the ‘first accretion scale’ reported by consistent-trees,
which records the earliest epoch at which the main progenitor
of a given descendant passed through the virial radius of a
larger object; we exclude all descendants whose first accretion
scale is earlier than the epoch of interest.8 For completeness,
we report that splashback haloes at z = 0 form . 6% (4.5%)
by number of our low-mass halo populations in CDM (WDM)
and . 0.7% of high-mass objects in either cosmology (see
below for the corresponding mass ranges), with the fractions
becoming vanishingly small at high redshifts."
"Throughout, we will quote halo and progenitor masses
using the mass definition Mvir as reported by rockstar.
This corresponds to the bound mass contained in a halo-
centric sphere of virial radius Rvir which encloses a density
equal to ∆vir times the critical density of the Universe, where
∆vir is the spherical collapse overdensity and is taken from
the fitting function provided by Bryan & Norman (1998) (at
z = 0, ∆vir ' 98 for our cosmology, while ∆vir → 18π2 ' 178
at high-z during matter domination). Additionally, we use
the rockstar values of M200b to infer the halo-centric radius
R200b which encloses a density equal to 200 times the mean
density of the Universe at each redshift; this will be useful
when characterising local halo environments below."

8 To avoid effects of numerical precision in comparing scale factor
values, we define splashbacks as objects whose first accretion epoch"
"is more than 100 Myr in the past of the epoch of interest. We
have checked that varying this threshold by factor 2 on either side"
makes no difference to our results.
"Figure 1. Halo mass function: Dashed (solid) lines show the
halo mass function in CDM (WDM) at z = 0.0 (thick curves) and"
"z = 1.5 (thin curves) as a function of virial mass Mvir. The horizon-
tal axis starts at Mvir = 1.4× 1010h−1M�, corresponding to a 60
particle cut which we use for identifying progenitors. The first ver-"
"tical dotted line from the left indicates Mvir = 1.2× 1011h−1M�
or 500 particles, which we use as the threshold for identifying
descendants at any redshift (see text for other criteria applied in"
"selecting a clean halo sample). The low-mass and high-mass bins
we use are indicated in blue and red colours, respectively, demar-
cated by the remaining vertical lines and with the corresponding"
"ranges mentioned in the labels. Highlights: In the WDM mass
function, we clearly see the suppression of halo counts below the
half-mode mass Mhm ' 3×1011h−1M�, and (at low redshift) the
spurious upturn at very low masses due to numerical artefacts."
"Figure 1 shows the mass functions for haloes in CDM
(dashed) and WDM (solid) at z = 0 and z = 1.5. The vertical
lines demarcate the mass bins we will use below; the lowest
mass threshold corresponds to 500 particles and the mass
functions in the low-mass (high-mass) bin we employ are
coloured blue (red). The CDM mass function shows the well-
studied power law rise towards low masses and exponential
decline at high masses (Press & Schechter 1974; Bond et al.
1991; Sheth & Tormen 1999; Tinker et al. 2008)."
"The WDM mass function is identical to the CDM one
at high masses for each redshift, but turns over around the
half-mode mass (see above), leading to a suppression of halo
abundances at low masses as expected from the lack of small-
scale perturbations (Hahn & Paranjape 2014; see also Benson
et al. 2013; Schneider et al. 2013). At masses smaller than
∼ 1010.4h−1M�, however, we see an up-turn in the z = 0
WDM mass function, which is a well-known consequence
of numerical artefacts in the N -body technique applied to
initial conditions with suppressed small-scale power (Wang
& White 2007; Angulo et al. 2013; Lovell et al. 2014; Agarwal
& Corasaniti 2015). Note that the virial cut of 0.5 < η < 1.5
mentioned earlier already removes many spurious objects at
masses close to the half-mode mass (Agarwal & Corasaniti
2015); removing the lower-mass spurious objects would re-
quire a more sophisticated study of the initial proto-patches"

"from which these objects evolve (Lovell et al. 2014), which
we have not performed here."
"Our choice of the lowest mass bin for descendant haloes
is sufficiently far above the mass scale where spurious objects
start becoming numerically relevant. We have checked this by
applying the correction suggested by Schneider et al. (2013)
by fitting a power law to the mass function below the up-turn
scale (not displayed) and subtracting it from the measured
mass function; the result agrees with the measured mass
function in the mass bins of interest at better than ∼ 2% at
all redshifts. Spurious objects therefore do not contribute to
our chosen populations of descendant haloes at any redshift.
However, when identifying progenitor haloes in the merger
trees, we will employ a lower mass cut of 60 particles (the
left edge of the horizontal axis in figure 1). This affects the
quantification of mass accretion rates in the WDM case at
low redshifts, by artificially enhancing the accretion due
to mergers and correspondingly decreasing the accretion of
diffuse mass. We return to this point below."
2.3 Measuring specific mass accretion rates
"For the analysis below, we use haloes in the two mass bins
discussed above, all of which are well-resolved with more than
500 particles. We used merger trees generated by consistent-
trees to find all the progenitors of a given halo within the
previous 2 dynamical times9 at any chosen redshift. The
values of the dynamical time Tdyn and the redshift interval
∆z ≡ zi− zf corresponding to 2Tdyn at different redshifts are
given in table 1. Our snapshot resolution of ∆a ' 0.005 (see
above) provides us with excellent sampling of the required
∆z at all the redshifts we probe (see table 1)."
"Throughout, we retain progenitors that are resolved
with more than 60 particles (Mvir > 1.4 × 1010h−1M�).
This leads to a different dynamic range in progenitor-to-
descendant mass ratio χ for the low-mass (χ & 0.04) and
high-mass bin (χ & 6× 10−5). To the extent that accretion
rates are self-similar with mass (Fillmore & Goldreich 1984;
Bertschinger 1985), this would lead to accretion by ‘mergers’
being systematically enhanced in high-mass haloes simply
because relatively low-mass objects are counted as progen-
itors as compared to the low-mass bin. Provided accretion
rates are accurately estimated without double-counting due
to (artificial) fragmentation, however, the contribution to
genuine mergers from very low mass ratios (say χ < 10−2)
should be small (Genel et al. 2010). consistent-trees im-
proves the consistency of progenitor/descendant assignment
across time steps by solving differential equations for the
expected locations of potential descendants (Behroozi et al.
2013b), so that effects of artificial fragmentation are reduced.
Also, since we define accretion rates over 2Tdyn, any residual
effects of instantaneous fragmentation should typically be
averaged over. Moreover, environmental trends have been
found to be relatively insensitive to whether progenitors are
defined using a fixed minimum particle count or minimum
χ (Fakhouri & Ma 2010). We therefore proceed with our
analysis using a fixed threshold of 60 particles on progenitor
mass and comment below on analyses using other choices."
9 We have repeated our main analysis for accretion rates calcu-
"lated over 1 dynamical time and find qualitatively similar but
noisier results. We therefore focus on results using accretion rates"
over 2 dynamical times.

"We follow Fakhouri & Ma (2010) and divide the mass
accreted by a halo into two parts: (i) via other resolved haloes
as mergers and (ii) in the form of diffuse mass, which includes
bound structures below the chosen mass resolution, actually
unbound particles which may have been tidally stripped from
other objects, or genuinely diffuse mass which has never been
part of a bound structure earlier. In practice, we calculate
the mass accreted in a given time interval zi > z > zf due to
mergers as the total mass of all progenitors except the main
progenitor. Correspondingly, diffuse mass accreted in the
same time interval is the difference between the descendant
halo’s mass and the total mass of all the progenitors. Finally,
the total mass accreted in this time interval is the sum of
the masses accreted via mergers and diffuse accretion, i.e.,
the difference between the descendant halo’s mass and the
mass of the main progenitor. Symbolically, if we define"
"M0 : virial mass of descendant halo at z = zf ,
Mj : virial mass of the j"
"th progenitor halo at z = zi,
M1 : virial mass of the main progenitor at z = zi,"
"then the dimensionless specific accretion rates Γmer (merger),
Γdif (diffuse) and Γtot (total) – where Γ ∼ d lnM/d ln a (e.g.,
Diemer & Kravtsov 2014) – can be written as"
Γmer ≡

"Γtot ≡
(M0 −M1)
M0(zi − zf)"
× (1 + zf) . (3)
"We have chosen a convention such that positive values of the
rates correspond to increase in mass from zi to zf ."
"Using the progenitors selected as above, we computed
Γmer, Γdif and Γtot within the previous 2 dynamical times
at seven redshifts z = 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 for
the CDM and WDM simulations.10 These rates are found
to show distributions similar to those shown in Fakhouri
& Ma (2010). Figure 2 shows the normalised probability
distributions for Γdif (left panel) and Γmer (right panel) for
z = 0 haloes in the low-mass (blue) and high-mass (red) bin,
for CDM (dashed lines) and WDM (solid lines). Arrows in
the left panel (with identical colour-coding and line styles)
indicate the corresponding median values of Γdif . These"
"10 As a check, we also explicitly calculated Γtot over 100 My,
finding that these are within ∼ 10% of the values reported by
consistent-trees. The differences are likely due to different"
"choices of progenitor mass resolution between our values and the
default settings of consistent-trees, and are not expected to"
alter our conclusions qualitatively.

Mass accretion rates and environment 5
"Figure 2. Accretion rate distributions: Histograms in the left (right) panel show the distributions of the specific mass accretion
rates Γdif (Γmer) due to diffuse mass (mergers) at z = 0 (see equations 3). Dashed (solid) lines show results for CDM (WDM) haloes,"
"with the red (blue) curves showing results for the high-mass (low-mass) bin. The legend in the left panel indicates the number of haloes
that contributed to each mass bin, while the arrows mark the median values of Γdif for the respective distributions. Highlights: Low-mass"
WDM haloes have the highest Γdif and lowest Γmer values on average.
"arrows show that the median Γdif is the highest for WDM
low-mass haloes. For the high-mass bin, CDM and WDM
haloes show very similar distributions of the two accretion
rates. Γmer is always positive except if there were no recent
mergers, in which case Γmer = 0 exactly. Γdif can be negative
if the total mass of progenitors is more than the mass of the
descendant halo, which can happen due to tidal stripping; this
is evidently a significant effect only for low-mass CDM haloes.
Below, we will investigate in detail the redshift evolution and
environmental trends of both Γdif and Γmer."
"As mentioned earlier, the dominant presence of spuri-
ous objects in the WDM simulation at low redshifts and
masses . 1010.4h−1M� affects the measurement of WDM
accretion rates. In particular, Γmer is overestimated and Γdif
correspondingly underestimated due to the fact that mass
is locked up in spuriously identified objects. However, the
amount of mass in these low-mass spurious objects is not
dramatically large. By integrating the measured and power-
law-corrected (see section 2.2) mass functions, weighted by
mass, over the range 60mp ≤ Mvir ≤ 500mp, we find that
the contribution of spurious objects in this range is ' 40%
by mass at z = 0 and falls to . 4% by z = 1.5. Moreover, we
will see below that accretion due to mergers is subdominant
in WDM in any case. We therefore tentatively conclude that,
although the WDM merger accretion rates are likely to be
systematically overestimated due to the presence of spuri-
ous objects, accounting for this spurious contribution is not
expected to alter any of our qualitative conclusions."
"To assess the effects of the potential caveats discussed
above, namely, the effect of a fixed particle threshold versus a
threshold in mass ratio for defining progenitors, and the effect
of spurious WDM haloes, we have repeated our entire analysis
using two different selection criteria. In the first modification,
we replaced the fixed cut of > 60 particles per progenitor with
a lower threshold of > 30 particles, which should emphasize
the effects of spurious WDM haloes. In the second, we used"
"the 60 particle threshold for progenitors of the low-mass
descendants, but a threshold of Mvir > 4.84 × 1011h−1M�
for progenitors of high-mass descendants. This corresponds to
χ ' 0.08 with respect to the median descendant mass in the
high-mass bin, which is the same as the ratio between the 60
particle threshold and the median mass of the low-mass bin,
and should emphasize any differences between environmental
trends due to the different progenitor selection. We find that
all our qualitative results remain unchanged in each case,
with only a few minor differences which we comment on later.
This indicates that (a) the environmental trends we study
are indeed insensitive to the choice of progenitor threshold
mass and (b) spurious haloes in WDM do not affect the
inference of the trends. All our results below will be quoted
for the (more conservative) fixed threshold of > 60 particles
per progenitor for each mass bin."
2.4 Quantifying local halo environment
"We quantify the local environment of haloes using scalars
constructed from the smoothed halo-centric tidal tensor
Tij(x) = ∂i∂jΨR(x), where the Newtonian potential ΨR
satisfies the normalised Poisson equation ∇2ΨR = δR with
δR being the halo-centric dark matter overdensity Gaussian-
smoothed on comoving scale R. In practice, for any smooth-
ing scale R, we invert the Poisson equation in Fourier space
using cloud-in-cell (CIC) interpolation for the unsmoothed
density on a 5123 grid. Namely, we Fourier transform the
CIC overdensity to obtain δ(k), using which the tidal tensor"
"is the inverse Fourier transform of (kikj/k
2)δ(k)e−k"
"2R2/2.
As the two scalars of choice, we use the overdensity δR"

"we first evaluate the tidal tensor on the grid for a fixed set
of smoothing scales and then interpolate to the adaptive
scale and spatial position corresponding to each halo.) This
adaptive filtering choice maximises the correlation between
the local halo tidal environment and large-scale halo bias,
useful for studies of assembly bias. Hereafter, for brevity we
will write α ≡ αR and δ ≡ δR."
"A common approach to classifying cosmic web environ-
ment is by counting the signs of the eigenvalues of the tidal
tensor or density Hessian defined at some fixed smoothing
scale; with the tidal tensor we would have (e.g., Hahn et al.
2007) λ1 > 0 : node, λ1 < 0 and λ2 > 0 : filament, λ2 < 0
and λ3 > 0 : sheet, λ3 < 0 : void. The use of α and δ
provides an alternative, continuous definition of halo envi-
ronment adapted to the halo size. These variables, although
correlated, are not completely degenerate (Ramakrishnan
et al. 2019, see also below). Such a continuous measure of
environment is much better suited for studies of large-scale
environmental correlations or assembly bias (Paranjape et al.
2018; Ramakrishnan et al. 2019) as well as environmental
trends in galaxy evolution (Zjupa et al. 2020)."
"Physically, small values of the adaptively defined α cor-
respond to isotropic environments (nodes), while large values
correspond to very anisotropic environments (filaments). As
discussed by Paranjape et al. (2018) and Paranjape (2020),
the value α = 0.5 forms a rather sharp threshold separating"
"haloes in node-like and filament-like environments. We have
checked that this is true at all the redshifts we study in this
work."
"Figure 3 shows the distribution of α at four redshifts
for CDM (dashed) and WDM (solid) haloes in the low-mass
(left panel) and high-mass bin (right panel). The distribution
of α at fixed redshift depends on halo mass, with massive
haloes having preferentially lower values of α and low-mass
haloes spanning a wide range of α. Haloes at higher redshifts
also have preferentially lower values (as well as narrower
distributions) of α, which is possibly mainly a consequence
of mass resolution (since haloes at fixed mass are rarer in
the past), but might also be partially reflecting a genuine
evolution of the local cosmic web environment of haloes.
Figure 4 is formatted identically to figure 3 and shows the
corresponding distributions of δ. At fixed redshift, we see
that the distributions for low-mass haloes have wider tails
than for high-mass haloes, at both low and high density. At
fixed mass, high-redshift haloes span substantially narrower
ranges of δ than those at lower redshift. For both α and δ, the
results for WDM and CDM at each redshift are very similar
to each other for high-mass haloes, while the distributions
for low-mass WDM haloes are narrower than their CDM
counterparts (with the median δ also being systematically
higher for WDM). This extends the results of Paranjape et al.
(2018), who studied CDM haloes at z = 0, to significantly
higher redshift as well as WDM cosmologies."
2.5 Large-scale environment: halo bias
"As an indicator of the large-scale halo environment, we es-
timate the linear bias b1 for each halo using the technique
outlined by Paranjape et al. (2018) and Paranjape & Alam
(2020). This is essentially an object-by-object version of the
usual cross-correlation definition of bias in Fourier space
– Phm(k)/Pmm(k) – averaged over low-k modes using the
weights discussed by Paranjape & Alam (2020), where Phm"

values."
"and Pmm are the halo-matter cross power spectrum and
matter auto-power spectrum, respectively."
"The box size of 150h−1Mpc leads to small-volume sys-
tematic effects in the absolute value of b1 measured for each
object, due to missing long-wavelength modes. Here, however,
we are only interested in the correlation between b1 and other
halo properties like accretion rates and halo environment.
As demonstrated by Ramakrishnan et al. (2019), these cor-
relations are relatively insensitive to volume effects and we
therefore expect our results to be robust to such systematics."
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
"We now turn to our main results, starting with the
environment-independent evolution of mass accretion, fol-
lowed by trends with local environment and finally assembly
bias."
3.1 Mass accretion: mergers vs. diffuse accretion
"Figure 5 shows the evolving fraction fnomerge of haloes which
do not accrete any mass through mergers in the last 2 dy-
namical times (i.e., haloes without any secondary progenitor
larger than the 60 particle threshold, having Γmer = 0), for
CDM and WDM. High-mass CDM haloes essentially always
had mergers, except at very low redshifts where a small
fraction have evolved with Γmer = 0. At fixed mass, the
value of fnomerge is always larger in WDM than in CDM.
This can be easily understood as being due to the lack of
small-scale structure and hence fewer low-mass bound struc-
tures in WDM. In fact, we see that haloes in the low-mass
WDM bin accrete mainly diffuse mass at all redshifts, with
fnomerge & 0.9 at all z. This is consistent with corresponding
results from Elahi et al. (2014)."

Γmer (left and middle panels, respectively) with the total
accretion rate Γtot shown in the right panel. Error bars on the
measurements were calculated by bootstrap sampling: at each"

"haloes accrete mainly diffuse mass at all epochs, while essentially
every high-mass CDM halo has accreted some mass through merg-
ers in the previous 2 dynamical times, except at very low redshift."
"redshift and for each mass bin, the accretion rate data are
sampled with repetition a number of times and the standard
deviation in the median values of each sample gives the value
of error. We see that WDM high-mass haloes have nearly
the same total accretion rate as CDM high-mass haloes, at
all epochs (consistent with the earlier results by Knebe et al.
2002; Benson et al. 2013). WDM low-mass haloes, on the
other hand, have higher total accretion rates than, both,"

"high-mass bin, although Γtot is nearly identical between CDM and WDM, the relative contribution to this total from mergers versus
diffuse accretion is higher in CDM than in WDM."
"CDM low-mass haloes and also WDM (and CDM) high-mass
haloes."
"Upon splitting the accretion rate between mergers and
diffuse accretion, we see that diffuse accretion dominates the
accretion budget at all redshifts, in each mass bin for both
CDM and WDM. Comparing low-mass and high-mass results
for diffuse accretion, in CDM we see that low-mass haloes
have lower Γdif than high-mass haloes, while the opposite is
true for WDM (see also figure 2). For accretion by mergers,
on the other hand, high-mass haloes have higher Γmer than
low-mass haloes in both CDM and WDM."
"And, interestingly, while the high-mass total accretion
rates in CDM and WDM are nearly identical, the relative con-
tribution to this total from mergers versus diffuse accretion
is higher in CDM than in WDM."
"These results are all consistent with an overall picture in
which the arrested growth of small-scale structure in WDM
inhibits mass accretion through mergers, as compared to
CDM. The fact that differences between WDM and CDM
accretion rates are dramatic at low masses is not surprising,
considering that our low-mass bin is at slightly smaller mass
than the half-mode mass for our WDM cosmology (see sec-
tion 4 for analytical insights into this behaviour). The fact
that high-mass haloes also show differences between WDM
and CDM can be attributed to the difference in available
substructure for such haloes in the two cosmologies. In the
following sections, we explore the relation between these
accretion rates and the local environment of haloes."
"3.2 Environments of haloes accreting with and
without mergers"
"To start with, we focus on whether the environmental vari-
ables α and δ evolve differently on average for haloes that add
mass with and without mergers, in both CDM and WDM
cosmologies. Figure 7 shows the median α (left panel) and
δ (right panel) for haloes having zero and non-zero merger
rates in the low-mass (blue, cyan) and high-mass (red, or-
ange) bins. The solid (dashed) lines show results for WDM
(CDM). Error bars on the measurements were calculated"
"by bootstrap sampling at each redshift. Several interesting
trends are apparent, as we discuss next."
"Overall, we see that the tidal environments of objects at
any fixed mass are typically more anisotropic at later times,
while most local densities evolve moderately or decrease at
later times. This is broadly consistent with the growth of the
cosmic web such that a larger fraction of haloes at fixed mass
find themselves in filamentary or sheet-like environments at
late times."
"Comparing the trends for low-mass and high-mass ob-
jects, we see for CDM that high-mass objects (dashed, warm
colours) are in relatively denser and more isotropic environ-
ments than low-mass objects (dashed, cool colours), at any
redshift. This is fully consistent with the standard hierar-
chical picture in which massive haloes are more clustered
and dominate their tidal environments more than low-mass
haloes."
"In WDM, while massive haloes do live in more isotropic
environments than their low-mass counterparts (solid warm
versus solid cool in left panel), unlike CDM, now the low-
mass haloes are in denser environments than high-mass ones
(same in right panel, see also figure 4). These low-mass WDM
environments are also more overdense than the corresponding
low-mass CDM environments.11 We return to this point later."
"We focus next on the high-mass bin where one might ex-
pect similarities between CDM and WDM haloes (although
see section 3.1). Indeed, we see that haloes with mergers oc-
cupy nearly identical median density and tidal environments
at all redshifts in CDM and WDM (compare the dashed
versus solid orange curves in each panel). And, within er-
rors, this is also true for haloes without recent mergers (red
curves)."
"These high-mass environments tend to be the most
isotropic of all (c.f. figure 3) while having intermediate den-
sities, at almost any redshift. Thus, most of the differences
between high-mass CDM and WDM haloes are related to the"
11 We have also checked that the median b1 values for various
"halo categories are nearly identical between CDM and WDM, and
conform to the usual expectation of low-mass objects being less"
biased than high-mass ones.

accretion in WDM seen in figure 6."
"In the low-mass bin, the results are more nuanced, with
several differences between zero and non-zero merger envi-
ronments in CDM and WDM which can be summarized as
follows:"
"• The environments of low-mass CDM haloes with and
without mergers have similar densities at all redshifts (dashed
cyan versus dashed blue in the right panel), but are system-
atically more anisotropic at low redshift for haloes without
mergers at any redshift (same in the left panel). We discuss
this further below.
• In contrast, low-mass WDM haloes without mergers"
"(solid blue) live in systematically less dense and more isotropic
environments than those with mergers (solid cyan). This is
sensible, since isolated, isotropic environments would allow
diffuse accretion to dominate over mergers.
• Low-mass WDM haloes without mergers (solid blue) live"
"in more dense environments (with similar tidal anisotropy)
than their CDM counterparts (dashed blue). This is consis-
tent with an enhancement of diffuse accretion in WDM; the
lack of substructure in WDM compared to CDM means that
environments conducive to purely diffuse accretion (i.e., no
recent mergers) can be denser in WDM than in CDM.
• In contrast, low-mass WDM haloes with mergers (solid"
"cyan) live in substantially more dense and more anisotropic
environments than their CDM counterparts (dashed cyan).
We discuss this below."
"These low-mass results can be mostly understood keep-
ing in mind the preponderance of small objects in WDM as
compared to CDM, as well as the facts that a higher local
tidal anisotropy would typically inhibit the accretion of dif-
fuse mass (e.g., by redirecting local flows towards nodes; see
Borzyszkowski et al. 2017), while higher densities would en-
hance mergers. Some of these trends, however, deserve more"
"careful consideration. For example, the CDM haloes without
mergers are in more anisotropic environments than those
with mergers, contrary to what is suggested by the argument
above. Similarly, the higher anisotropy of low-mass WDM
haloes with mergers as compared to their CDM counterparts
is intriguing as well. On the other hand, the higher density
of low-mass WDM haloes without mergers as compared to
all other categories might be understood as being due to the
substantially decreased occurrence of mergers in the smooth
WDM cosmic web, with only the highest density environ-
ments being capable of sustaining merger events. In the next
section, we will explore in more detail the correlations be-
tween environment and mass accretion rate, which will shed
further light on the nature and origin of these trends."
"3.3 Correlation between mass accretion rates and
local halo environment"
"To quantify the dependence of mass accretion rates on envi-
ronment, in this section we study the evolving correlations
between our environmental proxies α and δ, and the mass
accretion rates due to diffuse accretion (Γdif) and mergers
(Γmer)."
"Following Ramakrishnan et al. (2019), we calculate
Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the envi-
ronmental variables and accretion rates; namely, in each
mass bin and for every redshift, we calculate the coefficients
α ↔ Γdif , δ ↔ Γdif , α ↔ Γmer, δ ↔ Γmer, as well as the
coefficient α ↔ δ for reference (which was also studied by
Ramakrishnan et al. 2019, for z = 0 CDM haloes). In order
to assess which, if any, of the two environmental proxies is
more important, we also compute conditional coefficients.
For stochastic variables a, b and c, the coefficient between a
and b, conditioned on c, is given by"
(a↔ b)|c = (a↔ b)− (a↔ c)(b↔ c) . (7)
"MNRAS 000, 1–16 (0000)"
10 Dhoke & Paranjape
"If the variables were Gaussian distributed with a joint dis-
tribution that had the structure p(a, b, c) = p(a|c)p(b|c)p(c),
then the variables a and b would be conditionally indepen-
dent and we would have (a ↔ b)|c = 0 although (a ↔ b)
need not be zero. We point the reader to Ramakrishnan et al.
(2019) for a detailed justification for constructing conditional
coefficients using equation (7) with Spearman rank coeffi-
cients, even for variables that are not Gaussian distributed,
as is the case here (see also below)."
"Figure 8 (figure 9) shows the correlation coefficients
for CDM (WDM). In each case, in the left (right) panel
we display correlations between the environment and Γdif
(Γmer) as a function of redshift."
"12 Additionally, the left panel
in each case also shows the evolving correlation (α ↔ δ).
Results for the low-mass (high-mass) bin are displayed using
cool (warm) colours. The solid curves show the primary
correlations such as (α ↔ Γmer) while the dotted curves
show conditional coefficients such as (α ↔ Γmer)|δ. Error
bars on the measurements were calculated by bootstrap
sampling at each redshift. This represents the first detailed
study in the literature, of the evolving correlation between
local environment and mass accretion rates in either CDM
or WDM cosmologies."
"We see that α and δ are always positively correlated
for both CDM and WDM, with a strength that is relatively
independent of halo mass and that only weakly depends on
redshift and dark matter type. This extends the results of
Ramakrishnan et al. (2019) (who studied CDM haloes at
z = 0) to significantly higher redshift, as well as to WDM
cosmologies. The remaining correlations, which depend only
weakly on redshift, can be summarized as follows."
• High-mass bin:
"– For both CDM and WDM, we see a strong negative
correlation (δ ↔ Γdif), and a weaker but significant positive
correlation (δ ↔ Γmer), at all redshifts (solid orange).
This is consistent with the expectation that overdense
environments enhance mergers while underdense regions
allow for more diffuse accretion (Fakhouri & Ma 2010)."
"– The corresponding primary correlations (α ↔ Γdif)
and (α ↔ Γmer) (solid red) are all negative, with mag-
nitudes comparable to those in the case of δ, for both
CDM and WDM. Interestingly, however, the conditional
coefficient (α↔ Γdif)|δ (dotted red in left panels) for both
CDM and WDM almost vanishes at all z, while the cor-
responding conditional coefficient (α↔ Γmer)|δ does not
vanish (dotted red in right panels).13 Thus, for high-mass
haloes, α and δ are equally important for accretion via
mergers, while δ almost completely explains the environ-
ment dependence of diffuse accretion."
• Low-mass bin:
"– In low-mass CDM haloes, Γmer shows almost no cor-
relation with either α or δ at any redshift, consistent with"
"12 For this correlation analysis, we only evaluate Γmer using those
haloes that had mergers in the previous 2 dynamical times, i.e.,"
"objects having Γmer 6= 0. Γdif on the other hand, is evaluated
using all haloes in the bin.
13 When using a mass threshold Mvir > 4.84× 1011h−1M� for
defining progenitors (see section 2.3), the high-mass negative (α↔
Γmer) correlation becomes weaker, and in fact slightly positive at
low redshift. This is the only qualitative difference we find between"
different progenitor definitions.
"similar weak correlations seen previously using other envi-
ronmental proxies (c.f. figure 4 of Fakhouri & Ma 2010)."
"– The situation changes in WDM: we now see positive
correlations (α ↔ Γmer) and (δ ↔ Γmer), comparable in
strength to each other and increasing at higher redshift.
Moreover, at least at low redshift, we see that the condi-
tional coefficient (δ ↔ Γmer)|α (dotted cyan) is close to
zero. In fact, this is the case within errors at all z . 1.5.
Thus, α mostly accounts for the environment dependence
of Γmer at nearly all redshifts for low-mass WDM haloes,
with Γmer being enhanced in more anisotropic tidal envi-
ronments."
"– For Γdif in low-mass CDM haloes, both (δ ↔ Γdif)
and (α↔ Γdif) are negative, with comparable magnitudes
(solid cyan and blue). Also, neither of the conditional
coefficients (α↔ Γdif)|δ and (δ ↔ Γdif)|α is close to zero
(dotted cyan and blue). Thus, both α and δ play a role for
Γdif , consistent with the expectation that diffuse accretion
should be more efficient far from crowded regions, i.e. in
underdense, isotropic environments in CDM."
"– For Γdif in low-mass WDM haloes, on the other
hand, we see a stronger (α↔ Γdif) anticorrelation (solid
blue), which almost completely explains the (δ ↔ Γdif)
(solid cyan) anticorrelation, seen as the near-vanishing of
(δ ↔ Γdif)|α (dotted cyan) at all redshifts. Thus, the envi-
ronment dependence of Γdif in low-mass haloes is related to
both α and δ for CDM and almost completely explained by
α for WDM. The dominant role played by the tidal environ-
ment for low-mass WDM haloes is consistent with previous
simulation results (Angulo et al. 2013) which indicate that
these objects form in a well-established tidal environment
which can then further affect their mass accretion."
"The nature of the environmental correlations discussed
above reveals a complex interplay between mass accretion
rates and local environment. While this is perhaps not sur-
prising, considering the intimate connection between mass
accretion in the halo outskirts and the internal structure of
haloes (e.g., Diemer & Kravtsov 2014; More et al. 2015), our
results above show several interesting aspects. In section 3.2,
for example, we saw that low-mass WDM haloes with merg-
ers live in systematically more anisotropic environments than
their CDM counterparts, a trend consistent with the correla-
tions seen above in which (α↔ Γmer) is positive for WDM
but negative for CDM. This is counter-intuitive, consider-
ing that accretion due to mergers is enhanced in overdense,
isotropic environments in CDM, and one might expect this
trend to be even more pronounced in WDM which has less
small-scale structure available in all environments. Moreover,
the small magnitude of (δ ↔ Γmer)|α for these low-mass
WDM haloes shows that α, in fact, dominates the environ-
mental trends for Γmer. This connection between mergers
and the local tidal environment of low-mass WDM haloes
deserves further study."
"Another puzzling result from section 3.2 was that the
environments of low-mass CDM haloes without mergers are
more anisotropic than of those with mergers. In this case
as well, the correlation results above do not particularly
clarify the situation, since they are consistent with Γdif being
enhanced in underdense, isotropic environments (with both
δ and α playing comparable roles) and Γmer being nearly
uncorrelated with environment. We have checked that these
trends are not restricted to the median α alone; rather, the"

bins (left panel, solid curves). (ii) Γmer correlates positively (negatively) with δ (α) in the high-mass bin (right panel, solid orange and
red), and does not correlate with either in the low-mass bin (right panel, solid cyan and blue). (iii) The conditional coefficient (Γdif ↔ α)|δ
for high-mass haloes (left panel, dotted red) almost vanishes at all z, indicating that δ almost fully explains the environment dependence
of diffuse accretion in high-mass CDM haloes."
"Figure 9. Same as figure 8, for WDM haloes. Highlights: (i) The coefficient (Γmer ↔ α) for low-mass haloes is, surprisingly, positive
(right panel, solid blue) and the corresponding conditional coefficient (Γmer ↔ δ)|α (right panel, dotted cyan) is close to zero. (ii) The
conditional coefficient (Γdif ↔ δ)|α for low-mass haloes nearly vanishes (left panel, dotted cyan), even though the primary correlation
(Γdif ↔ δ) (solid cyan) is significantly non-zero. The same is true for the conditional coefficient (Γdif ↔ α)|δ for high-mass haloes (left
panel, dotted red). Thus, α (δ) almost completely explains the environment dependence of diffuse accretion for low-mass (high-mass)"
WDM haloes.
"entire distributions of α in such haloes are shifted relative
to each other."
"As a check on systematic errors due to our use of corre-
lation coefficients and equation (7), we repeated the analysis
by measuring the median accretion rates Γdif and Γmer in
narrow bins of α and δ. The results, although noisy, are fully
consistent with the conclusions above."
3.4 Accretion rate assembly bias
"In this section, we explore the nature of the correlations
between mass accretion rate and the large-scale halo environ-
ment (characterised by halo bias b1; see section 2.5) in fixed
mass bins, also known as halo assembly bias or secondary
bias."
Previous studies have largely focused on secondary halo
"MNRAS 000, 1–16 (0000)"
12 Dhoke & Paranjape
"variables such as age, concentration, shape, angular momen-
tum and velocity dispersion structure (see the Introduction
for references). To our knowledge, the only previous work
that studied the assembly bias of mass accretion rates was
by Lazeyras et al. (2017), who focused on the total mass
accretion rates of high-mass CDM haloes at z = 0. Our
analysis below therefore substantially extends these results
in terms of halo mass, redshift range and dark matter type."
"We define the assembly bias of mass accretion as the two
correlations (b1 ↔ Γdif) and (b1 ↔ Γmer) measured using
Spearman rank correlation coefficients in different mass bins
for all redshifts. The results of Ramakrishnan et al. (2019)
indicate that, at z = 0 in CDM, the assembly bias of each
of the internal properties halo concentration, spin, shape
and velocity dispersion can be mostly attributed to two
fundamental correlations, one between b1 and α and the
other between α and the halo internal property. Considering
that there are relatively strong correlations between the mass
accretion rates Γmer, Γdif and the local environmental proxies
α and δ (see figures 8 and 9), it is interesting to ask (a) what
is the overall strength of assembly bias with mass accretion
rate in comparison to other internal halo properties, and (b)
what role, if any, do the local environmental proxies play in
explaining these trends?"
"Figure 10 (figure 11) shows the results for CDM (WDM)
haloes. As with figures 8 and 9, the left (right) panels show
results for Γdif (Γmer), with the solid (dotted) curves show-
ing primary (conditional) coefficients. Additionally, the left
(right) panels show the correlation (b1 ↔ α) ((b1 ↔ δ)) for
comparison."
"Similarly to the results for (α ↔ δ) in figures 8 and 9,
we see that the correlations (b1 ↔ α) and (b1 ↔ δ) are
significantly positive, very similar across halo mass as well as
between CDM and WDM, and evolve moderately between
z = 2 and z = 0. The (b1 ↔ α) correlation at any redshift is
∼ 50% larger than the corresponding (b1 ↔ δ) correlation, for
both CDM and WDM. This extends the z = 0 CDM results
of Paranjape et al. (2018) and Ramakrishnan et al. (2019)
to significantly higher redshifts and to WDM cosmologies."
"In the high-mass bin, the correlations (b1 ↔ Γdif) and
(b1 ↔ Γmer) are relatively weak at nearly all redshifts for both
CDM and WDM. The exception is at the highest redshift
z = 2 for WDM, where (b1 ↔ Γdif) is negative while (b1 ↔
Γmer) is positive, but with large errors. Overall, therefore,
we conclude that high-mass objects in CDM and WDM do
not show significant assembly bias for either mass accretion
rate."
"In the low-mass bin, we see more interesting results.
Although the (b1 ↔ Γmer) correlation is essentially zero
across all redshifts for both CDM and WDM, the same
is not true for the (b1 ↔ Γdif) correlation, which remains
significantly negative at nearly all redshifts, in both CDM
and WDM. In fact, the strength of the correlation at z =
0, namely |(b1 ↔ Γdif)| & 0.05 (0.1) for CDM (WDM), is
amongst the strongest seen for any secondary variable at
this halo mass (see, e.g., the middle panel of figure 2 in
Ramakrishnan et al. 2019). The magnitude of the correlation
is nearly constant with redshift for CDM while showing an
increasing trend with time for WDM. Thus, the assembly bias
of low-mass accretion rates, especially at low redshift, is a
comparatively large effect, entirely driven by diffuse accretion."
"More interestingly, the conditional coefficient (b1 ↔
Γdif)|α for low-mass haloes is close to zero at all redshifts,
for both CDM and WDM. (For CDM, the coefficient (b1 ↔"
"Γdif)|δ also has a small magnitude, but is not as close to zero
as (b1 ↔ Γdif)|α.)"
"Thus, the local tidal anisotropy plays a key role in ex-
plaining the accretion rate assembly bias of both CDM and
WDM haloes, with local overdensity also playing a significant
role in CDM. These findings are consistent with previous re-
sults in the literature (e.g., Dalal et al. 2008; Hahn et al. 2009;
Borzyszkowski et al. 2017) which show that low-mass haloes
which are in the vicinity of massive haloes, and are hence
highly clustered at large-scales while residing in anisotropic
local tidal environments, show suppressed (diffuse) accretion
rates."
4 ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS
"In this section, we discuss the numerical results presented
above in the language of the excursion set approach (Bond
et al. 1991; Lacey & Cole 1993, 1994; Bond & Myers 1996).
Below, we briefly recapitulate the basic concepts underlying
the excursion set approach and its modern variants, before
discussing our results in this context."
4.1 Recap of the excursion set (peaks) approach
"In the excursion set framework, halo abundances, large-scale
clustering and accretion rates are estimated by identifying
and counting likely locations of virialisation identified in
the initial stochastic density field (linearly extrapolated to
present epoch). A key ingredient in the traditional excursion
set approach is a choice of collapse threshold or ‘barrier’
B which must be crossed by random walks in the linearly
extrapolated density field δR as a function of Lagrangian
smoothing scale R. The barrier B is usually adopted from
spherical (Gunn & Gott 1972) or ellipsoidal (Sheth et al.
2001) collapse models, and depends on the redshift z of
interest and possibly additional stochastic variables (such
as those related to tidal effects in the ellipsoidal model, see
Castorina et al. 2016)."
"The statistical properties of the random walks, on the
other hand, are determined by the choice of initial matter
power spectrum and a smoothing filter, which fixes the func-
tional relation σ2(m) where σ2 is the variance of the linearly
extrapolated density contrast smoothed on a Lagrangian
scale corresponding to mass m ∼ R3. If a random walk
first upcrosses the barrier B(z) at scale R(m) (starting from
R→∞ or σ2 → 0), then a halo of mass m is declared to form
at redshift z. While early work on the subject focused on a
filter that is sharp in Fourier space (for reasons of analytical
simplicity), later developments have shown how to efficiently
analyze the effects of more realistic filters that are compact
in real space and lead to random walks with correlated steps
as R is varied (Musso & Sheth 2012; see also Bond et al. 1991;
Zentner 2007; Paranjape et al. 2012). Finally, the recognition
that the sites of virialisation are special (Sheth et al. 2001) –
e.g., peaks in the linearly extrapolated density field (Bardeen
et al. 1986) – leads to an ‘excursion set peaks’ approach
(ESP, Paranjape & Sheth 2012; Appel & Jones 1990) which
has been shown to agree with simulated halo mass functions
and large-scale clustering in CDM cosmologies at the ∼ 10%
level (Paranjape et al. 2013; Castorina et al. 2016)."
"The ESP framework has also been studied in the context
of WDM cosmologies by Hahn & Paranjape (2014, hereon,"
"MNRAS 000, 1–16 (0000)"

"HP14), who demonstrated that the suppression of small-
scale power in these models is an excellent diagnostic tool for
testing the assumptions underlying the excursion set (peaks)
approach. In particular, HP14 argued that a single-barrier
framework is insufficient to properly explain halo abundances
due to small but systematic errors in the ellipsoidal collapse
model (Monaco 1999; Giocoli et al. 2007; Ludlow et al. 2014),
which become dramatically amplified in WDM models as
compared to CDM. Here, however, we are interested in the
prediction (Lacey & Cole 1993, 1994) that mass accretion
rates are intimately connected with the slope of the initial
power spectrum near the scales of interest, with steeper"
"spectra leading to higher accretion rates. The consequences
of the latter effect for WDM can be understood without
delving into the details of any specific excursion set model
and only depend on the correlated nature of the random
walks, as we discuss next."
4.2 Accretion rates in the ESP framework
"In the following, in addition to the barrier B for linearly
extrapolated density fluctuations and the σ(m) relation men-
tioned above, we will need two more quantities from the
excursion set lexicon. The first is the proto-halo ‘significance’"
"MNRAS 000, 1–16 (0000)"
14 Dhoke & Paranjape
"ν(m, z) = δc(z)/σ(m), where δc(z) ∝ 1/D(z) is the collapse
threshold from the spherical model, with D(z) being the lin-
ear theory growth factor. The second is the typical peak curva-
ture 〈x|ν 〉 at scale ν(m, z), where x = −∇2δR/"
"√
Var(∇2δR)"
"(see figure 6 of Bardeen et al. 1986).
As mentioned above, accretion rates in CDM and WDM"
"are expected to be very different due to the comparative
steepness of the initial matter power spectrum in WDM
around the half-mode mass scale. To see what this implies,
we must mainly keep in mind that the σ(m) relation becomes
‘stretched out’ for a truncated power spectrum such as WDM,
with σ(m) → a constant below the half-mode mass (see,
e.g., figure 2 of HP14). In CDM, on the other hand, σ(m)
continues to increase down to very small masses. A simple
calculation now shows that the diffuse mass accretion rate
can be written as (e.g., Lazeyras et al. 2017)"
"Γ =
d lnM"
"d ln a
="
dB/d ln a
d lnσ/d lnM
"〈x|ν 〉
|dB/d ln a|
|d lnσ/d lnM |"
"where the first line is a manipulation of variables and the
second line relates the slope at barrier crossing, dB/dσ, to
the peak curvature 〈x|ν 〉 (Musso & Sheth 2012; Paranjape
& Sheth 2012), with γ being a spectral variable of order
unity in both CDM and WDM (γ ' 0.5 for our cosmology)."
"At high masses, for both CDM and WDM, 〈x|ν 〉 is large,
σ is small and |d lnσ/d lnM | is finite. At masses smaller than
the half-mode mass for WDM, 〈x|ν 〉 is smaller than at high
masses, σ is constant and |d lnσ/d lnM | approaches zero.
This last feature makes the accretion rates very high. At
low masses for CDM, on the other hand, 〈x|ν 〉 is similar to
that in WDM, σ is significantly larger than at high masses
and |d lnσ/d lnM | is finite, so that low-mass CDM accretion
rates remain small. This qualitatively explains the overall
trends seen in the right panel of figure 6."
"Quantitatively, in our high-mass bin at z = 0, for
both CDM and WDM we have σ . 1.5, 〈x|ν 〉 & 3 and
|d lnσ/d lnM | . 0.2. Assuming that the time dependence
of the barrier is completely determined by δc(z), we also
have |dB/d ln a| ∼ 1 at z = 0. Equation (8) then predicts
high-mass accretion rates of Γ ∼ 0.5 at z = 0. In the low-
mass bin, for CDM, we have σ ∼ 2.5, 〈x|ν 〉 ∼ 2.5 and
|d lnσ/d lnM | . 0.15. For WDM, on the other hand, while
σ and 〈x|ν 〉 are not very different from CDM for our cosmol-
ogy and choice of mass bin, we have |d lnσ/d lnM | . 0.075,
a factor 2 smaller than in CDM. Thus low-mass accretion
rates at z = 0 are predicted to be about a factor 2 higher
for our WDM low-mass bin than the corresponding CDM
values, which agrees with the trend seen in the right panel
of figure 6. The values predicted, Γ ∼ 0.5 (1.0) for CDM
(WDM), are higher than the measured ones, which is per-
haps not surprising considering the approximate nature of
our calculation.14"
"The discussion of environmental trends for mass ac-
cretion rates requires a prediction of the cross-correlation
between the slopes of random walks at barrier crossing and"
14 We have also ignored the issue of mass reassignment discussed
"by HP14, in which the σ(m) relation must effectively be modified
for collapsed objects, with the effect becoming more prominent in"
WDM at scales substantially smaller than the half-mode mass.
"the values attained by these walks at larger smoothing scales.
This is conceptually easiest for the density environment,
which is the natural variable used in excursion set calcula-
tions. Lazeyras et al. (2017) have applied such arguments to
show that an overall assembly bias trend, in which slowly
accreting haloes are strongly clustered as compared to rapid
accretors, i.e. a negative correlation (b1 ↔ Γ), is a natu-
ral prediction of the excursion set peaks framework. The
distinction between diffuse accretion and that via mergers,
on the other hand, requires a higher level of sophistication
in the simultaneous prediction of continuous and discrete
accretion rates, an aspect which excursion set models have
only recently begun to explore (Musso & Sheth 2014). And
the trends we have noted with tidal anisotropy α, especially
the result that α largely explains low-mass assembly bias
trends with mass accretion, are currently not predictable
by any excursion set (peaks) model that we are aware of
(although see Castorina et al. 2016, for some initial steps in
this direction). We therefore defer a discussion of analytical
predictions for the environment dependence of mass accre-
tion to future work, where we hope to develop a versatile
excursion set framework that can address these issues."
5 SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONS
"We have investigated the evolving correlations between mass
accretion rates and environment in N -body simulations of
CDM and WDM cosmologies. The latter are characterised
by a strong suppression of small-scale power (we deliberately
chose a somewhat extreme case with mdm = 0.4 keV), which
creates dramatic differences in the nature of mass accretion
between haloes smaller and larger than the half-mode mass
scale."
"While accretion rates in WDM models have been com-
pared with their CDM counterparts previously in the liter-
ature (Knebe et al. 2002; Benson et al. 2013; Elahi et al.
2014; Khimey et al. 2020), and environmental trends of
CDM accretion rates have also been studied before (see the
Introduction), our analysis represents the first systematic
comparison of environmental trends of accretion rates be-
tween CDM and WDM haloes, at masses above and below
the WDM half-mode mass, using multiple proxies for the
local as well as large-scale environment, and over a wide
range of redshift 2 ≥ z ≥ 0."
"Most of our results (section 3) regarding the evolving
nature and environment dependence of specific accretion
rates due to mergers (Γmer) and diffuse mass (Γdif ; see equa-
tions 3) can be understood in terms of the lack of small-scale
structure below the half-mode mass scale in WDM, which
affects not only the low-mass haloes but also the accretion
histories of massive objects. We summarize these below and
also highlight a few puzzling findings that deserve further
study."
Environment-independent trends:
"• Specific accretion rates of low-mass CDM haloes are
lower than those of high-mass CDM haloes, while low-mass
WDM haloes have higher accretion rates than their high-mass
counterparts (figure 6). This is a straightforward prediction of
the excursion set approach with correlated steps (section 4).
• Mass accretion in WDM haloes is dominated by Γdif ,"
"consistent with previous work (Benson et al. 2013; Elahi et al.
2014). Γdif (Γmer) in WDM haloes is also higher (lower) than"
"MNRAS 000, 1–16 (0000)"
Mass accretion rates and environment 15
"that in CDM haloes of the same mass, as expected from the
lack of small-scale bound structures in WDM."
Trends with local environment:
"• The evolving median local density and tidal anisotropy
of haloes with and without mergers (figure 7) are also largely
consistent with expectations based on the lack of small-
scale structure in WDM. The only exceptions, which deserve
further study, are"
"– the environments of low-mass WDM haloes are denser
than those of all other categories, and"
"– the environments of low-mass CDM haloes without
mergers are more anisotropic than of those with mergers."
"• The correlations between environment and accretion
rates in figures 8 and 9 add further detail to these results.
For both CDM and WDM, at all redshifts in the high-mass
bin,"
"– there is a strong negative correlation between δ and
Γdif , a weaker positive correlation between δ and Γmer,
and comparable negative correlations between α and both
Γdif and Γmer,"
"– while α and δ are equally important for Γmer, δ almost
completely explains the environment dependence of Γdif ."
"• In the low-mass bin at all z, for CDM haloes, α and δ are
equally important in explaining the environment dependence
of Γdif and show no correlation with Γmer. In WDM, on the
other hand, the environment dependence of both Γmer and
Γdif is almost fully explained by α. In fact, the correlation
(α↔ Γmer) is positive, which is counter-intuitive and deserves
further study."
"In summary, at all z, the local tidal anisotropy α plays a
completely dominant role for both Γmer and Γdif in low-mass
WDM haloes, and a bigger role than the local density δ for
Γmer in high-mass haloes in both CDM and WDM. In contrast,
δ plays the dominant role for Γdif in high-mass CDM haloes.
In the other cases, δ and α play equally important roles."
Assembly bias:
"We defined assembly bias using the Spearman rank correla-
tion coefficients (b1 ↔ Γdif) and (b1 ↔ Γmer) in each mass
bin (c.f., Ramakrishnan et al. 2019). We find that the fol-
lowing holds for both CDM and WDM haloes (figures 10
and 11):"
"• (b1 ↔ α) is always higher than (b1 ↔ δ) at any z. This
extends the z = 0 CDM results of Paranjape et al. (2018) and
Ramakrishnan et al. (2019) to higher redshifts and WDM
cosmologies.
• We detect assembly bias in the low-mass bin, driven"
"entirely by Γdif , with a strength (b1 ↔ Γdif) at z = 0 that is
the highest of nearly all known secondary variables for CDM
and is higher in WDM than in CDM (solid blue curves in the
left panels of figures 10 and 11, compare the middle panel of
figure 2 in Ramakrishnan et al. 2019). In the high-mass bin,
there is no significant assembly bias at any but the highest
redshifts we study.
• The tidal anisotropy α plays a dominant role in ex-"
"plaining the low-mass assembly bias, especially for WDM
haloes."
"Our results place important constraints on (semi-) an-
alytical excursion set models of halo formation and growth"
"and, by extension, on galaxy evolution models built upon
such approximate techniques (see the Introduction for refer-
ences). As argued by HP14, any such model which purports
to explain environmental trends of evolving haloes must logi-
cally work equally well for CDM and WDM, since the physics
of collisionless self-gravitating systems is common to both.
As we have seen, however, the suppression of small-scale
power in WDM leads to an intricate dependence of the mass
accretion on local (and large-scale) halo environment, partic-
ularly at masses smaller than the WDM half-mode mass. As
with the mass function at these scales discussed by HP14,
producing an accurate model of mass accretion with the
correct environment dependence is likely to reveal interesting
features of collisionless dynamics in the shell-crossed regime.
It will be very interesting to confront our results above with
excursion set models of mergers and mass accretion (Lacey
& Cole 1994; Mitra et al. 2011; Musso & Sheth 2014), as well
as excursion set-inspired semi-analytical algorithms tuned to
reproduce CDM results (Somerville & Kolatt 1999; Parkin-
son et al. 2008; Jiang & van den Bosch 2014). We leave this
to future work."
