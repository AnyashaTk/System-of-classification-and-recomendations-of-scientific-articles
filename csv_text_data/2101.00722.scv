"ABSTRACT
The physical foundations of the dissipation of energy and the associated heating in weakly collisional plasmas are poorly
understood. Here, we compare and contrast several measures that have been used to characterize energy dissipation and kinetic-
scale conversion in plasmas by means of a suite of kinetic numerical simulations describing both magnetic reconnection and
decaying plasma turbulence. We adopt three different numerical codes that can also include interparticle collisions: the fully
kinetic particle-in-cell vpic, the fully kinetic continuum Gkeyll, and the Eulerian Hybrid Vlasov–Maxwell (HVM) code. We
differentiate between (i) four energy-based parameters, whose definition is related to energy transfer in a fluid description of a
plasma, and (ii) four distribution function-based parameters, requiring knowledge of the particle velocity distribution function.
There is an overall agreement between the dissipation measures obtained in the PIC and continuum reconnection simulations,
with slight differences due to the presence/absence of secondary islands in the two simulations. There are also many qualitative
similarities between the signatures in the reconnection simulations and the self-consistent current sheets that form in turbulence,
although the latter exhibits significant variations compared to the reconnection results. All the parameters confirm that dissipation
occurs close to regions of intense magnetic stresses, thus exhibiting local correlation. The distribution function-based measures
show a broader width compared to energy-based proxies, suggesting that energy transfer is co-localized at coherent structures,
but can affect the particle distribution function in wider regions. The effect of interparticle collisions on these parameters is
finally discussed."

1 INTRODUCTION
"Understanding energy dissipation and heating in weakly collisional
plasmas is a key challenge in the study of space and astrophysical
plasmas, such as the solar corona, solar wind, the outer magneto-
spheres of planets, and compact astrophysical objects. At variance
with neutral fluids and collisional plasmas (e.g. magnetofluids), in-
terparticle collisions are typically weak in these systems and are of-
ten neglected. One example is during magnetic reconnection, where
magnetic fields with a reversing component effectively break and
cross-connect at length-scales at and below the gyroradius of the"

"particles (kinetic scales), allowing the conversion of magnetic en-
ergy to kinetic, thermal, and non-thermal energy (Yamada et al.
2010). Another example is that weakly collisional plasmas are often
observed to be in a strongly turbulent state (Federrath et al. 2010;
Bruno & Carbone 2016; Narita 2018; Beresnyak 2019; Fraternale
et al. 2019). Hence, they are characterized by the cross-scale transfer
of fluctuation energy from large injection scales to smaller, kinetic
scales, where energy dissipation is expected to occur (Schekochihin
et al. 2009; Howes 2015b; Matthaeus et al. 2015; Vaivads et al. 2016;
Verscharen et al. 2019). These features have, at least, two profound
implications."

"collisional systems for which the proximity to local thermal equilib-
rium restricts velocity distribution functions to be near-Maxwellians
due to efficient collisional thermalization. Indeed, VDFs in weakly
collisional plasmas frequently display non-equilibrium features, such
as temperature anisotropy and agyrotropy, rings, beams of acceler-
ated particles, etc. (Marsch 2006; Servidio et al. 2012, 2015; Lapenta
et al. 2017; Perri et al. 2020). In turbulence, this interesting dynamics
has been envisioned as a phase-space cascade (Tatsuno et al. 2009;
Plunk & Tatsuno 2011; Kanekar et al. 2015; Parker et al. 2016;
Schekochihin et al. 2016; Servidio et al. 2017), where the plasma
exhibits a power-law scaling –typical of turbulence– in both phys-
ical and velocity space. In this perspective, by expanding particle
VDFs in velocity space using Hermite polynomials, a power-law
Hermite spectrum was recently observed, reflecting the presence of
fine velocity-space structures, in both in situ observations (Servidio
et al. 2017) and numerical simulations (Cerri et al. 2018; Pezzi et al.
2018). This clearly illustrates the necessity of using kinetic models
to describe such plasmas. Moreover, non-Maxwellian structures in
particle VDFs are observed to be significant in the vicinity of intense
current sheets or other nearby coherent structures such as vortices,
where MHD-like dissipation is thought to occur (Osman et al. 2011;
Servidio et al. 2012; Matthaeus et al. 2015; Parashar & Matthaeus
2016).
Secondly, concepts about energy dissipation and conversion in"
"neutral fluids and magnetofluids do not necessarily carry over to
weakly collisional systems. The rate and parametric dependence of
dissipation and kinetic-scale energy conversion for such plasmas is
extremely challenging and is not thoroughly understood. One chal-
lenge is that various physical mechanisms and processes can cause
dissipation and kinetic scale energy conversion in various physi-
cal circumstances. In weakly collisional plasmas in which kinetic
effects play a crucial role in the dynamics, such as during turbu-
lence and reconnection, it may be difficult to assess quantitatively
the relative importance of the various dissipative mechanisms, and
likewise the net effect of a given dynamical process may be unclear
due to reversibility. To address these issues different mechanisms and
concepts of dissipation have been proposed and, hence, several dis-
sipation surrogates have been adopted (see e.g. Vaivads et al. 2016;
Matthaeus et al. 2020, for recent reviews). However, a unified and
general picture of when and where different views work better is still
lacking.
Another important question is the following: do the sites identified"
"potential sites of dissipation correspond to regions where interpar-
ticle collisions, although weak, dissipate energy in an irreversible
way? Addressing this question has encouraged the examination of
a different concept of dissipation associated with the growth of en-
tropy due to collisions (TenBarge et al. 2013; Navarro et al. 2016;
Pezzi et al. 2019c; Liang et al. 2019). Although collisions typically
act on large characteristic times (Spitzer Jr. 1956; Vafin et al. 2019),
their effects are enhanced where particle VDFs exhibit strong dis-
tortions, since intense velocity-space gradients are dissipated very
quickly by collisions (Landau 1936; Rosenbluth et al. 1957; Balescu
1960; Schekochihin et al. 2009; Pezzi et al. 2016; Pezzi 2017). Non-
Maxwellian VDFs make intraspecies collision operators non-zero,
thus activating this dissipation channel.
In the following, we classify eight different dissipation proxies into"
"two general classes that we call “energy-based” and “VDF-based”.
The energy-based definition describes dissipation as a transfer of
energy within a fluid-like description. Often such transfer occurs
from an ordered component (e.g. magnetic or bulk flow fluctuations)
into a random (e.g., internal) component. On the other hand, VDF-
based surrogates directly quantify the presence of non-equilibrium"
"features in the particle VDF. The two classes of dissipation proxies
are correlated, since the distortion of the particle VDF is often the
consequence of a transfer of energy and vice versa. The dissipation
proxies here adopted do not explicitly distinguish signatures asso-
ciated with particular phenomena, e.g. Landau damping, cyclotron
damping, or stochastic processes (Chandran et al. 2010; Numata &
Loureiro 2015; Li et al. 2016; Chen et al. 2019). Future studies will
analyze the connection between these dissipation measures –useful
to detect potential sites of inhomogeneous dissipation in a turbulent
environment– and the underlying plasma processes, e.g. highlighted
through the field-particle correlation (Klein & Howes 2016; Klein
et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2019; Klein et al. 2020)."
"In this work, we investigate numerically the functionality of several
dissipation proxies belonging to the two classes introduced above.
We focus on two different types of numerical simulations: mag-
netic reconnection in a single current sheet and the development
of a turbulent cascade at kinetic scales. We exploit three different
numerical Boltzmann–Maxwell algorithms, of both Lagrangian and
Eulerian type, that can include inter-particle collisions. In partic-
ular, we adopt the fully kinetic particle-in-cell vpic code (Bowers
et al. 2008), and two Eulerian Vlasov–Maxwell codes. These latter
codes are the fully kinetic continuum Vlasov–Maxwell solver imple-
mented in the Gkeyll simulation framework (Juno et al. 2018) and
the Hybrid Vlasov–Maxwell (HVM) code with kinetic protons and
fluid electrons (Valentini et al. 2007). We find that the dissipation
measures well characterize significant features of both magnetic re-
connection and turbulence, such as the reconnection diffusion region
and the intermittent current sheets surrounding turbulent vortices.
The dissipation surrogates evaluated from the PIC and Gkeyll re-
connection simulations agree to a wide extent. Slight differences
between the two runs result from the presence of secondary islands
in the Gkeyll simulation that are not present in the PIC simulation.
A qualitative correspondence between the signatures in the recon-
nection simulations and the self-consistent current sheets generated
in turbulence is also found, despite larger variations observed in the
turbulent case with respect to the magnetic reconnection one. The
parameters show a regional correlation: their local peaks take place
in similar spatial regions, but they are not necessarily point-to-point
correlated (Yang et al. 2019; Matthaeus et al. 2020). When including
interparticle collisions, peaks of the dissipation proxies are in general
weaker than in the associated collisionless system, suggesting that the
slow yet incessant effect of collisions locally reduce the transfer of
energy and the presence of non-Maxwellian features. By considering
the effect of both intraspecies and interspecies collisions, we confirm
that the former mainly dissipate non-Maxwellian features in the par-
ticle VDF, although they may have an indirect effect also on energy
transfer through the pressure tensor isotropization (Del Sarto et al.
2016). On the other hand, the latter also significantly affect energy-
based parameters. Finally, by adopting a suite of different algorithms
and numerical codes, the current work aims at providing a further
contribution to the “turbulence dissipation challenge” (Parashar et al.
2015), on which several recent efforts have been dedicated (e.g. Pezzi
et al. 2017; Perrone et al. 2018; González et al. 2019)."

In Section 3, numerical models and algorithms adopted for the cur-
rent analysis are described. Sections 4 and 5 report numerical results

The left-hand sides of Eqs. (6)–(8) contain terms involving diver-"
"gences of fluxes. These terms can be locally important and corre-
spond physically to energy transport (Pezzi et al. 2019a). Assuming
there is no flux across the domain boundaries (e.g., with periodic
boundary conditions), they have no net effect on the global energy
partition of the system. Energy transfer between bulk flow and mag-
netic energy is described by the 𝒋 ·𝑬 term, while conversion of energy
between bulk flow and thermal occurs through the pressure–strain"
"interaction (𝑷𝛼 · ∇) · 𝒖𝛼. Including intraspecies collisional effects
(e.g. proton–proton and electron–electron) would not introduce an
extra term in Eqs. (6)–(8). However these collisions indirectly affect
these equations by thermalizing the particle VDF, thus reducing the
nongyrotropic terms in the pressure tensor and, in turn, having an
impact on the pressure-strain interaction term (Del Sarto et al. 2016).
On the other hand, interspecies collisions (electron–proton) insert an
explicit interspecies energy transfer term in the energy equations.
The first dissipation surrogate here considered is the Zenitani mea-"
"sure (Zenitani et al. 2011), widely adopted to describe dissipation in
magnetic reconnection (Zenitani et al. 2011; Phan et al. 2018) and
plasma turbulence (Wan et al. 2015). It evaluates the rate of work
per unit volume done by the electric field on particles, 𝒋 · 𝑬, in the
reference frame co-moving with the considered species, in contrast
with 𝒋 · 𝑬 in the simulation frame, which gives the total rate of en-
ergy conversion between the electromagnetic fields and the plasma.
It directly measures the non-ideal energy conversion (Zenitani et al.
2011) and is related to the production of entropy density in the MHD
framework (Birn & Hesse 2005). It reads as:"
"𝐷𝛼 = 𝒋
′ · 𝑬 ′ = 𝒋 ·"
"× 𝑩
)
− 𝜌𝑐 (𝒖𝛼 · 𝑬) , (11)"
"where 𝒋 ′ and 𝑬 ′ are the current density and the electric field in
the reference frame co-moving with the species 𝛼, respectively. As
shown in Zenitani et al. (2011), 𝑛𝑒𝐷𝑒 = 𝑛𝑝𝐷 𝑝 and, in a singly ion-
ized quasi-neutral system such as the ones considered in the present
work, 𝐷𝑒 ' 𝐷 𝑝 . 𝐷𝛼 contains both reversible and irreversible con-
tributions since the electric field 𝑬 has contributions from both re-
versible (e.g. wave–particle interactions etc.) and irreversible (e.g.
collisional resistive) processes. We note that the probability distribu-
tion function (PDF) of 𝐷𝛼 and other dissipation measures are almost
symmetric between negative and positive values (see Fig. 4 of Wan
et al. (2015)). Net dissipation, which is ultimately an integral over
space and time, arises from slight asymmetry (skewness) in the tails
of the PDF.
More recently, the pressure–strain interaction (𝑷𝛼 · ∇) · 𝒖𝛼 has"
"been analysed to understand dissipative mechanisms in weakly colli-
sional plasmas (Yang et al. 2017a,b; Yang et al. 2019; Chasapis et al.
2018a; Sitnov et al. 2018; Pezzi et al. 2019a; Matthaeus et al. 2020).
This term is commonly decomposed as"
"− (𝑷𝛼 · ∇) · 𝒖𝛼 = −𝑃𝛼\𝛼 −𝚷𝛼 :D𝛼 , (12)
where 𝑃𝛼,𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑃𝛼𝛿𝑖 𝑗 + Π𝛼,𝑖 𝑗 ; 𝑃𝛼 = 𝑃𝛼,𝑖𝑖/3; \𝛼 = ∇ · 𝒖𝛼;
D𝛼,𝑖 𝑗 ="
"(
𝜕 𝑗𝑢𝛼,𝑖 + 𝜕𝑖𝑢𝛼, 𝑗"
")
/2 − \𝛼𝛿𝑖 𝑗/3; and 𝛿𝑖 𝑗 and 𝜕𝑖 denote"
"the Kronecker delta and a partial derivative with respect to the 𝑖–
th spatial coordinate, respectively. The first term on the right-hand
side of Eq. (12), called P-\𝛼, is associated with plasma expansion
and compression. The last term, called Pi-D𝛼, is associated with the
trace-less (anisotropic and off-diagonal) parts of the pressure tensor
and the symmetric part of the velocity strain and describes the rate of
work per unit volume done by flow shear. The spatial integral of the
Pi-D𝛼 term measures the thermal energy gain (Pezzi et al. 2019a).
Here, we use the convention that Pi-D𝛼 and P-\𝛼 include the minus
signs in Eq. (12), so that positive values tend to locally increase the
thermal energy. The Pi-D𝛼 term has been adopted to provide insights
on themechanisms that transfer energy towards smaller scales, where
it is dissipated (Yang et al. 2019). The motivation for this term be-
ing associated with dissipation arises from the MHD framework, in
which traceless pressure–tensor terms are related to viscous dissi-
pation (Braginskii 1965). Hence, it is interesting to explore whether
this connection remains valid in a weakly collisional system.
Another dissipation proxy is associated with the cross-scale con-"
version of energy in its non-linear transfer during the turbulent cas-

"Δ𝒈 ≡ 𝒈(𝒓+ℓ)− 𝒈(𝒓) is the increment of a field 𝒈 between two spatial
points separated by a distance ℓ and is used to describe structures or
fluctuations of that size. The subscript ℓ indicates longitudinal incre-
ment, i.e. the projection along the increment vector ℓ. In this work,
LET values are associated with the starting point of the increment
vector and, for all simulations, the LET parameter 𝜖𝑝,ℓ is computed
with ℓ = 𝑑𝑝 and by averaging the increments taken in the positive
horizontal and vertical directions. Since the LET parameter 𝜖𝑝,ℓ is
introduced within a fluid framework, we do not compute it with ℓ
below proton scales, where electron kinetic effects become impor-
tant. The definition of LET is motivated by the isotropic form of
the Politano–Pouquet scaling law for the mixed third-order fluctua-
tions in turbulent incompressibleMHD plasmas (Politano & Pouquet
1998; Sorriso-Valvo et al. 2002, 2007), in this case also including the
Hall–MHD terms (Galtier 2008; Ferrand et al. 2019; Bandyopad-
hyay et al. 2020; Vásconez et al. 2021). Under the assumption of
stationarity, homogeneity and large Reynolds’ number, the associ-
ated scaling coefficient 〈𝜖𝑝〉 (〈...〉 indicating the ensemble average)
is the constant mean energy transfer (or, in the stationary steady
state, the dissipation) rate of the turbulent cascade (Kolmogorov
1941). In 3D fluid, fully developed turbulence, the sign of the av-
eraged third-order moment has to be negative, corresponding to an
ensemble-averaged global net transfer towards the small scales (the
non-linear turbulent energy cascade). Other terms locally contribut-
ing to the energy transfer vanish and are disregarded here. These
represent the different fluid contributions to the turbulent transfer of
energy: kinetic and magnetic turbulent energy transported by veloc-
ity fluctuations, coupled magnetic and velocity Alfvénic fluctuations
transported by magnetic structures, and two associated Hall terms. In
weakly collisional plasmas, the LET may be unable to describe the
contribution of compressibility, as well as the role of possible non-
thermal features. The latter might enter in the energy budget via the
pressure–tensor contributions. However, it can provide information
on the local transfer of ordered energy towards small scales, where
it is made available for conversion through various possible mecha-
nisms, including dissipation. In particular, according to the definition
used in this work, negative LET terms can be thought of as locally
contributing to the non-linear energy transfer towards small scales,
and positive LET terms describe a contribution to energy transfer to
large scales. In non-turbulent systems aswell as in systems displaying
a large-scale structure (e.g. a single reconnecting current sheet), the
interpretation of the LET sign is more difficult, since the assumption
of homogeneity is not satisfied. However, for this analysis, peaks of
LET indicate the local concentration of cross-scale energy transfer
that can be made available for dissipation, regardless of the sign."
2.2 VDF-based dissipation measures
"The first parameter belonging to the class of VDF-based dissipation
measures is the pressure agyrotropy (Scudder & Daughton 2008).
Agyrotropy is a measure of differences in the plasma temperatures in"
"the two perpendicular directions to a given axis (Scudder&Daughton
2008; Aunai et al. 2013; Swisdak 2016). Standard axis orientations
for computing agyrotropy are along the local magnetic field or the
meanmagnetic field. Other coordinate systems, such as theminimum
variance frames of the particle VDF, have been also adopted (Ser-
vidio et al. 2015; Pezzi et al. 2017). We consider here the agyrotropy

by collisional effects (Pezzi et al. 2016)."
3 NUMERICAL MODELS AND SIMULATIONS SETUP
"The parameters introduced in the previous section are computed
using the results of kinetic numerical simulations performed with
different codes. All simulations in this work are 2.5D in space (quan-
tities depend on two dimensions, but vectors have three components)
and 3D in velocity space. For all codes, quantities are presented us-
ing a normalization based on an arbitrary magnetic field strength
𝐵0 and density 𝑛0. Spatial and temporal scales are normalized to
the proton inertial length 𝑑𝑝 = 𝑐/𝜔𝑝𝑝 and the proton cyclotron
time Ω−1𝑐𝑝 , respectively, where 𝜔𝑝𝑝 ="
"√︃
4𝜋𝑛0𝑒2/𝑚𝑝 is the proton"
"plasma frequency based on 𝑛0 and Ω𝑐𝑝 = 𝑒𝐵0/𝑚𝑝𝑐 is the proton
cyclotron frequency based on 𝐵0. Thus, velocities are normalized to

"2

dimensionless.
3.1 Numerical algorithms
"For the present analysis, we adopt the particle-in-cell vpic code
and two different Eulerian Vlasov–Maxwell codes: the fully kinetic
Gkeyll code and the hybrid-kinetic HVM code.
vpic utilizes a 3D, relativistic, fully kinetic explicit algorithm"
"(Bowers et al. 2008). vpic has beenwidely adopted for both collision-
less andweakly collisional plasma simulations, including simulations
ofmagnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence (e.g. Daughton et al.
2009; Daughton et al. 2011; Karimabadi et al. 2013; Roytershteyn
et al. 2013; Wan et al. 2015; Roytershteyn et al. 2015). The code
includes several models of binary collisions, including the particle-
pairing Coulomb collision algorithm of Takizuka & Abe (1977) ca-
pable of accurately reproducing the Landau collisional integral over
a wide range of parameters. The latter model is used in this study.
Gkeyll is a highly extensible code framework that contains solvers"
"for a number of systems of equations of relevance to plasma physics,
including multimoment multifluid (Wang et al. 2015), continuum
gyrokinetics (Shi et al. 2019; Mandell et al. 2020), and continuum
Vlasov–Maxwell (Juno et al. 2018; Hakim & Juno 2020). Gkeyll’s
Vlasov-Maxwell solver utilizes the discontinuous Galerkin finite el-
ement method for phase-space discretization and a strong-stability"
"preserving Runge–Kutta method for the integration in time. The
conservative, discontinuous Galerkin implementation of the non-
linear Dougherty operator (Dougherty 1964) is adopted to include
intraspecies collisions (Hakim et al. 2020) (see Juno 2020, for further
details).
HVM integrates the Vlasov–Maxwell system within the hybrid"
"framework, assuming quasi-neutrality and neglecting the displace-
ment current density (Mangeney et al. 2002; Valentini et al. 2007).
The proton Vlasov equation is discretized on a phase-space grid and
integrated numerically, while electrons are assumed to be a massless
isothermal fluid. A generalized Ohm’s law for evaluating the electric
field in Faraday’s law is coupled to the Vlasov equation. Proton–
proton collisions have been recently included through the non-linear
Dougherty operator (Pezzi et al. 2015; Pezzi et al. 2019b,c)."
3.2 Simulations setup
"Wediscuss the two classes of numerical simulations in this work. The
first class employs both collisionless and weakly collisional vpic and
Gkeyll simulations of a single current sheet that undergoes sym-
metric antiparallel magnetic reconnection. In the collisionless case,
we find that vpic and a separate PIC code P3D (Zeiler et al. 2002),
adopted in Liang et al. (2020), provide consistent and qualitatively
similar results. Although the vpic and Gkeyll simulations are very
similar in their choice of parameters, there are small differences we
make note of in the subsequent discussion. We first describe the vpic
simulations.
The vpic reconnection simulations use a domain size of 𝐿𝑥 ×"
"𝐿𝑧 = 25 × 25, with periodic boundary conditions in 𝑥 and perfectly
conducting boundaries on 𝑧. A single-current-sheet initial condition
is used, with magnetic field given by 𝐵𝑥 (𝑧) = tanh[(𝑧 − 𝐿𝑧/2)/𝑤0],
where 𝑤0 = 0.5 is the initial half-thickness of the current sheet.
The initial VDFs are drifting Maxwellians with temperatures 𝑇𝑒 =
1/12 and 𝑇𝑝 = 5/12 for electrons and protons, respectively; both
temperatures are initially uniformover thewhole domain. The density
is set to balance plasma pressure in the fluid sense, with 𝑛(𝑧) =
sech2 [(𝑧−𝐿𝑧/2)/𝑤0] +𝑛𝑏 , where 𝑛𝑏 = 0.2 is the background (lobe)
density. Therefore, the total upstream plasma 𝛽 for this simulation is
𝑛𝑏𝑘𝐵 (𝑇𝑒 +𝑇𝑝)/(𝐵20/8𝜋) = 0.2. The proton-to-electron mass ratio is
𝑚𝑝/𝑚𝑒 = 25 and the speed of light 𝑐 = 15. These choices enforce
that the plasma is non-relativistic (the thermal and Alfvén speeds
are much less than the light speed), which is appropriate for the
non-relativistic treatment of kinetic entropy. We employ a time-step
of Δ𝑡 ≈ 5.8 × 10−4. The smallest electron Debye length for this
simulation (based on the maximum density of 1 + 𝑛𝑏) is _𝐷𝑒 =
0.018. The spatial grid scale is Δ𝑥 = Δ𝑧 = 0.0125 ≈ 0.6944 _𝐷𝑒
(𝑁𝑥 = 𝑁𝑧 = 2000). The reference number of particles per cell per
particle species is 104 for a density equal to one. We simulate three
different electron–ion collision frequencies: a = 0, a = 0.01 Ω𝑐𝑒 =
0.25 Ω𝑐𝑝 and a = 0.05 Ω𝑐𝑒 = 1.25 Ω𝑐𝑝 . All types of collisions
(electron–electron, electron–ion, and ion–ion) are taken into account.
For each type of collision, the variance of the scattering angle in
the Takizuka–Abe algorithm is chosen to yield correct ratio of the
respective collision frequencies (see Takizuka &Abe 1977, for more
details).
In addition to the parameters for the PIC simulation, the kinetic"
"entropy diagnostic requires other parameters, discussed in detail in
appendix B of Liang et al. (2019). For the PIC simulation, we use
a velocity space grid scale of Δ𝑣 ≈ 0.6 𝑣𝑡ℎ,𝑒 for electrons and
Δ𝑣 ≈ 0.5𝑣𝑡ℎ,𝑖 for ions. We use a velocity range for binning the
particles from −𝑐 to 𝑐 in each dimension for electrons and from
−0.4𝑐 to 0.4𝑐 for ions."
"MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2021)"
6 O. Pezzi et al.
"The Gkeyll reconnection simulation also uses a single current
sheet initial condition, in a domain of size, 𝐿𝑥 × 𝐿𝑧 = 8𝜋 × 4𝜋,
which compared to the PIC simulation is a similar size in 𝑥 but
about half the size in 𝑧. The boundary conditions are periodic in
𝑥, a reflecting wall boundary condition in 𝑧. The initial magnetic
fields and plasma parameters are the same as the vpic simulations:
𝑤0 = 0.5, 𝑚𝑝/𝑚𝑒 = 25, 𝑇𝑝 = 5/12, 𝑇𝑒 = 1/12, and 𝑛𝑏 = 0.2. Like-
wise, there is only one Maxwellian component in the current sheet,
but 𝑐 = 50. Since the continuum Vlasov method in Gkeyll avoids
aliasing errors associated with under-resolving the Debye length in
PIC methods while still conserving energy, we choose a coarser con-
figuration space grid resolution to save on the computational cost of
a continuum method while still resolving the reconnection dynam-
ics. Our grid resolution is Δ𝑥 = Δ𝑧 ≈ 0.4 ≈ 40 _𝐷𝑒 (𝑁𝑥 = 64,
𝑁𝑧 = 32) with piecewise quadratic Serendipity polynomials within
a grid cell (Arnold & Awanou 2011). The velocity space range is
from −6 𝑣𝑡ℎ,𝛼 to 6 𝑣𝑡ℎ,𝛼 with a velocity space grid of Δ𝑣𝛼 = 𝑣𝑡ℎ,𝛼
along with piecewise quadratic Serendipity polynomials in velocity
space. Zero-flux boundary conditions are employed in velocity space
to ensure energy conservation. We choose a constant collisionality
of a𝑒𝑒 = 0.01 for electron–electron collisions and a𝑝𝑝 = 0.002
for proton–proton collisions for the Dougherty collision operator.
Reconnection is initiated using a magnetic perturbation with a spec-
trum of random wave modes in the first 20 modes of the system with
r.m.s. amplitude 𝛿𝐵/𝐵0 = 2 × 10−3. These random perturbations
break the symmetry of the continuum kinetic initial condition and
allow for the study of the standard 𝑚 = 1 tearing mode that arises
from noise in PIC simulations.
The HVM turbulence simulations have 512 grid-points in each di-"
"rection and a size 𝐿𝑥 = 𝐿𝑦 = 𝐿 = 2𝜋×20. Periodic boundary condi-
tions are imposed for the spatial domain. Velocity space is discretized
with 71 grid-points in the range 𝑣 𝑗 ="
"[
−5𝑣𝑡ℎ, 𝑝 , 5𝑣𝑡ℎ, 𝑝"
"]
( 𝑗 ="
"𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧), with the boundary condition 𝑓 (𝑣 𝑗 > 5𝑣𝑡ℎ, 𝑝) = 0. The ini-
tial equilibrium is characterized by spatial homogeneity, Maxwellian
proton VDFs, and a background uniform out-of-plane magnetic field
𝑩0 = 𝒆𝑧 with 𝛽𝑝 = 2. This equilibrium is perturbed at 𝑡 = 0
by imposing magnetic 𝜹𝑩 and bulk speed 𝜹𝒖 = ±𝜹𝒃 fluctuations
(𝜹𝒃 in Alfvén speed units). Energy is injected at large scales, i.e.
𝑘 ∈ [2, 6]𝑘0 (𝑘0 = 2𝜋/𝐿), with a flat energy spectrum and random
phases. The r.m.s. amplitude of the fluctuations is 𝛿𝐵/𝐵0 = 1/2.
No density perturbations nor parallel perturbations are introduced at
𝑡 = 0. Electron inertia effects are neglected in Ohm’s law, while elec-
tron temperature is set equal to the initial ion temperature. A small
resistivity ([ ' 10−3) is introduced to suppress numerical instabili-
ties and does not play a significant role in the plasma dynamics. The
adopted numerical resolution captures two decades of perpendicular
wavenumbers: one above and one below the proton skin depth 𝑑𝑝 .We
consider two simulations, characterized by a different proton–proton
collisional frequency a, namely collisionless (a = 0) and weakly
collisional (a = 10−3) (see Pezzi et al. 2019c, for further details)."
"4 NUMERICAL RESULTS: DISSIPATION MEASURES IN
MAGNETIC RECONNECTION"
4.1 Proton dissipation proxies for collisionless reconnection
"Figure 1 displays the set of implemented proxies for protons in the
vpic simulations. The left column collects the results for the col-
lisionless simulation, i.e. with a = 0. We initially focus on these
results, and discuss the effects of collisions in Section 4.3. The data
are taken at time 𝑡 ' 22 Ω−1𝑐𝑝 , after the peak of the reconnection"
"rate. To compute energy-based parameters involving spatial deriva-
tives, Gaussian smoothing is used to filter the noise (e.g. Birdsall &
Langdon 2004).
The Zenitani parameter 𝐷 𝑝 shows signatures consistent with pre-"
"vious studies (Zenitani et al. 2011; Swisdak 2016), being peaked
with a positive value in the diffusion region. In the exhausts, there
is oscillatory behavior especially on small scales in the primary is-
land. This is likely due to time-domain structures (Mozer et al. 2015)
such as electron holes, which formDebye-scale bi-directional electric
fields. Such structures are at small scales and produce local energy
conversion between the particles and fields.
The LET parameter 𝜖𝑝,ℓ shows a large-scale pattern peaked inside"
"the magnetic island that is only weakly modulated in the horizontal
direction, as well as a weaker signal approximately coincident with
the electron diffusion region (EDR). As pointed out in Section 2.1,
extracting information about LET is challenging in this reconnection
simulation, where the background field is inhomogeneous and the
fields are not in a steady state of fully developed turbulence. The
signs of LET are opposite on either side of the magnetic reversal
because LET is calculated with an increment with a component in
the positive 𝑧 direction. The contribution of various terms to the
local 𝜖𝑝,ℓ (not shown) reveals that the Hall terms (in particular
the current-helicity term, i.e., the last term in Eq. 13) dominate
the non-linear energy transfer. This is related to the presence of
Hall-scale electric currents and to the magnetic configuration of
the reconnection region, which thus are the main drivers of the non-
linear interactions. Furthermore, the prevalent positive sign observed
for theMHD cross-helicity term (not shown) suggests that non-linear
interactions are inhibited by the strong presence of coupled velocity-
magnetic field (Alfvénic) fluctuations, which reduce the effective
transfer of energy and possibly the onset of turbulence.
The Pi-D𝑝 plot shows that the pressure–strain term is positive"
"yet small near the X point on a length-scale in the inflow direction
beyond the EDR. Protons undergo meandering orbits in this region,
producing non-gyrotropic VDFs, while the reconnection inflow and
outflow are associated with bulk velocity shear: this produces a non-
zero Pi-D𝑝 . Inside the islands, a bipolar (positive/negative) signal is
found. The strong negative region suggests energy is locally being
converted from thermal energy to bulk kinetic energy, perhaps in
a region where counterstreaming beams including reflected ions at
the dipolarization front where the denser current sheet population
is being pushed downstream by the reconnected magnetic field are
converted into bulk flow. In contrast, P-\𝑝 , which has a peak value
about a factor of 2 larger than Pi-D𝑝 , tends to be quite structured and
positive in most of the island, is negative in the EDR, and is small in
the ion diffusion region (IDR). These results make sense physically:
the plasma in the island is undergoing compression due to the bulk
flows, so that P-\𝑝 is positive. In the diffusion region, when upstream
magnetic flux tubes enter the region of weaker magnetic field, they
expand, leading to negative \𝑝 = ∇ · 𝒖𝑝 .
Moving to VDF-based parameters, the proton agyrotropy"
"parameter indicates a proton gyro-scale region of non-gyrotropy sur-
rounding the diffusion region and the whole island at this stage of the
evolution, owing to the complicated distribution functions that ap-
pear where protons undergo meandering orbits. Local"
"√︁
𝑄𝑝 maxima"
"occur in the inner shell of the magnetic island, where both the LET
and Pi-D𝑝 are locally peaked. Turning to the non-Maxwellianity pa-
rameters, the b𝑝 parameter similarly shows structure at proton scales
in both the diffusion region and the islands. The structure of �̄�KP,p
and �̄�𝑝 are qualitatively quite similar to b𝑝 , as expected. In each
case, the protons are most strongly non-Maxwellian in the EDR, with
non-zero values also in the IDR and in the island. Themain difference"

"between these last measures, namely the quadratic non-Maxwellian
parameter b𝑝 and the entropy-based non-Maxwellianity parameters,
is that the latter appear more localized than the former, suggest-
ing that the entropy-based proxies require relatively more strongly
non-Maxwellian structures to attain appreciable values relative to
b𝑝 , owing to the natural log VDF dependence in their definition
compared to the quadratic dependence of b𝑝 .
Summarizing the collisionless simulation results for protons, all"
"eight dissipation measures in question show structure in and around
the current sheet and magnetic island. For the parameters in this
simulation, the quantities that are most strongly peaked in the EDR
are 𝐷 𝑝 , b𝑝 , �̄�𝐾𝑃,𝑝 , and �̄�𝑝 . The strongest measure for the IDR is√
𝑄𝑝 , with Pi-D𝑝 , b𝑝 , �̄�𝐾𝑃,𝑝 , and �̄�𝑝 also displaying structure. In
the island, 𝜖𝑝 , Pi-D𝑝 and P-\𝑝 are significant, with 𝐷 𝑝 revealing
significant electron-scale variations."
4.2 Electron dissipation proxies for collisionless reconnection
"In analogy with protons, electron dissipation proxies are displayed in
Fig. 2. One exception is that the LET parameter is not computed for
electrons, as discussed in Section 2.1. As expected, 𝐷𝑒 ' 𝐷 𝑝 due to
quasi-neutrality. Again, we first focus on the collisionless case in the
left column.
The other energy-based parameters, the electron pressure–strain"
"interaction terms Pi-D𝑒 and P-\𝑒, have highly structured patterns
at much smaller scales than their proton counterparts, as expected.
In the current sheet, Pi-D𝑒 and P-\𝑒 are both confined to the EDR,
with almost no signal in the IDR. Pi-D𝑒 is positively peaked in
the magnetic island close to the X-point. There are strong bands of
Pi-D𝑒 near the upstream edges of the EDR, where velocity shear
due to electron meandering orbits is significant. In the island, both
Pi-D𝑒 and P-\𝑒 have strong variations in the small-scale structures
discussed in the previous subsection. The intense electric fields are
expanding and compressing the electron fluid as seen in P-\𝑒, and
these fluctuations in the local velocity shear give a non-zero Pi-D𝑒.
There is also coherent structure of Pi-D𝑒 as the electrons leave the
EDR and develop a velocity shear as they move around the pre-
existing magnetic island.
For the VDF-based proxies, all four proxies"
"√
𝑄𝑒, b𝑒, �̄�KP,e and"
"�̄�𝑒 are peaked in the EDR where the strong signature of 𝐷𝑒 is
present. For"
"√
𝑄𝑒, it is peaked at the upstream edges of the EDR"
"where the meandering orbits meet the upstream electrons, and is
relatively smaller near the magnetic field reversal where distributions
have a characteristic wedge shape (Ng et al. 2011). Interestingly,
the agyrotropy"
"√
𝑄𝑒 is only non-zero in the EDR, while the non-"
"Maxwellianities b𝑒, �̄�KP,e and �̄�𝑒 are non-zero in both the EDR
and IDR. The reason for this is that the electrons upstream in the
IDR are trapped (Egedal et al. 2005), and it has been shown that they
produce gyrotropic distributions elongated in the parallel direction
(Egedal et al. 2008, 2013). Consequently, the agyrotropy in the IDR
is zero, while the non-Maxwellianity is non-zero, as is seen in the
simulation results.
All four VDF-based proxies also show strong signatures close to"
"the separatrices, where complicated distributions at the boundaries
between upstream plasma and the magnetic island occur. This is a
key distinction between these proxies and the energy-based proxies,
which are not peaked near the separatrices. This signature suggests
that the energy conversion in the island and exhaust is not taking
place near the edges of the islands, but more towards the core as
the bent field lines straighten. The VDF-based proxies also display
non-zero signals at the small-scale structures in the exhaust."
4.3 Collisional effects on proton and electron dissipation proxies
"We now turn to the effect of interspecies and intraspecies collisions
on the dissipation measures for both protons and electrons. To put the
numerical collisionality in perspective, we compare it to two known
critical collision frequencies for reconnection. Collisionless (Hall)
reconnection transitions to collisional (Sweet–Parker) reconnection
at a critical resistivity [𝑐 (Cassak et al. 2005). The initial current
sheet thickness 𝑤0 = 0.5 is about four times smaller than 𝑑𝑝 , so
it is expected that collisionless reconnection will occur for small
enough resistivity. From Fig. 3 of Cassak et al. (2005), the critical
resistivity is [𝑐𝑐2/4𝜋𝑐𝐴𝑑𝑝 ' 0.2, which in normalized units for
this study is [𝑐 ' 1. Then, the critical collision frequency is a𝑐 =
[𝑐𝑛𝑒𝑒"
"2/𝑚𝑒 ' 5. Therefore, for a = 0.25 and 1.25, as is used here in
the vpic simulations, reconnection is expected to remain Hall-like.
The time-scale for magnetic diffusion in the electron current sheet
is 4𝜋𝑑2𝑒/[𝑐2 = 1/a, so the diffusion time-scales are 4 and 0.8 for
a = 0.25 and 1.25, respectively. In comparison, the electron Alfvén
transit time through the EDR is 2𝑑𝑒/(0.1𝑐𝐴𝑒) ' 2, where 𝑐𝐴𝑒 is the
electron Alfvén speed. Consequently, collisions are expected to have
a noticeable effect in the EDR in the vpic simulations for a = 0.25,
and a significant effect for a = 1.25. A second critical collision
frequency is that at which collisions affect electron trapping upstream
of the EDR, which is approximately a = 0.1 (Le et al. 2015). Thus,
the trapping of electrons will be minorly affected for a = 0.25 and
significantly affected for a = 1.25. In contrast, the collisionality for
the Gkeyll simulation is very low, below both thresholds, so the
evolution is essentially collisionless.
Figure 1 displays the proton dissipation proxies for the a = 0.25"
"(centre) and a = 1.25 (right) vpic simulations. Data are from 𝑡 ' 26
for both a = 0.25 and 1.25, when the magnetic energy of these
simulations is nearly the same as the collisionless case at 𝑡 = 22. The
a = 0.25 case is just after the peak in reconnection rate, as for the
a = 0 case. The a = 1.25 case is just before the peak in reconnection
rate, which explains why the island is somewhat smaller for this case.
The energy-based parameters should be affected by the presence"
"of inter-species collisions due to the exchange of energy between
species. For a = 0.25, collisions affect the small-scale structures that
were present in the collisionless case, especially in 𝐷 𝑝 and P-\𝑝 .
However, as expected, the large-scale structure of these parameters
is not greatly altered for this collisionality. For a = 1.25, however,
collisions significantly alter the dissipation proxies. The signals in
the magnetic islands are severely weakened, as are the signals in the
EDR and IDR. Despite being weaker, the large-scale structure of the
measures is largely unchanged.
In a similar way, VDF-based parameters are qualitatively unaf-"
"fected by collisional effects for a = 0.25, with only weak quantitative
differences. On the other hand, for a = 1.25, VDF-based parame-
ters are strongly quantitatively affected. As collisions drive distribu-
tions towardMaxwellianity, especially those with fine velocity–space
structures, i.e. the non-Maxwellianity measures b𝑝 , �̄�KP,p, and �̄�𝑝 ,
are strongly decreased. The agyrotropy"
"√
𝑄𝑝 is also reduced by strong"
"collisions, but not as drastically as the non-Maxwellianity measures,
as it is less sensitive to sharp peaks in velocity space. This result again
confirms that collisional dissipation acts on different characteristic
time-scales depending on the scale of the velocity–space distortion in
the particle VDF: finer velocity space structures produce shorter dis-
sipation time-scales (Landau 1936; Rosenbluth et al. 1957; Balescu
1960; Pezzi et al. 2016).

secondary island near 𝑧 = 𝑧0 and 𝑥 − 𝑥0 ' [1, 2], which develops
shortly after the peak of the reconnection rate. The secondary island
has a bipolar structure in Pi-D𝑝 analogous to the bipolar structure

"5 NUMERICAL RESULTS: DISSIPATION MEASURES IN
TURBULENT PLASMAS"
"We here describe the structure of dissipation proxies in plasma turbu-
lence at kinetic scales. Since the HVM code using the hybrid model
neglects electrons, we only treat proton parameters. In these simu-
lations, energy injected at large scales generates a cascade towards
smaller scales. The time corresponding to the most intense turbulent
activity is 𝑡 = 𝑡∗ = 30, in which a turbulent state characterized by
an intermittent pattern of current sheets that border magnetic islands
and vortices (Servidio et al. 2015; Wan et al. 2015) is reached. We
show simulation results at 𝑡 = 𝑡∗ in Fig. 5, with the output of the

"the electromagnetic fields to protons. Similarly, the predominantly
negative LET supports the standard picture of a direct global energy
cascade towards small scales. The regions of larger energy transfer
are generally located near the current sheets, and some complexity
in the fine local details of the transfer can be observed. A detailed
analysis of each term of the right-hand side of Eq. (13) reveals that
the total energy (kinetic plus magnetic) available to be transported by
the longitudinal componentΔ𝑢𝑝,ℓ is the main contributor to the LET
parameter in this HVM simulation. In this case, it is also confirmed
(not shown) that the global (Yaglom–Hall) law shows a linear scaling
in the interval roughly corresponding to the MHD-turbulence range
(2𝑑𝑝 . ℓ . 10𝑑𝑝), as also recently reported in similar simulation
setups by Sorriso-Valvo et al. (2018a) and Vásconez et al. (2021).
As displayed in previous HVM (Pezzi et al. 2019a) and in PIC"
"simulations (Yang et al. 2019), Pi-D𝑝 is highly structured, having
both positive and negative regions close to intense current sheets.
Conversely, P-\𝑝 is larger than its Pi-D𝑝 counterpart and has signif-"
"icant contributions both at the current sheets and in magnetic islands
since it is related to large-scale plasma compression (red) and rarefac-
tion (blue). The most intense regions of P−\𝑝 are at current sheets,
reflecting the rapid collision or separation of large-scale magnetic
islands.
The four VDF-based proxies bear many similarities. They are"
"highly structured, with local peaks close to current sheets. As with
the reconnection simulations, there are also differences between these
measures. It is more common to get appreciable values of"
"√
𝑄𝑝 than"
"other VDF-based measures, especially �̄�𝐾𝑃,𝑝 and �̄�𝑝 . This indi-
cates that the agyrotropy provides an overall picture of the presence
of large-scale kinetic effects in the VDFs (namely the 2nd order VDF
moment), while fine-scale structures in the VDF are larger contribu-
tors to non-Maxwellianity measures.

species collisional effects, intraspecies collisions do not generate a

fluid quantities. On the other hand, VDF-based parameters are dissi-
pated by collisions, signature of the collisional thermalization. Since
these parameters are sensitive to the presence of out-of-equilibrium
structure in the proton VDF, they are affected by intraspecies colli-
sional effects. The effect of collisions is less visible in"

"lisions preferentially dissipate fine velocity–space structures (Pezzi
et al. 2016), which contribute less to"

"is visible in b𝑝 and in the entropy density-based non-Maxwellianity
proxies. The maximum values of these three parameters are smaller
by about 10% in the weakly collisional simulation than the colli-
sionless simulation. Similarly, average values are reduced by about
20% for b𝑝 and 30% for �̄�KP,p and �̄�𝑝 when including collisions.
The effect of collisions becomes more significant at later times (not
shown here, see Fig. 4 of Pezzi et al. 2019c). Indeed, at the final time
of the simulation, maxima of b𝑝 and of the entropy density-based
proxies are, respectively, about 20 and 30% smaller when collisional
effects are considered, while their average values are reduced by 40
and 60%, respectively. The different dissipation (in terms of both
maximum and averaged values) of b𝑝 and the entropy density-based
proxies suggests that the latter react more to collisional effects than
b𝑝 since entropy-based proxies are dissipated more efficiently via
collisions."
"6 ONE-DIMENSIONAL PROFILES OF DISSIPATION
PROXIES"
"We conclude by presenting 1D cuts of the dissipation surrogates
adopted in this work across a typical current structure. We include"
"both the reconnecting current sheet and a typical current sheet ob-
served in the turbulent HVM simulation. We focus on the collision-
less simulation, since our aim is mainly discussing how these pa-
rameters look when crossing a particular structure. Moreover, for the
magnetic reconnection simulations, we show cuts for only the vpic
runs, since Gkeyll and vpic provide similar results. These plots
help reveal comparative proxy structure near to the current sheets,
and may also be useful for future comparison with in situ spacecraft
observations, e.g., for the Pi-D measure (Chasapis et al. 2018b). For
applications of these results to observations or laboratory experi-
ments, it is important to emphasize that the results are undoubtedly
sensitive to the plasma parameters and to the reduced 2D physical-
space dimensionality (Howes 2015a; Li et al. 2016). Note also that
multispacecraft observations are necessary to compute the spatial
derivatives needed to calculate some of these diagnostics (e.g. Pi-D
measure)."
"Figure 6 shows the dissipation proxies along a cut in the recon-
nection simulation through the X-point in 𝑧. The vertical dotted and
dashed lines mark the upstream edges of the EDR and IDR, respec-

proxies b, �̄�𝐾𝑃 , and �̄� , show intensified signals over the IDR with
relatively strong peaks in the EDR. As discussed in Section 4, the
electron non-Maxwellianities not only show the peaks in the EDR
but also broad intensified signals over the IDR. As analysed in Liang
et al. (2020), the broad intensified signals are due to the gyrotropic
distributions created by trapped electrons (Egedal et al. 2005). This
non-zero signal is coincident with negligible signal in the electron
energy-based proxies 𝐷𝑒, Pi-D𝑒 and P-\𝑒.
Figure 7 similarly displays the dissipation proxies along a vertical"
"cut through the reconnection simulation at 𝑥 − 𝑥0 = 5, i.e. through
the reconnection exhaust. The format is the same as Figure 6. For
this cut, the exhaust is between the separatrices at 𝑧 − 𝑧0 ' ±1.5. For
both electrons and ions, all energy-based diagnostics, 𝐷𝑒 = 𝐷 𝑝 , 𝜖𝑝 ,
Pi-D and P-\ show intensified, yet noisy, signals. The signals include
positive and negative values due to complex flows in this region,
although for this cut the Pi-D𝑝 measure has a sizeable negative value.
The VDF-based proxies for both electrons and ions are intensified in
the exhaust, as well. The electronVDF-based proxies have peaks near
the separatrices, due to the counter-streaming electron flows (Hesse
et al. 2018; Liang et al. 2020). The VDF-based proxies are slightly
broader than the exhaust, which results from the finite Larmor radius
(FLR) effects near the separatrices as shown by the non-gyrotropy√︁
𝑄𝑝 . Although FLR effects are not seen much in the energy-based
diagnostics, they are picked up by the VDF-based diagnostics b𝑝 ,
�̄�𝐾𝑃,𝑝 and �̄�𝑝 ."
"Finally, we show in Fig. 8 the dissipation proxies for the collision-
less HVM turbulence simulation along a 1D cut close to the current
sheet near (𝑥, 𝑦) = (69, 36). Similar results are obtained in the col-
lisional simulation. All the energy-based parameters (top panel of
Fig. 8) are peaked within the same region, i.e. 𝑦 ' 36. The VDF-
based proxies (bottom panel of Fig. 8) also reveal clear maxima near
the current structure. However, the maxima are somewhat broader in
width (∼ 2 − 5) than the energy-based parameters (∼ 1). Moreover,
the agyrotropy parameter"
"√︁
𝑄𝑝 shows large-scale fluctuations quite"
"far from the current structure. The broader distribution observed for
the VDF-based parameters suggests that energy transfer is localized
close to the coherent structures, but can affect the particle distribution
function in a larger region around these structures."
"The 1D cuts of the dissipation proxies for both the reconnection
and turbulence simulations support the idea that peaks of dissipation
measures in a reconnecting current sheet or a turbulent environment
characteristically occur in coincident spatial regions, but not nec-
essarily at the same exact spatial position. This is consistent with
the notion of regional correlations, suggested by Yang et al. (2019);
Matthaeus et al. (2020). The selected structure has more of a resem-
blance to the 1D cut of the reconnection simulation at the X-point
than at the reconnection exhaust. However, there are qualitative and
quantitative differences. The Zenitani measure and the diagnostics
based on the pressure–strain interaction (Pi-D and P-\) have the same
dimensions (see Sect. 3), hence it is reasonable to compare their mag-
nitude. In this respect, we notice that the Zenitani measure is most
prominent in the reconnection simulation, while a positive P-\ is the
strongest in the turbulence simulation. This suggests that, when sim-
ulating a single reconnecting current sheet, compressible effects are
less significant. On the other hand, when reconnection occurs in a
turbulent environment, where magnetic islands can merge with each
other, compression is much more significant. The LET parameter,
which has different dimensions than the other three energy-based
surrogates, oscillates in the reconnection simulation, but is strongly"

"negative in the turbulence one. Qualitative agreement between the
structures is found for the VDF-based surrogates, that are all adimen-
sional, although some features in the reconnection simulation (e.g.
double peaks in the agyrotropy) are not present in the turbulence
simulation perhaps because of the different numerical resolution.
Furthermore, for the cut through the current sheet in turbulence,
the parameters depend on time due to the turbulent interaction of
larger scale magnetic eddies, so wide variation in parameters across
different current sheets and at different times is expected."
7 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
"As a result of the weak collisionality of many space and astrophysical
plasmas, several physical processes can locally contribute to the dis-
sipation of energy and the heating of the plasma. During magnetic
reconnection, magnetic energy is efficiently converted to directed
plasma flows, thermal energy, and energetic particles (Burch et al.
2016; Torbert et al. 2018). During turbulence in amagnetized plasma,
the cascade provides the global amount of energy needed for fluc-
tuations to be dissipated at small scales (Marino et al. 2008). How-
ever, which dissipative mechanisms are dominant and under which
conditions is still not sufficiently understood (Vaivads et al. 2016).
Therefore, a multiplicity of dissipation surrogates have been adopted
in the literature to identify potential sites of dissipation. Owing to
the strongly non-linear dynamics and the importance of physics at
kinetic scales in such systems, numerical simulations of the Vlasov–
Maxwell system (or, including collisions, the Boltzmann–Maxwell
system) are the decisive tool to address the long-standing issue of
plasma heating and energy dissipation in magnetized plasmas, e.g.
Parashar et al. (2009). For example, the “turbulence dissipation chal-
lenge” (Parashar et al. 2015) motivated numerical work to compare
different algorithms on the solution of similar problems to assess the"
"nature of the dissipation in magnetized turbulence (e.g. Pezzi et al.
(2017); Perrone et al. (2018); González et al. (2019)).
In the same spirit, we have conducted a survey of a number of dis-"
"sipation surrogates with three different kinetic plasma codes — the
fully kinetic particle-in-cell vpic, the fully kinetic Eulerian Vlasov–
Maxwell Gkeyll, and the Eulerian Hybrid Vlasov–Maxwell codes
— to perform numerical simulations of two important physical phe-
nomena in plasma physics. The first class investigates reconnection in
an isolated current sheet, and the second concerns plasma turbulence
at kinetic scales. We have calculated and compared eight distinct
dissipation proxies, delineated in Section 2. For the sake of clarity,
we have categorized them in terms of (i) energy-based parameters,
whose definition describes energy transfer and conversion; and (ii)
VDF-based parameters, that are directly related to kinetic signatures
in the particle VDF. Energy-based parameters considered here are the
power density by electromagnetic fields on charged particles (Zeni-
tani et al. 2011), the pressure–strain interaction (Yang et al. 2017a),
and a local proxy of the turbulent energy transfer (Sorriso-Valvo et al.
2018a). The VDF-based parameters are the local pressure agyrotropy
(Swisdak 2016) and three measures describing how different a lo-
cal distribution function is from being Maxwellian (Kaufmann &
Paterson 2009; Greco et al. 2012; Liang et al. 2019).
Our findings are that each of the studied measures is non-zero"
"in key settings in reconnection and turbulence, including the recon-
nection diffusion region and magnetic islands, and the intermittent
magnetic shear regions bordering magnetic eddies in a turbulent sys-
tem. The region that each proxy is strongest highlights a potentially
different aspect of the physics taking place, as is described in detail
in Sections 4 and 5. It is intended that the discussion therein will
contribute to the assessment of dissipation and energy conversion in
satellite and plasma laboratory experiment measurements. We here
remark on the importance of the VDF-based diagnostics, which re-
veal further details about the underlying dynamics of the plasma
compared to the energy-based diagnostics. Indeed, the energy-based
diagnostics give similar results for similar simulations in the mag-
netic reconnection setup (i.e. vpic and Gkeyll runs), as we expect
since these simulations which show little difference in many of the
measures of the plasma response tomagnetic reconnection. However,
the additional level of detail provided by VDF-based diagnostics al-
lows us to more carefully ascertain the kinetic response of the plasma
from small differences which arise naturally between two different
simulation codes, and the added robustness of these diagnostics is
likely to be especially useful when analysing more general simu-
lations and observations of real plasma systems such as the solar
wind. In contrast, the energy-based diagnostics are directly related to
the turbulence cascade process that connects the energy containing
scales to the kinetic range of scales where the velocity space structure
becomes increasingly important. Therefore both type of diagnostics
are helpful to form a complete picture of the dynamics leading to
dissipation.
The spatial locations where each proxy has a local maximum can"
"be different between the different proxies. For example, in the mag-
netic reconnection simulations, the Zenitani measure is peaked at
the X-point while the pressure–strain interaction terms are peaked
inside the magnetic islands. This confirms a suggestion that both
energy-based and VDF-based parameters display a regional correla-
tion: structures identified by these parameters often occur in similar
regions, although not necessarily exhibiting a point-to-point corre-
lation. This underscores a key conclusion of this work: that no one
single measure is universally the best measure for dissipation. Rather,
employing a number of proxies is likely best for assessing the dissi-
pation and energy conversion in a plasma system."

Dissipation measures in weakly collisional plasmas 15
"We also consider the role of collisions by including their dy-
namical effect ab initio in the numerical simulations for both re-
connection and turbulence. When including only weak intraspecies
(proton–proton) collisions in the turbulence simulations, the VDF-
based proxies decreased while the energy-based proxies were largely
unchanged. This behavior is expected since such collisions drive par-
ticle VDFs towards Maxwellian distributions, but they do not pro-
duce a net energy transfer between different species although they
indirectly modify the energy equations by isotropizing the pressure
tensor (Del Sarto et al. 2016). On the other hand, both energy- and
VDF-based proxies are influenced by interspecies and intraspecies
(electron–proton) collisions in simulations ofmagnetic reconnection.
In particular, small-scale structures are dissipated by collisions, and
the distributions in the diffusion region are less non-Maxwellian and
thermalize more rapidly than in the collisionless case.
Interestingly, we find the peaks of dissipation proxies in the sys-"
"tems with collisions are generally weaker than in the collisionless
system. VDF-based dissipation proxies show this behavior for all the
simulations reported in the manuscript. These surrogates are local
in position space and provide only a local measure of the complex-
ity of the distribution function. Energy-based measures also become
weaker in the collisional runs of magnetic reconnection, which in-
clude interspecies collisional effects. This behavior is an effect of the
work of collisions that, since the beginning of the numerical simula-
tion, have produced dissipation. In particular, intraspecies collisions
dissipate VDF complexity, while interspecies collisions affect both
the VDF and the energy. Therefore, by looking at these parameters at
a fixed time snapshot, their peaks are weaker in the collisional runs
with respect to the collisionless case. Further, it also clearly illustrates
that the energy-based measures contain information about both col-
lisional and collisionless processes, implying that they are not yet
capable of distinguishing reversible from irreversible processes.
Although defining the concept of dissipation in a collisionless"
"plasma is rather complicated, analysing dissipation surrogates in col-
lisionless simulations and comparing the evolution of these proxies in
collisionless and collisional runs, as done in this study, is meaningful.
Such a comparison indeed addresses the key question: are collisions
preferentially active in regions where the dissipation surrogates eval-
uated in absence of collisions are intense, i.e. where other dynami-
cal characteristics (e.g. pressure–strain interactions, non-Maxwellian
structures) are significant?Our analysismay indirectly suggest a posi-
tive answer to this question. The regional correlation of energy-based
and VDF-based diagnostics indicate that non-Maxwellian structures
in the particle VDF are expected close to regions where energy-
based dissipation surrogates are also strong. Moreover, as shown
in previous studies (Landau 1936; Rosenbluth et al. 1957; Balescu
1960; Schekochihin et al. 2009; Pezzi et al. 2016, 2019c), collisions
rapidly dissipate strong velocity–space disturbances in the particle
VDF. Hence, we suggest that regions identified by dissipation sur-
rogates in the collisionless simulations are regions where collisions,
if present, preferentially smooth out non-Maxwellian features in the
particle VDF, thus producing irreversible dissipation.
The present study is not intended to be the final word on this"
"topic, as there are many avenues for future work. The diagnostics
considered here do not discriminate the underlying process which
may lead to energy dissipation or conversion, e.g. Landau damping,
cyclotron damping, phase-mixing, and stochastic heating (Chandran
et al. 2010; Li et al. 2016). In this perspective, a different approach,
based on the field-particle correlation, has been recently adopted to
identify the presence of particular signatures in the particle VDF
(Klein & Howes 2016; Klein et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2019; Klein
et al. 2020). This method has the advantage of diagnosing energiza-"
"tion directly in velocity space while the others here adopted involve
an integration over the full velocity space. The field-particle corre-
lation is also local in physical space and does not require spatial
gradients, which would require multiple spacecraft for in situ ob-
servations. Incorporating the field–particle correlation gives a visual
way to identify energy transfer between particles and fields, and
would be interesting to compare with the other proxies. Indeed, the
diagnostics considered in this work are extremely useful to char-
acterize potential sites of intermittent dissipation, e.g. in structures
close to intense current sheets. On the other hand, methods such as
the field–particle correlation identifies basic plasma processes, e.g.
Landau damping. Connecting these two points of view would also
contribute to addressing the fundamental question whether dissipa-
tion in plasmas is uniform or intermittent (Vaivads et al. 2016) and
deserves a dedicated, future study. Moreover, kinetic plasma turbu-
lence excites in a very complex way an entire ensemble of genuinely
kinetic degrees of freedom, i.e. those related to velocity–space struc-
tures in the particle VDF (Servidio et al. 2017; Pezzi et al. 2018),
thus driving free energy towards finer and finer scales in velocity
space where it is dissipated through interparticle collisions (Pezzi
et al. 2019c). The relation of the dissipation surrogates considered
here with the enstrophy phase-space cascade will be the subject of a
future work.
Finally, there are many necessary extensions to the current study."
"The present simulations varied collisionality, but for a particular set
of field and plasma initial conditions, so the parametric dependence
of the conclusions attained herein should be the subject of future
work. Both the reconnection and turbulence simulations were 2D,
and therefore 3D effects are not captured. The reconnection sim-
ulations studied here employed a small system size in which the
protons do not fully couple back to the large-scale systems, so it is
important to revisit the proton dissipation measures in larger sys-
tem sizes. The effect of proton–electron collisions on energy-based
parameters in turbulence should be addressed in future work. The tur-
bulence simulations considered here addressed decaying turbulence,
and comparisons to driven turbulence would be interesting."
