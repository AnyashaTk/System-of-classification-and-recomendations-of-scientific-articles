"ABSTRACT
We estimate the Intracluster Light (ICL) component within a sample of 18 clusters de-
tected in XMM Cluster Survey (XCS) data using deep (∼ 26.8 mag) Hyper Suprime Cam
Subaru Strategic Program DR1 (HSC-SSP DR1) i-band data. We apply a rest-frame µB =
25 mag/arcsec2 isophotal threshold to our clusters, below which we define light as the ICL
within an aperture of RX,500 (X-ray estimate of R500) centered on the Brightest Cluster Galaxy
(BCG). After applying careful masking and corrections for flux losses from background sub-
traction, we recover ∼20% of the ICL flux, approximately four times our estimate of the
typical background at the same isophotal level (∼ 5%). We find that the ICL makes up about
∼ 24% of the total cluster stellar mass on average (∼ 41% including the flux contained in the
BCG within 50 kpc); this value is well-matched with other observational studies and semi-
analytic/numerical simulations, but is significantly smaller than results from recent hydrody-
namical simulations (even when measured in an observationally consistent way). We find no
evidence for any links between the amount of ICL flux with cluster mass, but find a growth
rate of 2−4 for the ICL between 0.1 < z < 0.5. We conclude that the ICL is the dominant evo-
lutionary component of stellar mass in clusters from z ∼ 1. Our work highlights the need for
a consistent approach when measuring ICL alongside the need for deeper imaging, in order
to unambiguously measure the ICL across as broad a redshift range as possible (e.g. 10-year
stacked imaging from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory)."

1 INTRODUCTION
"A complete understanding of the growth of universal large-scale
structure (LSS) is one of the primary goals of modern cosmol-
ogy. Structures which make up the ‘cosmic web’ include: ‘nodes’
(gravitationally-bound groups and clusters of galaxies), ‘filaments’
(lower-density connective ‘strings’ of galaxies) and ‘voids’ (vast
under-densities of galaxies). These have been observed extensively"

"in nature, initially by Fritz Zwicky, with widespread cataloguing
later by individuals such as George O. Abell in the early-to-mid
20th century (e.g. Zwicky 1937; Abell 1958) to a more extensive
scale by modern spectroscopic galaxy surveys (e.g. 2dFGRS, Col-
less et al. 2001). Our comprehension of how matter - baryonic (pro-
tons, neutrons, electrons) and dark - collapses to form these struc-
tures (and the rate at which this happens) is partially governed by
our understanding of cosmology (e.g. BAHAMAS, McCarthy et al.
2018)."

"and outputs from hydrodynamical simulations remain critical when
attempting to accurately model LSS. In recent years, cosmolog-
ical hydrodynamical simulations have been reasonably success-
ful in reproducing the structures observed in nature (e.g. Millen-
nium, Springel et al. 2005, see their Figure 1). However, for ex-
ample, at individual cluster scales, there are numerous key incon-
sistencies (e.g. the baryonic matter fraction). This has motivated
higher-resolution ‘zoom’ simulations with more complex ‘subgrid’
physics to better understand these differences (e.g. Barnes et al.
017b), as well as applying semi-analytic models (SAMs) to simu-
lated dark matter haloes (e.g. De Lucia & Blaizot 2007)."
"These discrepancies are especially striking in the case of
Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs); massive, often non-star form-
ing galaxies which primarily reside at the X-ray peak of galaxy
clusters, a proxy used for the bottom of the gravitational poten-
tial well (e.g. Lin & Mohr 2004). For example, there are un-
resolved tensions with most cosmological simulations regarding
‘profile cuspiness’ (e.g. Navarro et al. 1996), with observed BCGs
having a ‘core’ present in their dark-matter density profiles (e.g.
Newman et al. 2013b) which cannot readily exist in the ΛCDM
paradigm for non-self-interacting dark matter (e.g. Harvey et al.
2017). Vitally, there are also tensions present between the observed
stellar mass growth rate of BCGs (e.g. Collins et al. 2009; Burke
et al. 2012) and that in simulations (e.g. De Lucia & Blaizot 2007;
Laporte et al. 2013), with simulations generally predicting signifi-
cantly more rapid rates of growth (∼ 2− 4× since z ∼ 1) than those
observed in nature (although significant improvements with better
agreement have been made in recent studies, e.g. Ragone-Figueroa
et al. 2018)."
"One of the proposed ‘solutions’ to this missing BCG stellar
mass problem is analysis of the co-evolution of cluster BCGs with
the Intracluster Light (ICL, e.g. Zwicky 1952; Gunn & Gott 1972;
Donzelli et al. 2011 and numerous others) which is a low-surface
brightness (LSB; <1% sky level, e.g. Bernardi et al. 2017), diffuse
stellar component in clusters. The origin of the ICL is debated ex-
tensively in the literature, namely whether it originates primarily
from BCG-passive satellite mergers (e.g. Burke & Collins 2013;
Gonzalez et al. 2005), tidal stripping from infalling, younger satel-
lites (e.g. DeMaio et al. 2018; Morishita et al. 2017 DeMaio et al.
2015; Montes & Trujillo 2014; Montes & Trujillo 2018), in-situ
star formation due to ICM collapse in the case of gas-rich clusters
(Puchwein et al. 2010), or a combination of these."
"Exactly how much the ICL contributes to the stellar mass of a
cluster at a given epoch is much debated throughout the literature.
At present epochs (z ∼ 0), observational results span over a wide
range of values (10-50%) with the same being true for simulations;
significant tension also however exists between them with respect
to the rate of observed ICL growth (e.g. Murante et al. 2007, Dolag
et al. 2010, Rudick et al. 2011, Contini et al. 2014 and Tang et al.
2018). The reasons behind these deviations are unclear, with sam-
ple selection, data quality and method of measurement all being
contributing factors to the scatter. As the ICL is a faint component
which is not bound to any one cluster galaxy, a concise definition
in an observational context is non-trivial. Some authors attempt
to model the light profiles of galaxies to disentangle their haloes
from the true ICL (e.g. Morishita et al. 2017; Gonzalez et al. 2007),
whereas others use a isophotal thresholding technique (e.g. Burke
et al. 2012; Burke et al. 2015) or use ellipsoidal masks derived from
basic structural parameters to mask cluster objects (e.g. Kron 1980;
see Zibetti et al. 2005, DeMaio et al. 2018); or use a wavelet-like
approach (e.g. Da Rocha & Mendes de Oliveira 2005; Da Rocha
et al. 2008; Jimenez-Teja & Dupke 2015; Jiménez-Teja et al. 2018;"
"Ellien et al. 2019). All of these methods have various biases and
caveats."
"In this work, we study the ICL component of a sample of
X-ray selected galaxy clusters from the XMM-Cluster Survey, us-
ing deep (i ∼ 26.8 mag, or 28.3 mag/arcsec2 (5σ, 2′′ × 2′′)) Hy-
per Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program DR1 imaging (Aihara
et al. 2018b). In doing so, we hope to gain a greater understand-
ing of the nature of the accumulation of stellar mass in the cores
of clusters since z ∼ 0.5. This paper is structured as follows: firstly,
we discuss the parent sample of the clusters used for this study; sec-
ondly, we outline our selection and detail our methodology used in
quantifying the ICL; lastly, we discuss our results. We adopt, where
applicable, a standard ΛCDM concordance cosmology throughout,
with H0 = 70 km s−1Mpc−1, h100 = 0.7, ΩΛ = 0.7 and ΩM = 0.3."
2 DATA
2.1 The XMM Cluster Survey
"The XMM Cluster Survey (Romer et al. 2001) is an all-sky
serendipitous search for galaxy clusters using legacy X-ray data
from the XMM-Newton space telescope (e.g. Jansen et al. 2001).
The first XCS data release in 2012 (Mehrtens et al. 2012) contained
X-ray and optical confirmations for 503 galaxy clusters, a third of
which were entirely new to the literature. The second XCS public
data release (Giles et al., in prep) increases the number of clusters
detected in XCS to ∼ 1300 and overlap with this master catalogue
in HSC forms the basis of the sample we use in this work1. Due
to the considerably less biased means of cluster selection in X-rays
than optical surveys coupled with high angular resolution X-ray
imaging (4.1′′), XCS data is ideal for constructing a representative
cluster sample."
"In the case of the sample used in this work (Giles et al., in
prep), XCS detections were cross-matched for spectroscopy with
the SDSS DR13, VIPERS PDR2 and DEEP2 surveys (Albareti
et al. 2017; Guzzo et al. 2014 and Newman et al. 2013a respec-
tively). Spectroscopic redshifts are assigned to each cluster through
application of a biweight location estimator (see Beers et al. 1990)
using all galaxies falling within 1.5′ from the XCS centroid from
the X-ray Automated Pipeline Algorithm (XAPA, Lloyd-Davies
et al. 2011); this redshift centroid is then re-calculated after ap-
plying a clip of ∆v ± 3000 kms−1 about the initial redshift, within
a radius of 1.5 Mpc projected distance from the XAPA centroid
(see method described in Hilton et al. 2018). Section 4 details the
outcome of the matching process for the sample used here."
"3 HYPER SUPRIME-CAM SUBARU STRATEGIC
PROGRAM"
3.1 Survey Description
"In this work, we make use of optical imaging data from the first re-
lease of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-
SSP, e.g. Aihara et al. 2018a); one of the deepest, public ground-
based optical surveys available (see Table 1). The HSC instrument
is a wide-field (1.8 deg2) imaging camera on the 8.2 m Subaru tele-
scope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii where the SSP has been running since
March, 2014. In total, the SSP is scheduled for a run of 300 nights"

"over the course of six years, covering three imaging depths in total:
‘Wide’, ‘Deep’ and ‘Ultra-Deep’ in 5 Sloan-like passbands (grizy).
In this work, we use imaging from the ‘Deep’ subset, chosen to
keep the imaging data for our cluster sample as consistently deep
as possible. A summary table of the average 5σ limiting depths has
been included for reference for the available runs and broad bands
(Table 1). The survey footprint overlaps with numerous other sur-
veys, such as the general Sloan footprint and its associated surveys
(e.g. York et al. 2000), Pan-STARRS (e.g. Chambers et al. 2016),
COSMOS (e.g. Scoville et al. 2007) and DEEP-2 (e.g. Newman
et al. 2013a). The imaging depth of HSC far exceeds that of any
current public survey, with the exception of the Hubble Frontier
Fields (HFF, Lotz et al. 2017) e.g. KiDS (de Jong et al. 2013), DES,
(The Dark Energy Survey Collaboration 2005). Current estimates
of HSC image quality are comparable to surveys anticipated by the
upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory (formerly the Large Synop-
tic Survey Telescope, see Ivezic et al. 2008 and Brough et al. 2020,
also Section 3.2 for further comments on data reduction)."
3.2 Data Reduction
"For the DR1 release, the HSC-SSP data products have undergone
processing through the HSC pipeline, an adapted version of the
Vera C. Rubin Observatory Data Management (DM) software stack
in preparation for Vera C. Rubin Observatory data products in the
coming decade (see Jurić et al. 2015 for a description of the Vera
C. Rubin Observatory DM stack). The full implementation for HSC
is detailed in Bosch et al. (2018) (including a flow diagram of the
complete process, see their Figure 1) but we include an abridged
version here to provide context. The pipeline software itself is open
source and licensed for public use under the GNU public license
(version 3). The photometric performance of the pipeline on mock
objects is described in detail in Huang et al. (2018a), who demon-
strate a strong recovery in input versus output flux even for de
Vaucouleurs-like objects (on average ∼ 85% at mi = 25). They ac-
knowledge, however, that the HSC pipeline tends to over-subtract
flux around extended, bright objects (which they explore further
when studying the faint haloes of elliptical-type galaxies in Huang
et al. 2018b). We discuss this issue, along with a proposition of a
post-processing ‘fix’, in Section 5.1."
"In simplified terms, much of the HSC pipeline is built on algo-
rithms and concepts originating from the SDSS photo pipeline (see
Lupton et al. 2001), the pipeline which produces the data products
for all SDSS data releases. Raw data and coadds can be queried
online on the HSC-SSP DR1 release site; alternatively, there are"
"reduced data products (e.g. photometry, best-fit models, photo-z es-
timates) available which can be downloaded via SQL query."
"The HSC pipeline operates in several stages to produce the
final scientific data products. The process (with relevant details) is
roughly as follows:"
"(i) CCD processing: the raw data from each CCD is taken, and
basic data corrections and calibrations are applied. Firstly, an In-
strument Signature Removal (ISR) is applied, which embodies ba-
sic reduction (i.e. flat, bias and dark corrections), brighter-fatter
corrections (for source intensity dependence on the measured PSF),
corrections for crosstalk and corrections for CCD non-linearity
(e.g. Krick & Bernstein 2007 for context as to how this applies
to ICL). The sky is estimated for each image and subtracted using
a variance-weighted 6th order Chebyshev polynomial sampled over
128 × 128 3σ clipped average pixel values."
"In summary, this stage produces two main data products: cali-
brated exposure data (i.e. datacubes which contain: a background
subtracted, calibrated image; a mask frame containing source de-
tections, pixel flags and star masks; a variance frame, essentially a
‘weight map’ describing the pixel-by pixel variance of the coadded
images) and a ‘source catalogue’, namely a database of detected
objects with photometric information as measured by the pipeline."
"(ii) Joint calibration: when all CCDs have been processed,
their astrometric and photometric calibrations are refined by requir-
ing consistent positional and flux values of sources on repeat visits
where they may appear on different regions of the focal plane."
"(iii) Image coaddition: the individual CCD exposures are then
coadded to improve the imaging depth. As is widely known in as-
tronomical surveys, co-addition can lead to complications, such as
data degradation or introduction of systematic errors. Efforts have
been made during the HSC pipeline’s construction to avoid these
issues wherever possible; as stressed by Bosch et al. (2018), the
pipeline is still actively undergoing refinement."
"(iv) Coadd processing: after creating the coadds, the pipeline
carries out another round of image processing. Objects on the
coadds are detected, deblended and measured, creating a catalogue
of final object measurements. A final background is then subtracted
for each sky ‘patch’ via an average from a 4k × 4k pixel bin."
4 SAMPLE SELECTION
"To create our sample of clusters, we cross-matched the XCS-DR2
North (Giles et al., in prep) master source list with the entire HSC-
SSP DR1 footprint region (Wide, Deep and Ultra-Deep). This pro-
duced an initial match of 202 common sources. We required, for
robustness, for there to be an available spectroscopic redshift for
both the assigned BCG and for the cluster itself; 79 objects met
this criterion. The BCGs in this work are assigned through the GM-
PhoRCC algorithm of Hood & Mann (2017) and then eyeballed
individually using optical images with overlaid X-ray contours.
The GMPhorCC algorithm models galaxy distributions as Gaus-
sian mixtures using SDSS DR10 data, using objects from the main
galaxy catalogue (see paper for details on colour selection crite-
ria and identifying the red sequence; see also their Figure 4 for a
detailed flowchart on the operation of the algorithm). From this, it
was decided that no reassignments were necessary."
"The BCG and cluster spectroscopic redshifts were then com-
pared - if they deviated significantly from one another beyond a
specified velocity space limit (∆v > ±5000 kms−1), these objects
were discarded (8 objects, leaving 71). We then required that each"

text for details). The redshifts are spectroscopic, with errors ∆z ∼ 10−5.
The clusters span a wide range in both redshift and mass; a correlation is
detected, but it is not significant (see table 5)."
"cluster had X-ray source parameter measurements (e.g. X-ray tem-
perature, TX,500) from XAPA (53 objects). Finally, to ensure the
depth of our images were approximately consistent, we selected
only sources which lay within the HSC-SSP Deep footprint (29 ob-
jects)."
"For each of the fields, i-band image data were then down-
loaded as cutouts (see Section 3) using a field size equivalent to
1.5 × 1.5 Mpc at the spectroscopic redshift of the cluster. These
were checked against the value used here as a proxy for cluster ra-
dius (see Section 5.5) to ensure that the field size encompassed the
size of the cluster as estimated by X-rays. The quality of the indi-
vidual fields were checked at this stage, with 7 being discarded due
to bright foreground source contamination, or being at the edge of
a field. The 7 clusters with rejected image data are shown in Figure
2. Another 4 clusters were also rejected a posteriori, as they were
agreed by the collaboration to be poor candidates. Our final sample
therefore consists of 18 clusters (see Figure 5); the corresponding
MX,500 − z relation (see Section 5.5) can be seen in Figure 1. The
clusters span a wide range in both redshift (0.06 < z < 0.5) and
halo mass (1012.5 < MX,500 < 1014.5)."
"From the X-ray measurements, we estimate RX,500 and MX,500
using the X-ray temperatures of the remaining clusters in our sam-
ple (the subscript X, 500 referring to the value being derived from
X-rays). The RX,500 act as a proxy for the cluster radius and are
used as physically-motivated aperture sizes for measuring ICL;
RX,500 also has the benefit of lower levels of contamination from
the background compared with larger cluster radii (e.g. R200). We
do, however, recognise that there is a significant caveat with this
method, in that we are assuming the BCG to be a proxy for the cen-
tre of the cluster. While this is generally a reasonable assumption
at low redshift (e.g. Lin & Mohr 2004), at higher redshift, there
are an increasing number of clusters out of dynamical relaxation
(e.g. Hatch et al. 2011) with multiple BCG candidates; this may be
resolved in future studies with deeper photometric coverage (e.g.
mass-weighted centroid estimation via weak lensing)."
"Both RX,500 and MX,500 are computed via the scaling relations"
"of Arnaud et al. (2005), modelled as power laws:"
"E(z)RX,500 = 1.104

−1/2, (3)"
"where z is the cluster redshift and ΩM and ΩΛ are our concordance
cosmology values. The range of RX,500 and MX,500 values for our
clusters are summarised in Table 2. Although we recognise that the
relation from Arnaud et al. (2005) is derived from relaxed clusters
(which may not be the case here), a recent paper from Giles et al.
(2017) investigated the luminosity-mass relation using statistically-
complete Chandra data with masses derived via a hydrostatic mass
analysis. They found no significant differences between relaxed and
non-relaxed clusters when comparing masses derived from a Yx-
mass relation."
5 ANALYSIS
"5.1 Background Over-subtraction - The ‘Divot Correction’
Method"
"A major concern regarding the measurement of ICL is not only
the addition of flux from excess sources (as discussed in the prior
subsection and in Section 5.4) but also, the over-subtraction of
flux. For space-based telescopes with low levels of background,
this is generally less of a concern (e.g. HST); in the case of ground
based telescopes, however, it provides a significant challenge for
LSB science. For extended objects such as galaxies, issues arise
due to modern commonly-used background estimation methods -
namely, spline-mesh approaches. Within the galaxy-modelling lit-
erature, this issue is long-known (e.g. Zhao et al. 2015a and refer-
ences therein); namely, that such approaches produce a ‘dearth’ of
flux around extended sources, termed here as a ‘divot’."
"Divots occur because we are limited in our background es-
timation by the size of our chosen mesh, as we cannot accom-
modate for the wide range of angular extents of all objects in a
frame. Hence, some light in extended object profile wings is of-
ten mistaken for background flux and mistakenly subtracted with
the sky. Even in surveys such as HSC where background estima-
tion is (more-or-less) state-of-the-art, these features still occur (see
Figure 3). This effect is doubly serious in the case of cluster and
ICL science compared with isolated galaxies, as there is often a
high source density (i.e. overlapping profile wings) which makes it
nearly impossible to select a globally appropriate mesh size."
"In an upcoming paper (Kelvin et al., in prep; Lee Kelvin, priv.
comm.), we attempt to address these problems, providing survey
comparisons and suggesting potential solutions. To do so, we have
produced a pipeline to correct for such flux over-subtraction ef-
fects. We acknowledge that post-processing is less preferable than
an optimised survey strategy, especially given that our method in-
volves parametric estimates that we attempt to avoid as much as
possible when measuring our ICL values (Section 5.5). In this case
(and in many others) however, this is not an option for either past
or present surveys that have not prioritised LSB science in their
observational approach. The construction, application and limits of
the aforementioned pipeline will be the subject of a separate paper;"

"Figure 2. The 7 clusters (1.5 × 1.5 Mpc on each frame) omitted from the sample due to poor photometry or bright source contamination. BCGs, if present on
the frame, are marked with cyan diamonds. The images have been log-scaled and Gaussian-smoothed to show structure."
"here, we instead provide an abridged description of its operation
and use in the context of this work."
"The pipeline, which is written in R and is primarily SExtrac-
tor (version 2.19.5) and SWARP based, operates on an image in
three major steps as follows:"
"(i) Object detection/modelling: firstly, SExtractor is run on
a given input image. The settings used are similar to those used
in Furnell et al. (2018). Since SExtractor version 2.8 (e.g. Bertin
2009), it is possible to fit models to the light profiles of objects
detected by the algorithm. There are several model types available
(e.g. delta function, Ferrer profile, exponential profile, Sérsic pro-
file). Here, we opt for a single-Sérsic model (see equation 4). All
detected objects in the frame are modelled with a Sérsic profile,"
"which are fit through a Levenberg-Marquardt χ2 minimization al-
gorithm. The Sérsic profile has the following form:"
"I(R) = Ie exp {bn[(R/Re)
1/n
− 1]} , (4)"
"where I(R) is the intensity of an object at radius R, Re is the effec-
tive radius, Ie is the object intensity at the effective radius, n is the
Sérsic index and bn is a product of incomplete gamma functions
as described in Ciotti (1991). SExtractor imposes an internal hard
limit on the range of Sérsic indices (0.5 < n < 8); the majority
in this work fall around 0.5 < n < 4. The result of doing so is an
image frame containing the modelled light profiles of all catalogue
objects."
(ii) Differential inversion: in order to estimate the flux loss in
"MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2021)"
6 K. E. Furnell et al.
"object profile wings caused during the image processing stage, we
then take the difference between the input image and the image
containing the object models. The result is then inverted, creating
the ‘divot correction’ (see centre panel of Figure 3)."
"(iii) Coaddition: the divot correction image is then added on to
the original image using SWARP (LANCZOS3 interpolation; this
was selected as recommended in the SWARP user manual, but as
the resolution of the images is identical, no resampling is neces-
sary), thus providing an approximate flux ‘correction’ (see Figure
3)."
"There is an obvious caveat in our approach, namely with our
selection of a single-Sérsic profile with which we fit to all galax-
ies in a frame. We therefore assume that object wings will follow
those of a Sérsic profile. This estimate is often cuspier than, for
example, the true profiles of BCGs, of which some are thought to
be multi-component objects (see, e.g. Bernardi et al. 2014, Zhao
et al. 2015a, Zhang et al. 2019; Iodice et al. 2016 see also Section
6) and may, for example, lead to residuals which are added into the
image which are not part of the divot. As well as this, there will
be some dependence on the reliability of the correction with both
cluster extent and redshift; with that said, we choose large postage
stamps (in excess of RX,500 in most cases) when modelling the div-
ots (to provide a sense of scale, the objects modelled here range
from ∼ 2′′ − 13′′). Although we appreciate the simplicity of this
approach, the addition of other components to hundreds of mod-
els (as well as attempting to accurately morphologically classify all
detected objects in a frame), provides not only significant compu-
tational cost challenges, but also adds additional free parameters
which may not be necessary for all objects and may lead to less
reliable fits (see arguments in Furnell et al. 2018). We therefore in-
stead caution the reader that our estimates represent, most likely,
a lower-limit estimate on the true value of the total wing flux loss
during processing. The divot method allows us to quantify the over-
subtraction but is not a substitute for a full pipeline sky-subtraction
reduction analysis."
5.2 BCG Photometry
"We apply three methods of quantifying the flux contribution from
our cluster BCGs: total flux within an aperture of radius 50 kpc
(e.g. Whiley et al. 2008) or two parametric models: a single, free
Sérsic fit, or a de Vaucouleurs model with a fixed Sérsic index of
4. We choose an aperture of radius 50 kpc primarily as other au-
thors have found that this radius corresponds approximately to the
region where there is an excess of light in BCGs compared with a
de Vaucouleurs profile (e.g. Presotto et al. 2014). We prefer, given
the nature of our data, to take a simplistic approach over attempt-
ing to fit multiple components here. We take a similar approach as
in our previous work in this respect (Furnell et al. 2018), where
we assessed the performance of the pipeline for SDSS data. There
are numerous arguments as to the best model to fit; most notably, a
two-component model which includes the addition of an exponen-
tial halo to a Sérsic profile (e.g. Donzelli et al. 2011; Zhao et al.
2015a; Bernardi et al. 2013). However, we take the approach in
this work that disentangling the BCG from the ICL is non-trivial to
achieve, given how much they are closely linked in terms of evolu-
tionary history (e.g. Burke et al. 2012; Spavone et al. 2018; Iodice
et al. 2016), so include parametric model fits primarily as a compar-
ative measure. For our results, due to them being non-parametric,
we use the aperture values to represent our BCG fluxes."
We model our galaxies using the SIGMA pipeline (Structural
"Investigation of Galaxies via Model Analysis, see Kelvin et al.
2012), using a similar implementation as in Furnell et al. (2018).
SIGMA is a software wrapper written in R that performs a full
model fit of a given object using GALFIT 3 (see Peng et al. 2010),
including an estimate of the field PSF using PSFEx (see Bertin
2013). The weight maps used in this procedure are those generated
by the HSC pipeline. We fit the BCGs simultaneously with their
brightest 3 neighbours, masking out their centres (to mitigate sat-
uration issues) and the remaining objects in the field. We produce
models for our objects pre- and post-divot correction (see Section
5.1) and use the post-divot corrected models because of the correc-
tion to the profile wings of our objects. Generally, the output pa-
rameters are similar in both cases (see Figure 4), and do not show
any obvious biases."
"It is important to mention that we do not use the PSFs gen-
erated by SIGMA when masking of stars on our images (e.g. to
estimate the contamination extent); rather, their use is to provide a
sufficiently well-approximated model for our BCG model fits. This
is because the PSFs generated by SIGMA are not estimated out to
large enough radii to account for the wings of the brightest stars
on our frames (∼ 0.2′). PSFEx is not optimised for the purposes of
producing extended PSFs; indeed, using PSFs with a small angular
extent both for the purpose of masking and removal of wings from
point source contamination represent two of the most commonly-
cited issues regarding the robustness of LSB photometric studies
(e.g. Duc et al. 2015, in the context of deep ATLAS-3D survey
data; see also Uson et al. 1991, Slater et al. 2009, Trujillo & Fliri
2016, Román et al. 2020, Infante-Sainz et al. 2020). For a more
detailed description of the masking process, see Section 5.3."
"In most cases, the three methods of quantifying BCG magni-
tude agree within a few percent, with the aperture values generally
yielding slightly lower values due to there being no wing extrapola-
tion (e.g. Furnell et al. 2018). There are, however, a couple of cases
where there is a disagreement between values of ∼ 10% or higher:"
"(i) XMMXCS J095901.2+024740.4 the highest redshift system
in this work (z = 0.51; panel 7 of Figure 5), with the faintest BCG
apparent magnitude from an integrated model (mi = 18.51). The
BCG flux fraction for this system with respect to the cluster within
RX,500 doubles using the best Sérsic fit over either the aperture or
de Vaucouleurs values (0.34, compared with 0.17 and 0.21 respec-
tively). From our work in Furnell et al. (2018), we found that galaxy
models tended to degrade with decreasing surface brightness; in-
deed, of all of the BCGs modelled here, the Sérsic fit for this system
has the largest relative error."
"(ii) XMMXCS J095951.2+014045.8: closer inspection of the
system using the DS9 software revealed it to be a cD-type (panel
14 of Figure 5); this extra flux may potentially have been missed
through using an aperture to measure the BCG (e.g. for a recent
paper on the effect of cD haloes when fitting galaxies, see Zhao
et al. 2015b) and more heavily contributed to the ICL fraction, as
both fitted models give a larger fraction of cluster light attributable
to the BCG (0.28 in either case, compared with 0.19 for the aper-
ture estimate). As aforementioned, such cases are testament to the
caveats of a non-parametric approach."
5.3 Masking
"As in every photometric survey, HSC imaging is not free from ar-
tifacts. Although the processing algorithm has been optimally de-
signed to avoid such defects wherever possible, some sources of
excess flux remain. These include artifacts from overexposed stars,"
"MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2021)"
Intracluster Light in XCS-HSC 7
"Figure 3. An example of the ‘divot correction’ method used in this work (shown here for cluster XMMXCS J232923.6-004854.7, z = 0.3); all images have the
exact same scaling (from Kelvin et al., in prep). The first image depicts the data prior to correction; as is visible, there is a dearth of flux in the regions around
the BCG and its satellites. The second shows the estimated divot correction (the divot corrections are smoothed using a 5-pixel FWHM Gaussian kernel); the
third shows the resultant image after implementation. As is visible, there is a vast improvement, with the sky level varying far more smoothly."
"Figure 4. Differential comparison between the input and output parameters for the cluster BCGs in this sample, with and without an added divot correction.
The values at the top of each frame represent the median deviation and rms. The top and bottom panels represent the outputs for a free Sérsic profile and a de
Vaucouleurs profile respectively. The fit parameters for both the non-corrected and corrected cases tend to be reasonably similar and there are no clear biases
present upon using a divot correction."

"telescope ghosts, satellite trails and cirrus, to name a few (refer
to Duc et al. 2015 for a comprehensive summary). This is shown
in Figure 2, which constitutes examples of clusters in XCS which
were not included in the final sample due to heavily contaminated
photometry in HSC."
"For our sample, we create custom masks in order to min-
imise the contribution to ICL flux from artifacts. Although the HSC
pipeline does produce masks as output, we opt to generate our own
as an attempt to more comprehensively remove artifacts, such as
extended diffraction spikes from bright stars which are often not
cleanly removed. We refer the reader to Bosch et al. (2018) for
more details of the masking method used in the HSC pipeline."
"For our custom masks, we begin with the binary masks gen-
erated by the HSC pipeline. The binary masks contain numerical
identifiers in order to differentiate between different ‘layers’ of the
masks - namely artifacts/saturated stars vs. objects. From these, we
generate our mask layers via 3 stages:"
"(i) Bad Pixel Masking: we begin by first identifying the ‘bad
pixel’ regions thresholded out by the HSC pipeline. These regions
are then masked out, and constitute the first mask layer. These in-
clude: regions which have been incorrectly weighted by the weight
maps, saturated pixels and some of the artifacts generated by bright
stars."
"(ii) Star Masking: next, we run SExtractor across all of the im-
ages. We set a detection threshold for our objects at 10σ; with other
parameters (such as saturation level, etc.) set to roughly the same
values as those used during our running of SIGMA. We allow SEx-
tractor to approximate a rough background level using a large mesh
size to account for any extended bright sources (128 pixels). The
purpose of this step is primarily to identify brighter, more compact
objects within the frame, for which we do not require absolutely
accurate photometry."
"For fainter stars, we query the Gaia DR2 catalogue (Gaia Collab-
oration et al. 2018) for both photometry and astrometry. The Gaia
mission aims to collect both photometry and astrometry for ∼ 109"
"stars in the Milky Way (for science objectives, see Gaia Collabora-
tion et al. 2016). We produce catalogues of stars within the frames
of our images, and mask stars out with 17 < G < 21 (mean apparent
magnitude value in the G-band from Gaia, see technical paper for
the filter curve: Jordi et al. 2010; G ∼ 21 is the survey limit). There
is around a 10% rate of contamination in Gaia by elliptical galax-
ies; we follow the prescription outlined in Koposov et al. (2017)
and apply a cut using the ‘astrometric excess noise’ parameter, ans
(log10(ans) < 0.15(G − 15) + 0.25), which they found to be ∼ 95%
effective; upon visual inspection, none of the BCGs were masked in
this way. We then apply the following empirical masking formula
used canonically in HSC2 to define our exclusion apertures:"
"r = A0 × 10
B0(C0−i) + A1 × 10"
B1(C1−i) (5)
"where r is in pixels, i are the HSC i-band magnitudes as measured
by SExtractor (Kron aperture, Kron 1980) and A0 = 200, B0 =
0.25, C0 = 7.0, A1 = 12.0, B1 = 0.05, and C1 = 16.0."
"For brighter stars (G < 17 in our case), this approach is not rec-
ommended. Although some bright stars are masked in HSC al-
ready, there are many missing due to the prior use of the much
less complete NOMAD survey (Zacharias et al. 2004) compared
with the Gaia survey, which will be used for future releases as de-
tailed in Coupon et al. (2018). Instead, we create custom masks"

"across all frames by hand for the brightest stars, any other point-like
sources missed in our catalogues from Gaia and any visible diffrac-
tion spikes (a similar method to that used, for example, in Montes
& Trujillo 2018 and Burke et al. 2015). Using the same method,
we also mask out all non-cluster galaxies brighter than the BCG
via careful visual inspection of the cluster field, following Burke
et al. (2015). We used the SAO DS9 imaging software to view our
images, which includes an array of tools for image visualisation
ideal for these purposes, including optimised Gaussian smoothing
kernels and high contrast scaling (useful for scaling masks to ac-
commodate stellar wings). Masks were then created by hand using
the region definition tool in DS9, and subsequently converted to
fits format using the open-source mkmask software (courtesy: Rolf
Janssen)."
"(iii) Isophotal Mask Creation: we then produce isophotal
masks for each of our frames (see discussion in 5.5), below which
we define the ICL to be measured and apply these in conjunction
with our bad pixel and star masks when performing photometry.
To do so, we use an effective surface brightness detection thresh-
old in the rest-frame of 25 mag/arcsec2 (an approach similar to that
carried out on the CLASH cluster sample by Burke et al. 2015).
To compare our results with Burke et al. (2015), we also shift our
equivalent surface brightness threshold at which we measure ICL to
that of the rest-frame B-band. For the B-band equivalent threshold,
we introduce the following equation:"
"µi,obs = µB,rest + 2.5log10(1 + z)
4"
"+ ki,B(z) , (6)"
"where µi,obs is the limit at which we observe, µB,rest is the equiva-
lent rest-frame surface brightness in the B-band, 2.5log10(1 + z)4 is
the bolometric cosmological surface brightness dimming term and
ki,B(z) is the k-correction term, defined here as:"
"ki,B(z) = Mi,obs(z) − MB,rest(z) , (7)"
"where Mi,obs(z) and MB,rest(z) are the pseudo-absolute magnitudes
derived for each respective waveband at a given redshift for our
choice of stellar population synthesis model. These are computed
via the EZGAL software (Mancone & Gonzalez 2012), assuming
an old stellar population with a formation redshift of z f = 3, solar
metallicity (Z�) and passive evolution thereafter, using the models"

"of Bruzual & Charlot (2003) coupled with a Chabrier (2003) IMF
(also resembling the methodology of DeMaio et al. 2018). We list
our B-band limits in Table 3."
"While we appreciate that it is unlikely that the stars contained
within our BCGs evolved entirely in situ, most BCGs have shown
little evidence for significant growth through starburst activity at
z < 1 and are primarily assumed to gain mass through mergers with
satellites containing reasonably similar stellar populations (or even
more passive, e.g. Guo et al. 2009), so we consider this assumed
‘burst’ model reasonable for simplicity (this was an assumption
also made by Burke et al. 2015). There are, however, an increas-
ing number of studies showing a younger age for the ICL compo-
nent compared to the BCG (see, for example, Montes & Trujillo
2014; Montes & Trujillo 2018; Morishita et al. 2017; Jiménez-Teja
et al. 2019). As an aside, we also performed an additional check to
ensure that correcting to the B-band did not result in any serious
biases from the rapid fade of bluer stellar populations with redshift
(see Appendix)."
"We show how the choice of metallacity and formation redshift
affects our ki,B(z) values in the Appendix, for the mean values of
our sample split in two bins about the mean redshift (0 < z < 0.28
and 0.28 < z < 0.5 respectively); in short, there is an rms of ±0.3
magnitudes in ki,B(z), depending on the model of choice. Interpo-
lating from Figure 8 (see upcoming discussion), this translates at
25 mag/arcsec2 to a difference in ±5% of the final ICL value."
5.4 Quantifying the Systematic Background
"In all astronomical image data, a systematic background exists. At
visible wavelengths, it is partially caused by faint galaxies below
the survey limit (which is a caveat to our method, refer to discus-
sion below), the wings of bright sources such as stars or contami-
nant galaxies and residual flux from the sky (e.g. Guglielmetti et al.
2009). In order to better understand this in the context of our im-
age data, we performed a test by applying photometry on injected
mock profiles so that we could trace the additional flux contribu-
tion at a given surface brightness. We performed this test on ‘con-
trol’ frames offset from each of the clusters in this study. The 18
control frames selected were patches of sky within the HSC-SSP
footprint, offset at random by 0.5◦ from the centre of the original
frames. We chose to use representative control frames so as to pre-
vent any contributions from ICL that may be present. The control
frames were subject to an identical masking method as that used in
the cluster frames, were weighted using the HSC-generated weight
maps (inverse variance) and were not divot-corrected."
"For each of the frames, 10 random positions were selected. To
mimic an ICL-like profile (found by numerous authors to be ap-
proximately exponential, e.g. Gonzalez et al. 2005; Seigar et al.
2007; Zhang et al. 2019), we generated an exponential model
(n = 1, Re = < RX,500 >/4, θ = 50◦, a/b = 0.8; Sérsic index, effec-
tive radius, position angle and axis ratio respectively) at 9 surface
brightness levels (24 - 28 mag/arcsec2 in steps of 0.5 mag/arcsec2;
where, for reference, the faintest limit is ∼3 magnitudes below that
which we measure for the ICL in our clusters). The profiles were
convolved with the field PSF from SIGMA (as per the modelling
process for the BCGs) and an idealised Poisson noise component
was added. We injected the models at 10 random positions within
each of the control frames, measuring the difference between the
input and output flux values using a fixed circular aperture equiva-
lent to the selected effective radius of our models (∼ 2000 models
in total, for a similar method, see Burke et al. 2012)."
"Figure 6 shows the bulk output across the fields, with Figure
7 showing the stacked median for all of the control frames. From
our mock photometry, we detect a <5% excess of the input flux on
average for an ICL-like profile over the range of our B-band equiv-
alent surface brightness levels (23.74 - 25.64 mag/arcsec2). There
is obvious scatter on a case by-case basis (for example, panel 16 of
Figure 6, see also panel 16 of Figure 5); from eyeballing, the pre-
dominant cause of this seems to be due to source-heavy frames (e.g.
many/clustered sources or bright sources such as stars present).
Moreover, we will show evidence in Section 6 that the flux lost
through the divot effect at the range of isophotal levels at which we
measure the ICL is approximately 4× the background contribution;
hence, we do not correct for it here (see further discussion of sys-
tematics in Section 5.5). It is again, however, worth noting that this
method does not quantify the flux contribution of the population of
faint galaxies below the survey limit (indeed, it is an issue with all
similar observational studies of ICL, e.g. see Zhang et al. 2019)."
5.5 Quantifying ICL
"Observationally, past studies have generally taken two approaches
when quantifying the amount of ICL present in a cluster: a paramet-
ric approach using model fitting (e.g. Gonzalez et al. 2005, 2007,
2013; Morishita et al. 2017), or by summing up the contribution
of ICL below a set (usually isophotal) limit while masking out the
BCG and any satellites (e.g. Burke et al. 2012, 2015; Krick & Bern-
stein 2005, 2007; Montes & Trujillo 2018). Other approaches look-
ing at either the shape of the BCG+ICL profile (see upcoming dis-
cussion) or the so-called ‘colour profile’ (namely, how the colour
of the ICL spatially varies across the cluster) have also measured
the flux in isophotes or annuli to acquire a 1-D profile (e.g. Zhang
et al. 2019; DeMaio et al. 2018; Burke et al. 2012)."
"When modelling a profile, one must assume a prior; exactly
the best model to use when describing the BCG+ICL profile varies
enormously across studies, with some recommending a double de
Vaucouleurs profile (e.g. Krick & Bernstein 2007), some using a
Sérsic+Exponential (e.g. Lauer et al. 2007) and others more com-
plicated models still (e.g. Zhang et al. 2019). Choosing the wrong
profile can lead to large uncertainties (e.g. Zhao et al. 2015a); as
well as this, the degeneracies present when using multiple com-
ponent fits mean that one cannot readily disentangle individual
flux contributions without dynamical information (e.g. Dolag et al.
2010). As per our masking methodology outlined in Section 5.3,
we take an isophotal approach to measuring the ICL in our clus-
ters, which we do for two reasons: simplicity, and to keep our as-
sumptions minimal. While the approach of using a surface bright-
ness limit is not perfect (and often leads, according to Rudick et al.
2011, to a lower ICL estimate), it is at least model independent.
Here, we choose a limit of µB = 25 mag/arcsec2 in the rest frame
B-band, similar to Burke et al. (2015); we discuss our methodology
in Section 5.3."
"After applying a mask (which includes an isophotal thresh-
old), we sum the weighted flux within an aperture of RX,500 centred
on the cluster BCG and repeat the process without an isophotal
limit (Section 5.3). We also provide comparisons at the equivalent
surface brightness levels of 24 and 26 mag/arcsec2 respectively
to assess the effect of changing the selected surface brightness on
the recovered ICL. The ICL measurement errors, E(ICL), are com-
puted directly from the image variances as follows:"

6 RESULTS
6.1 How Much of a Cluster is ICL?
"For comparison, we measure the ICL for our clusters before and af-
ter applying a divot correction. The measurements are summarised"
"in Table 4. In Section 6.2, we will provide more extensive com-
ments on our results and their consequences for BCG evolution;
here, we restrict our commentary towards the inferred systematics
involved in ICL measurement for ease of comprehension."
"For our clusters, with the inclusion of a divot correction,
the mean ICL contribution to the total cluster light at µB,rest =
25 mag/arcsec2 sits at around 24%. It is immediately clear from Ta-
ble 4 that applying a divot correction has a significant effect on the
overall recovered value for the ICL (∆ f being the difference in ICL
to total cluster light between the divot corrected and uncorrected"

"values); Figure 8 illustrates this difference, for equivalent surface
brightness limits in B from 24 − 26 mag/arcsec2 in steps of 0.5.
On average, the ICL fraction is ∼ 5% higher with a divot correc-
tion included, which represents ∼ 20% of the mean measured ICL
light fraction overall. The final masked, divot-corrected images are
shown in Figure 5."
"Our results illustrate exactly how crucial it is to account for the
flux over-subtraction problem around objects in surveys. As stated
previously, because the divot corrections are modelled with a ‘one-
size-fits-all’ Sérsic profile, it is likely that the ‘true’ net flux loss
is underestimated due to our choice of Sérsic profile with which
to model our divot corrections, with ∼ 50% of BCGs tending to
have an additional ‘halo’ as well as a central bulge by z < 0.1
which is debated to be either ICL or a BCG component (Zhao et al.
2015a). In addition, our method, as for other observational methods
for measuring ICL which utilise a surface brightness limit, clearly
cannot account for ICL in projection of the BCG. Whilst we appre-
ciate that there is a method dependency when measuring ICL, there
is still a significant difference upon inclusion of a divot correction
when changing the surface brightness limit (Figure 8)."
"As a sanity check, to measure the BCG+ICL profile shape,
we fit elliptical isophotes using the IRAF ellipse package (Jedrze-
jewski 1987) centred on each cluster BCG, for both the pre- and
post- divot-corrected images. The frames are masked at µB,rest ="

median n values, with values of 4.65 and 4.57 for the non-corrected and
corrected models respectively."

ware having an inbuilt de-blending algorithm to separate object
fluxes (with the exception of the BCG itself, which is left unmasked
during this process). A stack of the resulting profiles is shown in
Figure 9. Interestingly, we do not find much deviation in shape
on average when applying a divot correction within the percentiles
of the stacks, which supports the comparable outputs we obtained
through our SIGMA models."
"Our results illustrate that one must consider their data care-
fully when attempting to measure ICL. Indeed, many authors have
recognised this issue and have attempted to overcome it by using"

ture) with respect to halo mass, MX,500. The BCG flux contributions from
Burke et al. (2015) (B15) have been plotted for comparison, which we dis-
cuss further in Section 6.3. It is clear that there is a strong anti-correlation
with halo mass (see text)."
"novel processing methods of their own, such as implementing less
‘aggressive’ global background subtraction techniques (often, for
example, using a larger mesh, e.g. Huang et al. 2018a, or, a mean
global ‘step’, e.g. Montes & Trujillo 2019)."
"We recognise that there are several obvious caveats with our
method; as aforementioned, surface-brightness methods of measur-
ing ICL tend to recover less flux than methods more readily avail-
able in simulations such as setting a binding energy threshold (e.g.
Rudick et al. 2011). Finally, we assume the location of the BCG to
be a proxy for the centre of the cluster when measuring the ICL;
for local systems, this is often the case (e.g. Lin & Mohr 2004),
however the picture has been known to change at high redshift,
with higher number of clusters out of dynamical relaxation at z > 1
(e.g. Hatch et al. 2011). Having outlined these caveats, we proceed
with the view that we have utilised a method which relies as little
as possible on parametric modelling; we refer the reader towards
arguments for our approach in Section 5.5 of this paper."
6.2 What Drives ICL Growth?
"To enable a more complete interpretation of our results, we per-
form a partial Spearman analysis on our sample of 18 clusters (see
Furnell et al. 2018 for method). The partial Spearman enables us
to account statistically for underlying correlations which may be
present through the means that we have selected our clusters. Here,
we choose four primary parameters of interest: the fractional con-
tribution of the ICL and of the BCG ( fICL/ ftot and fBCG/ ftot respec-
tively), the cluster redshift (z) and the cluster mass MX,500 (which
is computed from the X-ray temperature, as detailed in Section
2). We also look at correlations between k-corrected BCG abso-
lute magnitude, cluster mass and redshift via a similar means. We
hold our significance at the standard value of p ≤ 0.05 throughout
(log10[ps] ≤ −1.301). The full Spearman analysis for our clusters is
contained in Table 5; the partial analysis can be found in Appendix
B (Tables 3-6)."
"As aforementioned, in the rest-frame B-band, we find a mean
ICL flux fraction of around 24%; this exceeds the mean BCG con-"

of the trend for the highest redshift system at z = 0.501. This is
not a definitive conclusion, in that we are obviously limited by our
small sample size (18 systems) as is the case for most legacy stud-
ies of ICL (see references in the Introduction), alongside significant
caveats with assuming a fixed aperture scale when measuring the
fluxes of our BCGs. However, it raises interesting questions as to
what point in time the ICL begins to dominate the cluster halo (see

"In common with other authors (e.g. Burke et al. 2015 and up-
coming discussion), we detect a significant anti-correlation (rs =
−0.786, log10[ps] = −4.017) between the contribution of ICL with
cluster redshift, which remains almost entirely unchanged when
fixing for cluster mass (see Table 6 in the Appendix). This is clearly
visible on Figures 15 and 16, which we will discuss in Section 6.3.
This is not the case for the BCG flux fraction, which has no signifi-
cant correlation with redshift (rs = −0.153, log10[ps] = −0.275, see
Figure 11) and remains highly anti-correlated with the cluster mass
even after fixing for redshift (rs = −0.750, log10[ps] = −3.477,
see Table 5 in the Appendix and Figure 10). Even if we consider a
Sérsic model (which produces almost universally the largest BCG
fraction estimates) in place of an aperture magnitude for our BCGs,
there is still an anti-correlation present at fixed redshift that remains
almost unchanged (rs = −0.775, log10[ps] = −3.801), so the trend
is robust to the flux loss through not accounting for galaxy profile
wings."
"There is no strong correlation present, however, between the
ICL and the mass of the cluster at fixed redshift (rs = 0.126,
log10[ps] = from Table 5). This has an interesting implication, in
that our findings imply a much closer dependence between stars
within the very central region of the halo (BCG) with the halo prop-
erties (such as M500) in comparison to stellar mass distributed fur-
ther out (ICL). Indeed, with a lack of correlation present between"

of comprehension, we have inverted the y-axis. No significant trends are detected in our partial Spearman analysis between BCG magnitude with either redshift
of halo mass."
"halo mass and ICL mass, there seems to be a ‘decoupling’ between
the two components; the ICL, for instance, has been found to ex-
hibit far more growth since z ∼ 1 than the BCG (e.g. Burke et al.
2012, 2015), with BCG growth rates being much more modest than
those predicted from simulations."
"The leftmost panel of Figure 12 shows the relationship be-
tween the k-corrected BCG absolute magnitude (Mi, i-band aper-
ture, see Section 6.3) and cluster mass (MX,500). Although we de-
tect an anti-correlation between halo mass and absolute magni-
tude (which is anti-correlated with BCG mass), it is not significant
(rs = −0.40877, log10[ps] = −1.0785). This finding is also the case
if we fix for redshift (rs = −0.27456, log10[ps] = −0.56831). If
we remove the two points with the largest errorbars, it becomes
significant by our criteria, but still remains insignificant with fixed
redshift (rs = −0.48775, log10[ps] = −1.3094; rs = −0.37136,
log10[ps] = −0.80487 respectively). We therefore do not find con-
clusive evidence that our BCG absolute magnitudes (and therefore
masses) are strongly governed by halo mass here. This is likely to
be as a result of our selection (e.g. Burke et al. 2015) and also due
to the fact that our sample size is small. An obvious point would
therefore be to establish whether our result for the BCG flux frac-
tion with halo mass weakens when applying our method a larger
sample of clusters with an established MBCG − Mhalo relation; this
was also recognised in Burke et al. (2015)."
"We find a similar result for absolute magnitude with redshift
when fixing for halo mass (rs = −0.46034, log10[ps] = −1.2632,
see rightmost panel of Figure 12) even having removed the two
points with the largest error bars (rs = −0.31443, log10[ps] =
−0.62785); hence, we do not detect any significant change in BCG
brightness with redshift either. Although this may also be linked to
the way we have selected our BCGs, given numerous authors have
found little change in BCG brightnesses since z ∼ 1 (e.g. Whiley
et al. 2008, Collins et al. 2009, Stott et al. 2010), our result acts to
support trends found by other works using independent data sets."
6.3 Comparison with Other Studies
"We show the results from a number of other studies of ICL, from
both simulations and observations, in Figures 13−16 alongside
our results. Where relevant, we have included descriptions giv-
ing context to the results presented in the plots. The shorthand
for the observational studies shown in the legends of the plots is:
Gonzalez et al. (2013) (G13, parametric model) and Burke et al.
(2015) (B15, µB = 25 mag/arcsec2). Respectively, the shorthand
for the simulation-based studies presented in the legends of the
plots is: Puchwein et al. (2010) (P10, both with and without an
AGN feedback prescription applied), Rudick et al. (2011) (R11,
µV = 25 mag/arcsec2), Contini et al. (2014) (C14, disruption model
only) and Tang et al. (2018) (T18, µV = 24.7 mag/arcsec2, mock
SDSS r-band; closest to our own data). All observational masses
have been scaled from X-ray measurements (from either XMM
Newton or Chandra in the case of the majority of the CLASH clus-
ters) using the same scaling relation (Arnaud et al. 2005). In the
case of the CLASH sample, it is worth noting that clusters with
T > 5 keV have a ∼15% mass increase on average between values
computed from Chandra vs XMM-Newton data (see discussion in
DeMaio et al. 2018 and Mahdavi et al. 2013), however, scaling the
points does little to influence the interpretation of our comparisons
(see upcoming discussion). In the case of the theoretical studies, the
density contrast was scaled where necessary (e.g. from ρc = 200 to
ρc = 500) using the method outlined in Hu & Kravtsov (2003),
assuming an NFW profile with a concentration of 3."
"Figures 13 and 14 show the relationship between the
BCG+ICL fraction and the ICL fraction with cluster mass re-
spectively. In both cases, there is an obvious difference between
the results from simulations and observations, in that while the
observations qualitatively appear fairly consistent (see upcoming
discussion) the simulations appear to predict significantly larger
BCG+ICL (or ICL) contributions to the overall cluster light. The
exception here is Contini et al. (2014), whose results are con-
sistent with observations (Figure 14); their simulations are how-
ever semi-analytic rather than hydrodynamic. Although not plot-
ted here, larger BCG+ICL fractions than those seen observation-"

tion). With the exception of C14, there is a clear disagreement between the
observations and simulations."
"ally (60-80% compared with 1-60%) were also found by Cui et al.
(2014), who, using hydrodynamical simulations (for specifics, see
Bonafede et al. 2011), measured the BCG+ICL light using a V-
band surface brightness limit, similar to our own approach. Contini
et al. (2014) also found that their ICL fractions were also very sen-
sitive to AGN and supernova feedback; this is in contrast to Puch-
wein et al. (2010), as while the BCG+ICL fractions themselves are
similar, there was little difference found between the fractions de-
tected when an AGN model was used (see Figure 13). An exception
using simulations is Murante et al. (2007), who found a much lower
average fraction of ICL with respect to halo mass (∼ 22%) in a sim-
ilar mass range to that of the CLASH clusters (1014 − 1015 M�);
however, they found a positive correlation between halo mass and
the fraction of ICL, which has not been seen observationally. In"
"fact, the opposite has increasingly been reported, with lower mass
haloes found to be more ‘efficient’ producers of stellar mass than
large clusters (e.g. Figure 8 of Tang et al. 2018, simulations; De-
Maio et al. 2018 and Erfanianfar et al. 2019, both observations)."
"Results for the ICL light fraction with respect to the overall
cluster from numerical simulations and SAMs appear generally to
be more self-consistent than those obtained observationally (e.g.
for our work, 20-40%, see Contini et al. 2014, Rudick et al. 2011
for some typical SAM results). Barai et al. (2009), using a numer-
ical prescription, simulated the build-up of intracluster stars using
several different cluster mass profiles (e.g. Perseus-like to Virgo-
like) while considering the morphology of the galaxies contained
within the cluster (e.g. if the BCG was a cD-type). They found
mean ICL fractions of ∼ 25% for a Virgo- or Perseus-like system,
compared with much higher fractions (∼ 40%) for an NFW model;
they also found a dependence of the ICL fraction on the morphol-
ogy of the BCG (with cD-type BCGs leading to generally more
centrally-concentrated ICL profiles). Henriques & Thomas (2010),
building on the semi-analytic study of BCG mass growth of De
Lucia & Blaizot (2007), included a prescription for ICL (tidal dis-
ruption and dynamical friction); they found a mean fraction of ICL
of around 18%, with a positive correlation between the ICL fraction
and the halo mass of the cluster. Contini et al. (2014) used dark mat-
ter haloes from the Millennium Simulation, coupled with several
simple dynamical models (e.g. mergers, disruption, tidal stripping),
finding results similar to observations in Gonzalez et al. (2013) (and
indeed, our own), with no correlation with halo mass."
"Here, we detect no strong trend between halo mass and the
fraction of ICL (as is the case in Burke et al. 2015); it is there-
fore possible that any gradients present in Figure 13 are driven by
the strong anti-correlation between the BCG flux fraction and halo
mass established in Section 6, as they are not present with the ICL
fraction itself. Toledo et al. (2011) also find little evidence dynam-
ically for any strong relation between the BCG+ICL fraction with
cluster mass for a single cluster at z ∼ 0.3, acquiring a total fraction
of ∼ 70% in line with the low-z (z < 0.1) results of Gonzalez et al.
(2007), though higher than the latter’s 2013 revisited study (Gon-
zalez et al. 2013, see Figures 13-15) and indeed, our own work.
Our results with respect to halo mass are fairly consistent observa-
tionally with the other studies presented in Figures 13 and 14, with
the ∼ 24% ICL fraction and ∼ 41% BCG+ICL fraction seen here
comparable with the respective results of Burke et al. (2015) and
Gonzalez et al. (2013). As discussed at length however in the Intro-
duction, observational results for ICL dramatically vary in general,
with a dependence on the data used and the measurement approach
(see Figure 8 of Tang et al. 2018)."
"Tang et al. (2018) investigated the limitations of measuring
ICL from optical imaging data using hydrodynamical simulations.
Although their ICL result differs significantly from our own and
that of Burke et al. (2015), their findings on the causes of what
effects drive scatter in ICL measurements are arguably far more in-
teresting. Using simulated images of their clusters, they produced
mock images with numerous observational differences, such as
band, pixel size, surface brightness limit and PSF size. They found
a clear effect from the PSF, finding that large PSFs lead to greater
smoothing and a slightly higher ICL fraction (5-10%, see upcom-
ing discussion). They also found a band dependence on the ICL
fraction, finding that the r-band yielded a much larger ICL fraction
(∼ 2×) even when using the same equivalent V-band surface bright-
ness limit; they attribute this in their discussion to uncertainties in
their stellar population model of choice (Bruzual & Charlot 2003
with a Chabrier 2003 IMF). They also found that the surface bright-"
"MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2021)"
16 K. E. Furnell et al.
"ness limit also affected their ICL result, finding a doubling in the
amount of ICL detected between 23.0 < µV < 26.5 for low redshift
haloes (also observed in Cui et al. 2014, from whom their method
for generating mock images was derived). Finally Tang et al. (2018)
also found a clear dependence of cosmological dimming on their
ICL, finding an increase in the relative fraction of ICL up to z ∼ 1
when accounting for surface brightness dimming (see rightmost
panel of their Figure 6). Their results suggest a clear motivation for
more studies of this kind, as such a result has unexpected conse-
quences regarding the current widely-accepted paradigm of BCG-
ICL co-evolution (see Introduction), given it is canonically thought
that the period 0 < z < 1 is an era of rapid ICL growth, with little
changes in the luminosity of the BCG."
"The theoretical studies presented here also obviously differ
enormously in their methodology, with some using methods to esti-
mate ICL that are not observationally feasible (such as tracking star
particles). It is, however, curious that despite more complex phys-
ical models being included in hydrodynamical simulations, they
generally seem to struggle to reproduce ICL fractions with clus-
ter mass in contrast to either a simple numerical or semi-analytic
prescription. This therefore presents a challenge to these modern
simulation suites and an opportunity for further analysis to better
understand the reasons behind these differences, such as the effects
of subgrid size and the physical models used. Future studies resem-
bling this work with larger cluster samples (e.g. in the wake of the
Vera C. Rubin Observatory) will also help in our understanding of
these discrepancies."
"Figures 15 and 16 show the trend of our results with redshift,
for the BCG+ICL fraction and ICL fraction respectively. Although
we appear consistent with Gonzalez et al. (2013) in Figure 15, there
is some deviation present between our results and those presented
in Figure 16 (e.g. Burke et al. 2015), in that our fractions with red-
shift appear noticeably higher. Interestingly, however, there seems
to be no clear consensus overall, with the slopes of ICL growth dif-
fering clearly across studies. There may be several reasons as to
why this may be the case. Firstly, as noted in Tang et al. (2018), ob-
servational results are strongly influenced by several factors. The
PSF, for example, was found by Tang et al. (2018) to produce a
scatter of 5-10% in the total ICL fraction at a redshift range similar
to that explored here (0 < z < 0.4 from their Figure 3, µV = 26.5),
with a smaller PSF (such as those found using space-based obser-
vatories as in CLASH) and usually also produced smaller results
for the ICL fraction. They also found that measuring the ICL in a
redder passband (SDSS r) increased the fraction of ICL detected,
even when using the same equivalent threshold, by around a factor
of 2."
"The results from Tang et al. (2018) presented in Figure 16 rep-
resent an SDSS-like, V-band image with the ICL measured using
an isophote of µV = 24 mag/arcsec2, with cosmological surface
brightness dimming not being taken into account. This corresponds
to a growth factor of ∼ 3, similar to what we observe. As previ-
ously mentioned, Tang et al. (2018) do not actually find any phys-
ical growth of the ICL over cosmic time; in fact, they find the ICL
contribution to dramatically shrink with decreasing redshift. This
result sets them starkly apart from most other theoretical studies,
which, within the redshift range explored in this work, find frac-
tional increases in the ICL relatively consistent with our own of
1.5-4 (e.g. Willman et al. 2004; Murante et al. 2007; Rudick et al.
2011; Contini et al. 2014)."
"Some of the observational reasons outlined in Tang et al.
(2018) may partially account for the difference we see between our
results and the results of Burke et al. (2015). We have, for example,"
"Figure 15. Comparison of the relative fluxes of ICL+BCG versus redshift,
with the points from Gonzalez et al. (2013) (G13)."
"Figure 16. As in Figure 15, but for ICL flux only. The legend key is as
follows: Burke et al. (2015) (B15), Rudick et al. (2011) (R11) and Tang et al.
(2018) (T18). The best least-squares fit has been included for comparison
(slope = -54.50, intercept = +40.01)."
"larger k-corrections due to our use of a redder band (HSC-i); test-
ing EZGAL using the bands used in CLASH (F606W, F626, F775,
F850LP) with an identical stellar evolution model however pro-
duced similar results to Burke et al. (2015), with the same trends.
Our data is also ground-based with a larger PSF (< FWHM >∼
0.56′′ for HSC, see Aihara et al. 2018b), which we correct for when
fitting profiles (but we do not deconvolve our data when computing
ICL); the effect of this on recovering the magnitudes in HSC-SSP-
Wide data was investigated in detail by Huang et al. (2018a), where
they determined a 10-18% margin of error in i-band magnitudes at
25th mag (see also Huang et al. 2018b). HSC-SSP-Deep is ∼ 1 mag-
nitude deeper than that of CLASH (where, as noted in Burke et al.
2015, a difference in 0.5 magnitudes in survey depth results in a
5-10% reduction in the amount of measured ICL component). Our
values are, of course, also divot-corrected."
"One of the biggest differences we observe is that of the frac-
tional contribution of the BCG, in that ours are far larger than those"
"MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2021)"
Intracluster Light in XCS-HSC 17
"stated in Burke et al. (2015) (∼ 19% compared to ∼ 5%, see Figure
12). It is not clear from Burke et al. (2015) whether the fractions
are measured relative to a set absolute cluster radius (here, RX,500
in kpc); however, using a radius of R500, similar low BCG fractions
are seen in Burke et al. (2012) (2-4% depending on whether a de
Vaucouleurs model or 50 kpc aperture is used). This differs signifi-
cantly from numerous other works, with which our BCG fractional
contribution to the overall cluster light is more consistent; it is, for
example, comparable to Zibetti et al. (2005) at z ∼ 0.25, who fit de
Vaucouleurs profiles and measure the relative fractions contained
within a fixed radius of 500 kpc centred on the BCG. A BCG stel-
lar mass contribution to the overall halo of around 15-40% was
also noted by Shan et al. (2015), as well as in Seigar et al. (2007).
The CLASH sample constitutes especially massive systems, with
the range of cluster masses representing the larger end of the clus-
ter population (∼ 1015 M�); no overlap is present with our sample.
As other authors have shown (e.g. Andreon 2010, Erfanianfar et al.
2019), there appears to be an increasing inefficiency in stellar mass
production with increasing halo mass, particularly with respect to
the BCG."
"There is also the added issue of how CLASH data was opti-
mised for science, in that its original focus was specifically to study
the lensed and high-z Universe, rather than LSB science (Postman
et al. 2012). The background subtraction method is therefore gen-
erally more aggressive than ideal (although there is a focus on
lensing in HSC, there is also an LSB science focus and a great
deal of pipeline refinement in preparation for the Vera C. Rubin
Observatory). In addition, HST’s ACS has a far smaller field of
view (∼ 3.36′) than HSC (∼ 1.5◦), as well as a very small associ-
ated dither pattern in CLASH. The majority of the clusters within
CLASH (given their redshift) therefore would fill the majority of a
frame (for example, a cluster with a radius of 0.7 Mpc at z = 0.4 has
an angular extent of 2.2′, assuming our concordance cosmology).
This implies that it is unlikely that the true background is reached
(i.e. that there is little available sky with respect to source), lead-
ing to an overestimate of the background. As a further example, the
‘missing flux’ issue with HST WFC3 (which has a smaller FOV
than the ACS at 2.7′) data was explored in detail in Borlaff et al.
(2019), who produced a pipeline to re-reduce Hubble Ultra-Deep
Field data (Beckwith et al. 2006); they found, when re-reduced, an
integrated magnitude of recovered light of ∼ 20 mag, which they
state is comparable to the brightest galaxies in the field. Although
Borlaff et al. (2019) did not apply their method to the CLASH data,
it is likely, given the comparable observational and data-reduction
methodology, that it suffers from the same issue. This issue in par-
ticular may well be a large factor in the difference between the
results of Burke et al. (2015) and our own. With its larger FOV,
HSC SSP DR1 is more appropriate for LSB science (see, for ex-
ample, Figure 5 of Aihara et al. 2018b); moreover, further pipeline
processing improvements have been made with the release of DR2
(see, for example, discussions in Aihara et al. 2019). Work is cur-
rently underway to establish how effective the DR2 pipeline will
be for the deeper data stream from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory
(e.g. Watkins et al., in prep.)."
7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
"In this work, we measured the ICL in 18 XCS-HSC clusters along-
side consideration of two systematics: background contribution and
sky over-subtraction. We discussed the sample of clusters in XCS
used in this work and how they were selected; we also discussed the"
"HSC-SSP survey, the current processing pipeline and the photom-
etry used. We outlined how we measured our ICL, using an equiv-
alent B-band isophotal threshold, measured within an aperture of
radius RX,500 centred on the brightest cluster galaxy. We introduced
the ‘divot’ problem, which arises due to an ‘over-subtraction’ of
flux from background estimation during image processing, and our
method to correct for this effect. Finally, we introduced a set of ba-
sic simulations to allow us to understand the flux contribution from
the background at a given mean surface brightness for an ICL-like
profile."
"We then presented our results alongside numerous other stud-
ies for comparison, from simulations and observations. We noted
a large degree of scatter, observationally (1-60% globally, 20-40%
for our sample) and theoretically (10-90%) for retrieved ICL frac-
tions. We then discussed at length some of the reasons as to why
such discrepancies may exist, such as the data used, the measure-
ment methodology, the simulation method and so on. Our primary
conclusions are as follows:"
"(i) there is a loss in ICL flux of about 4× the estimated back-
ground from the effects of sky over-subtraction, which remains
approximately constant ±1mag/arcsec2 about our lowest chosen
threshold. We surmised that this was likely to be an underestimate,
given the Sérsic models used when creating the divot corrections,"
"(ii) the divot corrections themselves do little to change the over-
all profile shape, with the 1-D profiles and parametric fits from
SIGMA respectively yielding very similar results,"
"(iii) we detect no significant correlation between BCG absolute
magnitude and redshift when fixing for halo mass. We also find
the fractional contribution of BCG light with respect to the overall
cluster light to be strongly anti-correlated with halo mass, inferring
that star-formation efficiency is inversely proportional to halo mass
(e.g. Erfanianfar et al. 2019),"
"(iv) we find no strong evidence that the contribution of ICL to
the overall stellar content of the cluster is strongly linked to halo
mass, in line with most recent simulations,"
"(v) the fraction of ICL light is not strongly linked to the frac-
tional contribution of the BCG (Section 6), indicating a ‘decou-
pling’ between the two components (e.g. DeMaio et al. 2018),"
"(vi) while finding generally higher fractions with redshift, we
find the ICL to grow by a factor of ∼ 2-4 between 0.1 < z < 0.5,
slightly more modest than the factor of 4-5 in clusters over a sim-
ilar range in redshift from Burke et al. (2015) albeit with a higher
scatter (rms fICL/ ftot ∼ 10%),"
"(vii) we find a significant difference generally between hydro-
dynamical stellar mass fractions of ICL and BCG+ICL in clusters
at a given halo mass, with the simulations almost always over-
predicting the contribution (even when measured in an observa-
tionally consistent way). Numerical and SAM based simulations,
however, yield results closer to our observations."
"Our work supports the current scenario of relatively rapid ICL
build-up since z ∼ 0.5, with BCGs remaining relatively unchanged
with respect to absolute magnitude. There is also, as has been
the case for most observational studies, discrepancies present be-
tween simulations. From the evidence presented here, it seems that
a far greater understanding of the observational effects involved is
needed (e.g. surface brightness limit used, band used, whether a
BCG+ICL model fit is used and PSF size), given that such effects,
as noted in Tang et al. (2018), can change the ICL result obtained
by a factor of 2."

"the coming decade (such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which
promises frequent periodic imaging of the whole southern sky cou-
pled with an enormous FOV of 9.62 deg2, see Ivezic et al. 2008 and
Brough et al. 2020), studies will be more readily able to untangle
the degeneracies, for example, between a detection of ICL growth
and the effect of surface brightness dimming. For now, however,
our results support the paradigm of ICL growth being the dominant
stellar evolutionary component in galaxy clusters since z ∼ 1."

"It was realised when carrying out the isophotal method of measuring ICL
flux that choice of measurement band may potentially be a concern. Montes
(2019) point out that measuring the ICL in bluer bands can lead to a stronger
redshift trend than reality, due to the rapid fade of bluer stellar populations
at high redshifts. Although we measure all clusters in the HSC i-band, we k-
correct to the B-band, so performed a check on how this effect may influence
our results via looking at the trend of the square root of the isophotal areas
of the cluster BCGs (i.e. an approximation of the radius beyond which the
ICL is considered for our clusters), normalised by the RX,500 value of each
cluster (to account for cluster size) with redshift."
"The result is shown in Figure 1. There is a large amount of scatter, and
the corresponding Spearman rank does not show evidence for a significant
correlation here (rs = 0.11, p = 0.66). Studies with larger sample sizes
may help clarify whether isophotal methods at different wavebands must
consider this effect more carefully when interpreting their results."
