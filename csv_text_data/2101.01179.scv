ABSTRACT
"Context. Transition discs are expected to be a natural outcome of the interplay between photoevaporation and giant planet formation.
Massive planets reduce the inflow of material from the outer to the inner disc, therefore triggering an earlier onset of disc dispersal due
to photoevaporation through a process known as Planet-Induced PhotoEvaporation (PIPE). In this case, a cavity is formed as material
inside the planetary orbit is removed by photoevaporation, leaving only the outer disc to drive the migration of the giant planet.
Aims. We investigate the impact of photoevaporation on giant planet migration and focus specifically on the case of transition discs
with an evacuated cavity inside the planet location. This is important for determining under what circumstances photoevaporation is
efficient at halting the migration of giant planets, thus affecting the final orbital distribution of a population of planets.
Methods. For this purpose, we use 2D FARGO simulations to model the migration of giant planets in a range of primordial and transition
discs subject to photoevaporation. The results are then compared to the standard prescriptions used to calculate the migration tracks
of planets in 1D planet population synthesis models.
Results. The FARGO simulations show that once the disc inside the planet location is depleted of gas, planet migration ceases. This
contradicts the results obtained by the impulse approximation, which predicts the accelerated inward migration of planets in discs that
have been cleared inside the planetary orbit.
Conclusions. These results suggest that the impulse approximation may not be suitable for planets embedded in transition discs. A
better approximation that could be used in 1D models would involve halting planet migration once the material inside the planetary
orbit is depleted of gas and the surface density at the 3:2 mean motion resonance location in the outer disc reaches a threshold value
of 0.01 g cm−2."

1. Introduction
"Giant planet migration is regarded as a natural outcome of the
gravitational interaction between a forming planet and the sur-
rounding gas in the planet-forming disc. While the existence
of this process was predicted more than 40 years ago (Lin &
Papaloizou 1979; Goldreich & Tremaine 1979, 1980), its im-
portance for planet formation theories was only realised with
the first discoveries of the so-called hot Jupiters (e.g. Mayor &
Queloz 1995). These Jupiter-like planets with orbital periods of
P < 15 d (Wang et al. 2015) are considered to be direct evidence
of planet migration having taken place. Their in situ formation
at such small distances to their host stars is unlikely (see, how-
ever, Batygin et al. 2016, and Boley et al. (2016) for alternative
explanations), suggesting that these planets generally formed in
the outer parts of the planet-forming disc and migrated inwards
during their evolution (e.g. Dawson & Johnson 2018)."
"In the last few years, scattered light and (sub-)millimetre sur-
veys have provided observations of circumstellar discs with dif-
ferent substructures, such as rings (e.g. ALMA Partnership et al.
2015; van Boekel et al. 2017), spirals (e.g. Benisty et al. 2015;
Dong et al. 2018; Muro-Arena et al. 2020), or shadows (e.g.
Benisty et al. 2017; Walsh et al. 2017). While there is a range
of mechanisms that can potentially explain these substructures,
such as gas pressure bumps at ice lines (e.g. Zhang et al. 2015;"
"Okuzumi et al. 2016; Owen 2020), photoevaporation (e.g. Er-
colano et al. 2017), or non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
effects (e.g. Hu et al. 2019), the deep gaps and other substruc-
tures in many of these systems are commonly believed to have
been carved by nascent planets (e.g. Paardekooper & Mellema
2004; Picogna & Kley 2015; Dipierro & Laibe 2017; Zhang et al.
2018; Veronesi et al. 2020). The discovery of the two young, ac-
creting protoplanets PDS 70b and PDS 70c (Keppler et al. 2018;
Müller et al. 2018; Haffert et al. 2019) proved that giant planets
can indeed form early and that gaps and rings in so-called tran-
sition discs may offer potential indirect evidence for embedded
planets (Rosotti et al. 2016; Sanchis et al. 2020) and possibly
also for their migration (Meru et al. 2019; Nazari et al. 2019;
Pérez et al. 2019)."
"Independently of when exactly giant planet formation sets
in, the dispersal of the gas-phase of planet-forming discs sets not
only a strict upper limit to the planet formation timescale (Pol-
lack et al. 1996), but also to planet migration as this is the result
of the exchange of angular momentum between the planet and
the gas in the disc. As the migration timescale of giant planets
(typically ∼ 105 yr, cf. Kley & Nelson 2012) has been shown to
be much shorter than the observed lifetimes of planet-forming
discs (typically ∼ 106 yr, cf. Haisch et al. 2001; Mamajek 2009;
Fedele et al. 2010; Ribas et al. 2014, 2015), this elucidates the"

"necessity of formulating planet formation theories in combina-
tion with disc dispersal mechanisms."
"It is commonly believed that planet-forming discs disperse
via a combination of viscous accretion and disc winds, possibly
launched due to internal photoevaporation by the host star. Theo-
retical models predict that viscous accretion dominates for most
of the disc lifetime, until the accretion rates can no longer match
the mass-loss rate due to disc winds, which will finally disperse
the disc quickly on a timescale of a few hundred thousand years
from the inside out (Alexander et al. 2014; Ercolano & Pas-
cucci 2017). The evolution of young stars on colour-colour di-
agrams of nearby star-forming regions is indeed consistent with
the prediction of a fast inside-out dispersal phase (Ercolano et al.
2009b, 2011; Koepferl et al. 2013)."
"Models show that the gas is heated and finally unbound, pre-
dominantly by soft X-rays (0.1 keV ≤ E ≤ 1 keV) emitted by
the host star so that over a range of disc radii a vigorous disc
wind is established and eventually a gap opens up in the disc.
This decouples the inner from the outer disc, so that the former
drains viscously onto the central star, while the latter is photoe-
vaporated away from the inside out (Ercolano et al. 2008, 2009a;
Owen et al. 2010, 2011, 2012). The influence of extreme ul-
traviolet radiation (EUV, 13.6 eV ≤ E ≤ 0.1 keV) on the final
mass-loss rates is expected to be negligible due to the fact that
EUV photons are readily absorbed by atomic hydrogen in the
disc atmosphere, and thus have a much smaller penetration depth
(Ercolano et al. 2008, but see also Wang & Goodman (2017)
and Nakatani et al. (2018)). The notion that the EUV luminosi-
ties impinging on protoplanetary discs are low compared to soft
X-rays has also been observationally confirmed (Pascucci et al.
2014). Internal photoevaporation rates driven by far ultraviolet
emission (FUV, 6 eV ≤ E ≤ 13.6 eV) yield comparable mass-
loss rates of ∼ 10−8 M� yr−1 to the XEUV-models (Gorti et al.
2009; Gorti & Hollenbach 2009), depending on the assumption
made for the small grain population in the disc atmospheres.
However, no hydrodynamical calculations exist to date for in-
ternal photoevaporation driven by FUV, and thus the mass-loss
profiles, Σ̇wind, and mass-loss rates, Ṁwind, still need to be con-
firmed by future calculations."
"It has been numerically shown that disc dispersal via photoe-
vaporative winds can strongly affect the migration of giant plan-
ets and therefore ultimately leave an imprint in their final semi-
major axis distribution (Alexander & Armitage 2009; Alexan-
der & Pascucci 2012; Ercolano & Rosotti 2015; Jennings et al.
2018). These works also show that the final orbital distribution of
giant planets strongly depends on the radial profile of the mass-
loss rates. It is thus in principle possible, within the limitation of
the numerical models (see the discussions in Ercolano & Rosotti
2015, and Jennings et al. (2018)), to observe an imprint of the
disc dispersal phase in the present-day giant planet orbital dis-
tribution. Monsch et al. (2019) made a first attempt at finding
possible signatures of X-ray driven photoevaporation (XPE) in
the observational exoplanet data, presumably established in the
disc dispersal phase and driven by the highly energetic radiation
emitted by the host star. To this aim, they looked for a possible
link between the X-ray properties of stars hosting giant planets
and their corresponding semi-major axis distribution. They as-
sembled a catalogue of the stellar X-ray luminosities and found a
suggestive void in the Lx versus semi-major axis plane. This void
could be qualitatively explained as a consequence of disc disper-
sal via XPE, which stops giant planet migration at a given place
in the disc for a given range of Lx. However, due to the small
sample size, the statistical significance of this feature could not
be proven with the data set at that time. Monsch et al. (2019) ar-"
"gued that, without having a significant increase in observational
data points, accurate numerical models are required to predict
the location and/or size of this gap a priori, in order to prove its
statistical significance."
"For such purposes, 1D planet population synthesis models
are an ideal tool as they allow us to assess the impact of a range
of different initial conditions on the final architecture of plan-
etary systems (cf. Benz et al. 2014, and Mordasini (2018), for
reviews). However, several simplifications have to be assumed
in such models to be able to run a statistically significant amount
of simulations, ultimately limiting their predictive power. In par-
ticular, approximating a three-dimensional problem to 1D is the
largest source of error since it requires the description of geomet-
rically complex problems like angular momentum exchange be-
tween the gas disc and the planet in one dimension. This is gener-
ally achieved through prescriptions derived from more complex
multi-dimensional hydrodynamical calculations."
"One of these prescriptions is the so-called impulse approxi-
mation (Lin & Papaloizou 1979), which is used to approximate
the torques that are exerted by the gaseous disc on a planet. Since
it yields the correct scaling as more complicated treatments (e.g.
Trilling et al. 1998), it has been widely used in 1D planet pop-
ulation synthesis approaches to model the migration of planets
embedded in gaseous discs (cf. Lubow & Ida 2010, and Kley
& Nelson (2012), for reviews). In our case, this regime cor-
responds to so-called type II migration, in which the planet is
entrained in the viscous flow of the gas, therefore migrating at
the viscous accretion speed. However, the classical paradigm of
type II migration has recently been questioned, suggesting that
the migration rate of the planet is not locked to the disc’s vis-
cous evolution (Duffell et al. 2014; Dürmann & Kley 2015, and
Kanagawa et al. (2018); however, see also Robert et al. (2018)).
While the impulse approximation yields reasonable results for
many disc-planet systems, its accuracy for more complex con-
figurations, in which the 2D structure of the disc may be of rele-
vance, still needs to be tested and adapted as, for example, by Liu
et al. (2017), who studied the migration process of Super Earths
trapped at the magnetospheric cavity of the planet-forming disc
and are therefore subject to one-sided torques."
"Using 2D hydrodynamical FARGO simulations, Rosotti et al.
(2013, 2015) studied the interplay of giant planet formation and
disc dispersal via XPE, concluding that giant planets may trigger
the faster onset of disc dispersal by reducing the mass inflow into
the inner disc. This effect was referred to as Planet-Induced Pho-
toEvaporation (PIPE). The disc around TW Hya may be a pos-
sible example of PIPE taking place as the planet, which might
have carved the outer rings in the disc observed with ALMA
(Andrews et al. 2016), may have also triggered the onset of pho-
toevaporation that has cleared the disc at small radii (Ercolano
et al. 2017). However, Rosotti et al. (2013, 2015) did not inves-
tigate in detail which effect this would have on the migration
process of planets."
"In this paper, we extend the work by Rosotti et al. (2013) and
investigate how the interplay of XPE and planet formation may
affect giant planet migration. The aim is to assess whether the
commonly employed impulse approximation in 1D models can
correctly describe the migration of giant planets in photoevap-
orating discs. For this purpose, we perform 2D FARGO simula-
tions to compare migration tracks of giant planets embedded in
primordial discs to those embedded in transition discs for which
the disc inside the planet has been cleared (for example by PIPE).
These are then compared to results obtained from 1D simulations
with the same input parameters that employ the impulse approx-
imation."

"The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe
the 1D and 2D simulations used for this study. Section 3 sum-
marises and discusses the results, while Section 4 highlights the
limitations of our numerical model. In Section 5 we draw our
conclusions and propose how planet migration in transition discs
formed by PIPE could be handled in 1D planet population syn-
thesis approaches."
2. Methods
"To investigate the impact of photoevaporation on giant planet
migration, we made use of both 1D and 2D simulations to com-
pare migration tracks from the impulse approximation to those
obtained from the full treatment of the underlying disc torques
in two dimensions. Our study therefore only concerns the late
phases of disc evolution, meaning when disc dispersal is tak-
ing place, assuming that the planet has already formed. In each
of these approaches, we considered both primordial and transi-
tion discs formed by PIPE. Considering the former, we sought
to study the impact of photoevaporation on the overall migration
history of the planet, while considering the latter, we specifically
investigated the process of giant planet migration in discs with
an evacuated cavity inside the planetary orbit, so that the planet
is only subject to one-sided torques acting from a rather massive
outer disc."
2.1. X-ray photoevaporation model
"We employed the XPE profile with an EUV component from the
recent radiation-hydrodynamical calculations by Picogna et al.
(2019) and refer the reader to that work for more details on
the underlying physical model. It improves on previous work by
Owen et al. (2010, 2011, 2012) by parameterising the tempera-
ture as a function of local gas properties and the column density
to the star. This results in an almost twice higher mass-loss rate
compared to Owen et al. (2012) and differences in the radial pro-
file of the mass-loss rate. Wölfer et al. (2019) present X-ray pho-
toevaporation models for carbon-depleted discs, predicting even
more vigorous winds with radially extended profiles. Studying
the migration of giant planets in X-ray photoevaporated, carbon-
depleted discs is, however, beyond the scope of this paper and
will be attempted in future work. While photoevaporative winds
are expected to be dusty (Franz et al. 2020), the remaining dust
in the disc is not likely to affect giant planet migration signifi-
cantly (see Benítez-Llambay & Pessah 2018, for a study on the
impact of dust on the migration of low-mass planets)."
"The strength of the photoevaporative mass-loss rate is pri-
marily determined by the stellar X-ray luminosity, which typ-
ically reaches highly elevated levels for young T Tauri stars
compared to their main-sequence counterparts (e.g. Feigelson &
Montmerle 1999). We used the X-ray luminosity function deter-
mined for the Taurus molecular cloud by Güdel et al. (2007) and
scale this to a stellar mass of 0.7 M�, with a resulting median of
Lx = 1.1×1030 erg s−1. To cover the intrinsic scatter of X-ray lu-
minosities of T Tauri stars for a given stellar mass, we considered
two values for the X-ray luminosity in the simulations presented
here, namely Lx = 2.7× 1029 erg s−1 and Lx = 1.1× 1030 erg s−1."
"Picogna et al. (2019) present different mass-loss profiles for
primordial and transition discs, which we included in our cal-
culations. These profiles are described in detail in Appendix A.
For most of the disc lifetime, the viscous accretion rate onto the
star (∼ 10−8 M� yr−1 at 1 Myr, cf. Hartmann et al. (1998)) ex-
ceed the mass-loss rate due to photoevaporation, which for the
above stated X-ray luminosities of Lx = 2.7 × 1029 erg s−1 and"
"Lx = 1.1× 1030 erg s−1, reaches values of 5.6× 10−9 M� yr−1 and
1.8 × 10−8 M� yr−1. After the viscous accretion rate drops below
the wind mass-loss rate, photoevaporation will open a gap in the
disc, and cut off the inner disc from further mass supply from the
outer disc. While the inner disc drains viscously onto the central
star, the outer disc is irradiated directly by the stellar X-rays as
soon as the column density of the remaining material inside the
gap becomes less than the maximum X-ray penetration depth of
roughly 2.5 × 1022 cm−2 (Ercolano et al. 2009a; Picogna et al.
2019). At this point the switch between the primordial and tran-
sition disc profile is performed in our models."
2.2. 1D model using impulse approximation
"To model the migration of a giant planet in an XEUV-irradiated
disc following the impulse approximation, we used the 1D vis-
cous evolution code SPOCK (Ercolano & Rosotti 2015). We fol-
lowed a similar setup as described by Ercolano & Rosotti (2015)
and refer the reader to their work for more details on the numer-
ical model, which we will only briefly summarise."
"We modelled a planet-forming disc evolving under the influ-
ence of viscosity and X-ray photoevaporation from the host star
with a mass of 0.7 M� and assumed an initial disc surface density
profile of"
"Σ(R, t = 0) =
Md(t = 0)"
"2πRsR
exp"
")
, (1)"
"where Σ(R, t) is the gas surface density of the disc and R the
distance from the star. Eq. 1 follows from the self-similarity so-
lution of the diffusion equation using a time-independent power-
law scaling of the disc radius with the kinematic viscosity, ν ∝
Rγ, assuming γ = 1 (cf. Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974; Hartmann
et al. 1998). We used an initial disc mass of Md(0) = 0.07 M�
with a disc scaling radius of Rs = 18 au, which defines the initial
disc size and sets the viscous timescale of the disc (Alexander &
Armitage 2009). Following the standard α-prescription (Shakura
& Sunyaev 1973), viscosity is defined as ν = αcsH, where cs
is the sound speed of the gas, H the disc scale height and α
a dimensionless parameter. We used α = 6.9 × 10−4, which is
consistent with models treating realistic hydrodynamical turbu-
lence (Picogna et al. 2018), resulting in a viscous timescale of
tν = 7×105 yr at Rs. This combination of viscosity and disc scal-
ing radius were chosen such that a population of discs subject
to XPE from stars with an observationally motivated X-ray lu-
minosity (cf. Sect. 2.1) have a mean disc lifetime of a few Myr
as suggested by observations of young stellar clusters (Haisch
et al. 2001; Mamajek 2009; Fedele et al. 2010; Ribas et al. 2014,
2015)."

term deals with the migration of the planet due to the torques
exerted from the gas in the disc (e.g. Lin & Papaloizou 1986),
and finally, the last term is the mass-loss due to photoevapora-
tion (described by Eq. A.1 and Eq. A.4). Here, M? is the stellar
mass, G the gravitational constant and Λ is the rate of angular
momentum transfer per unit mass from the planet to the disc."

"Eq. 2 is discretised on a grid of nr = 1000 radial cells equis-
paced in R1/2, extending from 0.04 au to 104 au."
"A fully formed planet of Mp = 1 MJ was then inserted
at 5 au into the disc once it had reached a surface density of
Σ0 = 10 g cm−2 or 100 g cm−2 at the planet insertion location.
At this point the resolution was increased to nr = 4000 and our
simulations were divided into two sets - primordial and transi-
tion discs. In the former, the planet was inserted into the full
disc, and was left to evolve undisturbed following disc-planet
interactions. In the latter, as soon as the planet was inserted, we
set the surface density to the floor value of Σfloor = 10−8 g cm−2
inside the planet location to manually create transition discs with
an evacuated inner cavity, such as would be formed by PIPE."
"Planetary accretion was modelled following Eq. 5 in Veras &
Armitage (2004) and took place in both sets of our simulations,
regardless of the inner disc being cleared or not. The planet then
migrated at a rate given by the impulse approximation (Lin &

"where H is the disc scale height. ∆p corresponds to the impact
parameter that ensures that material closer than one disc scale

"The simulations were stopped once the disc had been dis-
persed, or the planets reached a = 0.15 au as we do not attempt
to model the interaction with the magnetospheric cavity. Table 1
summarises the initial conditions used for the 1D model, which
are the same for both the primordial and transition disc simula-
tions. The only parameters that were varied in the 1D simula-
tions are the initial surface density of the disc, Σ0, and the X-ray
luminosity of the star, Lx."
2.3. 2D FARGO simulations
"To study the interaction of a giant planet embedded in an X-ray
irradiated disc in 2D, we used a modified version of the hydrody-
namical grid code FARGO (Masset 2000), in which we included
XPE. Before the planet is inserted, no detailed calculations of
the disc structure are required due to the axis-symmetry of the
system, which substantially reduces the computational expense
of the simulations. However, once the planet is formed, this axis-
symmetry will break as the planet induces spiral density waves
and eventually carves a gap. Therefore, following the approach
described in Rosotti et al. (2013), we used the surface density"

"by Eq. 1 that was used in the 1D simulations. However, we
tested that Eq. 6 correctly reproduces the surface density profile
from SPOCK in the smaller radial domain modelled with FARGO
at the time of planet insertion. Following the 1D simulations,
we considered two different values of Σ0, namely 10 g cm−2 and
100 g cm−2, while we kept the remaining parameters, unless oth-
erwise stated, fixed to their default values. Further we assumed
locally isothermal discs with a constant aspect ratio of h = 0.1
and a flaring index of f = 0.25, resulting in a mildly flared disc:
H/R = 0.1R0.25."
"We modelled the disc from 0.4 au to 25 au with a resolution
of nr = 256 cells in radial and nθ = 388 cells in azimuthal di-
rection using logarithmic spacing, which yielded approximately
square cells at the planet location. This resolution was chosen in
order to allow for a long integration time, while being able to
probe the parameter space. We further performed a higher res-
olution simulation for comparison that gave similar results. We
applied ‘viscous outflow’ boundary conditions at both bound-
aries of the radial grid to impose a steady-state accretion flow
both from the outer boundary into the disc and from the inner
disc onto the central star (for details, see Eq. 11 in Kley et al.
2008). The magnitude of the flow’s radial velocity at the corre-
sponding boundary radius is determined by the viscosity param-
eter α that was set to the same value of α = 6.9 × 10−4 as in the
1D runs."

ginning of each time step and to prevent negative surface densi-

the disc. We considered the same X-ray luminosities as in the 1D
model, namely Lx = 2.7×1029 erg s−1 and Lx = 1.1×1030 erg s−1
for a stellar mass of 0.7 M�. However, to extract the impact of
photoevaporation onto planet migration, we also performed con-
trol simulations without photoevaporation. Equivalently to the
approach described in Sect. 2.2, we generated transition discs in
FARGO by setting the surface density inside the planet location to
the above stated floor value at the beginning of each transition
disc simulation."

grew to its final mass of 1 MJ following a mass-taper function

"and tramp−up = 10 orbits is the ramp-up time. We note that after
this step, the planet was not allowed to accrete any more disc
material. The implications of this approach on the reliability of
our results are discussed in detail in Sect. 4.2. The planet was
kept fixed for 1500 orbits in the primordial discs and 200 orbits
in the transition discs to 1) allow the planet to carve a deep gap
in the surface density and 2) to stabilise the torques acting on
the planet before it is allowed to migrate and photoevaporation
is switched on. This is illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows the az-
imuthally averaged surface density evolution of the primordial
and transition discs at different snapshots during the first orbits,
in which the planet was kept fixed. It can be seen that the disc, es-
pecially towards the outer boundaries, had reached a stable state
long before the planet was released. Table 2 summarises the ini-
tial conditions used for the FARGO simulations."

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Migration in primordial discs subject to XPE
"Fig. 2 shows the semi-major axis evolution of the planets embed-
ded in primordial discs, computed from SPOCK using the impulse
approximation (left) and from the full 2D treatment using FARGO
(right). Each line represents a different setup sampled from the
two different initial disc masses of Σ0 = 10 g cm−2 (‘low-mass
disc’) and Σ0 = 100 g cm−2 (‘high-mass disc’) as well as X-
ray luminosities of log10(Lx/erg s"
"−1) = 29.54 (‘low Lx’) and
log10(Lx/erg s"
"−1) = 30.04 (‘high Lx’), while the remaining pa-
rameters were kept constant."
"Due to the vigorous photoevaporative winds, planets embed-
ded in the low-mass discs with high X-ray luminosities are effec-
tively immediately parked once they are inserted into the disc.
This can be seen in the subplots in the upper right corners of
Fig. 2, that zoom in the corresponding parameter space. For this
setup, the final parking locations of the planets as well as the
timescales are comparable both in the 1D and 2D approach. In
SPOCK, the planet migrates by about 0.03 au within 3 × 104 yr,
while in FARGO it takes the planet only 104 yr to get parked at
4.84 au. If no photoevaporation-driven mass-loss is applied, all
planets migrate up to the inner radial boundary of the corre-
sponding radial grid for both modelled disc masses, demonstrat-
ing the efficiency of X-ray photoevaporation at stopping giant
planet migration."
"The most significant differences in the final planet park-
ing locations for both approaches can be observed for

"−1) = 29.54. In SPOCK, the planet is parked at
4.08 au after approximately 0.5 Myr for the low-mass disc, but
for Σ0 = 100 g cm−2 it migrates up to the inner radial bound-
ary within 1.2 Myr. This is explained by the fact that for the
latter approach, the accretion rate through the disc exceeds the"

"mass-loss rate due to photoevaporation, which is then unable to
remove the material around the planet that is responsible for the
torques that cause its inward migration. Qualitatively similar be-
haviour can be observed in the FARGO simulations, in which the
planet is stopped at 4.14 au after only 0.06 Myr in the low-mass
disc, while for the higher-mass disc significantly faster migra-
tion compared to SPOCK is observed. However, also in this case
the planet migrates up to the inner radial boundary in less than
0.05 Myr."
"Consequently, while the simulations in SPOCK and FARGO
both qualitatively confirm that planets are expected to migrate
less with higher X-ray luminosity of the host star and that higher
migration rates are obtained for more massive discs (as the
torques acting on the planet directly scale with the disc’s sur-
face density, cf. Lin & Papaloizou 1986), they also show that the
absolute timescales differ strongly in the two approaches. While
in FARGO the planets are parked in less than 0.3 Myr, in SPOCK
they span a broader range between a few 105 yr to ∼ 1.4 Myr.
These differences can be mainly related to the different extent
and surface density profile of the disc, but more importantly, to
the different disc evolution in both approaches. While it is pos-
sible to model the entire disc-planet system for its full lifetime
in 1D, in FARGO one has to limit the simulations to a smaller re-
gion close to the planet due to the higher computational expense
of the 2D simulations. The simplifications and uncertainties in-
volved in the 1D approach will be addressed in more detail in
Sect. 4, however we additionally refer the reader to the discus-
sion in Rosotti et al. (2013). Fig. 2 therefore shows that a direct
comparison between the timescales in 1D and 2D simulations
should be treated with caution."
"As mentioned above, photoevaporation is clearly more ef-
fective in the low-mass discs. Here, the migration history of the
planets and the final parking location are most dramatically af-
fected by this process. This finding is in agreement with recent
results by Wise & Dodson-Robinson (2018), who showed that
the impact of photoevaporation on parking planets is negligible,
if the ratio of the planet to disc mass is small, so that Mdisc � Mp.
This is obvious as in high-mass discs the accretion rates exceed
the photoevaporation rates such that any material removed by"
"photoevaporation is readily replaced so that the net effect on the
torques is then negligible. In this context it is however important
to address the role of viscosity. The accretion rate onto the star is
not directly driven by the disc mass itself, but by the disc viscos-
ity, which in turn is set by the α parameter, the disc scale height,
H, and the sound speed of the gas, cs. In our simulations, α was
kept constant while we explored a given range of disc masses.
Thus, the mass accretion rate scales with the surface density of
the disc, which in our simple case can be directly related to the
disc mass. Therefore, for a given value of α, the higher-mass
discs accrete at higher rates than the lower-mass discs and lie
well above the photoevaporative mass-loss rate. This means that
the latter has negligible influence on the surface density evolu-
tion of the high-mass disc, and thus on the torques exerted on
the planet. For completeness, we present the effect of different
α-viscosities on the migration of the planets for the case exam-
ple of Σ0 = 10 g cm−2 and log10(Lx/erg s"
"−1) = 29.54 in Ap-
pendix B. We find that applying different viscosities in our sim-
ulations does not change the overall conclusion of this paper.
However, it will certainly change the migration rates that are ob-
served for the individual planets and impact their final parking
location."
"In conclusion, for primordial discs the impulse approxima-
tion employed in SPOCK gives a reasonably good match for the
final parking locations in the low-mass discs compared to the
more realistic treatment with FARGO. There is, however, a larger
discrepancy for the higher-mass discs, where even in the control
simulations without photoevaporation, the migration is faster in
the 2D calculations. The main reason for this discrepancy is the
different disc evolution between the two approaches as well as
the interaction between the planet and the spiral arms that de-
velop in the 2D simulations. These provide local enhancements
to the torques acting on the planet that cannot be reproduced and
accounted for in axisymmetric 1D calculations. The spiral arms
induced by the planet can be seen in Fig. 3, which shows the
2D gas surface density distribution of the primordial disc with
Σ0 = 100 g cm−2 at orbit 1500, that is right before the planet is
released and photoevaporation is activated."

3.2. Migration of planets in primordial versus transition discs
"Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the semi-major axis evolution
for the primordial and transition discs, computed with SPOCK
and FARGO. Using the impulse approximation implemented in
SPOCK, planets embedded in transition discs generally migrate
farther inside than they do in primordial discs, except for the case
of 100 g cm−2 and log10(Lx/erg s"
"−1) = 29.54, where for both se-
tups the planet is stopped at the inner radial grid. However, in all
of the scenarios modelled in 1D, the planets embedded in tran-
sition discs show accelerated inward migration compared to the
planets in primordial discs. Naively, this behaviour may be ex-
pected due to the missing counteracting effect of the inner disc,
so that the relatively massive outer disc can push the planet in-
side at an increased migration speed. However, it becomes im-
mediately apparent from the more realistic FARGO simulations
that the migration of planets subject to one-sided torques only
exerted from an outer disc is not treated correctly using the im-
pulse approximation in 1D. The FARGO results show that the
planet migrates the farthest inside, if it is embedded in a pri-
mordial disc. In contrast to that, the planet migrates only weakly
if it is embedded in a transition disc. The magnitude of migra-
tion depends however on the initial disc mass and the strength
of the photoevaporative winds. While for Σ0 = 10 g cm−2 only
insignificant migration can be observed for both modelled X-
ray luminosities, for the higher-mass discs, the planet migrates
up to 3.26 au for log10(Lx/erg s"
"−1) = 29.54 and up to 3.93 au
for log10(Lx/erg s"
"−1) = 30.04. The FARGO simulations therefore
show that planets in transition discs generally migrate signifi-
cantly less than they do in primordial discs."
"In summary, when comparing the migration tracks between
SPOCK and FARGO for the transition discs only, it becomes appar-
ent that in the latter, planets generally migrate significantly less
than they do in SPOCK, while for the primordial discs no strong
deviation is found, except for 100 g cm−2 and log10(Lx/erg s"
"−1) =
30.04, where the slower migration in SPOCK allows photoevap-
oration to deplete the disc more strongly. As a consequence,
planet migration is slowed down even more and the planet is
parked before it can reach the inner boundary."
3.3. Torques acting on the planet
"To understand the origin of the different migration rates of plan-
ets embedded in primordial and transition discs, Fig. 5 shows
the evolution of the total torques (Γtot) acting on the planet, to-
gether with the individual contribution of the corotation (ΓC) and
Lindblad (ΓLB) torques as a function of time. These are directly
compared to the semi-major axis evolution of the planet."
"The corotation torques are determined within the co-orbital
region xs (also known as horseshoe half-width, cf., Paardekooper
& Papaloizou 2009), spanning a region close to the planetary
orbit from a − xs ≤ a ≤ a + xs. The width of xs is given by"
"xs = 1.68a
√"
"q
h
, (9)"
"where a corresponds to the planet semi-major axis, q = Mp/M?
is the planet to stellar mass ratio and h the disc aspect ra-
tio (Paardekooper & Papaloizou 2009). The contribution of the
Lindblad torques are then calculated from the remaining parts of
the disc. The total torque is therefore the sum of the individual
corotation and Lindblad torques and the net difference between
the torques interior and exterior to the planet determine its final
migration rate. For most planet-disc configurations, the net dif-
ference between the torques becomes negative so that it drives
inward migration (Ward 1997), which is also the case in our sim-
ulations where no significant outward migration was observed."
"The cumulative torques as a function of time were nor-
malised by"
"Γ0 = (q/h)
2a4Ω2PΣP, (10)"
"which corresponds to the total torque of the unperturbed disc at
the initial planet location of 5 au (see e.g. D’Angelo & Lubow
2010; Dürmann & Kley 2015). It is a function of the planet to
stellar mass ratio q, the disc aspect ratio h, ΣP=Σ0 at 5 au, the or-
bital separation of the planet a and ΩP ="
"√
GM?/a3. The torques"
"were smoothed using a third order polynomial Savitzky-Golay
filter (Savitzky & Golay 1964) with a window length of 11. Fluc-
tuations are observed in the torque evolution as the planet moves
closer to the central star, in particular for the transition disc cases
(right column). The cause of these fluctuations is the interaction
between vortices developing at the gap edge and the photoevap-
orative wind with the planet, which is discussed in more detail
in Appendix C."
"It is important to note that the transition from a primordial
to a transition disc is smooth rather than sharp. While the total
torques in the former are the result of the counteracting effect
from the torques interior and exterior to the planet, as the disc is
slowly developing an inner cavity, the torques in the outer disc
will start to dominate over those from interior to the planet. In the
extreme limit of a transition disc with an evacuated inner cavity,
the surface density will have a sharp cutoff at the planet location
as the gap-crossing material will be either quickly accreted by
the planet or be photoevaporated by the star. At this point, the
planet will only be subject to the torques from the outer disc,
which we refer to as ‘one-sided torques’."
"It can be inferred from Fig. 5 that the absolute value of the
Lindblad torques is significantly larger than those of the corota-
tion torques. This is to be expected as the planets in our study are
massive enough to open gaps in the surface density, therefore de-
pleting the material in the corotation region. This becomes even
more prominent in the transition discs since the removal of ma-
terial due to the direct irradiation from the central star adds up"

3.4. Impulse approximation versus full 2D treatment
"Finally, we investigate why the impulse approximation is lead-
ing to contradicting results for transition discs compared to mi-
gration rates obtained from FARGO. The two major differences
between SPOCK and FARGO are the disc evolution and the treat-
ment of planet migration. Due to the different disc evolution (and
surface density profile), it is not useful to directly compare the
torques from both approaches. Therefore, in order to isolate the"
"effect of planet migration, we computed the torques from the
impulse approximation (cf. Eq. 4) using the 1D averaged FARGO
outputs. This way we focus only on the differences in planet mi-
gration, which is the aim of this paper."
"Fig. 6 shows the azimuthally averaged surface density profile
of the primordial and transition discs in comparison to the radial
distribution of the torques per unit disc mass dm directly deter-
mined from the FARGO outputs as well as through the impulse
approximation. The comparison is made at three different stages
of disc evolution, namely when the planet is released (first col-
umn), in the advanced stage of disc evolution (middle column)
as well as right before disc dispersal (right column). The radial"

"For the primordial discs (top row), the torques determined
from the impulse approximation strongly overestimate the con-
tribution of the corotation torques close to the planet (exerted
from the region a ± xs), while it underestimates the influence
of the Lindblad torques at larger radii. However, as previously
shown in Fig. 5, the corotation torques are of minor importance
to giant planet migration as the planet will carve a deep gap into
the disc, and therefore deplete this region of material. The abso-
lute values of the torques from FARGO are overall smaller than
the ones from the impulse approximation. However, the magni-
tude of the Lindblad torques, which ultimately drive planet mi-
gration, is larger especially close to the planet. The difference
between the calculated Lindblad torques in the two approaches"
"is coming mainly from the lack of 2D structures, such as spiral
density waves in the averaged density profiles as was previously
discussed."
"For the transition discs, the gas cannot perform complete
horseshoe orbits since the material is removed as it crosses the
planet location. The observed behaviour for the torques differs
strongly between the two approaches. There are negative torques
just outside the planet location pushing the planet inwards for
the impulse approximation, while in FARGO strongly positive
torques develop at the location of the gap edge, effectively act-
ing as a planet trap that will prevent any further inward migra-
tion of the planet (cf. Liu et al. 2017). As the disc evolves and
the photoevaporative wind depletes the gap edge this contribu-
tion becomes negligible. Here, it is important to note that our
previous statement about the corotation torques not being im-
portant to giant planet migration still holds. The reason for this
is that the torques shown in Fig. 6 correspond to the specific
torques, i.e. the torques were renormalised by the local disc mass
dm = Σ dA = 2πrΣ dr. Therefore, while the absolute value of the"

"torques exerted at the gap edge are significantly stronger than in
the primordial disc, the local disc mass is much more depleted
and the resulting effective torque is weaker as can be inferred
from Fig. 5."
"In summary, our 2D FARGO simulations show that planets
that are embedded in transition discs with an evacuated cavity
inside the planetary orbit migrate significantly less than they do
in primordial discs. This is in contradiction with the results ob-
tained by the impulse approximation in 1D, which predicts an
accelerated inward migration for planets in discs with inner cav-
ities. This suggests that the classic impulse approximation is not
suitable to model the migration of planets in such discs. This
has important consequences for 1D planet population synthesis
calculations that employ the impulse approximation to calculate
migration rates of giant planets."
3.5. Proposed fix for the impulse approximation in 1D models
"An easy fix to the impulse approximation in 1D models could
be to stop giant planet migration, once the disc inside the plane-
tary orbit is depleted of gas. However, as shown in Fig. 4, some
modest migration of the planet embedded in a transition disc can
be observed, if the outer disc is still rather massive. Stopping the
planet once the disc inside the planet is depleted would likely
result in too large parking radii of the planets. A better approx-
imation that could be therefore used in such simulations is de-
rived using Fig. 7. Here we compare the semi-major axis evo-
lution from the FARGO runs with the azimuthally averaged sur-
face density that was determined at the 3:2 and 2:1 mean motion
resonance locations. Both are located outside of the planetary
orbit and are one of the main contributors to the outer Lindblad
torques. The Σ0 = 100 g cm−2 runs of the primordial discs are ex-
cluded from this analysis as the planets reached the inner bound-
ary in these simulations and were effectively not parked due to
planet-disc interactions. We find that once the surface density
reaches approximately 0.01 g cm−2 at the 3:2 mean motion res-
onance location and around 0.1 g cm−2 at the 2:1 mean motion
resonance, planet migration can be considered to have stopped
fully. These threshold values are independent of the initial disc"
"mass as well as the applied X-ray luminosity tested in this work
and therefore appear to be a robust proxy. However, while their
eligibility for even higher disc masses still needs to be tested, it is
not expected to be of relevance to realistic planet formation mod-
els. In 1D treatments of migrating planets using the impulse ap-
proximation, we therefore suggest to stop giant planet migration
once the disc inside the planet is depleted and the surface density
at the 3:2 mean motion resonance location (as this is closer to the
planet than the 2:1 mean motion resonance) becomes less than
0.01 g cm−2, ensuring that the outer disc has become depleted
enough to not continue pushing the planet inside."
4. Numerical limitations
"This section will discuss the limitations of the numerical models
employed in this study."
4.1. Viscous boundary conditions
"Due to the reduced complexity of the disc structure in one di-
mension, it was possible to model a much larger disc extent with
SPOCK than in the 2D simulations with FARGO, which only in-
cluded disc radii between 0.4−25 au. In such models, the choice
of boundary conditions may have a significant impact on the final
outcome of a simulation. While we have tested different config-
urations of open and closed boundaries, we found that viscous
outflow boundary conditions (Kley et al. 2008) provide the most
realistic setup as they impose a steady-state accretion flow from
the outer to the inner disc as well as from the innermost disc
onto the star (cf. Sect. 2.3). The velocity of this flow is set by
the viscosity parameter α, for which we used the same value of
α = 6.9×10−4 both in 1D and 2D. However, as could be inferred
from Fig. 1, the discs in our model have reached a stable state
before the planets were released, confirming that the choice of
viscous boundary conditions is indeed appropriate for our study."

planet-disc interactions are shown. The horizontal dotted lines are drawn at Σ2:1 = 10−1 g cm−2 and Σ3:2 = 10−2 g cm−2 and cross the corresponding
vertical line where the planet is considered to be parked fully."
4.2. Planetary accretion
"In the classical framework of the impulse approximation (Lin &
Papaloizou 1986), no material can cross the planetary gap so that
the planet is locked inside the gap, migrating approximately on
the viscous timescale. Hydrodynamical simulations have how-
ever shown that gaps formed by giant planets are more compara-
ble to ‘leaky dams’ that do allow a certain mass-flow across the
planetary orbit (Lubow & D’Angelo 2006; Duffell et al. 2014;
Dempsey et al. 2020). Dürmann & Kley (2015) further showed
that, for some scenarios, this mass-flow can be entirely stopped"
"if the planet is additionally accreting the gap-crossing material,
therefore fully cutting off the inner from the outer disc."
"In SPOCK, planetary accretion is modelled following the
prescription derived by Veras & Armitage (2004), which was
also used in comparable studies (Alexander & Armitage 2009;
Alexander & Pascucci 2012; Ercolano & Rosotti 2015). It is well
known that the magnitude of this mass-flow can strongly affect
the migration rate of the planet. While the fitting formula that is
used in SPOCK is based on state-of-the-art numerical simulations
of planet-disc interactions (Lubow et al. 1999; D’Angelo et al."
"Article number, page 11 of 16"
A&A proofs: manuscript no. main
"2002; Lubow & D’Angelo 2006), its exact form is not known
and may therefore carry large uncertainties."
"In contrast, the simulations performed with FARGO do not
include planetary accretion. This may likely be a caveat of our
analysis, however, this approach was chosen to isolate the ef-
fect of XPE onto giant planet migration. Furthermore, Robert
et al. (2018) find that the accretion of material onto the planet
in discs with low viscosity (as it is the case in our study) should
not have any significant impact on type II migration, suggesting
that giant planets embedded in such discs should migrate slowly.
Studying the mass-flow across the planetary orbit in photoevapo-
rating discs is not within the scope of this paper, however, due to
its likely significance to giant planet migration in high-viscosity
discs, it should be investigated in more detail in future studies."
5. Conclusions
"In this paper we have tested the impulse approximation as a 1D
treatment of giant planet migration in evolving protoplanetary
discs subject to photoevaporation. Our conclusions based on our
comparison of 1D and 2D simulations can be summarised as fol-
lows."
"1. The impulse approximation in 1D can roughly reproduce
the migration history predicted by more complex 2D sim-
ulations for giant planets embedded in primordial discs with
or without photoevaporation. Despite some quantitative dif-
ferences, the effect on large population synthesis models is
not expected to be dramatic. One exception to this is the case
of planets embedded in high-mass discs with more vigorous
winds. Here, the parking effect of photoevaporation is more
enhanced in the 1D simulations compared to the 2D simu-
lations. This is due to the strong non-axisymmetric density
enhancements, such as spiral waves in the 2D simulations,
that are absent in the 1D simulations. These regions are more
resilient to photoevaporation and provide an additional con-
tribution to the torques that are driving migration."
"2. 1D simulations show higher migration rates in the case of
planets embedded in transition discs, in which the material
inside the planetary orbit has been cleared. On the contrary,
2D simulations of equivalent systems show that migration is
effectively stopped as soon as the material inside the plane-
tary orbit is cleared."
"3. Planet population synthesis calculations should account for
the above in order to accurately reproduce the orbital dis-
tribution of planets at the end of the disc clearing phase. A
simple approach for 1D codes using the impulse approxima-
tion is to halt planet migration as soon as the material inside
the planetary orbit has been cleared and the azimuthally av-
eraged surface density becomes less than 0.01 g cm−2 at the
3:2 mean motion resonance location of the planet."
"A quantitative estimate of the magnitude of the error intro-
duced by 1D migration prescriptions is beyond the scope of this
paper but will be attempted in future work.

model"
"Picogna et al. (2019) present an updated X-ray photoevaporation
model, which is based on a series of radiation-hydrodynamical
simulations. They focus on modelling the photoevaporative
winds of solar-type stars (M? = 0.7 M�) and show how these
impact the dispersal of their surrounding disc at various stages
of disc evolution."

"(Eq. A.3). It can be seen that in the early stages of disc evolution,
the viscous accretion rates onto the star will exceed the photo-
evaporative mass-loss rates. Depending on the initial disc mass
and the X-ray luminosity of the star, the accretion rates will drop
below the wind mass-loss rate at a given time, so that photoe-
vaporation can open an annular gap and start clearing the disc
from the inside out. In the bottom panel of Fig. A.1, the sur-
face mass-loss profile as a function of disc radius is shown. The
dashed line shows the primordial profile (Eq. A.1), which is ac-
tive before photoevaporation has opened a gap. As soon as gap
opening has taken place and the column density inside this gap
has decreased sufficiently, the stellar X-rays can directly irradi-
ate the outer disc, so that the photoevaporation profile switches
to the transition disc one outside of the gap (Eq. A.4). The total
surface mass-loss profile is therefore a combination of the pri-
mordial and the transition disc one that will intersect at the gap
radius, Rhole."

"The total mass-loss rate (i.e. including viscous accretion and
photoevaporation) of the discs modelled with FARGO are shown
in Fig. A.2. As expected, higher mass-loss rates are reached both
in the low- and high-mass discs with higher X-ray luminosities
of the host star due to the more vigorous winds that are more
efficient in removing disc material. This trend is independent
of the underlying disc structure, however, in the case of tran-
sition discs, even higher absolute values of the mass-loss rate
compared to the primordial discs are present. Rather than being
absorbed by the inner disc, the X-rays can directly irradiate the
outer disc in these cases, so that the stronger, direct photoevapo-
ration profile (Eq. A.4) becomes immediately active. This results
in higher total mass-loss rates and the faster removal of the outer
disc compared to the primordial discs."

"Overall, the total mass-loss rates stay relatively constant over
the disc lifetime, especially for the low-mass discs. For the high-
mass discs with Σ0 = 100 g cm−2 the viscous accretion rates
are higher (see the discussion in Sect. 3.1) and consequently
a stronger decrease in Ṁtot with time is observed. This is es-
pecially prominent for log10(Lx/erg s"
"−1) = 29.54, where Ṁtot
quickly reaches values below 10−9 M� yr−1. Due to the high disc
mass and low X-ray luminosity, photoevaporation is not strong
enough to overcome viscous accretion before the planet migrates
all the way to the host star (see Fig. 4). The mass-loss rate there-
fore follows a trend similar to that of the viscous accretion rate
observed in Fig. A.1 (black, dashed line) as the viscous accre-
tion rate will exceed the photoevaporation mass-loss rate for a
longer time. For the transition discs mostly the wind mass-loss
rate is contributing to the total mass-loss of the disc. The evac-
uated inner cavity formed by PIPE prevents any accretion onto
the star, and therefore all gas that crosses the planetary orbit is
immediately photoevaporated away."
Appendix B: The role of viscosity
"It was discussed in Sect. 3.1 that photoevaporation is more ef-
ficient in parking planets in low-mass discs. In comparison, the
planets embedded in the higher-mass discs with Σ0 = 100 g cm−2
were effectively not parked due to planet-disc interactions or
photoevaporation, but reached the inner boundary of the radial
domain. The magnitude of planet migration in photoevaporating
discs however crucially depends on the viscosity applied in these
models. Fig. B.1 shows the semi-major axis evolution of a planet"

"If the viscosity is lower, the migration speed of the planet
will become slower, as can be observed in the full disc simula-
tions. The reason for this is that the gaps that are carved by the
planets, are wider and deeper in low-viscosity discs, therefore
the torques acting on the planet will be reduced. In contrast, for
the higher viscosity cases, the planetary gap is partially refilled
by inflowing gas, producing stronger torques and leading to the
faster inward migration of the planet. For the transition discs op-
posite behaviour is observed, that is that the planet embedded in
the disc with α = 10−2 is parked the earliest. However, the differ-
ence in the final parking locations compared to the other mod-
elled disc viscosities is only marginal. The reason for this is that
with higher disc viscosity, material will accumulate on a faster
timescale close to the planet location in the outer disc. As was
shown in Fig. 4, one-sided torques near the gap edge will cre-
ate strongly positive torques, effectively preventing any further
inward migration of the planet. Consequently, with higher disc
viscosity more material will be present at the gap edge, resulting
in the formation of even stronger positive torques that lead to an
earlier stopping of planet migration compared to transition discs
with lower viscosity. In conclusion, while the choice of α may
affect the final parking location of the planet, it does not change
the conclusion that planet migration should cease once the disc
reaches the transitional phase, in which the disc inside the planet
is depleted of gas."

Appendix C: Torque fluctuations
"The torque evolution discussed in Sect. 3.3 showed strong os-
cillations with time, especially for the high-mass discs (Σ0 =
100 g cm−2) for which disc-planet interactions were more impor-
tant. The case with low X-ray luminosity (log10(Lx/erg s"
"−1) =
29.54) showed in particular short-term oscillations while for the
high X-ray case the variation was much longer with time. In
Figure C.1 we show the surface density distribution close to the
planet location at two time steps where the torque had a low or
high peak with respect to a reference step, for the low X-ray lu-
minosity case. The surface density shows strong interaction with
vortices developing in the outer gap edge that are well in agree-
ment with the short-term oscillations. The long-term variation
observed in the high X-ray flux case can be instead related to
the strong interaction between the stellar irradiation and the gap
edge outside the planet location, which affects the torque acting
onto the planet."
