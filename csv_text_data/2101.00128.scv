ABSTRACT
"We present High Sensitivity Array (HSA) and enhanced Multi Element Remotely Linked Interfer-
ometer Network (eMERLIN) observations of the radio-loud broad-lined type Ic supernova PTF11qcj
obtained ∼ 7.5 years after the explosion. Previous observations of this supernova at 5.5 yrs since
explosion showed a double-peaked radio light curve accompanied by a detection in the X–rays, but
no evidence for broad Hα spectral features. The Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) obser-
vations presented here show that the PTF11qcj GHz radio ejecta remains marginally resolved at the
sub-milliarcsecond level at ≈ 7.5 yrs after the explosion, pointing toward a non-relativistic expansion.
Our VLBI observations thus favor a scenario in which the second peak of the PTF11qcj radio light
curve is related to strong interaction of the supernova ejecta with a circumstellar medium of variable
density, rather than to the emergence of an off–axis jet. Continued VLBI monitoring of PTF11qcj in
the radio may strengthen further this conclusion."
1. INTRODUCTION
"Supernovae (SNe) of type Ib/c are believed to mark
the deaths of massive stars that are stripped of their
hydrogen (type Ib), and possibly helium (type Ic), en-
velope before explosion (Filippenko 1997). A sub-class
of Ib/c SNe dubbed broad-line (BL) Ic, estimated to
constitute only ≈ 5% of the Ib/c population (Woosley
& Bloom 2006; Gal-Yam 2017), is of particular interest
due to its relation to long-duration gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs), the most relativistic stellar explosions we know
of in the universe (Piran 2004; Mészáros 2006). While
all GRB-associated SNe are of type BL-Ic (Woosley &
Bloom 2006; Hjorth & Bloom 2012, but see Cano et al.
(2014) for the peculiar case of SN 2013ez), not all BL-Ic
events make a GRB (e.g., Berger et al. 2003; Soderberg
et al. 2006; Corsi et al. 2016). Thus, the question of what
physical ingredients enable some stripped-envelope mas-
sive stars to launch a relativistic jet remains open (e.g.,
Modjaz et al. 2016)."
"As first demonstrated by the well-known case of
SN 1998bw/GRB 980425 (Galama et al. 1998; Kulkarni
et al. 1998), radio observations are particularly well
suited to identify those BL-Ic SNe that may harbor
GRBs (hereafter referred to as engine-drive SNe), since
radio synchrotron emission traces the fastest moving
ejecta (e.g., Berger et al. 2003). At the same time, be-
cause non-thermal radio photons are produced in the in-
teraction of the SN shock with the circumstellar mate-
rial (CSM), bright radio emission can also be the smok-"

high-density CSM (e.g., Chevalier 1998; Chevalier et al.
2004; Chevalier & Fransson 2006). Although strong CSM
interaction is not commonly observed in BL-Ic SNe, a
few cases exists such as SN 2007bg (Salas et al. 2013),
PTF11qcj (Corsi et al. 2014; Palliyaguru et al. 2019),
SN2018gep (Ho et al. 2019a) and, possibly, AT2018cow
(Rivera Sandoval et al. 2018; Smartt et al. 2018; Ho et al.
2019b; Margutti et al. 2019)."
"Here, we focus on PTF11qcj, a radio-loud BL-Ic SN
extensively monitored via our approved programs on the
Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA; Corsi et al. 2014;
Palliyaguru et al. 2019). The extraordinary radio lumi-
nosity of PTF11qcj (∼ 1029erg s−1 Hz−1) is reminiscent
of the GRB–associated SN 1998bw (Kulkarni et al. 1998).
As discussed in Corsi et al. (2014) and Palliyaguru et al.
(2019), our radio monitoring over the first ≈ 5.5 years
since explosion has revealed an unusual double–peaked
radio light curve. The radio emission observed during the
first light curve peak (t . 200 d) can be modeled within
the standard synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) model
for a spherical SN shock expanding in the CSM. This
model yields an estimated speed of ≈ 0.3 − 0.5 c for the
fastest SN ejecta (Corsi et al. 2014), placing PTF11qcj in
an intermediate class between “ordinary” BL-Ic SNe and
engine-driven ones like SN 1998bw or SN 2009bb (Soder-
berg et al. 2010). The simple, spherically symmetric
model of SN shock interaction with a smooth CSM (sim-
ple power-law density profile), however, cannot explain
the second radio peak. As discussed in Palliyaguru et al.
(2019), two more complex scenarios can be invoked to in-
terpret this peculiar behavior of PTF11qcj: (i) A spheri-
cal SN shock going through a medium with extreme CSM
density variations, perhaps related to eruptive progenitor
mass loss; (ii) A radio-emitting SN shock (first peak) fol-
lowed by radio emission from an emerging off-axis GRB
jet, initially pointed away from our line of sight (second
peak)."
"In Palliyaguru et al. (2019) we have shown that, while
modeling of our VLA dataset within scenario (i) can in-"

"deed explain the second radio peak, the presence of an
off–axis jet (scenario (ii)) cannot be ruled out just based
on light curve measurements. However, scenarios (i) and
(ii) make rather different predictions for the angular size
of the PTF11qcj ejecta at very late times. Motivated by
these considerations, here we present Very Long Baseline
Interferometry (VLBI) observations of PTF11qcj aimed
at setting direct constraints on the size (angular diam-
eter) of its radio ejecta. These observations ultimately
provide a direct test for the presence of relativistic ex-
pansion, as expected in the case of an off-axis GRB jet."
"Our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we present the HSA and eMERLIN observations of
PTF11qcj. In Section 3, we discuss these observations
within the light curve and radio ejecta size predictions of
the two scenarios mentioned above. Finally, in Section 4
we summarize our results and conclude."
2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION
2.1. HSA observations
"We observed the field of PTF11qcj at 1.66 GHz (project
code BP229A, PI: Palliyaguru) and 15.37 GHz (BP229B,
PI: Palliyaguru) with the High Sensitivity Array (HSA)
on 2018 December 08.37 UTC and 2019 April 28.97
UTC. The HSA included, in both bands, the Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA, USA) and the Effelsberg 100 m
antenna (Germany). At 1.66 GHz, we also used the
VLA for improved sensitivity. Both observations cov-
ered 128 MHz continuum bandwidth and were correlated
at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO)
Array Operations Center (AOC) in Socorro (New Mex-
ico, USA) with averaging times of 2 s and 1 s at 1.66 GHz
and 15.37 GHz, respectively. In both observations, we
correlated the target data at R.A. 13h13m41.5100s, Dec.
+47◦17′57.600′′ (J2000; Corsi et al. 2014). In setting up
our observations, we used standard phase referencing,
where scans on target are interleaved with scans on a
nearby compact complex gain calibrator with known po-
sition. At 1.66 GHz and 15.37 GHz, we used J1310+4653
and J1358+4737, respectively, as our complex gain cal-
ibrators. The VLBA observations were correlated using
the NRAO’s implementation of the DiFX software cor-
relator (Deller et al. 2011)."
"We performed all calibration and imaging procedures
using the 31DEC19 release of the Astronomical Image
Processing System (AIPS; Greisen 2003) and Parsel-
Tongue (Kettenis et al. 2006). PTF11qcj was clearly
detected at both frequencies. At 1.66 GHz, in particular,
given the relatively large separation between PTF11qcj
and the complex gain calibrator J1358+4737 (≈ 7.6◦) we
used self-calibration to correct for the residual phase er-
rors towards PTF11qcj and obtain a reliable flux density
measurement. The final VLBI images are presented in
Figure 1."
"We fitted Gaussian intensity profiles to the target im-
ages to obtain the flux density and position of PTF11qcj
at each frequency. Our results are summarized in Ta-
ble 1. The reported flux density uncertainties are the
quadrature sum of the instrumental calibration uncer-
tainty plus the uncertainty of the Gaussian fit. At
15.37 GHz, we adopt an instrumental uncertainty of 15%.
At 1.66 GHz, we use an uncertainty of 20% to also ac-
count for residual errors due to the large separation be-"

"tween the target and the complex gain calibrator.
To estimate the source size we fit Gaussian intensity"
"distributions to the images. We find that the source ap-
pears marginally resolved along the major axis of our
15.37 GHz observations, while the minor axis is consis-
tent with an unresolved source. The deconvolved ma-
jor (minor) FWHM size of the fitted Gaussian model is
300 ± 71µarcsec (76 ± 76µarcsec), with position angle
125 ± 19 deg (see also Table 1). This corresponds to
a diameter of (5.2 ± 1.2) × 1017 cm ((1.3 ± 1.3) × 1017
cm). Given the relatively weak radio emission from
PTF11qcj, although this results gives us an estimate of
the source size, we refrain from speculation about the
non-symmetrical nature of this result. PTF11qcj radio
ejecta is not resolved at 1.66 GHz."
2.2. eMERLIN observations
"We observed the field of PTF11qcj at 5.07 GHz and
1.51 GHz with all six eMERLIN antennas on 2019 Au-
gust 01.55 UTC and 2019 August 29.47 UTC via our
DDT project DD8011 (PI: Perez-Torres). We used
J1310+4653 as our complex gain calibrator, 1 s integra-
tion time, and 512 MHz continuum bandwidth in both
bands. We used the standard eMERLIN calibrators"

volve the calibrated data and produce the final images.

"We report in Table 2 the peak and total flux densities,
along with the position of PTF11qcj, at each frequency,
calculated by fitting Gaussian intensity profiles to the im-
ages. The quoted flux density uncertainties correspond
to the sum in quadrature of the systematic, i.e., instru-
mental uncertainty (15%) and the image off-source RMS
noise."
3. MODELING
"The complete radio light curves of PTF11qcj are shown
in Figure 2. These include the latest flux measurements
(integrated fluxes from Tables 1 and 2) along with data
published in Corsi et al. (2016) and Palliyaguru et al.
(2019). Hereafter, we discuss the possible interpretation
of these light curves within the the standard synchrotron
self-absorption (SSA) scenario for radio SNe (see Soder-
berg et al. 2005, and references therein). We also consider
an alternative interpretation within an SSA (first radio
light curve peak) plus off-axis GRB (second radio light
curve peak) scenario. Finally, we discuss the direct size
constraints obtained via our VLBI observations in the
context of both these scenarios."
3.1. Light curves within the SSA scenario
"Similarly to what done in Corsi et al. (2016) and Pal-
liyaguru et al. (2019), we can model the radio emission of
PTF11qcj in the SSA scenario (Soderberg et al. 2005).
As described in Soderberg et al. (2005), the temporal
evolution of the shock radius, r, minimum Lorentz fac-
tor, γm, and magnetic field, B, are parameterized as:"

and eMERLIN data are shown by triangles. The first radio peak is modeled within a standard SSA model as described in Corsi et al.
(2014) (Model 0 in Table 3; solid curves). The re-brightening phase is modeled in two different scenarios: (i) within the standard SSA
model (dotted curves; Model 3 in Table 3) and (ii) within an off-axis afterglow model (long–dashed, blue curves; see Section 3.2). The
sum of the best fit CSM model in the first peak and off-axis jet emission from the second peak is also shown (dot–dashed curve). The
dash-dot-dot-dotted line in the bottom right panel shows the effects of synchrotron cooling within the SSA scenario as discussed in Section
3.1. The measurement of the shock size from HSA data rules out the off–axis jet scenario."

(A13) in Soderberg et al. 2005), and where the optical
depth τ is given by (see Equations (20) and (A14) in

"with T a normalization constant that depends on the pa-
rameters (r0, B0, p, γm,0, η). We note that for νm << ν,
the value of γm,0 is left largely unconstrained by the ob-
servations, and thus typically fixed so that νm,0 ∼ 1 GHz.
In addition, the thickness of the shell is typically set to
a value η > 1 (Li & Chevalier 1999). Thus, for a given
choice of η and νm, the SSA model is a function of the
parameters (r0, ξ, αr, te, s, B0, p)."
"Within the SSA scenario, and with the data collected
here, we can further test the hypothesis first presented
in Palliyaguru et al. (2019) that the double-peaked radio
light curve of PTF11qcj is due to strong interaction with"

therefore included in the normalization constant"
"CSM of variable density. Our results are shown in Fig-
ure 2, and are reported in Table 3. Model 0 in Table 3 is
the best fit SSA model for the first peak (t . 215 days
since explosion) as reported in Corsi et al. (2016). The
last is obtained by setting te = 55842, p = 3 (as typically
expected for Type Ib/c SNe; see Chevalier & Fransson
2006), η = 10, νm,0 = 1 GHz, and varying r0, ξ, αr, s,
and B0. Model 0 is also plotted in Figure 2 (solid line).
Model 1 is a fit to the second radio peak (t & 587 days
since explosion) where we keep r0 and αr fixed to their
best fit values for the first peak so as to ensure a smooth
radial evolution between the first and second radio light
curve peaks, and allow ξ, s, and B0 to vary. This fit is
similar to the one reported in Palliyaguru et al. (2019)
but updated to include the eMERLIN and HSA data
presented here."
"Compared to Palliyaguru et al. (2019), the reduced χ2"
"for Model 1 is substantially higher, indicating a worsen-
ing of the goodness of fit. Model 2 is a fit with a model
identical to Model 1 but where the 15 GHz HSA data
has been excluded. The improved χ2 value for Model 2
compared to Model 1 indicates a significant discrepancy
between data and model at the highest radio frequencies,
suggesting a steepening in the highest frequency light
curve which may be caused by the passage of the cool-
ing frequency in band. Indeed, the effects of synchrotron
cooling may become important at the late timescales con-
sidered here. Within the SSA scenario, the synchrotron
cooling frequency can be written as (see Equation (A16)
in Soderberg et al. 2005):"
"νc =
18πme c e"
"(t− te)2σ2T B3
, (12)"
"where σT is the Thomson cross-section and e is the elec-
tron charge (Rybicki & Lightman 1986; Soderberg et al.
2005). For ν > νc, the flux density becomes (Soderberg
et al. 2005):"
fν(t) ∝ ν−p/2 t(6αr+(8−5p)αB+2(p−2)αγ−4p+2)/2. (13)
"Model 1 in Table 3 predicts νc ≈ 50 GHz at t − te ≈
7.5 yrs, which is above the highest frequency of our ob-
servations, resulting in large residuals with the HSA data
point. Thus, in Table 3 we also report the results of
a fit where we set te = 55842, p = 3, s = 0, η = 2,
νm,0 = 3 GHz, r0 = 1.1 × 1016 cm, but allow αr, B0,
and ξ to vary (Model 3). As shown in Figure 3, with
this choice the cooling frequency falls below 16 GHz at
t − te ≈ 1345 d (≈ 3.6 yrs since explosion), thus causing
a steeping of the light curve at this frequency. In Fig-
ure 2 we plot Model 3 with dotted lines, and the expected
steeping (fν(t) ∝ t−2.6 according to Equation (13)) of
the 16 GHz light curve due to synchrotron cooling with a
dash-dot-dot-dotted line. Model 3 substantially improves
the goodness of fit for the second radio peak compared
to Models 1 and 2."
"In summary, while the SSA fits described in this Sec-
tion have large limitations due to the simplifications that
characterize the SSA model, overall they are indicative
of the fact that (i) a non-constant CSM profile is needed
to explain the PTF11qcj radio light curves, and (ii) syn-
chrotron cooling may be playing a role at late times. We
also note that in Model 3 a flat (s = 0) radial profile
of the environment (ISM-like) is favored (see Chevalier"

"Fig. 3.— Cooling frequency vs time during phase 2. The horizon-
tal dotted lines mark the observation frequencies of 2.5 GHz, 13.5

3), νc (solid line) crosses 16 GHz at ∼ 1345 days since explosion."
"Fig. 4.— Radius vs time during phases 1 and 2. During phase
2, the radial evolution is modeled using Model 3 in table 3. The
date of the 16 GHz VLBI data is marked by the vertical dashed

the CSM discontinuity and shows that the shock has decelerated
during phase 2."
"1982, for a discussion of the s = 0 case). Finally, as
shown in Figure 4, the combined radial evolution of the
shock as implied by Model 0 for the first peak of the
PTF11qcj light curves and by Model 3 for the second
peak, implies that the shock has decelerated while en-
countering the CSM discontinuity. A similar case is of
SN2014C, where VLBI observations revealed that the SN
has substantially decelerated at late times after encoun-
tering a higher density shell (Bietenholz et al. 2020)."
3.2. SSA plus off-axis GRB scenario
"Similarly to what done in Palliyaguru et al. (2019),
we also use numerical simulations for off-axis GRB jets
by van Eerten et al. (2012) to model the second peak
of PTF11qcj light curve within a constant density envi-"
"ronment, considering the new HSA and eMERLIN data
points. Within this scenario, the first radio peak is the
radio emission from the SN ejecta while the second ra-
dio peak is due to the delayed emission from an initially
off-axis jets that enters our line of sight after spread-
ing and decelerating. These two-dimensional hydrody-
namic simulations of the GRB jets take into account the
Blandford-Mckee solution (Blandford & McKee 1976) in
the relativistic regime, the Sedov-von Neumann–Taylor
(SNT) solution (Taylor 1950) in the late non-relativistic
regime, and a transition in between regimes (Zhang &
MacFadyen 2009)."
"In Table 4 we report the best fit results for the isotropic
equivalent kinetic energy of the explosion Eiso, the jet
half-opening angle, θ0, ISM density nISM, and the ob-
server angle, θobs, when the latest four data points from
HSA and eMERLIN, as well as the Chandra X-ray data
point reported in Palliyaguru et al. (2019), are added
to the fit. These fits also assume equipartition of en-
ergy between particles and magnetic fields such that
�e = �B = 0.33. We set the electron energy index,
p = 2.5, which is typical for GRB afterglows, as expected
from theoretical considerations (Kirk et al. 2000; Achter-
berg et al. 2001). The best fit off-axis jet light curves are
shown in Figure 2 (light blue, long-dashed lines)."
"3.3. Size constraints: CSM-interacting vs off-axis GRB
scenario"
"Within the SSA scenario, Models 0, 1, and 2 described
in Section 3.1 all imply a shock radius around the time
of the 16 GHz HSA observation (2759 days post explo-
sion) of r ∼ 1018 cm. This in turn corresponds to an
angular diameter of ∼ 1 mas at the redshift z = 0.028
of PTF11qcj, larger than the size constraints set by our
HSA observations (see Table 1). On the other hand,
Model 3 gives r ≈ 3 × 1017 cm at 2759 days post ex-
plosion (see Figure 4), which corresponds to an angular
diameter of ≈ 0.4 mas, compatible with the HSA obser-
vations reported in Table 1. We note however that within
the SSA model, which assumes spherical symmetry, we
are not able to model any potential asymmetry in the
shock geometry."
"Within the off-axis GRB scenario for the second ra-
dio peak, the ejecta will no longer produce a symmet-
ric image on the sky. Instead, the resolved image will
highlight the front edge of the jet heading to the ob-
server, producing an elongated and curved shape. For
model 1 in Table 4, this curved front will have traveled
R⊥,travel = 3.0× 1019 cm in projected distance from the
origin of the explosion. The projected width of the im-
age is R⊥,w = 1.4 × 1019 cm, and its projected height
R⊥,h = 2.5 × 1018 cm. These correspond to a pro-
jected angular distance from the origin of the explosion
of 35 mas, a projected angular width of 8 mas, and a pro-
jected angular height of 14 mas. Thus, if the second radio
light curve peak of PTF11qcj was due to an off-axis GRB,
we should have resolved a much larger image in our HSA
observations."
"We note that while the off–axis GRB model consid-
ered here assumes a top-hat jet, a structured jet such
as the one considered in Nakar & Piran (2017) would
imply sizes that can be bracketed by the the two ex-
treme cases of a spherically symmetric blast wave, and"

the total energy in the ejecta, ρref and Rref are the cir-
cumburst medium density and radius at a reference time
(which we set to 10 days), respectively (van Eerten 2018).
For the best fit parameters of Model 1 in Table 3, we find
the expected radius would be 8.9×1017cm (1 mas), larger
than our HSA constraint."
"For a relativistic jet expanding into the ISM, the ap-
parent radius at time t may be calculated using the an-
alytical expression (Oren et al. 2004):"

"2(1 + z) is the jet break
time, θ0 is the jet half opening angle, n is the ISM number
density (Oren et al. 2004). For the best fit parameters
of Eiso, θ0, nISM listed in Table 4, the expected radius
at 2759 days post explosion is 4.8 × 1019 cm. This cor-
responds to an angular size of ∼ 55 mas at the redshift
z = 0.028 of PTF11qcj, much larger than our HSA con-
straint."
"Based on these results, the off-axis hypothesis for the
origin of the second radio peak of the PTF11qcj light
curves is disfavored."
4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
"We have presented HSA and eMERLIN observations of
PTF11qcj obtained ∼7.5 yrs post explosion. The source
is marginally resolved in the HSA data at 15 GHz, indi-
cating a diameter of (300± 71)µas. This corresponds to
an average expansion velocity of ≈ 0.036± 0.008 c."
"Modeling of the light curves within an SSA scenario
requires the interaction of the shock with a non-smooth
CSM whose radial profile changes from a stellar wind
profile (ne ∝ r−2) to a constant density medium. This
variable CSM profile also affects the temporal evolution
of the shock radius. We also find that synchrotron cool-
ing may be playing a role at the highest radio frequencies.
Within this SSA model with variable CSM, the derived
size of the shock at the time of our HSA observations can
be reconciled with our measurements. Our results are
thus consistent with the CSM interaction model (con-
sidering that such model is highly simplified). The size
constraints derived from our HSA observations also seem
to disfavor an off-axis relativistic jet scenario for the ra-
dio re-brightening of PTF11qcj."
"In conclusion, the VLBI observations reported in this
paper favor the original interpretation of PTF11qcj as
a strongly CSM-interacting radio SN (see Corsi et al.
2014; Palliyaguru et al. 2019). However, our conclusions
are limited by the simplifications inherent in the spheri-
cally symmetric SSA model adopted here. We encourage
more detailed theoretical modeling aimed at interpreting
PTF11qcj complex radio light curve and available VLBI
data."
