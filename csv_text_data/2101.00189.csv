"Abstract. The local pulsar and its progenitor, SNR, can together accelerate the positron,
electron and nuclei to very high energy. The famous excesses of positron(nuclei) above 20(200)
GeV possibly come from such kind of local source. This hints that the primary electron should
also hold ""excess"" above 200 GeV, synchronously accelerated along with the nuclei. The
recent precise measurement of sharp dropoff at 284 GeV of positron by AMS-02 experiment
takes chance to study this expected electron excess. In this work, the spatially-dependent
propagation with a local source is used to reproduce the spectrum of positron, electron and
proton. When considering the dropoff at 284 GeV of positron, a sharp bump structure for
primary electron above 284 GeV is required to fit the total spectrum of positron and electron.
Then we systematically study the common origin of the excesses of positron, electron and
nuclei from Geminga pulsar and SNR. Those excesses can be reproduced under this unified
single-source model. Lastly, we hope that the fine bump structure can be observed to support
our model by AMS-02 experiment in future."

1 Introduction
"In recent decades, great progress has been made in development of advanced space-borne
and ground-based experiments. With those new generation of experiments, comic rays (CRs)
measurements are stepping into an era of high precision and revealing a series of new phenom-
ena. A fine structure of spectral hardening above 200 GV for nuclei were observed by ATIC-2,
CREAM and PAMELA experiments [1–5]. AMS-02 experiment confirmed this discovery with
full accuracy [6, 7]. Just recently, more interesting was that the break-off at 14 TeV for pro-
ton was clearly observed by CREAM, NUCLEON and DAMPE experiment [4, 8–10]. Several
kinds of models have been proposed to explain the origin of spectral hardening, which include
the local source [11–14], the combined effects from different group sources and the spatially-
dependent propagation [15–19]. Considering the break-off at 14 TeV in spectrum, it seems
that the local single source model becomes natural and accessible. But where is the dominant
source ? Further clues of observation is necessary to support this view of point."
"The anisotropy of CRs is an optimal choice to fulfill this role. Thanks to new generation
of ground-based experiments, the measurements of anisotropy has made great progress from
hundred of GeV to several PeV [20–24]. It is clear that the phase of anisotropy below 100
TeV roughly directs to galactic anticenter, which is totally paradoxical with the traditional
propagation model (TPM). However, above 100 TeV, the phase directs to galactic center and
is consistent with the expection of TPM. Correspondingly, the amplitude has experienced
similar transition at the critical energy of 100 TeV. In addition, the most importance is that
there exists a common transition energy scale between the structures of the energy spectra and
the anisotropy. The local source possibly plays very important role to resolve the conjunct
problems of spectra and anisotropy. Furthermore, the direction of anisotropy can roughly
outline the position of such local source. In our recent work, we propose a local source under
the spatially-dependent propagation (SDP) to reproduce the co-evolution of the spectra and
anisotropy. In this model, the optimal candidate of local source is SNR at Geminga’s birth
place [13, 25]. If this standpoint is right, one question is that whether the electron has similar
excess above 200 GeV, synchronally accelerated along with the nuclei. In addition, can the
Geminga pulsar dominantly contribute the positron spectrum?"
"The famous spectral excess of positron above 20 GeV was discovered by PAMELA ex-
periment [26, 27]. Then the AMS-02 experiment confirmed this remarkable result with un-
precedented precision [28]. Just recently, a sharp dropoff at 284 GeV was observed by AMS-02"
"experiment with above 4σ confidence level [28]. However, the dropoff around 1 TeV in the
total spectrum of positron and electron was first reported by HESS collaboration [29–31] and
validated by MAGIC [32], VERITAS [33] experiments. DAMPE experiment performed the
first direct measurement to this feature and announced that the breakoff was at ∼0.9 TeV
[34]. At this erengy range, CALET experiment also gave the corresponding messurement
[35]. It means that the total spectrum shows a single power-law from ∼40 GeV to ∼0.9
TeV without significant features [34, 36]. Considering the lower energy cutoff at 284 GeV,
this deficit of positron spectrum above 284 GeV should be supplied by the primary electron,
which indicates that an extra bump structure is required for the primary one above ∼284
GeV. It’s worth noting that similar origins are predicted in [37–41]. A number of alternatives
have been proposed, which can be either astrophysical, such as local pulsars and the hadronic
interactions inside SNRs, or even more exotic dark matter self-annihilation or decay [12, 42–
54]. Among those models, the local pulsar source [51, 55–57], such as Geminga pulsar, is
favourite candidate [58, 59], though there leaves some debates [60]."
"Based on above discussion, a sharp bump structure possibly exist in the spectrum of
primary electron. Geminga SNR and pulsar are the optical candidate to supply those anoma-
lous features in spectra and anisotropy. Therefore, in this work we firstly deduce the possible
bump structure based on the different break-off of positron and electron. Then a common
origin from Geminga pulsar and SNR was proposed to explain the positron excess and the
spectral hardening of proton/electron starting from 20 and 200 GeV respectively. The paper
is organized as follows. Sec.2 describes the SPD model and Geminga source briefly, Sec.3
presents the calculated results and Sec.4 gives the conclusion."
2 Model Description
2.1 Spatially-dependent propagation
"The SDP of CRs has received a lot of attention in recent years. It was first introduced as
a Two Halo model (THM) [61] to explain the spectral hardening of both proton and helium
above 200 GeV [5]. Afterwards, it is further applied to secondary and heavier components
[15, 18, 62–65], diffuse gamma-ray distribution [17] and large-scale anisotropy [13, 25]. For a
comprehensive introduction, one can refer to [15] and [18]."
"In the SDP model, the whole diffusive halo is divided into two parts. The Galactic disk
and its surrounding area are called the inner halo (IH) region, in which the diffusion coefficient
is spatially-dependent and relevant to the radial distribution of background CR sources. The
extensive diffusive region outside the IH is named as the outer halo (OH) region, where the
diffusion is regarded as only rigidity dependent. The spatially-dependent diffusion coefficient
Dxx is thus parameterized as:"
"Dxx(r, z,R) = D0F (r, z)βη
(
R
R′0"
")δ(r,z)
, (2.1)"
"For the parameterization of F (r, z) and δ(r, z), one can refer to [64]. The size of IH is
represented by its half thickness ξzh, whereas the OH region’s is (1− ξ)zh."
"In this work, we adopt the common diffusion-reacceleration (DR) model, with the"
"diffusive-reacceleration coefficient Dpp coupled to Dxx by DppDxx =
4p2v2A"
"3δ(4− δ2)(4− δ)
, in"
which vA is the so-called Alfvén velocity [66]. The numerical package DRAGON is used to
"solve the SDP equation to obtain the distribution of comic ray electrons (CREs). During the
propagation, the energetic CREs still suffer from the energy loss from synchrotron radiation
and inverse Compton scattering [67, 68]. A full-relativistic treatment of the inverse-Compton
losses [69] has been implemented in the DRAGON package [70]. Less than tens of GeV, the
CR fluxes are impacted by the solar modulation. The well-known force-field approximation
[71, 72] is applied to describe such an effect, with a modulation potential φ adjusted to fit
the low energy data."
2.2 Supernova remnants
"The SNRs are regarded as the most likely sites for the acceleration of CRs by default, in
which the charge particles are accelerated to a power-law distribution through the diffusive
shock acceleration. The distribution of SNRs are approximated as an axisymmetric, which is
usually parameterized as"
"f(r, z) ="
")α
exp"
"[
−
β(r − r�)"
"(
−
|z|
zs"
")
, (2.2)"
"where r� ≡ 8.5 kpc represents the solar distance to the Galactic center. The parameters α
and β are taken as 1.09 and 3.87 respectively in this work [73]. Perpendicular to the Galactic
plane, the density of CR sources descends exponentially, with a mean value zs = 100 pc. The
axisymmetric approximation is plausible as the diffusion length of CR nuclei is usually much
longer than the characteristic spacing between the neighbouring spiral arms. However, subject
to the energy loss from synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering, the transport
distance of the energetic electrons is much shorter so that the above approximation may no
longer hold. Thus the inclusion of a more realistic description of the source distribution is
expected to have striking impact on the observed spectrum of high-energy electrons."
"As is well-known, our Milky Way is a spiral galaxy. In this work, the spiral distribution
of SNRs follows the model established by [74]. The Galaxy consists of four major arms, with
the locus of the i-th arm centroid expressed as a logarithmic curve: θ(r) = ki ln(r/ri0) + θ"
"where r is the distance to the Galactic center. For the values of ki, ri0 and θ
i
0 for each arm,"
"one can refer to [64]. Along each spiral arm, there is a spread in the normal direction which
follows a Gaussian distribution, i.e."
"fi =

"]
, i ∈ [1, 2, 3, 4] , (2.3)"
"where ri is the inverse function of the i-th spiral arm’s locus and σi is equal to 0.07ri. The
number density of SNRs at different radii still conforms with the radial distribution in the
axisymmetric case, i.e. Eq (2.2). The injection spectra of nuclei and electron are assumed to"
"have a broken power-law, i.e."

2.3 Local source: Geminga
"The Geminga SNR locates at its birth place with the distance and age of r = 330 pc and
tinj = 3.3× 105 yrs [75]. Moreover, the observed direction is roughly consistent with the large
scale anisotropy of CRs below 100 TeV. However some authors think that the large anisotroy
was caused by the local magnetic field and has no relation to the direction of astrophysical
sources [76–78]. The current Geminga pulsar is located at 250 pc to solar system [79]. In this
work, we assume that Geminga pulsar accounts for the positron excess above ∼ 20 GeV and
Geminga SNR is responsible for the excesses of the electron and nuclei above 200 GeV."
"The propagation of positrons, electrons and nuclei from Geminga SNR and pulsar is
described by the time-dependent propagation equation, i.e."
"∂t
−Dxx∆ϕ+"
"∂E
(Ėϕ) = Q(E, t)δ(r − r′) . (2.5)"
"For the nuclei, the energy loss can be safely neglected, i.e. Ė = 0. But the energy loss
of the electrons and positrons is significant and has to be taken into account during their
propagation. Here their energy loss rate Ė is approximated as Ė = −bE2 in the Thomson
limit[80]. They are injected into the interstellar space as a power-law spectrum plus a high
energy cutoff, i.e."
"Q(R, t) = Q0(t)

"with Rc the cutoff rigidity. Compared with the Geminga SNR, whose injection is burst-like,
a continuous injection process of electron-positron pairs is considered for the Geminga pulsar.
Therefore the time-dependent injection rate Q0(t) at 1 GV is written as"

"where tSNR/psrinj and τ0 are the initial injection time and characteristic duration [81, 82]. The
injected energy spectral index for SNR and pulsar, which are listed in Table 1, are different."
"The solution of Green function G(r, t, E) of the time-dependent propagation equation can be
found in [83]. The propagated spectrum from Geminga SNR and pulsar is thus a convolution
of Green function with time-dependent injection rate Q(R, t) [81, 84], i.e."

3 Results
"The propagation parameters used in this work refer to [64], which well fit the recent ob-
servations of proton, helium and B/C ratio. The diffusion coefficient parameters are D0 =
9.65× 1028 cm2 · s−1 at R"
"′
0 = 4 GV, δ0 = 0.65, Nm = 0.24 and ξ= 0.12. The thickness of the"
"propagation halo is zh = 5 kpc, and the Alfvén velocity is vA = 6 km ·s−1. The corresponding
injected spectra of proton and helium are applied to calculate the yields of secondary elec-
trons and positrons during the transport, with the production cross section taken from the
Fluka package [85]. The Geminga pulsar is assumed to be r = 0.25 kpc away from the solar
system and tpsrinj = 2×10"
"5 years old. At low energies the behavior of continuous injection from
Geminga pulsar is similar to burstlike injection. However, at higher energies it is qualitatively
different and the break-off due to the absortion is disppeared [80]."
"Fig. 1 illustrates the calculated spectra of positrons (top), electrons (middle) and total
spectrum of positron and electron (bottom). For both electrons and positrons, the measure-
ments by the AMS-02 experiment are taken. As for total spectrum of positron and electron,
the latest observation of HESS is also included as blue data points. The blue and yellow solid
lines are the primary electrons from SNRs and secondary electrons/positrons generated dur-
ing the propagation respectively. The green solid lines are the electrons/positrons generated
by the Geminga pulsar."
"First of all, we attempt to account for the positron excess, which is shown in the left
panel of Fig. 1. As can be seen that due to the SDP, the propagated background positron
and electron spectra flatten above tens of GeV, compared with the conventional propagation
model. This is similar to the spectral hardening of cosmic-ray nuclei during SDP. But unlike
the CR nuclei, the energy loss of electrons shifts that excess to the lower energy, i.e. about
tens of GeV. This is consistent with the hardening of electrons uncovered by the recent
experiments. Meanwhile due to the FLUKA generation cross section as well as the SDP +
spiral scenario, the background secondary positron flux also enhances overall greatly so that
the positron spectrum above 10 GeV could be well accounted for. These features have been
entensively discussed in the previous work [64]."
"The calculations show that to describe the positron break at ∼ 284 GeV, as shown in the
top left panel of Fig. 1, the cutoff rigidityRc in the injection spectrum of the Geminga pulsar is
800 GV. However we notice that when adopting this value, both electron and total spectrum
of positron and electron are inadequate to explain above ∼ 200 GeV. This is particularly
evident in the total spectrum of positron and electron when we allow for the HESS data
above 1 TeV. The calculated total spectrum of positron and electron is far less than the
measurements between ∼ 200 GeV and 2 TeV."
"We further change the cutoff rigidity Rc to fit the total spectrum of positron and electron
and study its influence of the TeV break on the positron spectrum, as demonstrated in the
right panel of Fig. 1. In this case, Rc is 2300 GV in order to fit the total spectrum of positron
and electron. But the positron flux continue rising above 200 GeV until ∼ 600 GeV then drop"

"off. Its flux significantly exceeds the lastest AMS-02 measurements above ∼ 300 GeV. This
excess results from the higher energy cutoff of the positrons. Therefore it is obvious that if"
"the drop-off of positron flux measured by the AMS-02 experiment is correct, inevitably there
are extra electrons."
"It should be emphasized that this excess also holds for other measurements, e.g. DAMPE.
Compared with AMS-02, the DAMPE expeiment could observe CREs beyond TeV energies,
from tens of GeV to 5 TeV, well covering the energy range of our concern. But the measured
total spectrum of positron and electron is overall higher than that of AMS-02 when the ener-
gies exceed 70 GeV. Moreover, it has no measurements of electrons and positrons because it
is incapable of separating positrons from electrons. Nevertheless, for the background compo-
nent, the electron flux far exceeds the positron flux, therefore the background flux could be
approximated as the electron contribution. The parameters of electron flux fitting DAMPE
experiment are listed in Table 1. Since the measured total spectrum of positron and electron
by DAMPE is harder than AMS-02, the background electron flux is harder, with power index
is 2.55 less than 1100 GeV and 3.0 above that energy. It can be found that to explain the
whole energy range of DAMPE experiment, the high energy cutoff of Geminga pulsar have
to be 2300, i.e. model B, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 2. If the cutoff rigidity of model
A are adopted, the similar absence also appears at around TeV energies, see the left panel of
Fig. 2."

"The feature of excess in the total spectrum of positron and electron are further studied.
After subtracting the theoretical model from the experimental data points, an additional
bump of electrons appears, which is shown as circles in Fig. 3. The red circles are the residuals
of AMS-02 minus model, whereas the blue circles are the residuals of HESS minus model.
We can see both residual are consistent. The residual electrons for DAMPE measurement
are shown in the right panel of Fig. 3. The blue solid lines shows the propagated electrons
from Geminga SNR. As can be seen that both bumps of HESS and DAMPE are consistent
and they can be well described by a time dependent propagation of local electrons. Above
TeV energies, the spectrum falls off rapidly. However, the Klein Nishina effect of the inverse
Compton scattering may also have some effect on regulating the electron spectrum[86–88].
The injected parameters used to fit HESS are also hold for DAMPE, which are listed in Table
1."

4 Conclusion
"The precise measurements of CRs enable us to better reveal their origins. Recently, AMS-02
collaboration have upgraded their measurements of CR electrons and positrons. Compared
with the previous observations, a new positron break-off above ∼ 284 GeV has been found.
This is different from the electron spectrum, whose power-law spectrum extends to the higher
energy and has a break at about TeV energies. In this work, we study the high energy cutoff
of electron and positron spectra based on the SDP model. A conventional SNR background
plus local pulsar model is applied. We find there is a tension in the high energy cutoff between
the positron and total spectrum of positron and electron in this simple scenario. Compared
with total spectrum of positron and electron, which requires the cutoff rigidity of Geminga
puslar is 2300 GV, to well fit positron dropoff, the high energy cutoff of the Geminga pulsar
is just 800 GV. Therefore if the observed cutoff of positron flux is correct, there are extra
electrons from ∼ 200 GeV to 2 TeV which are not accounted for. This excess of electrons has
not be been claimed as far as we know."
"After subtracting the calculated electron and positron fluxes from the measured total
spectrum of positron and electron, the excessive electrons has a bump-like structure. And
we show this excess is common whatever AMS-02, HESS or DAMPE measurements. This
feature indicates an origin of local sources. One of probable source is Geminga SNR. This
source has been used to account for both spectral hardening of CR nuclei and large-scale
anisotropy. Meanwhile the Geminga pulsar is widely believed to be source of the positron
excess. We find that the extra component could be decently explained by the Geminga SNR.
Therefore the observational features of Galactic cosmic rays could be accounted for in our
unified picture with SNR background plus a local source, even this excess of electons. At
present, the measurements of positrons above 200 GeV are still inaccurate, with quite large
errors. We expect the coming precise measurements could testify our speculation."
