ABSTRACT
"Context. Many galaxy clusters host Mpc scale diffuse radio sources called radio halos. Their origin is tightly connected to the
processes that lead to the formation of clusters themselves. In order to unveil this connection, statistical studies of the radio properties
of clusters combined with their thermal properties are necessary. To this purpose, we selected a sample of galaxy clusters with
M500 ≥ 6× 1014 M� and z = 0.08− 0.33 from the Planck SZ catalogue. In paper I, we presented the radio and X-ray data analysis that
we carried out on the clusters of this sample.
Aims. In this paper, we exploited the wealth of data presented in paper I to study the radio properties of the sample, in connection to
the mass and dynamical state of clusters.
Methods. We used the dynamical information derived from the X-ray data to assess the role of mergers in the origin of radio halos. We
studied the distribution of clusters in the radio power – mass diagram, the scaling between the radio luminosity of radio halos and the
mass of the host clusters and the role of dynamics on the radio luminosity and emissivity of radio halos. We measured the occurrence
of radio halos as a function of the cluster mass and we compared it with the expectations of models developed in the framework of
turbulent acceleration.
Results. We found that more than the 90% of radio halos are in merging clusters and that their radio power correlates with the mass
of the host clusters. The correlation shows a large dispersion. Interestingly, we showed that cluster dynamics contributes significantly
to this dispersion with more disturbed clusters being more radio luminous. Clusters without radio halos are generally relaxed and the
upper limits to their diffuse emission lie below the correlation. Moreover, we showed that the radio emissivity of clusters exhibits an
apparent bimodality, with the emissivity of radio halos being at least ∼ 5 times larger than the non-emission associated with more
relaxed clusters. We found that the fraction of radio halos drops from ∼ 70% in high mass clusters to ∼ 35% in the lower mass systems
of the sample and we showed that this result is in good agreement with the expectations from turbulent re-acceleration models."

1. Introduction
"An increasing number of galaxy clusters show diffuse syn-
chrotron emission detected in the radio band. This emission re-
veals that the Intra Cluster Medium (ICM) is permeated with
relativistic particles and magnetic fields. Cluster-scale radio
sources can be in form of radio halos, radio relics or mini ha-
los (van Weeren et al. 2019, for a review). Radio halos are the
main focus of this paper. They are found at the centre of some
merging galaxy clusters and have typical size of 1 − 2 Mpc."
"In current models, radio halos have origin when electrons in
the ICM are re-accelerated by turbulence, injected during merger
events (Brunetti & Jones 2014, for a review). In this scenario, the
properties of radio halos should be connected to the mass and to
the merging history of the host clusters. The statistical study of"
"large samples of galaxy clusters with deep radio observations
is necessary to investigate this connection. In this respect, a big
step forward has been done during the past few decades, mainly
thanks to the combination of radio and X-ray observations (e.g.
Giovannini et al. 1999; Kempner & Sarazin 2001; Liang et al.
2000; Venturi et al. 2007, 2008; Kale et al. 2013, 2015). It has
been shown that the radio power of radio halos correlates with
the X-ray luminosity of the host clusters (e.g. Liang et al. 2000;
Brunetti et al. 2009). Moreover, clusters without radio halos (for
which upper limits are available) lie well below this correlation
(Brunetti et al. 2007). While the connection between the pres-
ence of radio halos and the clusters’ merging state had been
previously proposed for a few cases (Buote 2001; Markevitch
& Vikhlinin 2001; Govoni et al. 2004), Cassano et al. (2010b)"

"found the first statistical evidence that radio halos are predom-
inately found in merging clusters, while clusters without halo
detection are generally relaxed. More recently, similar studies
have been also performed in samples selected through Sunyaev-
Zel’dovich (SZ) measurements. This was a major improvement
in the study of diffuse emission in clusters, because the SZ ef-
fect is currently the best available proxy of the cluster mass (e.g.
Nagai 2006), which is the key parameter in the models for the
formation of radio halos, as it sets the energy budget available
for particle acceleration. A correlation has been found also be-
tween the synchrotron power of radio halos and the mass of the
host clusters (Basu 2012; Cassano et al. 2013). Although earlier
studies were unable to find a clear segregation between radio ha-
los and upper limits in SZ-selected clusters (Basu 2012), thanks
to the improved statistics, Cassano et al. (2013) showed that a
bimodal behaviour is also observed in the radio power-mass dia-
gram. Sommer & Basu (2014) showed that the fraction of radio
halos in mass-selected sample is larger with respect to X-ray se-
lected samples."
"To perform a solid statistical study of radio halos in a large
mass-selected sample of galaxy clusters, we selected 75 clusters
with M5001 ≥ 6 × 1014 M� and z = 0.08 − 0.33 from the Planck
SZ catalogue (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014). In Cuciti et al.
(2015), we analysed the occurrence of radio halos in a subsample
of 57 clusters with available literature information mainly com-
ing from previous works based on X-ray selected samples (e.g.
Venturi et al. 2007, 2008). We showed that the fraction of radio
halos drops in low mass systems. However, that result, could be
affected by the incompleteness of the sample, and we therefore
carried out a radio observational campaign to cover all the re-
maining clusters. Thanks to these observations, this is now the
largest (> 80% complete) mass-selected sample of clusters with
complete deep radio observations 2he typical sensitivity of these
observations is ∼ 50− 100 mJy/beam at 610 MHz and ∼ 20− 70
mJy/beam at 1.4 GHz, see paper I. In paper I, we presented the
results of these new observations and we summarised the radio
and X-ray properties of the sample drawn from the observations.
Here, we exploit the wealth of information acquired on the sam-
ple to perform the statistical analysis of the radio properties of
these clusters, in connection to their mass and dynamics. In par-
ticular, now that the limitations associated to the incompleteness
of the subsample in Cuciti et al. (2015) have been overcome, we
aim to address: the distribution of galaxy clusters in the radio
power-mass diagram, the difference in ‘radio loudness’ between
merging and non merging clusters, the occurrence of radio halos
as a function of the cluster mass and its comparison with model
expectations."
"In Section 2 we briefly summarise the radio properties of the
sample. In Section 3 we discuss the connection between the pres-
ence of radio halos and the disturbed dynamical state of clusters.
We analyse the distribution of clusters in the radio power–mass
and radio emissivity–mass diagrams in Section 4. We measure
the occurrence of radio halos as a function of the cluster mass
in Section 5 and we compare it with the model expectations. In
Section 6, we summarise the main results of this work. Through-
out this paper we assume a ΛCDM cosmology with H0 = 70 km
s−1Mpc−1, ΩΛ = 0.7 and Ωm = 0.3."
"1 M500 is the mass enclosed in a sphere with radius R500, defined as the
radius within which the mean mass over-density of the cluster is 500
times the cosmic critical density at the cluster redshift
2 T"
2. The sample
"The sample analysed in this paper is composed of 75 galaxy clus-
ters, selected from the Planck SZ cluster catalogue. The selection
criteria, extensively discussed in Cuciti et al. (2015) and paper I,
can be summarised as follows:"
"– at redshift 0.08 < z < 0.2 we selected clusters with M500 ≥
5.7 × 1014M�"
"– at redshift 0.2 < z < 0.33 we selected clusters with M500 ≥
6 × 1014 M�"
"Combining literature information with our new observations,
all these clusters have available radio information at ∼ GHz fre-
quencies. 63 clusters also have archival Chandra X-ray observa-
tions. The radio and X-ray data analysis are discussed in paper I.
Here, we summarise the diffuse sources present in our sample:"
"– 28 (∼37%) clusters host radio halos, 10 of them are USSRH
(Ultra Steep Spectrum) or candidate USSRH"
"– seven (∼10%) clusters have radio relics, five of them also
have radio halos (and have been already counted above)"
– 11 (∼15%) clusters host mini halos
"Moreover, we found candidate diffuse emission in six clus-
ters, one is a candidate mini halo and five are candidate radio
halos. 31 (∼41%) clusters do not show any hint of central diffuse
emission at the sensitivity of current observations. Combining
the work done in paper I with literature information, we were
able to derive upper limits for 22 of these clusters. For clusters
with GMRT data only (∼ 50%), we scaled the upper limits to 1.4
GHz assuming a typical spectral index α = −1.3 (van Weeren
et al. 2019). The lack of upper limits for the remaining 9 clus-
ters is mainly due to the bad data quality or to the presence of
artifacts around bright sources affecting the cluster’s field. We
note that these 9 clusters do not show any significant deviation
in terms of dynamics with respect to the 22 clusters with avail-
able upper limits. Moreover, they are uniformly distributed in
mass. For these reasons we do not expect the lack of these upper
limits to significantly affect the results presented in this paper."
3. Radio halo–merger connection
"It is widely accepted that radio halos are preferentially found
in merging clusters (e.g. Cassano et al. 2010b, 2013; Bonafede
et al. 2015; Kale et al. 2015; Cuciti et al. 2015). In this con-
text, our sample offers the opportunity to assess the radio halo
merger connection in a large and mass-complete sample of clus-
ters. We used three morphological parameters that are largely
used in the literature to define the dynamical state of clusters: the
concentration parameter, c, the centroid shift, w and the power
ratios, P3/P0 (Buote 2001; Santos et al. 2008; Lovisari et al.
2017; Andrade-Santos et al. 2017; Rossetti et al. 2017, see pa-
per I). Fig. 1 shows the three morphological diagrams c − w,
c − P3/P0 and w − P3/P0. The dashed lines are adapted from
Cassano et al. (2010b) and correspond to c = 0.2,w = 0.012 and
P3/P0 = 1.2× 10−7. In these plots, relaxed clusters are in the re-
gions with high values of c and low values of w and P3/P0, and
they become gradually more disturbed going towards the oppo-
site corner of the diagrams. Mini halos are marked as triangles
in Fig. 1 and they all lie in the regions of relaxed systems. Ac-
cording to the morphological parameters classification and con-
sidering that A1689 (that would be classified as relaxed based on
morphological parameters) is a merging system with the merger
occurring along the line of sight (Andersson & Madejski 2004),"
"Article number, page 2 of 15"
V. Cuciti et al.: Radio halos in a mass-selected sample of 75 galaxy clusters
"Fig. 1. a) c − w, b) c − P3/P0, c) w − P3/P0 morphological diagrams for the clusters in our sample with available X-ray Chandra data. Vertical
and horizontal dashed lines are adapted from Cassano et al. (2010b) and are: c = 0.2, w = 0.012, and P3/P0 = 1.2 × 10−7. Red circles are radio
halos. Black squares represent clusters without radio halos. Black triangles are clusters with mini halos. The values of the parameters plotted here
are listed in paper I, Table 5. The names label clusters that are explicitly mentioned in the text."
"more than the 90% of radio halos in this sample are hosted by
merging clusters, while only two of them (<10%) are found in
more relaxed systems. These two clusters are A2142 and A2261.
A2142 is a minor merging systems hosting multiple Mpc-scale
cold fronts (Markevitch et al. 2000; Owers et al. 2011; Rossetti
et al. 2013; Venturi et al. 2017) and A2261 would be classified
as a dynamically intermediate cluster from our visual inspection
(paper I), due to the presence of substructures on large scale."
"Fig.1 shows that only ∼ 60% of merging clusters host ra-
dio halos, confirming previous studies (e.g. Cassano et al. 2013;
Bonafede et al. 2017). This suggests that mergers are not the
unique players in the formation of radio halos (Brunetti & Jones
2014). One major player is the mass of the clusters that sets the
amount of energy released during merger events. To investigate
the role of the cluster mass in the radio halo merger connection,
we split the clusters into two sub-samples according to the me-"
"dian mass value of M500 = 7 × 1014M�, which guarantees equal
statistics in each sub-sample. We focus on c and w because they
are the most robust parameters to define the dynamical state of
clusters and they are also determined with much higher accuracy
with respect to the power ratios (paper I and references therein).
Fig. 2 shows that the fraction of merging clusters without radio
halos is ∼20% in high mass systems, while it is ∼65% in low
mass objects. If we attempt to interpret this evidence in the con-
text of turbulent re-acceleration models, it is the consequence
of the fact that massive and merging systems form radio halos
emitting up to high frequency, while merging events in low mass
cluster may not induce enough turbulence to accelerate particles
up to the energies necessary to emit radiation at GHz frequency
(Cassano et al. 2006, 2010b). In this scenario, a large fraction
of these lower mass merging clusters should host USSRH (e.g.
Brunetti et al. 2008; Cassano et al. 2012)."

"Fig. 2 also shows that the two clusters with radio halos that
appear dynamically relaxed from the morphological parameters
(A2142 and A2261) are both in the high-mass bin. This sug-
gests that, in massive clusters, a minor merger may be sufficient
to generate radio halos even though the X-ray morphology of
the cluster does not look extremely disturbed, whilst low mass-
systems need major mergers introducing a larger amount of tur-
bulent energy in the ICM to accelerate electrons and produce
radio diffuse emission."
4. Radio power–mass diagram
"In this Section we investigate the distribution of clusters, with
and without radio halos, in the radio power–mass diagram. The
values of P1.4GHz and M500 are listed in Table 1 of paper I."
"All radio halos of the sample, with the exception of three
USSRHs, namely A1132 (Wilber et al. 2018), RXCJ1514.9-
1523 (Giacintucci et al. 2011), and RXCJ1314.4-2515 (Venturi
et al. 2007), have radio powers measured at 1.4 GHz. For these
three USSRHs, that have been measured only at low radio fre-
quency, we extrapolated their 1.4 GHz radio powers with the es-
timated spectral index and we adopted a conservative uncertainty
of 30–50%, corresponding to a variation in α of 0.3-0.4."
4.1. Fitting procedure
"We followed the fitting procedure outlined in Cassano et al.
(2013). Specifically, we fit a power-law relation in the log–log
space by adopting the BCES linear regression algorithms (Akri-
tas & Bershady 1996) which take measurement errors in both
variables into account. We fitted the observed P1.4GHz − M500
data points with a power-law in the form:"

"(

+ A (1)"
"where A and B are the intercept and the slope of the correlation,
respectively."
"Considering Y = log(P1.4GHz) − 24.5 and X = log(M500) −
14.9, and having a sample of N data points (Xi,Yi) with errors
(σXi , σYi ) the raw scatter of the correlation can be estimated as:"

"Since we are dealing with a limited sample, we obtain a sam-
pled regression line that can deviate from the true (unknown)
regression line. To evaluate the 95% confidence region of the
best-fit relation, that is to say the area that has the 95% proba-
bility of containing the ‘true’ regression line, we calculated the
95% confidence interval of the mean value of Y , 〈Y〉. For a given

4.2. Results of the fitting
"Different fitting methods may give different results (e.g. Isobe
et al. 1990). Therefore, it is important to choose the most suited
regression method depending on the data in hand. Based on pre-
vious studies (e.g. Cassano et al. 2013; Martinez Aviles et al.
2016), we expect the correlation between the radio power of
radio halos and the mass of clusters to be steep and the radio
powers to show a large scatter around the correlation. The large
scatter is due to the superposition of clusters with different merg-
ing histories, in different phases of the merger events and with"

"different radio spectra (e.g. Donnert et al. 2013). Thus, it is rea-
sonable to treat the radio power as the dependent variable and
use the Y|X fitting method, which minimises the residuals in the
Y variable. Another possibility, is to assume that both variables
are quasi-independent and treat them symmetrically, using either
the bisector method, which represents the bisector between the
Y|X and X|Y regression lines, or the orthogonal method, which
minimises the orthogonal distances. All these methods are avail-
able among the BCES linear regression algorithms (Akritas &
Bershady 1996). In the following, we will report the results ob-
tained with the Y|X and bisector methods."
"We show the distribution of radio halos and USSRHs of our
sample (which we will refer to as the ‘statistical’ sample) in the
radio power–mass diagram in the left panel of Fig. 3, together
with the best fit line for radio halos only obtained with the BCES
Y|X method (see Figure caption). In line with previous findings
(e.g. Cassano et al. 2013), USSRHs and candidate USSRHs are
on or below the correlation. Even considering only radio halos
with classical spectrum, we note a significant scatter around the
correlation. A possible source of the scatter is a different emit-
ting volume of the halos. For example, in Cuciti et al. (2018) we
found two small radio halos lying below the correlation. In these
cases, it is reasonable to expect that they have a synchrotron
emissivity similar to that of larger radio halos, but they are less
luminous simply because the total luminosity is produced in a
smaller volume. To investigate this, we measured the radii of the
radio halos as RH ="
"√
Rmin × Rmax, where Rmin and Rmax are the"
"maximum and minimum radii measured on the 3σ isophote, re-
spectively (Cassano et al. 2007)3. We show the distribution of
(RH/R500)3, which is proportional to the volume of radio halos,"
3 For elongated radio halos (Rmax >> Rmin) we multiplied RH for a
"factor
√"
"Rmin
Rmax"
to take the ellipticity of radio halos into account.
"in the right panel of Fig. 3. The majority of radio halos are dis-
tributed around (RH/R500)3 = 0.06 − 0.15."
"There are four radio halos whose volumes are ∼ 6−20 times
smaller than the average radio halos in our sample. They are in
the clusters Z0634, A3411, A1689 and A2218 and they are all
underluminous with respect to the correlation (Fig. 3, left). In-
terestingly, the size of these four small radio halos roughly co-
incides with the threshold value between radio halos and mini
halos (RH ≈ 0.2 × R500) defined by Giacintucci et al. (2017). On
the other hand, no halos with volume larger than 5− 6 times that
of the average halos are found."
"Since the radio luminosity of these four radio halos is gen-
erated in a much smaller volume, their radio power cannot be
directly compared to the power of giant (RH ∼ Mpc) radio ha-
los4. Also, their radio power cannot be directly compared to the
upper limits because upper limits are derived using RH = 500
kpc by choice (corresponding to about RH/R500 ∼ 0.4 for the
typical masses and redshift in our sample). Indeed, if we inject
the fake radio halos on smaller scales, the upper limits would
be deeper (Brunetti et al. 2007). Therefore, we removed them
from the radio luminosity mass diagram and we performed the
fit again."
"The correlation for the statistical sample without small radio
halos is shown in the left panel of Fig. 4 and in the top panel of
Table 1 we report the best fit parameters obtained with the BCES
Y|X and bisector methods, together with those from a 5000 boot-
strap resampling analysis (see Akritas & Bershady 1996). We
report also the raw scatter of the correlation and the Spearman"
"4 An additional possibility is that these radio halos appear small be-
cause our observations did not recover their entire extension. However,
this would also imply that a large fraction of their flux is lost by our ob-
servations and that their luminosities are biased low compared to those
of the other halos in our sample."

"coefficient, rs, which is a measure of the monotonicity of the re-
lationship between two variables 5 (Spearman 1904). We note
that the bootstrap confidence intervals are quite large meaning
that the fitting is likely undetermined. This can be a consequence
of the cut in mass at M500 ≥ 6 × 1014M� of our sample, that im-
plies a small mass range (< 0.4 in log space) to estimate the
correlation coefficients."
"To evaluate the possible effect of this cut on the regression
analysis, we performed Montecarlo simulations that we describe
in Appendix A. We randomly distributed a number of clus-
ters with masses in the range M500 = (1 − 16) × 1014M� on
a known correlation (‘true’ correlation, that we assume to ex-
tend as a power law also at low masses) and we applied a fixed
scatter in both Y and X to distribute them around the correla-
tion. Then, we selected from the distribution only clusters with
M500 ≥ 6 × 1014M�. We repeated these two steps 500 times
and each time we performed the linear regression with the three
methods mentioned above, comparing the resulting slopes with
the ‘true’ one. We found that, in the presence of a steep corre-
lation with a fairly large scatter, all the fitting methods tend to
give steeper slopes once the cut in the X variable is introduced.
In particular, the orthogonal method is the most affected by the
presence of the cut, giving the most significant deviations from
the true slopes. According to our Montecarlo simulations we ex-
pect the ‘true’ correlation to be ∼ 0.2− 0.3 flatter with respect to
what we find in our sample if we focus on the Y|X method and
we assume the scatter to be predominantly in the Y axis (see Fig.
A.1, bottom left)."
"5 rs = −1 implies a perfect monotonically decreasing relation, rs = +1
implies a perfect monotonically increasing relation and rs = 0 implies
no correlation."

"We attempted to mitigate the limitation due to the small
range in mass spanned by the clusters of the statistical sample by
considering also an ‘extended’ sample, resulting from the com-
bination with a sub-sample from Cassano et al. (2013) and Mar-
tinez Aviles et al. (2016). In particular, we added only clusters
in the same redshift range of our sample (six radio halos). Since
one of the goals of this Section is to study the distribution of ra-
dio halos and upper limits in the radio power–mass diagram (see
Section 4.4), we added also the upper limits (five) from Cassano
et al. (2013) in the same redshift range of our sample. The prop-
erties of these additional clusters are listed in Table 2. We point
out that all these six radio halos have radio powers measured at
1.4 GHz. This allows us to study the scaling relation with larger
statistics and, most importantly, within a larger mass range."
"The results obtained by applying the fitting procedure to the
radio halos of the extended sample are summarised in the bot-
tom panel of Table 1 and shown in the right panel of Fig. 4.
We note that the bootstrap confidence intervals are now more in
agreement with the analytic estimates, meaning that the fitting
parameters are now better determined."
"Although they agree with each other within the 1-σ uncer-
tainties, we note that the correlation derived for the extended
sample, is slightly flatter, of ∼ 0.3, compared to that derived for
the statistical sample. This is in line with the outcome of our
Montecarlo simulations, suggesting that possible biases due to
the addition of a small sub-sample of low-mass clusters from the
literature (i.e. the radio brightest ones) are likely marginal. We
stress however that only future studies of statistical samples of
galaxy clusters covering a larger range of cluster masses, down
to few 1014M�, have the potential to unambiguously determine
the slope of the correlation."
"Depending on the regression method used, the slope of the
correlation ranges from 2.7 to 3.5. This is consistent with the
findings of Cassano et al. (2013) and Martinez Aviles et al."

"(2016). As a further check, we derived the correlation param-
eters using the Bayesian regression method linear regression in
astronomy (LIRA Sereno 2016). By default, LIRA treats X as
the independent variable and Y as the dependent one. We ap-
plied LIRA to the extended sample, excluding the small radio
halos and USSRH. We obtained a slope B = 2.85 ± 1.3, which
is in fact consistent with the BCES Y|X estimation. The larger
uncertainty in the slope estimate with LIRA is due to the fact
that this method considers a larger number of parameters with
respect to BCES (Sereno 2016)."
4.3. Scatter of the correlation and clusters’ dynamics
"For all fitting methods, the correlation shows a fairly large scat-
ter (Table 1), slightly larger than the one found by Cassano et al.
(2013). Different mergers may generate different spectra and a
large range of radio emitting volumes (extension of the turbu-
lent regions), as we also see in the right panel of Fig. 3. The
time evolution of radio halos may also contribute to the scatter
of the correlation. Indeed, simulations show that the synchrotron
emission evolves with the cluster dynamics, increasing in the
early stage of the merger, when turbulence accelerates electrons,
and then decreasing along with the dissipation of turbulence at
later merger stages (Donnert et al. 2013). In the radio power–
mass plane, this induces a migration of clusters from the region
of the upper limits to the correlation (or above) and then a pro-
gressive dimming of the radio power together with a steepening
of the spectrum. Yuan et al. (2015) suggested that the scatter of
the radio power – X-ray luminosity correlation can be signif-
icantly reduced if the dynamical state of clusters is taken into
account. Focusing on the statistical sample, without the addi-
tional clusters in Table 2, we show in Fig. 5 the distance (on
the P1.4GHz axis) of radio halos from the correlation vs their X-
ray morphological disturbance, measured as the distance from"

"ity has a key role in determining the position of radio halos with
respect to the correlation, thus inducing at least part of the large
scatter that we observe around the correlation. This is in line with
previous findings based on simulations (Donnert et al. 2013)."
"It is interesting to note that the fraction of USSRH or can-
didate USSRH among the most disturbed clusters in Fig. 5 is
∼ 20%, whereas it is ∼ 70% in the less disturbed systems. Al-
though the available statistics on USSRH is still poor and the in-
formation on the spectra is currently not homogeneous, this hint
can be interpreted as the consequence of the fact that less ener-
getic mergers induce a low level of turbulence in the ICM, which
in turn is not able to accelerate particles up to the energy neces-
sary to emit at ∼GHz frequencies. These less disturbed systems
can be either minor mergers or systems in their very late or very
early merger state, which are expected to appear more relaxed in
the X-rays and to develop steep radio spectra (e.g. Donnert et al.
2013). Interestingly, our results are in line with recent findings
suggesting that steep-spectrum halos reside in clusters with high
X-ray luminosity relative to that expected from the mass-X-ray
luminosity scaling relations, indicating that such systems may
be in an earlier state of the merger (Bîrzan et al. 2019). Finally,
we also note that small radio halos are predominantly found in
less disturbed systems, possibly suggesting that minor mergers
dissipate turbulence in smaller volumes."
4.4. Radio bimodality
"It is well known that merging clusters with radio halos lie on the
radio luminosity–mass (or X-ray luminosity) correlation, while
relaxed clusters typically do not host radio halos and their ra-
dio power lies well below the correlation (Brunetti et al. 2007,
2009; Cassano et al. 2013). Here we investigate the presence of
a bimodal behaviour of clusters with and without radio halos in"
"the radio power-mass diagram focusing on the extended sam-
ple without small radio halos (Fig. 4, right). We found that, for
clusters with M500 & 5.5 × 1014M�, almost all the upper limits
(∼ 90%) are below the 95% confidence region of the correlation,
confirming previous studies (e.g. Cassano et al. 2013)."
"To further investigate the radio distribution of clusters with
and without radio halos in the P1.4GHz −M500 diagram, we made
use of another method of regression analysis, based on the Ex-
pectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, that is implemented in
the ASURV package (Isobe et al. 1986) and deals with upper
limits as ‘censored data’. We applied the EM regression algo-
rithm to the radio halos only and then to the combined radio
halos and upper limits. The resulting best fits are shown in Fig.
6 and are summarised in the bottom lines of Table 1. The corre-
lation obtained including upper limits in the fit (dashed line) is
much steeper than the one derived using only detections. This is
due to the fact that the EM algorithm allows for the ‘censored
data’ to assume values smaller than those of the upper limits in
an iterative process whose aim is to find a maximum likelihood
solution. This, in addition to the fact that upper limits dominate
the cluster statistics at low masses and that the bulk of them is
clustered quite below the detections, leads to a best-fit that is
significantly different from the bet-fit line to radio halos. This
hints at the existence of two distinct radio state of galaxy clus-
ters: ‘on-state’ radio halo clusters that lie on the correlation, and
‘off-state’ clusters that occupy a different region of the diagram
(see also Brown et al. 2011)."
"Clusters with upper limits at GMRT frequencies have been
extrapolated to 1.4 GHz with α = −1.3. Here we point out that a
flatter spectrum (α ∼ −1.1) would make limits only ∼ 20% shal-
lower with no impact on the conclusions of this Section. On the
other hand, a steeper spectrum would make limits even deeper,
increasing the separation from radio halos."
4.5. Emissivity of radio halos
"To study the distribution of the clusters in the radio power mass
diagram we removed the smallest radio halos, whose volume is
6−20 times smaller than the average volume of radio halos in the
sample. In general, the different emitting volumes of radio halos
may drive a significant fraction of the scatter in the P1.4GHz −
M500 diagram. Therefore, one possibility to remove this effect is
to look at the emissivity, instead of the radio luminosity. In the
following, we will focus on the statistical sample, without the
additional clusters in Table 2."
"In paper I, we derived the azimuthally averaged surface
brightness radial profile of radio halos and we fitted them with an
exponential law to obtain the central surface brightness and the
e-folding radius, re. Following Murgia et al. (2009), for these
radio halos we calculated the volume averaged emissivity by as-
suming that their flux density (obtained by integrating the best
fit exponential profile up to 3re) comes from a sphere of radius

reported in Table 3 (top panel)."
"We were able to derive the emissivity with this approach only
for radio halos with a single peak and a regularly decreasing
brightness (about half of the radio halos in our sample). Here
we estimate the emissivity also for the remaining radio halos,
assuming that the measured flux comes from a sphere of radius
RH , where RH is the one derived in Section 4.2. In Fig. 7, we
show RH , as derived in Section 4.2, as a function of re for the
radio halos that have a radial profile available. RH appears to be
well correlated with re, in particular, a simple least squares fit
gives log(RH) = 1.12 × log(re) + 0.18. We used this relation to
infer re for the remaining radio halos and we estimated I0 by as-
suming that the measured flux corresponds to the integral of an
exponential function up to RH . To estimate the emissivity of the
upper limits taken from the literature, we assumed re = 192 kpc,
to be consistent with the upper limits derived in paper I. We note
that if we use the correlation shown in Fig. 7 to estimate re for
the literature upper limits, assuming RH = 500 kpc, we would"

"obtain an offset in the emissivity of less than 10%. We report the
values of the emissivity for the remaining radio halos and upper
limits in the bottom panel of Table 3."
"We show the distribution of radio halos and upper limits in
the emissivity-mass diagram in Fig. 8. In this plot we do not
show the 4 upper limits at z > 0.31 because, although they are
similar to the rest of the upper limits in terms of flux, their lumi-
nosity and emissivity is significantly higher (equation 5), mean-
ing that the sensitivity of our current observations does not allow
to put stringent upper limits at high redshift. For consistency, we
removed also the two halos at z > 0.31 (A1351 and R2003).
This is the first time that a systematic study of the emissivities
of radio halos is performed in a statistical sample. We found that
upper limits have emissivity ∼ 10 time smaller than the bulk of
radio halos. The apparent bimodality shown in the right panel of
Fig. 8 is currently driven by the sensitivity of our observations
(which sets the level of our upper limits) and can reflect two pos-
sible intrinsic distributions: i) the emissivity of clusters without
radio halos is close to the upper limit value, meaning that the
distribution is truly bimodal and future more sensitive observa-
tions should be able to detect these radio halos, ii) the emissivity
of clusters without radio halos is for the most part much smaller
than the upper limits, in this case the upper limits would repre-
sent a tail of the radio halos emissivities extending down to 1-2
orders of magnitude below and cluster would be ‘lifted up’ from
the tail to the bulk of radio halos as a consequence of merger
events. Looking at this point with deeper observations in the fu-
ture we will be able to provide valuable information on the evo-
lution of halos and on the level of the hadronic contribution (see
Cassano et al. 2012)."
5. Occurrence of radio halos
"To measure the occurrence of radio halos as a function of the
cluster mass, we focus on the statistical sample. The great ma-
jority of the galaxy clusters with radio upper limits are below
the 95 percent confidence level spanned by the radio power-mass
correlation (Fig. 4, right); we classify these clusters as non-radio"

"Fig. 8. Emissivity vs. mass diagram (left) and emissivity distribution (right). Red circles are radio halos with available radial profile while blue
squares are the remaining radio halos. Upper limits derived in paper I injecting an exponential model are represented with black arrows, while
upper limits from the literature are the gray arrows."
"halos. In five cases (A1914, A115, PSZ1 G205.07-6294, A1763
and A2390), clusters are classified as non-radio halo from the lit-
erature using deep radio observations; although no upper limits
were derived, we classified also these cases as non-radio halos.
However, there are two upper limits consistent with the correla-
tion in our sample, and four clusters for which we were not able
to derive upper limits due to problems in the observations. More-
over there are five candidate radio halos in the sample. These
11 clusters have uncertain classification. We will consider two
cases: a ‘reduced sample’, which does not include the uncertain
cases at all and the total sample, where we assumed that can-
didate radio halos actually host radio halos and clusters without
good upper limits do not host radio halos. We point out that a ran-
dom assignment of radio halos among the 11 uncertain clusters
would lead to almost to the same measured fractions of halos."
"Following the procedure adopted in Cuciti et al. (2015), we
split the sample into two mass bins and measured the fraction of
clusters with radio halos, fRH , in the low-mass bin (LM, M <
Mlim) and in the high-mass bin (HM, M > Mlim). In particular,
we used Mlim = 8 × 1014M� for consistency with our previous
study. With this partition we have:"
"- 60 clusters in the LM bin, among which 9 host radio halos,
5 host USSRH or candidate USSRH, 3 host radio halos with
RH/R500 ∼0.2 and 11 have uncertain classification (5 candi-
date radio halos and 6 clusters without solid upper limit)."
"- 15 clusters in the HM bin, 5 of which have radio halos, 5
have USSRH or candidate USSRH, one has a radio halo with
RH/R500 ∼0.2."
"In total, there are four small radio halos in the statistical sam-
ple, one of the small halos shown in Fig. 3 belongs to the ex-
tended sample. In order to take into account the uncertainty on
the derived fractions of radio halos associated to the statistical er-
ror on the masses, we used a Monte Carlo approach. Specifically,
we randomly extracted the mass of each cluster from a Gaussian"
"distribution having median value µ = M500 and standard devia-
tion σ = σM500 where M500 and σM500 are the values of the mass
and associated error as reported in the Planck catalog7. Then,
we split the clusters into the two bins with Mlim = 8 × 1014M�
and we calculated the fractions of radio halos. We repeated this
procedure 1000 times and we assumed that the fraction of radio
halos in each bin is the mean of the resulting distribution and the
error is the standard deviation. With this approach we obtained
that the fraction of clusters with radio halos in the LM bin is
fRH = 37 ± 2% in the total sample and fRH = 35 ± 2% in the
‘reduced sample’, while in the HM bin fRH = 67 ± 6% both in
the total and reduced samples. We thus confirmed the existence
of a drop in fRH at low mass systems with a complete (& 80%
mass completeness) mass-selected sample of galaxy clusters."
5.1. Comparison with theoretical expectations
"We used the model developed by Cassano & Brunetti (2005) and
Cassano et al. (2006) to derive the formation probability of ra-
dio halos as a function of the mass of the host cluster in the
redshift range of our sample (z = 0.08 − 0.33). These models
take into account the formation history of galaxy clusters us-
ing merger trees and calculate the generation of turbulence, the
particle acceleration and the synchrotron spectrum during the
clusters’ lifetime. These models currently offer the unique pos-
sibility to calculate the expected occurrence of radio halos to be
compared with observations. The basic idea of these models is
that the synchrotron spectra of radio halos are characterised by a
steepening frequency, νs, which is the result of the competition
between turbulent acceleration and radiative (synchrotron and
Inverse Compton) losses. In general, νs & GHz is expected in
the most massive clusters, undergoing major mergers, while less"
"7 since the errors on the masses are not symmetric, here we assumed
σM500 to be equal to the largest error."

the statistical error associated to the limited size of the observed sample.
Calculations have been performed for the following choice of model
parameters: b = 1.5, 〈B〉 = 1.9 µG (where B = 〈B〉 × (M/〈M〉)b), and
the fraction of energy channelled into particle acceleration ηt = 0.2 (see
Cassano et al. 2012, and references therein). The observed fraction of
clusters with radio halos in the two mass bins is overlaid (black lines)
and refers to the three cases in Tab. 4 for the total sample. The dots
represent the average mass of the clusters in the bins."
"energetic merger events, involving clusters with smaller masses,
are expected to form radio halos with lower values of νs. These
radio halos, should show extremely steep spectra (α < −1.5,
with S (ν) ∝ να) when observed at ∼GHz frequencies and they
are expected to constitute the class of USSRH. The possibility
to detect a radio halo is thus related to the observing frequency,
νobs, in particular, the spectral steepening challenges the detec-
tion of radio halos with νs < νobs."
"We calculated the theoretical formation probability of radio
halos with νs > 600 MHz and νs > 140 MHz as a function of
the cluster mass in the redshift range z = 0.08 − 0.33 (Fig. 9).
The uncertainties in the model (red and blue shadowed regions)
are calculated with Monte Carlo extractions from the large num-
ber of theoretical merger trees and take into account the statisti-
cal error introduced by the limited size of our observed sample.
The value of νs > 600 MHz can be considered as a reference
frequency for both VLA 1.4 GHz and GMRT 610 MHz obser-
vations, that constitute the great majority of the available radio
observations for the clusters of our sample."
"In order to properly compare these expectations with our ob-
servations, we need to take two main points into account: 1)
some of the USSRH and candidate USSRH observed in our
sample may have νs < 600 MHz, in that case, they should be
‘counted’ as radio halos only in the comparison with model ex-
pectations with νs >140 MHz. 2) A limitation of these models is"
"that the size of the emitting volume is fixed at RH = 500 kpc8.
However, the volume of the small radio halos in our sample is
6− 20 times smaller than the volume assumed in models, imply-
ing that the occurrence of radio halos in these situations is biased
low in models, as a result of the fact that turbulence generated in
a smaller volume is artificially spread in a Mpc3 causing a de-
cline of particle acceleration efficiency and νs. Therefore, in the
comparison between models and observations, one option is to
consider small radio halos as non radio halos or, in alternative,
as USSRH."
"For these reasons, we consider three possibilities for the
comparison with calculations that assume a value of the mini-
mum steepening frequency νs: i) small radio halos and USSRH
are non radio clusters (i.e. their steepening frequency is assumed
to be lower than the minimum steepening frequency in the con-
sidered models), ii) small radio halos are non radio halo clusters
whereas USSRH are, iii) both small radio halos and USSRH are
considered as radio halo clusters. To simplify the comparison,
here we consider candidate USSRH as USSRH, although future
observations might not confirm their steep spectra. In Table 4 we
report the observed fractions of radio halos in these three cases
both for the reduced and the total sample. These fractions are
derived with the Monte Carlo approach described in Section 5.
We show the comparison between the predicted and observed
fraction of radio halos as a function of mass in Fig. 9. The dif-
ference between the total and the ‘reduced’ samples in terms of
fRH is marginal (Table 4), thus, in Fig. 9, we report only the total
sample, for clarity."
"In spite of the basic assumption adopted in the model there is
a remarkable agreement between the observed fraction of clus-
ters with radio halos in the two mass bins and the model ex-
pectation with νs > 600 MHz. In particular, case i) can be con-
sidered the lower limit inferred from observations in the com-
parison with this particular model, essentially because a fraction
of the USSRH and candidate USSRH in our sample might have
νs > 600 MHz. Conversely, case ii) can be considered as the up-
per limit in this comparison. On the other hand, when attempting
a comparison with models with νs > 140 MHz (blue line) cases
ii) and iii) provide the most relevant observational constraints.
These constraints are however driven by observations at higher
frequencies (600-1400 MHz, paper i) and may have lost a signif-
icant number of USSRH in our sample. As a consequence, the
discrepancy between the model predictions for νs > 140 MHz
and the observed fraction of radio halos in the LM bin implies
that a number of radio halos in low mass clusters should be dis-
covered with future low frequency observations."
"These models are anchored to the observed mass distribution
function of clusters (Press & Schechter 1974) and to the rate of
mergers that is predicted by the standard ΛCDM model and con-
sequently the fact that at low mass, the occurrence of radio halo
decrease, implies that the number of merging clusters without
radio halos (when observed at frequencies > 600 MHz) should
increase. In agreement with that, in Section 3 we found that the
fraction of merging clusters without radio halos is much higher
(∼ 65%) in low mass clusters with respect to high mass ones
(∼ 20%). At the same time, this model predicts that a fraction
of these mergers will generate radio halos emitting at lower fre-
quencies (e.g. Cassano et al. 2006, 2010a, 2012, see also Fig.
9). Consequently, we expect that a large fraction of the merg-
ing systems in our sample that do not show radio halos in the"
"8 RH = 500 kpc corresponds to RH/R500 ∼ 0.4 for the typical masses
of our cluster sample, which is consistent with the average/typical sizes
of radio halos in our sample (Fig. 3, right)"

Frequency Array (LOFAR, van Haarlem et al. 2013) we will per-
form the statistical analysis of radio halos at low frequencies and
the comparison with the results presented in this paper will give
unprecedented insight on the formation and evolution of radio
emission in clusters."
6. Summary and Conclusions
"We presented the first statistical analysis of radio halos in a mass-
selected sample of 75 galaxy clusters. Clusters were selected
from the Planck SZ catalogue (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014)
with mass M500 ≥ 6 × 1014M� and redshift z = 0.08 − 0.33.
The radio and X-ray data analysis of these clusters are described
in paper I. In the following, we summarise the main steps and
results of the statistical analysis performed in this paper."
"– We combined the radio information on the clusters of our
sample with the dynamical information coming from the X-
ray data analysis (see paper I) in the morphological diagrams
(Fig. 1). We found that more than the 90% of radio halos
are in merging galaxy clusters, whereas less than 10% is in
non merging systems. As expected, not all the merging clus-
ters host a radio halo. Interestingly, the fraction of merging
clusters without radio halos is ∼ 65% in low mass clusters,
whereas it is ∼ 20% in high mass ones (Fig. 2). This is in line
with turbulent re-acceleration models predicting that merg-
ing events in low mass systems may not induce enough tur-
bulence to accelerate particles emitting at ∼GHz frequencies."
"– We confirmed the presence of a correlation between the ra-
dio power of radio halos and the mass of the host clusters
(Fig. 4). However, we showed that the small range of masses
of our sample is a significant limitation if we aim at con-
straining the slope of the correlation (App. A). Therefore,
we considered an ‘extended’ sample, made by the combina-
tion of our statistical sample with a subsample of clusters
from Cassano et al. (2013) and Martinez Aviles et al. (2016).
Depending on the fitting method, the slope of the correlation
ranges between 2.7 to 3.5. This result is consistent with pre-
vious findings (Cassano et al. 2013; Martinez Aviles et al.
2016)."
"– We investigated the possible connection between the scatter
of the correlation and the different dynamical state of clus-
ters. We found a clear trend between the distance from the
P1.4GHz − M500 correlation and the dynamical disturbance of"
"clusters (Fig. 5). This indicates that the large scatter around
the correlation is at least partly due to the complex mix of
merging histories in the diagram. Interestingly, the great ma-
jority of radio halos in less disturbed systems are USSRH
(Fig. 5), suggesting that less energetic merger events may
not be sufficient to produce radio halos emitting at ∼ GHz
frequencies. Additionally, some of these clusters may be in
a late stage of merger where the X-ray morphology appears
relaxed and the radio halo spectrum has steepened."
"– Although the scatter of the correlation is relatively large and
the bimodality is less evident, still limits occupy a different
region of the P1.4GHz − M500 diagram, being below the 95%
confidence region of the correlation (Fig.4 and Fig. 6)."
"– For the first time, we studied the emissivity of radio halos
in a mass-selected sample of clusters. In the emissivity, the
scattering induced in the radio luminosities by the different
emitting volume is reduced. Indeed, we find a clear separa-
tion between radio halos and upper limits with limits lying
more than five times below the bulk on radio halos in the
emissivity-mass diagram."
"– Following Cuciti et al. (2015), we measured the occurrence
of radio halos in two mass bins: M < 8 × 1014M� and M ≥
8× 1014M�. We found that the fraction of clusters with radio
halos is ∼ 70% in high mass clusters and ∼ 35% in low
mass clusters, thus confirming the presence of a drop in the
fraction of radio halos in low mass systems."
"– We used the model developed by Cassano & Brunetti (2005)
to compare the observed and predicted fraction of radio ha-
los as a function of mass (Fig. 9). Although these models
have some limitations that require a careful comparison, we
showed that there is good agreement between the theoretical
expectations and our observations. The combination of the
decline of occurrence and increase of the fraction of merging
clusters without radio halos in lower mass clusters suggests
that a population of USSRH should be discovered among
those systems with low frequency observations."

Appendix A: Test BCES
"The sample of galaxy clusters analysed in this paper is selected from the Planck SZ catalogue imposing a cut in mass at M500 ≥
6 × 1014 M�. As a consequence, our sample contains clusters within a relatively small range of masses (6 ≤ M500 < 16 × 1014 M�,
with only one cluster with M500 > 11 × 1014 M�). In order to test whether and how such a cut influences the correlation parameters
derived with the BCES methods, we performed Montecarlo simulations. We randomly distributed 60, 100 or 1000 points in the X-Y
diagram on a correlation in the form Y= slope × X. We used five values for the slope: 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5. We worked in log space
and we choose values for the X variable similar to the ones that we are dealing with in our cluster sample, but in a larger range (X
is in the range 14 − 15.2, with X = log(M500)). Here the assumption is that the scaling remains a power law also extending to lower
masses. We associated a random error to these points, both in X and Y, both in line with the errors that we have in our mass and
radio power measurements. Then, we distributed the points around the correlation following two approaches:"
"a) we assumed that the scatter in X is only statistical scatter, while the scatter in Y is both statistical and intrinsic.
b) we assumed that the raw scatter (statistic and intrinsic) is orthogonal with respect to the correlation line."
"In both cases, the value of the scatter that we introduced was chosen to be similar to the one that we observe in our sample. We
repeated the random distribution 500 times for each value of the slope and each time we performed the BCES analysis as described
is Section 4.1. We found that all the BCES methods are able to recover the true slope of the correlation with < 10% discrepancies
(the discrepancy decreases as the number of points increases)."
"As a second test, after applying the scattering, we selected only points with X ≥ 14.77, corresponding to the cut in mass of our
sample. An example of the distribution of points in the X-Y diagram after the cut in the X variable is shown in Fig. A.1, top left. In
this case the true slope of the correlation is 4.5 and the scatter follows approach a). The initial distribution is made of 60 clusters,
this allows us to obtain a similar number of points as in our sample, once the cut is applied. The top right panel of Fig. A.1 shows the
distribution of the slopes given by the three different fitting methods for the 500 Montecarlo trials. In Fig. A.1, bottom left, we show
the difference between the recovered and the true slope as a function of the true slope. We repeated this test using an orthogonal
scatter (approach b). Results are shown in Fig. A.1, bottom right panel. Our analysis suggests that a cut in the X variable influences
the results of the fitting using the BCES algorithms. In particular, regardless of how the points are scattered around the correlation,
the orthogonal method always gives steeper slopes with the largest uncertainties. Which fitting method performs better depends on
how the scatter is implemented. Since it is not trivial to know what is the best way to describe the scatter around the correlation, in
this paper we report the values obtained with the Y|X and the bisector methods. Also, we point out that the bisector method allows
us to better compare our results with previous works (e.g. Cassano et al. 2013)."
