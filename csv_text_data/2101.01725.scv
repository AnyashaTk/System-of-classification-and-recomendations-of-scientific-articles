"ABSTRACT
Population III (Pop. III) stars, as of yet, have not been detected, however as we move into
the era of extremely large telescopes this is likely to change. One likely tracer for Pop. III
stars is the HeIIλ1640 emission line, which will be detectable by the HARMONI spectro-
graph on the European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) over a broad range of redshifts
(2 ≤ z ≤ 14). By post-processing galaxies from the cosmological, AMR-hydrodynamical
simulation NEWHORIZON with theoretical spectral energy distributions (SED) for Pop. III
stars and radiative transfer (i.e. the Yggdrasil Models and CLOUDY look-up tables respec-
tively) we are able to compute the flux of HeIIλ1640 for individual galaxies. From mock 10
hour observations of these galaxies we show that HARMONI will be able to detect Pop. III
stars in galaxies up to z ∼ 10 provided Pop. III stars have a top heavy Initial Mass Function
(IMF). Furthermore, we find that should Pop. III stars instead have an IMF similar to those
of the Pop. I stars, the HeIIλ1640 line would only be observable for galaxies with Pop. III
stellar masses in excess of 107 M�, average stellar age < 1Myr at z = 4. Finally, we are able
to determine the minimal intrinsic flux required for HARMONI to detect Pop. III stars in a
galaxy up to z = 10."

1 INTRODUCTION
"The very first stars in the Universe, known as Population III (Pop.
III) stars, are believed to have been extremely massive (〈M?〉 ≥
100 M�, e.g. see Schwarzschild & Spitzer 1953; Larson 1998;
Bromm et al. 1999; Abel et al. 2000, and references within). These
stars would have formed out of the primordial gas created during
Big-Bang nucleosynthesis and as a result would have been chemi-
cally pristine. During the course of their lifetimes these stars would
have reionized the surround gas and, perhaps more importantly, cre-
ated the first batch of elements heavier than lithium in their interi-
ors (Ostriker & Gnedin 1996). Through feedback processes (i.e.
winds and radiations) and eventual supernova phase, Pop. III stars
heat and enrich their environment which has a direct impact on the
further star formation (Omukai 1999; O’Shea et al. 2005). Due to
this enrichment it is unlikely to find Pop. III stars at a low redshift
(z ≤ 3, Johnson 2010). Furthermore, as a result of their (predicted)
mass these stars would have relatively short lifetimes, on the or-
der of 1-10 Myr (Schaerer 2002) and thus are only expected to be"

"found at high redshifts (z � 2). This first generation of stars there-
fore determined the composition of future generations (Population
II and I) and changed how gas throughout the Universe was able to
cool i.e. allow for metal line cooling (Mackey et al. 2003)."
"Due to their importance in determining the evolution of galax-
ies and the intergalactic medium there have been a number of at-
tempts to observe Pop. III stars. However, detections have proven
difficult in part due to the short lifetime of Pop. III stars (assuming
〈M?〉 ≥ 100 M�) which (assuming they were formed at z > 2,
Dijkstra 2007; Nagao et al. 2008; Kashikawa et al. 2012), are not
expected to still be around at z = 0. Furthermore, due to the en-
riched metallicity of interstellar, circumgalactic and intergalactic
mediums (ISM, CGM and IGM), by definition, the local Universe
is no longer able to form new Pop. III stars. Detection of these stars
therefore requires telescopes that are able to probe sufficiently high
redshifts that Pop. III stars are either still forming and form a large
fraction of the total star formation in the galaxy at that epoch."
"When doubly ionised helium recombines and undergoes the
n = 3 → 2 transition it produces a bright emission line at 1640 Å
(HeIIλ1640). As a result of their (theoretical) high mass, Pop. III
stars are predicted to produce a large number of photons with suf-"

"ficient energy (≥ 54.4 eV) to fully ionise helium in the surround-
ing ISM and thus HeIIλ1640 could be a strong indicator, if not
direct tracer, for such stars (Jimenez & Haiman 2006). Unfortu-
nately, other objects such as Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars and Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN) also produce the HeIIλ1640 emission line
(see Francis et al. 1991; Leitherer et al. 1995; Schaerer & Vacca
1998; Cox 2000, and references within). With the aid of additional
diagnostics it should be possible to distinguish between these dif-
ferent sources. For example, the spectra of both AGN and WR stars
would normally contain emission from C III and C IV (Leitherer
et al. 1996; Reuland et al. 2007; Allen et al. 2008). Additionally,
HeIIλ1640 produced by Pop. III stars is expected to be relatively
narrow (< 700 km s−1) while lines from WR are expected to be
significantly broader (> 800 km s−1, Leitherer et al. 1995; Cassata
et al. 2013). A key diagnostic is the ratio of helium to hydrogen ion-
ising photons, which depends on the hardness of the UV radiation
field, and is directly connected to the stellar temperature, and there-
fore, mass. As the HeIIλ1640 line is unable to ionise hydrogen, it
is not heavily absorbed by the ISM (Woods & Gilfanov 2013) and
therefore HeII emissions from high redshift galaxies should be de-
tectable."
"One possible detection of a galaxy containing Pop. III stars
was made by Sobral et al. (2015) when looking for bright Lyman-α
(Lyα) galaxies. The object they identified, designated “CR7”, had
a strong–narrow HeIIλ1640 emission line. Furthermore they ruled
out the possibility of WR stars or AGN and concluded that CR7
is “the strongest candidate for a Pop. III-like stellar population”.
With the help of additional observations, Bowler et al. (2017) found
that CR7 is contaminated by the [OIII] λλ4959, 5007 doublet. They
therefore argued that the detected HeIIλ1640 signal in CR7 is more
likely to be from either a low-mass, narrow-line AGN or a young
low-mass starburst (if binaries are included in the model)."
"Despite the current difficulties faced by observations, new fa-
cilities such as the European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT),
with its 39 m diameter primary mirror, present a new opportuni-
ties for the detection of Pop. III stars. The High Angular Reso-
lution Monolithic Optical and Near-infrared Integral field spectro-
graph (HARMONI), currently being built, will serve as the work-
horse spectroscopic instrument on ELT and will provide spectra
from 0.47 to 2.45µm (Thatte et al. 2014). This large wavelength
range allows for the possibility that the HeIIλ1640 line will be de-
tectable for 2 . z . 14. Furthermore the high spatial resolution of
HARMONI may also provide details about the spatial distribution
of Pop. III stars inside their host galaxies. When combined with
the large (39 m) primary mirror of the ELT, HARMONI is ideally
suited to detect Pop. III stars"
"In this work we explore the possibility of detecting Pop. III
stars with HARMONI. To achieve this we combine the numerical
cosmological simulation: NEWHORIZON with the spectral synthe-
sis code CLOUDY to generate mock spectra of galaxies, containing
Pop. III stars for 3 . z . 10, which are “observed” using the
HARMONI simulator HSIM. In addition we explore how the mass
function of Pop. III stars will impact observations. The paper is
organised as follows. In Section 2 we outline the process of gen-
erating mock observations. We present our results in Section 3 and
discuss their implications in Section 4. Section 5 summarises this
work and its conclusions."
2 METHOD
2.1 NEWHORIZON
2.1.1 Simulation Overview
"Our source for mock “observable” galaxies is the NEWHORIZON
simulation, a high spatial resolution (∆x ∼ 35 pc1), hydrodynam-
ical, cosmological simulation run using the hydro+N -body, Adap-
tive Mesh Refinement (AMR) code RAMSES (Teyssier 2002). Here
we give a brief overview of the simulation but direct the reader to
Dubois et al. (2020) for complete details (see also Park et al. 2019).
NEWHORIZON is a re-simulation of a field environment spherical
region with a radius of 10 Mpc comoving which has been extracted
from the Horizon-AGN simulation (Dubois et al. 2014b; Kaviraj
et al. 2017)."
"NEWHORIZON started at a redshift of z = 45 and has cur-
rently reached z ∼ 0.7 after 40 million CPU hours. To counter
cosmological expansion, new levels of refinement are unlocked as
the simulation progresses to keep the maximum resolution as close
to 35 pc as possible. We give the actual resolution (∆xz) for each
snapshot that we analyse in Table 1. The simulation assumes cos-
mological parameters consistent with the WMAP-7 data (Komatsu
et al. 2011), i.e. Hubble constant H0 = 70.4 km s−1 Mpc−1, to-
tal mass density Ωm = 0.272, total baryon density Ωb = 0.0455,
dark energy density ΩΛ = 0.728, amplitude of power spectrum
σ8 = 0.809, and power spectral index ns = 0.967. Dark mat-
ter is modelled as collisionless particles, with a mass resolution of
106 M�. The simulation includes several important physical pro-
cesses such as star formation, stellar feedback from star particles,
AGN feedback from “black hole” sink particles, however it does
not include explicit radiative transfer. Gas is able to cool to 1 K
via a metal dependent collisional equilibrium model of radiative
cooling (Sutherland & Dopita 1993; Rosen & Bregman 1995) in
the presence of a uniform ultraviolet radiation field after the epoch
of reionisation (i.e. z = 10, Haardt & Madau 1996). At high
redshift, due to the lack of metals, cooling is primarily achieved
via molecular hydrogen, however the simulation does not model
molecular gas and consequently, this method of cooling has to be
approximated. This is achieved by assuming an initial metallicity
of Zinit = 10−3Z� (e.g. Wise et al. 2012)and using metal line
cooling at all times."
"Star formation occurs on a cell by cell basis when their gas
number density ≥ 10 cm−3 and temperature < 2 × 104 K. Stars
particles form according to a Schmidt law (Schmidt 1959) with the
star formation efficiency per free-fall time determined by the local
thermo-turbulent conditions of the ISM (Kimm et al. 2017). Each
star particle an initial (or birth) mass of M? ≥ 104 M� and is
assumed to represent a population of stars which follows a Chabrier
Initial Mass Function (IMF, Chabrier 2005) with lower and upper
mass cutoffs of 0.1 M� and 150 M� respectively. These particles
in turn feed back gas (31% of M? with appropriate momentum,
see Kimm & Cen 2014) into the ISM via supernovae explosions
occurring 5 Myr after their formation."
Cells where both gas and stellar densities are > 10 cm−3
"can form black holes (sink particles), with an initial seed mass
of 104 M�. These particles can then grow through Bondi–Hoyle–
Lyttleton accretion (Bondi & Hoyle 1944; Hoyle & Lyttleton 1939)
capped at the Eddington limit. Two models are employed to add
feedback from AGN: radio and quasar mode. The choice of model"
1 This is the linear size of the smallest cell.
"MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)"
Pop. III Stars and HARMONI 3
"is set by ratio of the gas accretion rate to the Eddington limit (see
Dubois et al. 2012, to which we refer the reader for details), and in
the jet mode case, the feedback efficiency depends on the spin of
the black hole (Dubois et al. 2014a)."
2.1.2 Selection of Galaxies
"The NEWHORIZON galaxy catalogue contains hundreds of galax-
ies at any given redshift (see Dubois et al. 2020). In order to identify
ideal candidates for observations we reduce the sample of galaxies
by only considering those for which M?,PopIII,tot/M?,tot ≥ 0.5.
Here M?,PopIII,tot and M?,tot are the total mass in Pop. III stars
and the total stellar mass of the galaxy respectively. Furthermore
we require that the stellar half-mass radius for the Pop. III stars
(R0.5,P3) be less than one kiloparsec for a galaxy to be considered.
We determine whether or not a star particle is Pop. III by its metal-
licity. If a particle has Zinit < Z < Zcrit we consider it to be a
Pop. III particle, where Zcrit = 0.02Z�2(= 4 × 10−4) adopted
from Zackrisson et al. (2011) (see also Bromm et al. 2001)."
"The above criteria reduces the number of possible galaxies at
any redshift to < 10. We make the final selection of fiducial galax-
ies by selecting the galaxy at each redshift with the smallest mean
age of Pop. III star particles. We present the properties of these se-
lected galaxies in Table 1. We present two values for the Star For-
mation Rate (SFR): Lifetime 〈SFR〉 and Final SFR. The former
is the mean stellar mass formed per year since the galaxy started
forming stars (i.e. the galaxy’s total stellar mass divided by the age
of its oldest star) while the later provides the average over the last
10 Myr of simulation run time (i.e. the stellar mass formed in the
galaxy over the last 10 Myr divided by 10 Myr). As stated in §1
the majority of the HeIIλ1640 emission line is expected to be pro-
duced by massive stars which will have lifetimes on the order of
1-10 Myr. We therefore adopt the upper age limit, i.e. 10 Myr, as
our time frame for calculating the Final SFR. It is therefore ex-
pected that galaxies with a larger Final SFR will be brighter in
HeIIλ1640. A comparison of the two SFR values can provide in-
sight into the current state of star formation in each galaxy, e.g. if
the Lifetime 〈SFR〉 is greater that the Final SFR it suggests the
galaxy is in a quiescent star formation phase."
"All of the selected galaxies have 100% of their stellar mass in
Pop. III stars. By calculating the mean (mass weighted) metallicity
of the stars (〈Z?〉) in each galaxy, we find that the stars in our
sample tend to have a metallicity of . 0.27Zcrit and with a small
standard deviation around the mean (see Table 1). Finally we note
that all stars in both G3 and G7 have Z? = Zinit."
2.2 Modelling Stellar SEDs
"As NEWHORIZON does not include explicit radiative transport, it
is therefore necessary to post process the simulation to determine
the spectrum of a given galaxy. This approach prevents us from
drawing conclusions about how Pop. III stars will shape their en-
vironment and effect galaxy evolution. However, post processing
does present an advantage: the choice of model used for Pop. III
stars can easily be changed without rerunning the simulation."
"The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of a population of
stars depends on its IMF. The shape of the IMF at high z is not yet
constrained (Karlsson et al. 2013) and is therefore a free parame-
ter to be explored. In this work we employ three IMFs for Pop. III"

shape which is described by a characteristic mass ofMc = 10 M�,
a dispersion of σ = 1 M� and wings extending from 1 to 500 M�
(see Tumlinson 2006; Raiter et al. 2010, for details). The final IMF
(PopIII.K) uses the universal Kroupa (Kroupa 2001) IMF, i.e."

M−1.3 if 0.08 ≤M < 0.5 M�,
M−2.3 if 0.5 ≤M ≤ 100 M�,
0."
"All three IMFs are shown in Fig. 1, normalised for a 105 M� stel-
lar population. We use the YGGDRASIL spectral synthesis code (see
Zackrisson et al. 2011, for details) with the above IMFs to generate
SEDs. The resulting SEDs, at four different stellar ages, are shown
in Fig. 2. All three models assume that the stellar population creat-
ing the SED has zero metallicity."
"As the stellar population ages the SED evolves and the num-
ber of photons produced per second with sufficient energy to ionise
H, He, and He+ (E ≥ 13.6, 24.6 and 54.5 eV respectively) de-
creases, shown in Fig. 3. All three of these models produces a
large number of photons with energies > 54.5 eV at most ages.
The exception being the PopIII.1 SED, which due to the extremely
top-heavy nature of the IMF produces stars with short lifetimes
(< 107 yr). Despite this we use PopIII.1 as our fiducial model
for Pop. III stars as it is the model most likely to be observable.
NEWHORIZON does not form individual stars but instead forms
star particles which represent a cluster of gravitationally bound
stars. We therefore assume that each star particle with Z ≤ Zcrit
represents a stellar cluster containing only Pop. III stars and we
discuss the validity of this assumption in §4.3."
"As stated above, our selection criteria leads to all eight of our
selected galaxies containing only Pop. III stars. However in princi-
ple it is possible that we could have selected galaxies that contain
non-Pop. III stars. In such a case additional CLOUDY simulations
would be needed, which account of each particle’s metallicity and"

"a non-Pop. II IMF. Fig. 2 and 3 (labelled as PopII.K) show an ex-
ample of a SED and number of ionising photons produced by a
stellar population following a Kroupa IMF with a metallicity of
Z? = 0.02(= Z�)."
"The IMF used by the simulation at run time sets the amount of
momentum, gas and metals injected into the surrounding ISM via
feedback and thus determines galactic evolution. As stated above,
NEWHORIZON employs a Chabrier IMF and as a result of this work
imposing a different IMFs in post-processing the self-consistency
of the simulation is lost. We can not, therefore, use this simulation
to explore how Pop. III stars following the PopIII.1, PopIII.2 or
PopIII.K IMFs impact a galaxy’s structure, dynamics or evolu-
tion. However, as their is no radiative transfer in NEWHORIZON
and adding photons to the simulation in post processing does not
change the gas dynamics we are still able to make predictions about
the observability of Pop. III stars."
2.3 Constructing Spectra
"For each galaxy we extract a cube, with sides of 4 kpc, centred
on the galaxy, this volume is divided into a uniform grid of cells
with sides of ∆xz (see Table 1 for values at a given z). Each cell
has its own unique gas properties (e.g. density, temperature and
velocity) and associated star particles. To create an “observable”
Spatial-Spectrum Data Cube (SSDC) of a galaxy we construct a
spectrum for each cell (and hence star particles). Below we outline
the method of its construction."
2.3.1 CLOUDY Models
"The HeIIλ1640 emission line is not produced directly by Pop. III
stars but instead is the result of their radiation being reprocessed
by the surrounding gas. To model these processes we employ the
microphysics code CLOUDY (see Ferland et al. 2017, for full de-
tails on CLOUDY). We assume that each star particle is at the cen-
tre of a spherical gaseous cloud (of constant density) with a ra-
dius ∆xz/2. CLOUDY is used to calculate the strength of emis-
sions lines and the continuum at the outer edge of the cloud, i.e. out
to a radius of ∆xz/2. In addition to the radiation field from stars
we include a background radiation field. This field is designed to
mimic the observed cosmic radio to X-ray background with con-
tributions from the CMB, assumed to be a black body with a tem-
perature of TCMB = 2.725(1 + z)K. To explore all possible en-
vironments surrounding star particles we run a grid of CLOUDY
models, at each redshift, z, varying: gas number density (n), stellar
age (t?,age) and total luminosity of SED (Ltot). A full sweep of
parameter space is completed for all three sets of SEDs (PopIII.1,
PopIII.2 and PopIII.K) so that the impact of different IMFs can be
explored."
"All CLOUDY models with Pop. III IMFs use the primordial
element abundances i.e. 76% of the gas (by mass) is hydrogen, with
the remainder made up of Helium. As a result we set CLOUDY to
only record line intensities for H and He lines in the wavelength
range of interest (1000 ≤ λ ≤ 6600 Å), i.e. we assume that all Pop.
III stars form from pristine gas and do not pollute their environment
until they die."
"There are a number of cells both in and surrounding our se-
lected galaxies that contain no star particles. For these cells we run
additional CLOUDY models using the background radiation field
but without a radiation field from the stars. As a result the only pa-
rameters varied in these CLOUDY simulations at a given z is n, as
we let CLOUDY determine the equilibrium temperature."

each particle which are then summed to create a single spectrum for
that cell. We create the spectrum for each star particle as follows.
First, we select the SED which matches both the star particle’s age

PopIII.1, PopIII.2, PopIII.K and PopII.K SEDs. A stellar population
with a total mass of 105 M� was assumed when calculating Q. NB: The
y-axis of each panel is scaled to best show the difference between all fours
IMFs. As a result of this choice, it appears that QH for PopIII.1 is parallel
to PopIII.2 and PopIII.K or thatQH/QHe orQH/QHe+ is the same for
each choice of IMF, however this is not the case. For example the latter ratio
can vary by factor as large as ∼ 3.5 when comparing the different IMFs."
"assumes the birth mass, MSED, of the stellar population which is
combined with IMF to determine the shape and magnitude of the
SED (i.e. the number of photons at each wavelength). Each star par-
ticles in NEWHORIZON has a birth mass, M?,birth, which is rarely
equal to MSED. It is therefore necessary to scale the magnitude of
the SED from YGGDRASIL so that the correct value of Ltot can be
passed to CLOUDY. This is calculated using"
"Ltot =
M?,birth
MSED"
"∫
Lλdλ, (3)"
"where Lλ is luminosity of the SED at each wavelength (λ).
M?,birth therefore scales the magnitude of the SED while the
choice of IMF and t?,age determine its shape for each particle."
"YGGDRASIL only provides SEDs until the time at which the
first supernova is expected for each SED (e.g. tSN = 106.5, 107.5"
"and 108 Myr for PopIII.1, PopIII.2 and PopIII.K respectively)
therefore if t?,age > tSN the star particle is marked as “dead”
and does not contribute to the spectrum of its host cell. In prin-
ciple “dead” particles will still contribute to luminosity of their"
"host galaxy, either as cooling supernova remnants or as low mass
(∼ 1 M�) Main Sequence stars in the case of PopIII.K. As this
will not effect the HeIIλ1640 line, on which this work is focused,
we have chosen not to include this contribution."
"With t?,age and Ltot of the particle as well as the n of its
host cell and the determination of Pop. II or Pop. III the particle is
matched to an appropriate CLOUDY model. We take each line’s in-
tensity (I0) from CLOUDY and assume that each line is a Gaussian,
given by"
"I(λ) = Inorme
− (λ−λ0)"
"2σ2 , (4)"
"where λ0 is the rest wavelength of the line, σ sets the width of
the function and Inorm is a normalisation constant to ensure that∫
I(λ)dλ = I0. We assume that the Full Width Half Maximum"
"(FWHM) of the Gaussian is set by the thermal motions of the gas,
i.e.: FWHM = 2"
"√
2 ln 2∆vg,therm where"
"∆vg,therm = λ0"
"√

"= σ, (5)"
"here Tg is the gas temperature in the cell, ma is the mass of the
element (hydrogen or helium) emitting the line, c is the speed of
light and kB is the Boltzmann constant (Blundell & Blundell 2006)."
"Once the shape and intensity of each emission line is known, it
is added to the continuum emission (also given by CLOUDY) to cre-
ate the entire spectrum for the particle. Finally the spectra from all
star particles in a given cell are summed to give the total spectrum
for that cell."
2.3.3 Constructing Spectra for Cells Without Stars
"Cells that have been identified as not containing a star particle are
matched to an appropriate CLOUDY model (i.e. those only employ-
ing a background radiation field, see §2.3.1) using just n. As with
cells containing star particles, the spectrum of a cell without stars
is constructed using line and continuum intensities from CLOUDY."
2.3.4 Constructing Data Cubes
"Next we modify the spectrum for each cell based on the turbulent
motions of the gas within. This is achieved by convolving the spec-
trum of a cell with a Gaussian whose width is given by the 3D ve-
locity dispersion of the gas (σg,vel) i.e. the turbulent motions. We
define σg,vel as"
"√
(σ2g,x + σ"
"2
g,y + σ"
"2
g,z)/3, where σg,x, σg,y and"
"σg,z are the velocity dispersions of the three velocity components
of a cell."
"Next wavelength-dependant extinction, due to dust, along the
line of sight is added to each cell’s spectrum. We achieve this by
first calculating AV using"
"AV = 1.086
3fdΣZQλ
4ρd
√
a1a2"
"where Qλ = 1.5 is a constant extinction coefficient, ρd =
4 g cm−3 is the typical density of a dust particle, fd = 0.1 is
the fraction of gas-phase metals locked up in dust, ΣZ is the col-
umn density of metals, a1 = 0.005µm is the smallest size of a
dust grain and a2 = 1µm is the largest size of a dust grain (see
Richardson et al. 2020, for full details of the method and discus-
sion on choice of values). As ΣZ depends on the mass of metals
along the line of sight between a given cell and the observer, a
unique value is calculated and used for each cell. We combine AV
with the dust extinction curve (E(λ)) found by Fitzpatrick (1999),"
"MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)"
Pop. III Stars and HARMONI 7
"assuming E(λ) = Aλ/AV , here Aλ is the wavelength specific ex-
tinction. Thus intensities of each cell spectrum is given by"
"IE(λ) = I(λ)10
AV E(λ)"
"−2.5 , (7)"
"here I(λ) is the spectrum of a cell before extinction is applied and
IE(λ) is the spectrum after extinction is applied. We do not include
the extinction due to the gas within the cell we are currently consid-
ering as this is applied by CLOUDY. As a result of the dependance
on metallicity and that our choice galaxies have very low metallic-
ity (see Table 1), both fd and ΣZ ∼ 0 for most cells and thus the
impact of extinction is negligible, however it is included for com-
pleteness. The above is a simple model of extinction and does not
account for every process that is able to reduce the strength of an
emission line. In order to fully capture every possible process a new
series of simulations with full radiative transfer would be required
where the path of each photon is taken into account (e.g. Laursen
& Sommer-Larsen 2007) which is beyond the scope of the work
presented here."
"Before the spectra along the line of sight are combined we
Doppler shift the spectrum based on the gas line of sight velocity
(vg,los) using"
"λo = λe(
vg,los
c"
"+ 1), (8)"
"where λo is the observed wavelength and λe is the emitted wave-
length. This shift in wavelength should not be confused with the
shift cause by placing each galaxy at the appropriate redshift, i.e.
at this stage we treat the galaxy, its stellar and gaseous contents as
if it is at z = 0. We then sum the intensities at each wavelength
along the line of sight to create an SSDC of the simulated galaxy.
Finally, we place the galaxy at the appropriate redshift by shifting
the wavelength range (e.g. for G1 1640 Å → 18040 Å) and con-
vert the luminosity of each spaxel into flux by accounting for the
luminosity distance (i.e. dividing by 4πD2L)."
2.4 Observing the Simulations: HSIM
"We employ the HARMONI simulator HSIM (version 2.10) to pro-
duce mock ELT observations of each SSDC. HSIM is a cube-in,
cube-out simulator for HARMONI that replicates all known in-
strumental effects, including the strongly wavelength-dependent
adaptive optics (AO) point spread function (PSF) (Zieleniewski
et al. 2015). It also includes thermal background from telescope
and instrument, as well as night-sky emission lines and continuum
(include lunar contributions), and telluric absorption. Instrumen-
tal transmission, detector read noise, detector cross-talk, shot noise
from all background sources is also modelled. HSIM also incorpo-
rates the instrumental wavelength response (line spread function,
or LSF), and the impact of spatial sampling for the chosen spaxel
scale. The resulting data cube in FITS format is in units of
electrons s−1. An associated variance cube is also produced. These
can be used to analyse mock observations as if observed with HAR-
MONI at the ELT. HSIM v2 is a completely re-coded version that
adopts a follow-the-photons philosophy for the simulations, adding
noise and background flux, and applying throughput losses in the
same order as they occur along the sky, telescope and instrument
light path (Pereira-Santaella & Thatte Prep)."
"For our analysis we employ the HSIM settings outlined in Ta-
ble 2 (unless otherwise stated). These settings are chosen to pro-
vide the most sensitive observation, therefore the results presented
in this work should be considered the best case. As the choice of
grating is determined by the redshift of the observed object we give"

3 RESULTS
3.1 NEWHORIZON Galaxies at 1640 Å
"Due to our selection criteria, the galaxies in our sample all consist
of a central high density region (Σgas & 103 M� pc−2), which
has radius on the order of 100 parsecs. Additionally most galaxies
also show some larger scale extended, but lower density structures
(Σgas ∼ 102 M� pc−2), surrounding the central region (see the
left column of Fig. 4). The stellar structure of the galaxies varies
more than the gas structure (as shown by the contours in the left
column of Fig. 4). That being said we do find a trend that as z
decreases the stellar structures tends to become more extended."

3.1.1 Flux Maps
"Running each galaxy through our SSDC generation pipeline (us-
ing the PopIII.1 IMF) we find that all eight galaxies produce a
HeIIλ1640 emission line from which we are able to calculate the
integrated HeIIλ1640 luminosity (L1640λ) which are given in the
second column of Table 3 and the middle column of Fig. 4 respec-
tively. The line strength is always greatest in regions of high gas and
stellar density. Furthermore, (reassuringly) the HeIIλ1640 emission"
"is only found in pixels containing stars and not being produced by
the locations with only gas. In §2.1.2 we stated the expectation that
galaxies with larger Final SFR will also have larger L1640λ, which
in general we find to be the case by comparing columns 6 and 2
of Tables 1 and 3 respectively. As a result of our selection criteria
all of our galaxies are spatially very compact, especially in terms
of their stellar structure. This results in the emission from these
galaxies being found in only a handful of pixels. We have run our
pipeline on more extended low redshift spiral galaxies and found"

"that we are able to recover the full extent of these galaxies and their
structure in flux maps."
"After being “observed” with HSIM (right column of Fig. 4)
we find that the HeIIλ1640 line is detectable in seven of the eight
galaxies: G1, G2, G3, G5, G6, G7 and G8. We are unable to detect
any signal from G4 after observations with HSIM, however given
that galaxies at larger z are detectable we conclude that the lack of
signal from this galaxy is due to its stellar mass and age combined
with gas mass and morphology (see Table 1). These maps also show"
"that, for the more extended galaxies, their morphology cannot be
recovered."
"It is worth noting that at z = 3 the HeIIλ1640 emission line
is redshifted to the observed V band, a wavelength regime where
the Laser Tomography Adaptive Optics (LTAO) correction is very
poor, with Strehl ratios typically below 1%. While the PSF still has
a small diffraction limited core, the fraction of the incident energy
in the diffraction limited core is very small, with most of the light
spread over a region of size ∼ 200 mas. Thus, only the strongest"
"MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)"
Pop. III Stars and HARMONI 11
"compact emission features from the galaxy are detected, resulting
in the emission line only being seen in a single spaxel."
3.1.2 Single Aperture Spectra
"To each map we apply a circular mask centred on the galaxy (the
mask is shown as a white circle in the right column of Fig. 4). By
summing the spectrum of each spaxel within the mask we produce a
single-aperture spectrum for each galaxy, (Fig. 5, black lines). Each
galaxy uses a different size mask, where the size is set to maximise
the signal to noise in resulting spectrum. In addition to the aperture
we also calculate the variance for each spaxel at each wavelength
and mask the signal from those with high variances (∼ 15× that
of the minimum calculated for each observation), typically those
wavelengths affected by strong sky emission lines or strong telluric
absorption features."
"For each spectrum we fit a Gaussian (magenta line in Fig. 5)
to the strongest emission feature (i.e. the HeIIλ1640 emission line)
and calculate its Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) and the ra-
tio of the emission line peak to continuum (Npeak/Ncont.). To en-
sure that the emission line recovered is in fact the HeIIλ1640 line,
we mark its pre-HSIM position in each panel (black dashed line).
We present the recovered values for each galaxy in their respective
panel in Fig. 5, which shows that the HeIIλ1640 line is detectable
in seven of eight galaxies. As before, we find that the signal from
Pop. III stars in G4 is lost in the noise and thus would not be de-
tected by HARMONI."
"Each panel of Fig. 5 shows the transmission curve (i.e. the
fraction of light that reaches the detectors after traveling through
the Earth’s atmosphere, the ELT and HARMONI) used by HSIM.
From these curves we see that detection of HeIIλ1640 at certain
redshifts will be more susceptible to noise and instrument effects
than others. For example only ∼ 5% of the HeIIλ1640 light emit-
ted by galaxies at z = 4, such as G7, will reach the detectors. To
determine if the transmission curve is preventing a detection of G4,
we artificially change the wavelength of the galaxy’s spectrum to
that of a galaxy at z = 7.53 and re-observe it with HSIM in the
H+K band. Unfortunately, the HeIIλ1640 line from G4 is still un-
detectable and we therefore conclude that the intrinsic brightness
of G4 is simply not sufficient for Pop. III stars to be detected."
3.2 Impact of Luminosity Distance
"In this work our “observed” galaxies have luminosity distances
(DL) between ∼ 20 and ∼ 110 Gpc and while it is obvious that
the luminosity of an object decreases asDL increases, it is not clear
how DL will impact the observability of a given object. By artifi-
cially placing one of our galaxies (G1) at different redshifts we are
able to determine the role ofDL4 in measuring the line strength. As
expected, moving G1 from z = 10 to z = 3 results in an (∼ 3×)
increase of the line flux (F ) of the galaxy before observation while
the ratio of the emission line peak to continuum (α) remains con-
stant (see Fig. 6)."
"When observing G1 with HSIM after moving it to smaller z we
do not recover the systematic increase in F found before observa-
tions (see Fig. 6); instead F tends to decrease with z. Furthermore,
α is no longer constant, instead it varies with z. This is the result of"
"3 To ensure that we are only testing the transmission curve we keep G4 at
a luminosity distance equal to that of z = 7 galaxy.
4 Changing DL also results in changes to the angular size of the galaxy."

calculated from the HSIM data cube without noise. The values have been
normalised to the value of Fz=10, i.e. the value at G1’s original redshift."
"a combination of different factors: the post-HSIM line flux appears
to decrease because the AO PSF has a substantially smaller fraction
of the total energy enclosed in the PSF core as we move to shorter
wavelengths (lower z). Thus, although the total line flux increases,
the fraction of the flux within the extraction aperture drops even
more markedly, resulting in a net decrease of line flux. In addition,
variations in spectrograph throughput as a function of wavelength
(mostly stemming from the grating’s efficiency curve) also play a
role. One can understand the variation of line to continuum ratio
by considering the AO PSF as having two components: one has the
size of the diffraction core of the ELT , and the other is several hun-
dred milli-arcseconds in size, close to the seeing disc. Depending
on the structure of the galaxy’s line and continuum emission, differ-
ent fractions of each couple into the extraction aperture at different
wavelengths, as the ratio of the two components of the PSF change
dramatically, by more than an order of magnitude (for full details
we refer the reader to Zieleniewski et al. 2015; Pereira-Santaella &
Thatte Prep)."
"In short HARMONI (and thus the ELT) has a wavelength de-
pendant instrumental response which produces a non-trivial depen-
dance on z to the sensitivity of line fluxes. A full analysis of these
different processes impacting observations is beyond the scope of
the current work and we leave it for future studies. However, assum-
ing that HSIM provides a reasonable representation of HARMONI,
we conclude that the redshift of an object is not the determining
factor in how bright that object will appear in observations."

extremely top-heavy IMF for Pop. III stars when applying our
pipeline. However, as discussed in §1 the IMF of Pop. III stars is not
yet constrained, and as discussed in §2.2, will determine whether
Pop. III stars are detectable. In the following sections we explore
how two additional IMFs (PopIII.2 and PopIII.K, see §2.2 and
Fig. 2) impact the detection of our sample of simulated galaxies.
We note that for the PopIII.2 and PopIII.K IMFs we find a gen-
eral trend for L1640λ to increase with Final SFR is found."
"When changing from PopIII.1 IMF to either the PopIII.2 or
PopIII.K IMF only the SED of every star particle is changed. All
other properties of the gas and star particles of our sample of galax-
ies remain constant. Therefore any change in line strength must be
a result of changing the IMF."
3.3.1 PopIII.2 IMF
"When employing the PopIII.2 IMF all eight galaxies produce an
intrinsic HeIIλ1640 emission line before observations, (values of
L1640λ are given in column 3 of Table 3). However these lines are
significantly weaker, for example G2, when assuming the PopIII.1
IMF has L1640λ ∼ 1.7 × 1042 erg s−1 but this falls to ∼ 3.6 ×
1041 erg s−1 when using PopIII.2. In the cases of G6 and G3 this
decrease in the intrinsic luminosity results in the galaxies no longer
being detectable when observed with HARMONI (via HSIM)."
"Unlike the other six galaxies, G3 and G4 increase their intrin-
sic luminosity (i.e. L1640λ) when using the PopIII.2 IMF. This is
a result of the “dead” star particle criteria when constructing the
SSDC (see §2.3.2). For example, ∼ 37% of G4’s stellar popula-
tion have t?,age > tSN when using PopIII.1, however this falls
to ∼ 31% when using PopIII.2. These additional stars, though
old are thus able to contribute additional ionising photons which
increase the luminosity of the emission line."
"Despite the PopIII.2 IMF reducing their intrinsic luminos-
ity, galaxies G1, G2, G5 and G7 still produce a sufficient number
of photons in the HeIIλ1640 emission line that after observation
with HSIM the line is detected (see Fig. 7). In these four galax-
ies the post-observation line strength has (as expected) also de-
creased and in all but one case we find so too has Npeak/Ncont..
In the case of G5, while the overall line strength has decreased,
Npeak/Ncont. has increased (see text on Fig. 5 and 7). To explain
this increase we looked at both the noiseless output from HSIM
and the pre-observation spectra of G5 for both IMFs and find that
when switching from PopIII.1 to PopIII.2 there is a decrease in
the continuum strength. In the case of the former IMF the pre-
observation continuum has magnitude of a few times that of the
noise modelled by HSIM, while in the latter case the continuum
has a magnitude approximately equal to the added noise which
results in a much weaker post-observation continuum and hence
larger Npeak/Ncont.."
3.3.2 PopIII.K IMF
"Finally we consider the PopIII.K IMF (see Eq. 2 and Fig. 1). As
before when switching from the PopIII.1 to PopIII.2, we find
a reduction in the pre-observation line strength of all our galax-
ies when switching from PopIII.2 to PopIII.K, due to the lack
of massive (> 100 M�) stars, for example, G2 when using this
IMF has L1640λ ∼ 4.1 × 1040 erg s−1. The strength of emission
lines in most galaxies is too weak to be detected after observations"
"with HSIM with only G7 still producing a detectable line, shown
in Fig. 8. Given that G7 is the brightest galaxy in our sample by
more than an order of magnitude, independently of the choice of
IMF and that when using the PopIII.K IMF it has a L1640 which
is ∼ 3 times brighter than G1 with the PopIII.2 IMF (see Table 3)
it is no surprise that this galaxy would be detectable with any of the
three IMFs. However G7 appears to be a special case, as it not only
has the largest stellar mass, average SFR and final SFR but it also
appears to be the most chemically pristine galaxy (despite being at
z ∼ 4) of our sample. We therefore conclude that if Pop. III stars do
follow the same IMF as Pop. II and Pop. I stars (i.e. a Kroupa-like
IMF) it is highly unlikely that we will be able to observe and detect
them via this emission line, unless galaxies with a stellar mass of a
few 107 M� and Z . 0.001Z� are common at z = 4."
"It is worth noting that changing the observational setup, e.g.
a longer exposure time or switching to the 20 mas pixels, does al-
low for the detection of the HeIIλ1640 emission line from other
galaxies in our sample such as G6."
3.4 Distinguishing Different IMFs
3.4.1 Using Hα to Determine the IMF
"We now turn to the question of determining which of these IMFs
is found in the Universe. One possible method for distinguishing
between these three IMFs is comparing the relative strength of
HeIIλ1640 and Hα (λ ∼ 6563 Å) emission lines. Unfortunately at
the redshifts of interest for detecting Pop. III stars the Hα line does
not fall within the wavelength range of HARMONI. As a result any
comparison between Hα and HeIIλ1640 would require a coordi-
nated approach using multiple observing facilities, e.g. observing
the same object with both HARMONI on the ELT combined with
observations with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)."
"HSIM is designed to mimic HARMONI and does not allow
for mock-observations of emission lines outside of HARMONI’s
wavelength range. We do not therefore produce mock-observations
of Hα, instead our discussion here focuses on the pre-observation
SSDCs centred on HeIIλ1640 and Hα.5. We take the SSDCs for all
eight galaxies with each IMF, calculate single aperture, continuum
subtracted, HeIIλ1640 and Hα spectra. By integrating over these
the total luminosity of the HeIIλ1640 (LHeII) and Hα emission
lines for each galaxy (with each IMF) is found. Fig. 9 shows how
log (LHeII/LHα) varies for each galaxy as we change the IMF."
"In general log (LHeII/LHα) decreases as we move
from PopIII.1 to PopIII.K. We note that the change in
log (LHeII/LHα) when moving from one IMF to another is not
identical for each galaxy, i.e. G2 has the largest value when using
the PopIII.1 IMF while G8 has its largest values when using the
PopIII.2 IMF. To get an estimate of how this ratio varies with
IMF, the mean value and the standard deviation are also plotted,
again finding a trend of a decreasing value as the IMF moves
from PopIII.1 to PopIII.K, i.e. we calculate the means and
standard deviations to be −0.917 ± 0.412, −1.251 ± 0.348 and
−1.556 ± 0.377. The mean value for a given IMF falls within the
error bars of either of the other two, which is most likely the result
of our limited data set (i.e. only 8 galaxies). It is possible as we
expand the catalogue of mock observations that it will be easier to
statistically separate the different IMFs using this ratio."

3.4.2 Using Lyα to Determine the IMF
"Lyα (λ = 1215.67 Å) is often the brightest emission line from
high-z galaxies, and it is likely that most targets observed with
HARMONI will have been discovered through observations of
their Lyα emission, with follow up observations in HeIIλ1640
(Cooke et al. 2009). As HARMONI can observe the Lyα line for
most Pop. III targets, it is interesting to simulate whether the flux of
the Lyα emission can provide additional information to constrain
the Pop III IMF, for example can the ratio of HeIIλ1640 to Lyα be
used as an additional method for differentiating the IMF of Pop. III
stars. One of the key advantages of Lyα over Hα is that the former
falls within HARMONI’s wavelength range. This means for galax-
ies at some redshifts (e.g. 3, 6 and 7) observations of both lines
can be carried out simultaneously as both lines fall within the same"

"part of the galaxy, and removed from our line-of-sight. This results
in asymmetric line profiles, which are commonly observed (e.g.
see Fig. 3 of Sobral et al. 2015). Furthermore, the exact fraction of
photons removed from our line-of-sight due to resonance effects is
highly dependent on source geometry and kinematics, and cannot
be quantified observationally which makes interpretation of obser-
vations at high redshift difficult (Laursen & Sommer-Larsen 2007;
Hoag et al. 2019). Additional complications arise to Lyα photons
interacting with the IGM between the emitting galaxies and the
observer. The reduction in Lyα photons by the IGM scattering is
dependent upon the reionisation history and the shape of the Lyα
emission line after resonant scattering with neutral hydrogen in the
ISM and CGM. This can result in as little 10% of the photons be-
ing transmitted through the IGM to observers (Dijkstra et al. 2007;
Zheng et al. 2010; Dayal et al. 2011; Laursen et al. 2011). For a
more complete discussion on the difficulties arising from the reso-
nant nature of Lyα and how this is combatted in modern observa-
tions we refer the reader to Dijkstra (2014) and reference within."
"Modelling the above effects is beyond the scope of the current
work. As the fraction of Lyα photons removed from our line of
sight varies with the content of the IGM, we use 3 different values
of fLyα (0.03, 0.1 and 0.3) to quantify the impact fLyα for a range
of possible sight lines. We define fLyα as the ratio of Lyα photons
escaping the galaxy along our line of sight to the number that would
have been seen without any resonance effects, dust extinction, etc.
The above values of fLyα are chosen to cover the range inferred
from observations (Hayes et al. 2011; Blanc et al. 2011; Dijkstra &
Jeeson-Daniel 2013) and simulations (Garel & et al. Prep)."
"Our processing pipeline calculates the Lyα emission follow-
ing the methods described above for the HeIIλ1640 emission line
(see §2.2 & 2.3), however before observing the Lyα emission with
HSIM we reduce its line strength by fLyα while keeping the contin-
uum unchanged. While the Lyα emission line falls within the wave-
length range covered by HARMONI for objects at 3 ≤ z ≤ 10,
LTAO is not available to observe Lyα for z < 4.3 (i.e. observed"

"wavelengths shorter than ∼ 6500 Å). Therefore, we excluded G7
and G8 from our post-observation analysis of Lyα. As the Lyα
emission line is not the primary focus of this work and due to
the simple order of magnitude model used to account for reso-
nant effects we do not present our recovered emission line profiles
as results, however we have included them in Appendix B for the
reader’s convenience."
"For each galaxy, with each IMF and choice of fLyα we cal-
culate LLyα and thus log (LHeII/LLyα) from the SSDCs, see
Fig. 10. For a given fLyα we find, as with the Hα ratio, that
log (LHeII/LLyα) tends to decrease when moving from a very top
heavy IMF to a standard Kroupa IMF. This trend is also seen in
the mean and standard deviation calculated for each data set. For
a given IMF there is a clear offset between log (LHeII/LLyα) cal-
culated with fLyα = 0.3 and 0.03, this is entirely a result of the
choice of fLyα."
"Fig. 11 shows the recovered values of log (LHeII/LLyα) after
the galaxies are observed with HSIM, however only galaxies that
produce a post-HSIM detectable HeIIλ1640 emission line are in-
cluded in this figure. The units of the spectra are converted from
electrons per second to erg s−1 before the ratio is calculated. We
again see the same trend of decreasing ratios as we move from
PopIII.1 to PopIII.2 as well as the vertical displacement of points
for a given IMF but different fLyα. As before we confirm that this
displacement is purely the result of fLyα. The fact that our “ob-
servations” are of very faint objects means that we are measuring
lines close to the noise limit and thus the ratio for a given galaxy can
be different after observation. We find a typical error on our ratios
of ∼ 0.03. This is highlighted by large scatter for galaxies using
PopIII.1 and fLyα = 0.03 compared to observations of the same
objects with fLyα = 0.3, e.g. the Lyα emission line is almost com-
pletely lost in noise for G6 when using PopIII.1 and fLyα = 0.03
(see Fig. B1) and we find LHeII > LLyα."

Pop. III Stars and HARMONI 15
"be used to determine the actual IMF of Pop. III stars. That being
said our results suggest that such a ratio would be a promising test,
with one caveat: fLyα must be known. For example if we compare
the pre-HSIM ratios for PopIII.1 and fLyα = 0.3 and PopIII.K
and fLyα = 0.03 (which have mean values of−1.180±0.297 and
−0.860 ± 0.299 respectively) they are consistent with each other.
Likewise, “observation” of G7 with PopIII.K and fLyα = 0.03
is consistent with the same galaxy using the PopIII.1 IMF and
fLyα = 0.3 Therefore, in order for this ratio test to be used as a
reliable method for determining the IMF of Pop III stars, further
knowledge on fLyα would be required."
4 DISCUSSION
4.1 Other Source of the HeIIλ1640 emission Line
"In this work we have focused on determining whether it will be
possible to use HARMONI on the ELT to detect Pop. III stars using
the HeIIλ1640 emission line, however these stars are not the only
source of this line. As discussed in §1 other luminous objects are
also capable of producing the HeIIλ1640 emission line (see also
Table 8 of Cox 2000). It is therefore important to have diagnostics
of this emission line that provide a determination as to the type of
object producing the emission line."
"For example, the HeIIλ1640 emission line from WR stars
should produce a broad emission line (i.e. FWHMs> 800 km s−1,
Leitherer et al. 1995; Cassata et al. 2013). We predict that Pop. III
stars will produce HeIIλ1640 emission lines with 80 ≤ FWHM <
225 km s−1 (see Fig. 5, 7 and 8). Therefore measuring the line
width of any observed HeIIλ1640 lines provides a simple way to
distinguish between WR and Pop. III stars."
"Naively, one might expect that AGN emissions should pre-
dominantly impact the centre of a given galaxy (Zeilik & Gregory
1997). Therefore, a sufficiently bright extended source which is
spatially resolved may allow us to distinguish between Pop. III
stars and AGN. As shown by Fig. 4, the current sample of simu-
lated galaxies are not spatially resolved and cannot be used to dis-
tinguish between these two types of object. Recent observations
(Reines et al. 2019) and the modelling of supermassive black holes
in NEWHORIZON now indicate that AGN are not always centrally
located. As a result spatial location and compactness alone is not
enough to rule out the possibility of the signal being from an AGN
and additional diagnostics are required."
"Due to their SED, the spectra of AGN are able to produce
both the NV doublet (λ = 1238.82 and 1242.80 Å) and OIII
(1665.85 Å) emission lines (see appendix C) if the accreting gas is
sufficiently metal rich. These lines should not be present in spectra
from Pop. III stars in part due to the shape of the SED and because
of the low metallicity of the surrounding gas. Therefore the pres-
ence of these lines would be a strong indicator that the HeIIλ1640
emission line is due to an AGN and not Pop. III stars. In future
work we will make use of the AGN modelled in the NEWHORI-
ZON simulation to explore how the presence of AGN will impact
the ability of HARMONI to detect Pop. III stars."
4.2 Detection Threshold
"We now explore what determines the detectability of Pop. III stars
in galaxies. The simplest answer is the total number of (young)
Pop. III stars producing a large number of photons able to doubly
ionise He and thus produce a strong HeIIλ1640 emission line, but"

by circles, while those that are not are marked by triangles. The single
square point marks the values found for galaxy G4 after the brightness of
each star particle is increased by a factor of ten. The black line links this
’brightened’ G4 measurement to its original to aid in comparison."
"how does this manifest in observations? By assuming an IMF that
is even more top heavy than PopIII.1 we are are able to increase the
luminosity of each star particle by a factor of ten. This in turn in-
creases the magnitude of the SED for each particle. Alternatively,
Mas-Ribas et al. (2016) found that if stochastic sampling of the
IMF is properly accounted for and with the correct physical con-
ditions, emission lines form Pop. III stars can be up to an order of
magnitude brighter."
"To explore the result of increasing the luminosity of star par-
ticles it is useful to define two terms: Fpeak as the maximum value
of the HeIIλ1640 emission line (before observation with HSIM) in
the a single aperture spectrum similar to those shown in Fig. 5
and Fcont. the estimated value of the continuum at same wave-
length as Fpeak. For both quantities we take their values in units
of spectral brightness (i.e. erg s−1 cm−2 Å"
"−1
arcsec−2) and mul-"
"tiply this value by the spatial and spectral dimensions of a spaxel
(e.g. 10 mas × 10 mas × 0.5 Å), thus both Fpeak and Fcont. are
fluxes in units of erg s−1 cm−2. As both are in the same unit
we are able to calculate the unit-less ratio of those two values:
Fpeak/Fcont., which we use as one of our diagnostic tools."
"Increasing the luminosity of each star particle, as expected,
results in a brighter galaxy. For example, the change in the bright-
ness of a single star particle’s SED by a factor of ten, increase
their output from CLOUDY and thus the galaxy’s single aper-
ture line brightness is larger (i.e. Fpeak increases), typically by
a factor of a few. The exact increase in brightness depends on
the star particles host cell’s gas density and can results in small
variations in Fpeak/Fcont.. For G4 increasing its brightness by a
factor of ten is sufficient to make the galaxy observable with the
PopIII.1 IMF, in this case Fpeak is increased from 5.8× 10−20 to
1.17−19 erg s−1 cm−2."
"Fig. 12 further explores what determines the detectability of
the Pop. III stars via the HeIIλ1640 emission line by comparing
the (pre-observation values) of Fpeak, the emission line’s FWHM
and Fpeak/Fcont. for all the galaxies. We find that Fpeak appears to
be the most important factor in ensuring a line is detected. Indeed,
both the ratio of Fpeak/Fcont. and the FWHM have little impact on
the detectability of HeIIλ1640: i.e. both detected galaxies and un-
detected galaxies have 5 . Fpeak/Fcont. . 80 and 19 .FWHM."

"120. G9, when using the PopIII.2 IMF, has the lowest value of
Fpeak for a detected galaxy thus we use this galaxy to set our lower
limit for detection, i.e. Fpeak > 10"
"−19 erg s−1 cm−2. Further-
more, during the brightness test above, G4 became detectable once
Fpeak > 10"
"−19 erg s−1 cm−2 despite a drop in Fpeak/Fcont., thus
providing further support for Fpeak > 10"
"−19 erg s−1 cm−2 being
the detection threshold."
"To remain self gravitating smaller galaxies must have small
velocity dispersion (on the order of 100 km s−1). This leads to
emission lines with smaller FWHM and thus the photons from the
line are more concentrated, boosting Fpeak/Fcont. and leading to
easier detections. So while the range of FWHM found for the high
redshift galaxies in our sample does not seem to impact detectabil-
ity, it is likely FWHM would play a role for galaxies with larger
velocity dispersions."
"Finally, when selecting galaxies from NEWHORIZON, we
specifically selected compact objects with a high percentage of
Pop. III stars (see §2.1.2) as this presented the best chance for
successful observations. Given that (by design) the simulation pro-
duces a volume that matches the average density of the Universe
and as a result, at z = 0 the most massive halo produced in
NEWHORIZON will have a mass on the order of ∼ 1013 M�.
Therefore the galaxies formed in the simulation should represent
the galaxies most likely to be in the Universe. Rarer and larger ob-
jects such as the Virgo Cluster, with mass on the order of 1015 M�
(Fouqué et al. 2001), will not be formed. From this, we infer that
for a given sight line it is likely that at least one HeIIλ1640 bright,
chemically pristine galaxy at 3 ≤ z ≤ 10 that meets the detection
limits described above and our selection criteria will be found."
4.3 Validity of Approach
4.3.1 Post Processing vs. On The Fly
"The primary goal of this work is to determine whether Pop. III stars
will be detectable with HARMONI and the ELT. To achieve this
it has been necessary to adopt several assumptions. For example,
we employed a metallicity cut to determine (in post processing)
whether or not a star particle is a Pop. III star. However, normally
a proper primordial chemistry network is used to model Pop. III
star formation (for example, see Glover 2007; Jappsen et al. 2009).
If the goal of this work had been to model the formation of Pop.
III stars and determine how they shaped the evolution of their host
galaxy this would present a significant issue."
"Furthermore such a study would require, in addition to the
primordial chemical networks, that the feedback model employed
in the simulation accounted for the top-heavy nature of the the-
atrical Pop. III IMFs. We emphasis this is not our goal, and as a
result, we are able to make use the pre-calculated SEDs from YG-
GDRASIL to account for the presence (or lack of) metals in Pop.
III stars. The impact of metals in the ISM surrounding these stars
is accounted for with the, well tested, radiative transfer program
CLOUDY. This approach affords us the flexibility of being able to
change the SED of a Pop. III stars at the time of analysis, allow-
ing for the testing of multiple IMFs, in a variety of environments
(i.e. gas densities, metallicities, etc) without having to rerun an ex-
tremely computationally expensive simulation. We therefore argue,
the post-processing method used here is sufficient to provide a de-
termination of Pop. III detectability with the ELT."
4.3.2 Large Pop. III Stellar Clusters
"This work assumed that Pop. III stars form in clusters with a total
mass ≥ 104 M�. However, it is perhaps more likely that a single
massive Pop. III star forms in a region and shuts down the local
star formation via feedback. When this first star eventually under-
goes a supernova it pollutes the local environment with metals and
therefore the subsequent generation of stars will be too metal rich
to be considered Pop. III (Ostriker & Gnedin 1996; Omukai 1999).
In this scenario Pop. III stars are likely to be scattered throughout
the galaxy and as a result fail to produce a strong enough emission
line to be detected even with HARMONI and the ELT."
"That being said, current work on the formation of 105 M�
black holes in the high-z Universe provides a possible formation
mechanism for clusters of Pop. III stars, as assumed in this work.
One of the current methods for forming such black holes is “direct
collapse” were gas clouds with masses of ∼ 105 M� collapse un-
der gravity directly to a massive black hole (see Begelman et al.
2006, and references within). These models require the gas to be
pristine and unable to form H2 which prevents the gas from cool-
ing to below 104 K. The lack of cooling stops the fragmentation
into smaller clouds and instead a single massive black hole forms.
We assert that by relaxing the no-H2 criteria the same arguments
can be used to produce a cluster of Pop. III stars: the presence of
H2 results in the collapsing pristine cloud fragmenting and forming
multiple Pop. III stars (see Abel et al. 2000). This model requires
that the star formation happens throughout the cloud on time scales
on the order of the free-fall time, as feedback (supernovae and ultra-
violet radiation) from just one massive Pop. III star could disperse
the cloud or dissociate the H2. In essence, for a Pop. III cluster to
be created, the star formation efficiency per free-fall time (�ff ) must
be on the order of unity. At z = 0, giant molecular clouds shows
�ff ranging from ∼ 10−4 to ∼ 2 (see Grisdale et al. 2019, and ref-
erences within) and therefore finding clouds at high-z with �ff ∼ 1
is plausible. Even if not the norm, galaxies where this type of Pop.
III formation occurs are the ones most likely to be detected with
30 + m class telescopes and therefore it is this kind of Pop. III star
formation we focus in this work."
"Using radiation hydrodynamic simulations Susa & Umemura
(2006) explored the impact of one generation of Pop. III stars on
subsequent generations. Finding that if a first generation Pop. III
star has a mass of 120 M�, its ionising radiation creates a H2 shell.
This shields H2 outside of the shell from the dissociating ultravio-
let (UV) radiation produced by the star. As a result the star forma-
tion of the second generation stars will not be effected by the first.
Hasegawa et al. (2009) took this concept further, testing a range of
different masses for the first generation Pop. III stars and found that
star formation was only delayed if the first generation had a mass
of . 25 M�, i.e. the ionising radiation was not sufficient to create
a H2 shell. Given that both the PopIII.1 and PopIII.2 IMFs have
a mean/characteristic stellar mass of & 100 M�, we argue that the
star particles in this work could indeed form in this self-shielding
regime and thus be a valid way of modelling Pop. III stars in cos-
mological simulation."
"Xu et al. (2016) showed that in the Renaissance Simulations
not only did Pop. III stars formation occur down to z = 7.6 but also
that galaxies could continue to form multiple generations of Pop.
III stars. This occurs as a result of two factors: (i) the local and
slow nature of metal enrichment and (ii) the delay of Pop. III star
formation due to Lyman-Wemer radiation from surrounding metal-
enriched star formation. Given all of the above, we argue that our"
"MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)"
Pop. III Stars and HARMONI 17
"assumption of Pop. III star clusters is not as reasonable as it might
initially seem."
"In this work we explored the detectability of Pop. III stars
with HARMONI and the ELT assuming that they follow one of
three specific IMFs (see §2.2 and Fig. 1). While we have attempted
to choose three IMFs that bracket the current theories on Pop. III
IMFs, it is possible that Pop. III stars actually follow very different
IMFs. For example, all IMFs in this work assume a continuously
sampled mass function however the IMF might be instead be sam-
pled stochastically (see Mas-Ribas et al. 2016, for details). To prop-
erly determine the IMF of Pop. III stars, all possible, or at least a
significant range of, IMFs need to be considered and a catalogue of
mock observations using methods such as those used in this work
needs to be built up for comparison with observations."
4.3.3 Are Hydro and CLOUDY Simulations Really Needed?
"It could be argued that the methods used here are surplus to require-
ment and that SED modelling could produce the same results. How-
ever, this is only true to a limited extent and only because our cho-
sen galaxies produce point-like sources when observed (see Fig. 4).
Indeed as mentioned above (see §3.1.1) if we were to choose a more
extended object, or one with a component of non-Pop. III stars,
gas and stellar structures would become visible in integrated line
strength maps both before and after observations. G6 demonstrates
this (see Fig. 4): the region we extract of the simulation contains
two galaxies connected by a reasonably dense (∼ 100 M� pc−2)
gas bridge. However due to the lack of stars in this bridge it is not
visible in HeIIλ1640 either before or after observations with HSIM.
Furthermore, the HeIIλ1640 integrated line strength map (i.e. mid-
dle panel of Fig. 4) shows that both of these galaxies have their
HeIIλ1640 emissions spread out over more than 20 pixels, with the
in-falling galaxy (top galaxy in the panel) having elongated emis-
sion region which stretches over∼ 0.5 kpc yet once observed with
HSIM both galaxy are reduced to just a handle of pixels. Indeed the
previously elongated structure of the in-falling galaxy is completely
lost (see the right panel for G6 on Fig. 4). An identical behaviour
is seen in G7. The lack of extended objects can partly be explained
by the AO technique employed by the HARMONI, as it provides
improved contrast on compact objects but provides little to no im-
provement to the detection of extend structures, such as those found
in G6 and G7 (Davies & Kasper 2012). The AO, coupled with the
decrease in like brightness in the extended regions (a result of the
compact stellar structure of these early galaxies) provides an expla-
nation as to why the extend regions and thus extended sources of
HeIIλ1640 are unlikely to be detected."
"The reader will remember that the spectrum recovered from
the individual SSDCs for an individual galaxy are the result of hun-
dreds or sometimes thousands6 of individual sources. The spectrum
of each of these sources is determined by a number of factors in-
cluding local gas density and the age of the star particle supplying
photons, in short they are unique and combine to give each galaxy
its own unique spectrum. Furthermore, the spectrum of each galaxy
is shaped by its evolutionary history in the simulated universe of
NEWHORIZON, which was designed to be a realistic model of our
Universe (see Park et al. 2019; Dubois et al. 2020). Therefore the
SSDCs and the spectrum produced after observation with HSIM are
cosmologically constrained for a given IMF."
"6 in our sample of eight galaxies the smallest has ∼ 60 star particles while
our most massive has ∼ 6000!"
"We argue the methods used in this work are the most realistic
(i.e. cosmologically constrained) for the computational cost (i.e.
without running full radiation-hydrodynamic simulation) and thus
provide the closest mock observations of Pop. III stars in high z
galaxies to real observations. Finally, the post processing pipeline
used here can be applied to any number of simulated galaxies, with
any choice of IMF to build up a catalogue of mock observations for
comparison with real observations made with HARMONI at the
ELT."
"While the work presented here is focused on the detectability
of HeIIλ1640 emission lines from Pop. III stars, the pipeline devel-
oped for this work can be used in a variety of ways to prepare for
30+ metre class telescopes, such as the ELT. For example, it would
be possible to use cosmological simulations to identity regions at
each z within the simulated volume that are capable of forming
Pop. III stars and galaxies. These regions could be processed with
our pipeline and mock observations could be carried out. Such work
might allow us to determine how proximity to non-Pop. III galaxies
effects the line flux of Pop. III galaxies."
5 CONCLUSION
"The existence of Population III (Pop. III) stars has not been ob-
servationally confirmed up to now, although several attempts have
been made, and some excellent candidates have been identified.
Given their primordial composition with no heavy elements, Pop.
III stars are expected to be substantially more massive, as well as
have poor coupling between their constituent gas and the emitted
radiation. Consequently, they should be much hotter, and have a
much higher UV flux, capable of ionising not only Hydrogen but
also Helium in the surrounding gas (H II region). The strength of
the HeIIλ1640 is thus a good observational diagnostic for the pres-
ence of Pop III stars, although the emission line will be faint due
to the large luminosity distance of these very high redshift star
forming regions. Starting with detailed cosmological simulations
from the NEWHORIZON suite at a range of redshifts, and post-
processing them with full radiative transfer and typical top heavy
IMFs expected for Pop III stars, we have created self-consistent
mock galaxies whose morphology, kinematics, line strengths and
line-to-continuum ratios are representative of what Pop. III star
dominated galaxies would exhibit at a range of redshifts. Then, us-
ing HSIM, we simulated long (10 hour) observations of these mock
galaxies with the world’s largest telescope, the ELT, and its AO-
assisted, first-light, integral field spectrograph, HARMONI. The
ELT’s huge collecting area, coupled with the exquisite spatial res-
olution provided by HARMONI LTAO allows us to predict that the
He II feature can be detected with good signal-to-noise from a sub-
stantial fraction of the mock galaxies, spanning a wide range of
redshifts. However, to be certain that the line indicates the presence
of Pop III stars would require ancillary observations of the Hα line
from these objects to measure the HeII to Hα ratio, probably using
the JWST, given the high redshifts involved. Our key results are:"
"(i) If Pop. III stars have a top heavy IMF, with a mean mass
≥ 100 M� and a total mass of≥ 104 M� they will produce strong
HeIIλ1640 emission. In the case of galaxies with a compact Pop.
III stellar distribution this line will be observable with HARMONI
at redshifts ranging from ten to three."
"(ii) While most of our sample galaxies are in essence point
sources some do have structure prior to observation with HSIM (e.g.
G6 and G7). We find that the morphology of our galaxies is not re-
coverable from observations of the HeIIλ1640 emission line. We"
"MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)"
18 Kearn Grisdale et al.
"therefore advise that observations looking for Pop. III stars with
HARMONI look for point-line sources rather than extended ob-
jects."
"(iii) If Pop. III stars follow an IMF similar to one found in cur-
rent stellar populations, e.g. a Kroupa IMF, the galaxy will still
produce a HeIIλ1640 emission line. However unless the emitting
galaxy has a stellar mass of the order 107 M�, a very young stellar
age and an average metallicity of . 0.001Z� this line will be too
weak to be observed."
"(iv) HeIIλ1640 emission lines is observable in our simula-
tions over a wide range of redshifts, only if line’s peak flux is
> 10−19erg s−1 cm−2 and if the emitting region is compact, i.e. a
few tens of milliarcseconds across."
"(v) Determining which theoretical IMF is close to the actual
IMF is very likely possible by comparing the relative strength of
other emission features, such as Hα and Lyα . However, this will
involve combining observation programs and possibly different fa-
cilities, such as the ELT (for Lyα and HeIIλ1640 emissions) and
JWST (for Hα emissions). Furthermore, a sufficiently large data
set will be required to allow for statistical analysis of the line ra-
tios."
"In future work we will explore how signals from other objects
capable of producing the HeIIλ1640 emission line will impact de-
tections of the Pop. III stars and how these signals can be disentan-
gled."

APPENDIX A: ANALYTICAL MODEL
"Throughout this work we employ CLOUDY to carry out all radiative
transfer calculations, however as we are using non-standard SEDs
it is important to determine if the results from CLOUDY are reason-
able. To this end, we run three CLOUDY simulations (one for each
Pop. III SED) for a 104 year old star cluster with a total luminos-
ity of Ltot = 1038erg s−1,7 embedded in a cloud with a uniform
density of H and He (nH = 100 cm−3 and nHe = 10 cm−3). To
compare the results of the CLOUDY tests we construct a simple an-
alytical model to determine the expected strength of the HeIIλ1640
line. In the following we outline this model and compare it to the
results from CLOUDY ."
A1 The Model
"Similar to CLOUDY, we treat the stellar cluster as a single point-like
source of radiation embedded within a cloud with three distinct re-
gions: a He++ and H+ inner sphere, a surrounding shell consisting
of He+ and H+ shell and an outer shell of He and H+, as shown"
"7 This Ltot corresponds to star cluster masses of 1.7 × 102, 5.0 × 102
and 3.0 × 103 M� for PopIII.1, PopIII.2 and PopIII.K SEDs respectively."
Pipeline vs Analytical Module
"He++, H+ sphere He+, H+ sphere He, H+ sphere"
"Figure A1. Cartoon depicting the analytical model, described in §A1. The
star represents the stellar cluster, while the dashed lines show the bound-
aries, between the three regions (i.e. He++ & H+, He+ & H+ and He &
H+) and the correspondingly coloured arrows represent the radius of each
Strömgren sphere."
"in Fig. A1. The distance from the star cluster to the outer boundary
of each of these regions can be estimated as a Strömgren sphere
(Strömgren 1939), which is given by:"
"RSS,i ="
"4πnineαB,i"
")1/3
, (A1)"
"where Qi is the number of photons per second with sufficient en-
ergy to ionise the chemical species i, ni is the number density of
the species, αB,i is the recombination rate of the species and ne is
the number density of electrons."
"The HeIIλ1640 emission can only be produced (in our model)
in the regions where He is ionised i.e. R ≤ RSS,He. We divide this
region into concentric shells (of thickness dR) and calculate the
flux emitted by each shell using:"
"jλ1640 = γjλ4686nenHedR, (A2)"
"where jλ4686 is the strength of the He line at 4686 Å and γ is the ra-
tio of jλ1640 to jλ4686. Values for jλ4686 and γ are taken from col-
umn 4 of Table 4.5 in Osterbrock & Ferland (2006). We adopt the
simplification that the only ion that contributes to recombination is
that of the species being considered, however the total number of
available electrons needs to be considered therefore"
"nH if RSS,He < R ≤ RSS,H,
nH + nHe if RSS,He+ < R ≤ RSS,He,
nH + 2nHe if R ≤ RSS,He+ ."
"Finally, the total luminosity emitted at a given distance from
the star cluster, L(≤ R), is calculated by summing the value of
jλ1640 for each shell contained within R."
A2 Model Comparison
"A comparison of the L(≤ R) as calculated by the above model and
CLOUDY is shown in Fig. A2 . We find that for most values of R
the two methods agree with each other to within a factor ∼ 2. It
is worth noting that for R . 0.5 pc the analytical model tends to
have a lower L than CLOUDY , while the opposite is true at larger
R, as summarised in the bottom panel of Fig. A2."
"There are several differences between how CLOUDY and the
model outlined above compute L(≤ R). The flattening seen in the
CLOUDY model atR ∼ 4−5 pc corresponds to the radius as which"

"only ∼ 40 − 80% of He+ is ionised, i.e. Strömgren sphere calcu-
lated by CLOUDY . The Strömgren sphere as calculated from the an-
alytical model (shown in Fig. A2 by the green dashed line) is larger
than the sphere calculated by CLOUDY . This difference in size of
Strömgren sphere arises from CLOUDY taking into account cool-
ing processes that are neglected in the analytical model as a result
the latter assumes a constant temperature throughout the gas. Fur-
thermore the analytical model assumes that hydrogen atoms have
no impact on the number of photons available to create He+ and
similarly for ions He+ have no impact on the number He+ ionising
photons. In reality this is not the case and more complete treatment
than that carried out in our model is need to completely account for
the impact of different species."
"Due to the overall agreement between our analytical model
and CLOUDY in the above test case, we are confident that CLOUDY"

galaxies."
APPENDIX B: Lyα EMISSION LINE PROFILES
"For the reader’s convenience we provide the post-HSIM Lyα spectra
of our simulated galaxies here. How these lines are produced and
the significance of fLyα is outline in §3.4.2. In this work we only
compare the Lyα emission lines with fLyα = 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 to
the HeIIλ1640 emission line, but here we include the emission line
with fLyα = 1.0. In the following figures we only show galaxies at
z > 4.3 (i.e. G7 and G8 are excluded) and for which we can detect
a corresponding HeIIλ1640 emission line."
APPENDIX C: THE SED OF AGN
"The SED of an AGN can be approximated as broken power law
given by"
"f(λ) ∝
{
λ−0.278 if λ . 1200 Å,
λ−1.339 if λ > 1200 Å,"
"with a typically luminosity of ∼ 1012L� (see chapter 14 of Os-
terbrock & Ferland 2006). The top panel of Fig. C1 compares the
spectrum given by Eq. C1 with the SEDs used in this work for
Pop. III stars with an age of 104 yr. For each SED we calculate the
number of photons that would be able to ionise an atom (Qλ) with
an ionising potential at λ (bottom panel of Fig. C1). Therefore by
knowing the ionisation potential of an atom, Fig. C1 can be used
to determine if an AGN or Pop. III stars should produce a stronger
emission line."
"Such an SED produces a large number photons (∼ 3 − 5 ×
1053s−1) with sufficient energies to produce emission lines from
the nitrogen V doublet found at λ = 1238.82 and 1242.80 Å or
the oxygen III emission line at 1665.85 Å. Pop. III stars produce
only ∼ 1 − 30% of the photons that AGN produce at these wave-
lengths (see bottom panel of Fig. C1) and therefore any resulting
nitrogen or oxygen emission lines from a Pop. III star cluster would
be significantly weaker than those produced by AGN."
"It is worth noting that the shape of the AGN SEDs is well
constrained at all redshifts (Hao et al. 2014). As a results the values
of Qλ may vary with z and therefore the impact of AGN on the
detection of Pop. III stars will also vary with redshift."
