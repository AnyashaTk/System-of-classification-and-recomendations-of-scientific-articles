ABSTRACT
"Aims. Accretion and luminosity bursts triggered by three distinct mechanisms: the magnetorotational instability in the inner disk
regions, clump infall in gravitationally fragmented disks and close encounters with an intruder star, were studied to determine the disk
kinematic characteristics that can help to distinguish between these burst mechanisms.
Methods. Numerical hydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk limit were employed to model the bursts in disk environments that
are expected for each burst mechanism.
Results. We found that the circumstellar disks featuring accretion bursts can bear kinematic features that are distinct for different
burst mechanisms, which can be useful when identifying the burst origin. The disks in the stellar encounter and clump-infall models
are characterized by tens of per cent deviations from the Keplerian rotation, while the disks in the MRI models are characterized only
a few per cent deviation, which is mostly caused by the gravitational instability that fuels the MRI bursts. Velocity channel maps
also show distinct kinks and wiggles, which are caused by gas disk flows that are peculiar to each considered burst mechanism. The
deviations of velocity channels in the burst-hosting disks from a symmetric pattern typical of Keplerian disks are strongest for the
clump-infall and collision models, and carry individual features that may be useful for the identification of the corresponding burst
mechanism. The considered burst mechanisms produce a variety of light curves with the burst amplitudes varying in the ∆m = 2.5−3.7
limits, except for the clump-infall model where ∆m can reach 5.4, although the derived numbers may be affected by a small sample
and boundary conditions.
Conclusions. Burst triggering mechanisms are associated with distinct kinematic features in the burst-hosting disks that may be used
for their identification. Further studies including a wider model parameter space and the construction of synthetic disk images in
thermal dust and molecular line emission are needed to constrain the origin mechanisms of FU Orionis bursts."

1. Introduction
"Protostars grow in mass through accretion from a surrounding
protostellar disk. The details of protostellar accretion are, how-
ever, not fully understood. One aspect that is currently under de-
bate is the behavior of protostellar accretion with time. Evidence
is growing that protostellar accretion is not constant or steadily
declining, but is highly variable (e.g, Contreras Peña et al. 2017;
Guo et al. 2020). FU-Orionis-type luminosity outbursts (FUors)
that are characterized by orders of magnitude increase in lumi-
nosity provide a prime example of accretion variability. A few
confirmed dozens of such objects are known to date (Audard
et al. 2014; Connelley & Reipurth 2018a) and several new can-
didates are routinely discovered every year."
"It is generally agreed that FUors are caused by a sudden in-
crease in the mass accretion rate from the disk on the protostar.
However, the mechanisms that trigger such an increase are un-
certain. These mechanisms include the magnetorotational insta-
bility (MRI) in the innermost disk regions prompted by a sudden
increase in the ionization fraction (e.g., Armitage et al. 2001;
Zhu et al. 2009; Bae et al. 2014; Kadam et al. 2020), infall of
gaseous clumps formed through disk gravitational fragmentation
(e.g., Vorobyov & Basu 2005; Machida et al. 2011; Vorobyov &
Basu 2015; Meyer et al. 2017), planet-disk interaction and mass-"
"exchange (Lodato & Clarke 2004; Nayakshin & Lodato 2012),
and close encounter between a protoplanetary disk and an in-
truder star in young stellar clusters (e.g. Pfalzner 2008; Forgan &
Rice 2010). Global simulations of clustered star formation also
indicate that gravitationally unstable protostellar disks with high
rates of mass infall from the surrounding environment can drive
accretion bursts (Kuffmeier et al. 2018). Audard et al. (2014)
provides a comprehensive review on these and other burst trig-
gering mechanisms."
"Distinguishing between different outburst triggers is not an
easy task. FUors show a variety of light curve shapes (Hart-
mann & Kenyon 1996; Connelley & Reipurth 2018a) and this
was suggested as evidence for different underlying trigger mech-
anisms (Audard et al. 2014). The underlying physical conditions
in a protoplanetary disk and its immediate environment may be
vastly different. Numerical simulations indicate that the same
burst mechanism can show a spread in burst amplitudes and du-
rations, further complicating the comparison (see e.g., Vorobyov
& Basu 2015). An alternative approach to discriminate between
different burst models would be to search for global disk fea-
tures that may be particular to a certain burst mechanism. These
can be the signatures of disk gravitational instability and frag-
mentation (Dunham et al. 2014; Cieza et al. 2018; Meyer et al."

"2019) or close companions that might have caused the outburst
(Beck & Aspin 2012) or disk winds and magnetic field struc-
ture that may be particular for the MRI-active inner disk (Zhu
et al. 2020). In the recent study, MacFarlane et al. (2019) demon-
strated that the flux increase during the burst is more prominent
in the infrared than millimeter wavelengths but this effect may
depend on the disk configuration, which in turn is specific to the
triggering mechanism."
"The theoretical comparison of different burst mechanisms is
complicated by the use of different numerical codes and tech-
niques (Audard et al. 2014). Even when using the same numeri-
cal code, the analysis of individual light curves during the bursts
of different origin may be complicated by inherent differences in
the numerical grid setup and uncertainties in the free parameters
of the models. Therefore, in this paper we focus on the global
kinematic signatures of burst-hosting disks, which are less af-
fected by these difficulties and can help to distinguish between
different burst mechanisms. For this purpose, we employ the nu-
merical hydrodynamics code FEOSAD (Formation and Evolu-
tion of Stars And Disks) to explore the global dynamics of pro-
toplanetary disks featuring FUor-type outbursts driven by three
distinct mechanisms: MRI, clump infall, and close stellar en-
counter."
"It has recently been shown that molecular line observations
can reveal the presence of gravitational instability (Hall et al.
2020) and the location of forming protoplanets (Pinte et al. 2019)
in the disk. Using our model data on the gas velocities, we con-
structed the velocity channel maps (which can serve as idealized
proxies for CO channel-map emission) and compare them with
the channel maps obtained for an idealized unperturbed Keple-
rian disk to determine any specific kinematic signatures that can
be used to distinguish between different burst mechanisms."
"The paper is organized as follows. Sect. 2 presents the nu-
merical model and discusses the considered burst mechanism.
Sect. 3 presents and compares the kinematic signatures of con-
sidered bursts. Sect. 4 provides the model caveats. Main conclu-
sions are summarized in Sect. 5."
"2. Model description and considered burst
mechanisms"
"We use numerical hydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk
limit to explore accretion bursts in young stellar systems. Three
burst mechanisms were considered: triggering of the MRI in the
innermost disk regions, infall of gaseous clumps in a gravitation-
ally unstable disk, and encounter between a protoplanetary disk
and an intruder (sub)-solar-mass star. These models are referred
to hereafter as the MRI model, clump-infall model, and colli-
sion model, respectively. All three burst mechanisms were simu-
lated using the same numerical hydrodynamics code FEOSAD1.
A detailed description of the code is presented in Vorobyov &
Elbakyan (2018), with modifications relevant for modeling the
MRI bursts and close encounters in Kadam et al. (2020) and
Vorobyov et al. (2020c), respectively. Here, we review only the
key aspects of burst modeling."

Poisson integral (for details see Vorobyov & Basu 2010) and the
gravity of the central protostar when formed. Turbulent viscosity
is taken into account via the viscous stress tensor Π, the expres-
sion for which can be found in Vorobyov & Basu (2010). We
parameterized the magnitude of kinematic viscosity ν = αcsH
using the α-prescription of Shakura & Sunyaev (1973), where cs
is the sound speed calculated using the disk midplane tempera-
ture (introduced below) and H is the disk vertical scale height. In
the clump and collision models α is a constant of time and space,
while in the MRI-model we use an adaptive α-value described in
more detail later in the text."

dius R∗ and photospheric luminosity L∗,ph due to gravitational
compression and deuterium burning in the stellar interior are
calculated using the stellar evolution tracks obtained with the
STELLAR code of Yorke & Bodenheimer (2008). We note that
Equation (8) does not take into account the possible variations
of the accretion luminosity caused by the processes at the stellar
surface (e.g., a fraction of accretion energy absorbed by the star,
Baraffe et al. (2017)), which may affect the burst light curves but
are of less significance for the analysis of disk kinematic signa-
tures."
"FEOSAD starts simulations from a collapsing pre-stellar
core in the form of a flattened pseudo-disk, which is expected
in the presence of rotation and large-scale magnetic fields (Basu
1997). The inner regions spin up and a circumstellar disk forms
when the inner infalling layers hit the centrifugal barrier near the
inner computational boundary. The material passing through the
inner boundary forms the growing central star. The infalling core
continues to land at the outer edge of the circumstellar disk (a
reasonable approximation according to Visser et al. (2009)) un-
til the core depletes. The infall rates on the circumstellar disk are
in agreement with analytic collapse models (Vorobyov 2010)."
"The main model characteristics are listed in Table 1. The pa-
rameters of pre-stellar cloud cores with distinct masses Mcore,
initial temperatures Tinit, and ratios of rotational-to-gravitational
energy β were chosen to produce disks with different character-
istics depending on the particular burst mechanism. For instance,
to study the bursts triggered by clump infall, we set a more mas-
sive pre-stellar core with a higher rate of rotation to produce a
massive and extended disk prone to fragment. The initial tem-
perature, which is also the temperature of external stellar irradi-
ation in our models, is also lower to promote disk fragmentation.
The other two models are characterized by lower Mcore and β but
higher Tinit to study the bursts triggered by the MRI and stel-
lar encounters, In these later models the interference from the
clump-infall mechanism is minimized. The simulations contin-
ued for up to 500 kyr to capture the entire embedded and early
T Tauri stages of disk evolution, but we focus here only on short
time periods with representative bursts."
"The MRI bursts considered here were modelled in de-
tail in Kadam et al. (2020) with the help of the adaptive α-
parameterization of turbulent viscosity following the method
laid out in Bae et al. (2014). In the MRI model, known also as
the layered disk model (Armitage et al. 2001), the α-value is
weighed according to the thickness of the MRI-dead and MRI-
active vertical columns of the disk. The MRI-active column and
the corresponding α-value are set equal to Σa = 100 g cm−2 and
αmax = 0.01, respectively. The α-value of the MRI-dead column
Σd is set to αd = 10−5. The adaptive α-value then reads"
"α =
Σaαmax + Σdαd"
"Σ
, (9)"
"where the total surface density of disk is Σ = Σa + Σd. Equa-
tion (9) indicates that the outer disk regions with low surface
densities are MRI-active, while in the innermost disk regions
(where the vertical column of gas greatly exceeds 100 g cm−2)
the α-value effectively reduces to α ' 10−5. These latter regions
of reduced viscous mass transport constitute a ’dead’ zone where
matter accumulates while being transported inwards from the
disk outer regions by the combined action of gravitational and/or
viscous torques."
"The MRI burst is triggered when the gas temperature in
the innermost disk regions exceeds a threshold value of Tcrit ="

and retrograde (forth panel) collisions. In particular, the red and blue
lines present the mass accretion rates on the intruder and target, respec-
tively. The time is reset to zero for each chosen interval of disk evolu-
tion. The arrows indicate the bursts that are investigated in more detail
later in the text."
"1300 K. Above this value, thermal ionization of alkaline met-
als sets in and the dead zone becomes active over a short period
of time. This transition is implemented by a sudden increase in
the α-value throughout the entire disk vertical column to a peak
value of αmax = 0.1. The active state continues for as long as
the disk temperature stays above 1300 K. We note that the peak
value of αmax = 0.1 is higher in the disk regions directly in-
volved in the burst than in otherwise MRI-active regions with
αmax = 0.01 (e.g., outer disk with low column density). This
choice is motivated by numerical magnetohydrodynamics sim-
ulations of Zhu et al. (2020) suggesting that the α-value in the
innermost disk regions during the MRI burst can exceed notably
the typical value of 0.01 for MRI-active disks in the non-burst
state (Yang et al. 2018)."
"Accretion bursts caused by infall of gaseous clumps were
studied by Vorobyov & Basu (2015). This mechanism requires
massive gravitationally unstable disks prone to fragment. Grav-
itational interaction between the clumps and also between the
clumps and spiral arms causes the clumps to preferentially mi-
grate inward. Fast inward migration followed by tidal destruc-
tion delivers large amounts of matter to the inner disk regions
causing an accretion burst. This mechanism has recently been
confirmed to operate also in disks around massive stars (Meyer
et al. 2017). In this paper, we used the high-resolution models of
Vorobyov & Elbakyan (2018) which were able to resolve the in-
ternal structure of inward-migrating clumps as they tidally lose
their envelope and produce the burst."

"To study the bursts caused by close encounters, we use the
model recently presented in Vorobyov et al. (2020c). In this col-
lision model, a diskless star is set on an encounter trajectory with
a protoplanetary disk around a sub-solar mass star. The intruder
star is allowed to accrete matter from its surroundings and its
accretion luminosity is taken into account when computing the
thermal balance of the system. We modified the accretion rate
calculations of the intruder star using the following algorithm.
First, we calculate the Hill radius of the intruder (RH) and con-
sider only the grid cells within RH that satisfy the following cri-
terion"
"Ekin + Egr < 0, (10)"
"where Ekin is the kinetic energy of motion in the frame of ref-
erence of the intruder and Egr is the gravitational energy in its
gravitational field. The above equation states that the material
has to be on a bound orbit to be accreted by the intruder. We
then calculate the mass of gas that is accreted by the intruder
during one time step dt as"
"∆M =
∑"
"DiFi Σi dS i, (11)"
"where the summation is performed over all cells within the Hill
radius subject to condition (10), dS i is the surface area of a given
cell, Σi is the surface density in this cell, and Fi is the fraction of
accreted material in this cell defined as"
"Fi = dt
ΩK,i"
"2π
. (12)"
"Here, ΩK,i is the Keplerian velocity of a given cell in the frame of
reference of the intruder. Equation (12) implies that the intruder
accretes all material in a given cell on a Keplerian time scale,
but this never happens in reality because Equation (10) may be
violated and new material is captured by the intruder as it passes
by. To take the finite disk thickness into account, we multiply the
accreted mass ∆M by the following factor"

"where Hi is the disk vertical scale height in a given cell and ri is
the radial distance from the intruder to a given cell. We note that
the value ofDi is expected to be unity for the considered masses
and periastron distances of the intruder, but may be smaller than
unity in a general case. Once the accreted mass ∆M is calcu-
lated, the mass of the intruder, its velocity, the surface densi-
ties and velocities of affected grid cells within the Hill radius"
"are updated to conserve the mass and momentum. The ideas de-
scribed above were taken from Forgan & Rice (2010) and Kley
& Nelson (2012). We considered also other accretion prescrip-
tions (e.g., Federrath et al. 2010), but found them less realistic in
our context because they led to premature dissipation of the disk
captured by the intruder. Finally, we note that Equations (2) and
(3) were modified take the gravitational potential and luminosity
of the intruder into account. The computations were performed
in the non-inertial frame of reference of the target star by intro-
ducing the so-called indirect potential (see for details Vorobyov
et al. 2017). The α-parameter in the collision and clump infall
models is set equal to a constant value of 10−2 to exclude MRI-
triggered bursts."
"In this paper, we consider accretion bursts caused by both
prograde and retrograde encounters in the plane of the target
disk. The disk was evolved to an age of 0.5 Myr to guarantee
that the other considered bursts mechanisms are unlikely to op-
erate. Indeed, the disk is axisymmetric and gravitationally stable
at this late stage, which excludes the clump-infall mechanism.
We also make sure that the disk density and temperature at this
time instance are insufficient to produce the MRI-triggered burst
without external interference. Typically, accretion of matter on
the intruder, as it passes through the disk, causes a burst. We
note, however, that perturbations produced by the intruder can
trigger disk fragmentation in the disk of the target (e.g. Thies
et al. 2010). Besides, the mass inflow to the inner disk caused by
the close passage of the intruder can also trigger the MRI burst
in the disk of the target. The situation can therefore become quite
complicated in the case of encounter-triggered bursts. Here, we
consider in detail only the primary burst of the intruder star and
leave the investigation of secondary bursts for a follow-up study."
"All bursts mechanisms were considered on the polar grid
(r, φ) in the thin-disk geometry. The radial grid is logarithmically
spaced, while the azimuthal grid is equally spaced. To model the
MRI bursts, the inner disk boundary is set at r = 0.4 au to capture
the innermost disk regions where the MRI is supposed to oper-
ate. The number of grid cells is 512 × 512, which corresponds
to a numerical resolution of 0.02 au at one astronomical unit. In
the clump-infall model, the inner boundary is set at 15 au and
the number of grid cells is 1024 × 1024. This choice allowed us
to attain a sub-au numerical resolution up to a radial distance of
150 au, i.e., in the disk regions of interest where clumps form
and migrate. In the close-encounter model, the inner boundary is
set at 2 au and the number of grid cells is 512 × 512."
"The inner unresolved region of the disk is replaced with a
sink cell and matter is allowed to flow both directions – from the
disk to the sink and vice versa (for details see Kadam et al. 2019).
The mass accretion rate in the MRI and clump-infall models is"

"calculated as the mass passing through the sink cell per unit time.
In the collision model, we focus on the mass accretion on the
intruder and not on the target star (the latter is much smaller
than the former). In this model, the accretion rate on the intruder
is calculated following the method described by Equations (10)-
(13)."
"We note that the calculated mass accretion rate best repre-
sents the protostellar accretion rate in the MRI model. In the
collision model, the mass accretion rate on the intruder star is
subject to model assumptions laid out by Equations (10)-(13)
and may change if other accretion models were used. In the
clump infall model, physical mechanisms operating inside 15 au
may also modify the calculated mass accretion rate. Neverthe-
less, these model limitations are not expected to affect notably
the global kinematics of protoplanetary disks undergoing accre-
tion bursts. In this case, using one code to model different burst
mechanisms presents a clear advantage, allowing us to eliminate
the uncertainty that may be introduced by adopting different disk
physics and numerical methods."
3. Kinematic signatures of accretion bursts

disks subject to accretion and luminosity bursts. The focus is put
on the analysis of disk kinematics. In particular, we will search
for any signatures in the disk rotation curves and velocity chan-"

triggering mechanisms."
3.1. Considered accretion bursts
"We start by illustrating the accretion and luminosity bursts con-
sidered in our work. Figure 1 presents the mass accretion rate
versus time for several representative time intervals of disk evo-
lution. We do not show the entire computed disk evolution
(which is much longer in the MRI and clump-infall models) be-
cause we focus in this study on the kinematic signatures of indi-
vidual bursts rather than on the collective burst properties. Panels
from top to bottom show the MRI model (first panel), clump-
infall model (second panel), and collision model (third and forth
panels). The collision model is represented by two panels for the
accretion rate on the intruder in the prograde and retrograde en-
counters. The target star exhibits bursts of a much smaller ampli-
tude than is typical of most FU Orionis-type eruptions (see also
Forgan & Rice 2010). The MRI and clump-infall models show
highly variable accretion with multiple bursts, while the mass ac-
cretion rate on the intruder in the collision model is characterized
by one burst that occurs during the closest approach between the
intruder and target stars (t ≈ 2.5 kyr). High variability in the
clump-infall model is caused by the perturbing influence of the
clump that orbits the star at about 25 au."
"We have chosen several representative accretion bursts indi-
cated by arrows in Figure 1, the total luminosities and mass ac-
cretion rates of which are displayed on shorter time intervals in
Figure 2. Clearly, the considered mechanisms produce a variety
of light curves with different peak luminosities, burst durations,"

"where Lpeak and Lbase are the peak and preburst total luminosi-
ties marked in Figure 2 with the black circles. Choosing the pre-
burst luminosity for the collision-triggered bursts presents a cer-
tain difficulty because the intruder was diskless before the col-
lision and its total luminosity was determined exclusively by its
photospheric contribution (set equal to 1 L�). As the intruder
penetrates the target disk, its accretion (and total) luminosity is
gradually rising. We set the preburst luminosity equal to 10 L�,
which is comparable to the corresponding value in the clump-
infall models. The resulting values of ∆m lie in the 2.5–3.7 lim-
its, except for the clump-infall model where ∆m can reach 5.4
for the Clump3 burst. The peak luminosities of model bursts are
in the range of the known FU Orionis type bursts (see Table A
in the Appendix). We postpone a detailed analysis of these burst
characteristics for a follow-up paper and focus on the disk kine-
matic signatures that are associated with these bursts. The verti-
cal dotted lines mark the time instances before, during, and after
the bursts, which are chosen to investigate in detail the disk kine-
matics below."
3.2. MRI-triggered bursts
"Figure 3 presents the two-dimensional disk properties before,
during, and after the MRI burst for the light curve shown in the
top panel of Figure 2. The corresponding time instances are in-
dicated by the vertical dotted lines and marked with letters a), b),
and c) in both Figures 2 and 3. The top and middle panels show
the gas surface density with different spatial resolution, while
the bottom panel presents the adaptive α-value. The global disk
structure is dominated by spiral arms indicating that the disk is
gravitationally unstable. Gravitational instability is a mechanism
that, alongside with turbulent viscosity, helps to bring matter in
the disk innermost regions and trigger the MRI (Zhu et al. 2009).
The inner disk structure is dominated by gaseous rings that form
in the dead zone (Kadam et al. 2019). During the burst (middle"

"column) the inner ring becomes MRI-unstable and falls on the
star, thus producing a burst. The development of the MRI is evi-
dent in the bottom panel showing that the α-parameter rises to a
peak value of 0.1 during the burst. About 2.9 MJ of gas mass is
accreted during the burst from the inner 1.8 au. After the burst,
the inner region with a radius of several astronomical units fea-
tures a gap, which slowly fills in with matter as the disk evolves
and recovers from the burst."
"Figure 4 compares the relevant time scales in the disk during
the MRI burst. In particular, the dynamical (Keplerian) timescale
τK = 2πr/vK is shown by the blue line, while the black line
presents the burst duration τbst calculated by defining the base-
line that connects the two time points of equal luminosity on
both sides of the luminosity peak. The red line shows the vis-
cous timescale defined as τvisc = r2/ν, where we azimuthally av-
eraged the kinematic viscosity ν to derive the radial profile. We
note that the viscous timescale is therefore inversely dependent
on the α-parameter and the sound speed in the disk. In the disk
region engulfed by the burst (to the left from the vertical dotted
line), τvisc >∼ τbst and both timescales are much longer than the
dynamical timescale. The fact that τvisc � τbst in the bulk of the
disk and τvisc approaches τbst in the innermost disk regions af-
fected by the burst supports its viscous origin. At the same time
τbst remains shorter than τvisc, which reflects a self-regulating
nature of the MRI burst – the burst terminates when the inner
disk becomes depleted of matter owing to elevated viscous mass
transport."

The values for the upper and lower halves of the disk are shown separately."
Keplerian velocity as
"δvφ = (vφ − vK)/vK, (15)
δvr = vr/vK. (16)"
"When calculating the Keplerian velocity vK we also took into ac-
count the disk mass that lies interior to a given radial distance.
The two-dimensional distribution of these quantities is shown in
the upper panel of Figure 5 at a spatial scale that captures the en-
tire disk. The time instance near the peak of the burst is chosen.
The residual velocity δvφ and the ratio δvr exhibit a spiral-like
spatial pattern that is caused by global perturbations from the
spiral density waves traversing the disk. The amplitude of these
perturbations is smaller in the inner disk regions where the waves
are weakest (due to increasing temperature and shear). The bot-
tom panel in Figure 5 presents the azimuthally averaged residual
azimuthal velocity δvφ and the ratio of radial to Keplerian ve-
locity δvr. When calculating the average, we mass-weighted the
radial and azimuthal velocities to diminish the input from the
disk regions where little matter is localized. The azimuthally av-
eraged patterns are highly irregular, but in general are of rather
small amplitude, not exceeding a few per cent. In particular, δvr
is notably smaller than δvφ and the former is negative in the inner
1 au, reflecting the infall of matter caused by the MRI."

averaged quantities from the MRI model at the time immediately
preceding the burst, t = 7.847 kyr (the highly perturbed disk
during the MRI burst cannot be described by a steady-state ap-
proach). The resulting deviation δur = ur/vK is shown with the
red dashed line in the bottom panel of Figure 5. The values of
δur for the steady-state disk are found to be much smaller than
the variations in δvr for the real disk during the MRI burst. In
fact, δur (the red dashed line) do not exceed 2×10−4 by absolute
value in the inner 200 au, while δvr (the blue dashed line) can
be as large as ±0.01. Our calculated values of δur are in agree-

demonstrates that our model velocity variations are much larger
than this estimate."
"The top row in Figure 6 compares the velocity channel maps
for Burst 2 near its maximum with the velocity channel maps
of an axisymmetric unperturbed Keplerian disk (middle row).
When calculating the velocity of the Keplerian disk we also take
the enclosed disk mass into account. The gas surface density of
the Keplerian disk is obtained by azimuthally averaging the sur-
face density of our model disk near the peak of the burst. For
convenience we also plot the gas surface density of the disk (the
color map for the surface density is chosen arbitrarily for better
visual representation). Each channel represents a velocity inter-
val (along the line of sight) of 0.4 km s−1. It is assumed that the
disk is tilted by 30◦ relative to the horizontal axis with the up-
per part being further out from the observer. The model velocity
channel maps show ’kinks’ and ’wiggles’, similar to those found
by Hall et al. (2020) for a gravitationally unstable disk. These
features are caused by the spiral density waves that traverse and
perturb the disk. They are absent in the idealized Keplerian disk.
In general there are no strong deviations from the Keplerian ve-
locity channel maps for the inner several tens of astronomical
units of the disk because the spiral pattern is weakened there. No-
table deviations occur only in the outer disk regions in the vicin-
ity of strong spiral arms. We conclude that the velocity channel
maps can help to reveal the presence of gravitational instability
as a possible MRI-assisting mechanism but not the MRI burst
itself. Whether or not these velocity fluctuations can be detected
is uncertain and the line radiative transfer simulations are needed
to address this point. However, the spiral arms causing these de-
viations are likely to be visible in the dust continuum emission
(see, e.g., Dong et al. 2016)."
"From the observations of dense gas tracers toward a Keple-
rian rotating disk, the blueshifted and redshifted velocity chan-
nels at the same velocity offset (from the systemic velocity)
should present reflection symmetric with respect to the stellar
position. This effect is illustrated in the middle row of Figure 6.
Quantifying the deviation from such reflection symmetric may
provide the degree of deviation from the Keplerian rotation. To
perform such an analysis, we calculate the deviations in the po-
sition angle and velocity of the center of each velocity channel
in the MRI model with respect to the center of the correspond-
ing channel in the Keplerian disk. The corresponding centers of
the velocity channels are shown in the top and middle panels of
Figure 6 by the solid blue curves. The corresponding deviations
are defined as"

"where φmodel and φK are the position angles of the center of the

Keplerian disk would effectively be retrieved and both quantities
δφch and δvch would be negligibly small."

disk during the burst. The yellow arrows show the position of perturbed
clumps that fall onto the central star, while the red arrows indicate the
clump that is involved in the close encounter. The disk is rotating coun-
terclockwise."
"The resulting values of δφch and δvch as a function of radial
distance are plotted in the bottom panel of Figure 6. The devi-
ations in the position angle δφch do not exceed ten degrees and
stay mostly within a few degrees. The corresponding relative de-
viations in the line-of-sight velocity δvch also stay within several
percent. The biggest deviations are found in the outer disk re-
gions where the spiral pattern is the strongest. However, nonzero
deviations can also be noted in the innermost disk regions, which
is not evident in the top and middle panels of Figure 6 because
of the narrowing channel maps near the coordinate center."
3.3. Bursts triggered by clump-infall
"The second type of accretion and luminosity burst is caused by
infall of gaseous clumps that form in gravitationally unstable
disks via disk fragmentation. This process is illustrated in Fig-
ure 7 showing the gas surface density distributions before and
during the burst events that are indicated in the second panel of
Figure 1 with arrows. Clearly, the disk exhibits a highly frag-
mented pattern with several clumps and irregular spiral arms. As
was described in detail in Vorobyov & Elbakyan (2018), chance
encounters between the clumps drive one of them towards the
star, while the other is scattered to a wider orbit. Figure 7 illus-
trates two such events. In the top row the encounter is mild and
the clump highlighted by the arrow gradually spirals down on the
star, leaving behind a characteristic spiral-like tail. This struc-
ture is composed of the clump envelope material that is tidally
lost when the clump spirals down towards the star. The bottom
row shows a more dramatic encounter when a small clump is
sling-thrown on the star by a massive clump. The falling clump
is indicated by the arrow and is approaching the star almost ra-
dially."

wise."
"bottom rows of Figure 7. Consider first the left column. Clearly,
the in-spiraling clump produces strong perturbations from the
purely Keplerian pattern of rotation, reaching tens of per cent in
some parts of the disk. The clump rotates counterclockwise, in
the same direction as the disk, and shows a characteristic pat-
tern with a positive δvφ lying at larger distances and negative
δvφ at smaller distances with respect to the center of the clump
(≈ 25 au). The trailing spiral arm behind the clump expands out-
wards as the result of angular momentum exchange with the in-
falling clump. The velocity pattern shown in the right column of
Figure 8 carries signatures of a violent close encounter, which
threw the smaller clump towards the star and triggered the burst.
The region between the two clumps is characterized by a promi-
nent inward flow (δvr < 0). The residual azimuthal velocity δvφ
is also negative in this region. The larger and more distant clump
creates a notable expanding wake with positive δvr and δvφ."
"To better quantify a strongly perturbed character of the ve-
locity field in the clump-infall model, we plot the azimuthally
averaged residual velocities in Figure 9. The top and bottom pan-
els correspond to the left and right columns in Figure 8 (or to the
Clump2 and Clump3 bursts). Clearly, the azimuthally averaged
values of δvφ and δvr show a much stronger deviation amplitude
from the purely Keplerian rotation than in the MRI model (see
Fig. 5). Let us first consider the top panel, which corresponds
to the Clump2 burst. The transition from infalling to expand-
ing motion as indicated by the change in the sign of δvr occurs
near the position of the in-spiraling clump, which is being dis-
integrated by tidal torques. The material interior to the clump
flows towards the star causing the burst, while the material be-
hind and further out with respect to the clump position (the spiral
wake in Fig. 7) is pushed outwards. The gravitational exchange"

"of angular momentum between the clump and the spiral wake
creates this velocity pattern. A sharp switch from sub-Keplerian
to super-Keplerian motion is also evident at the position of the
clump. The clump is fast rotating counterclockwise and this is
reflected in the amplitude of the jump. The spiral arm behind the
clump gains angular momentum, accelerates, and expands, con-
tributing to super-Keplerian rotation in the region between 25
and 100 au."
"Let us now consider the bottom panel in Figure 9 corre-
sponding to the Clump3 burst. The azimuthally averaged ve-
locity distribution is notably different and shows a dominant
inward-flowing, sub-Keplerian pattern in the inner 100 au of the
disk. This pattern is caused by the clump that is sling-thrown
toward the star during the close encounter with a more massive
clump located at ≈ 110 au (see panel c in Fig. 7). On the con-
trary, the regions outside 110 au demonstrate a super-Keplerian
expansion as the result of gravitational exchange of angular mo-
mentum between the two clumps during the close encounter. Ve-
locity perturbations at distances beyond 150 au are caused by
other distant clumps that can be seen in Figure 7. Overall, the
clump-infall models are characterized by a peculiar velocity pat-
tern with a much stronger deviation from Keplerian rotation than
the MRI models."

"previous findings. The model and Keplerian disks are both tilted
at 30◦ with respect to the horizontal axis with the upper part be-
ing further out from the observer. The black arrow shows the
position of the clump causing the burst. Clearly, strong pertur-
bations in the gas surface density and velocity field (see Fig. 9)
caused by the clump also lead to strong deviations of the ve-
locity channel maps from the Keplerian ones throughout the en-
tire disk. The kinks in the velocities for the Clump2 burst are
more pronounced compared to those for the MRI1 burst. More-
over, the velocity channels are often discontinuous at the leading
and trailing edges of the spiral arc that is formed behind the in-
spiraling clump, indication strong non-Keplerian motion caused
by rotation-expansion motion of the arc. We conclude that veloc-
ity channel maps can be used to infer strong perturbations caused"
"by the in-spiraling clump. As for the clump itself, the situation is
more complex and depends on the azimuthal angle at which the
system is viewed. The inner regions where the clump is being
tidally disintegrated may also be difficult to resolve. The third
row of Figure 10 zooms in on the clump at different azimuthal
angles, where φ0 is the azimuthal angle of the clump in the top
row. Clearly, at certain disk orientations the velocity channel
maps in the vicinity of the clump are strongly distorted, likely
due to strong internal rotation of the clump. However, there are
orientations at which the distortion is minimal."

"and δvch, respectively) calculated using Equations (19) and (20).
These deviations quantify the degree of distortion of the cor-
responding channel maps in the physical and velocity space
with respect to the channel maps of an idealized Keplerian disk.
The deviations are clearly much stronger than those of the MRI
model (see Fig. 6). For instance, the mismatch between the cen-
ters of the model and Keplerian velocity channels (δφch) can
amount to tens of degrees and the corresponding relative devi-
ation in the line-of-sight velocities (δvch) can be on the order of
tens of percent. The radial profiles of δφch and δvch are distinct
for the upper and lower halves of the disk experiencing a clump-
triggered burst. This is in stark contrast to the corresponding pro-
files in the MRI-burst model, which tend to follow a similar pat-
tern, albeit with notable variations. The distinct character of the
deviations in the upper and lower halves of the disk in the clump-
infall model is the result of strong asymmetry that is typical of
the disk with an in-spiraling clump."
"Finally, we note that strong deviations from the Keplerian ro-
tation pattern are typical not only for the time instances during
the clump-triggered bursts, but also for a gravitationally frag-
mented disk in general. For instance, the characteristic jumps"
"Fig. 12. Similar to Fig. 11 but for the retrograde collision that triggers
the Collision5 burst."
"in the azimutal velocity deviations (δvφ) at the position of the
clumps indicated with the vertical dash-dotted lines in Fig-
ure 9 are also found at the time instances preceding the burst
(t = 4.06 kyr). Distortions in the model channel maps of a frag-
mented disk as compared to the symmetric Keplerian pattern are
also appreciably stronger than what was found for a merely grav-
itationally unstable (but fragmentationally stable) disk. Strong
deviations from the Keplerian rotation in the absence of an obvi-
ous intruder star (see Sect. 3.4) may signalize that the system is
prone to the accretion burst activity."
3.4. Bursts triggered by collisions
"The last type of accretion burst considered in this work is trig-
gered by close encounters of an intruder star with a target disk.
Figures 11 and 12 display the gas surface density and temper-
ature distributions during close encounters that trigger the Col-
lision4 and Collision5 bursts (see the fourth and fifth panels in
Fig. 1). The initial intruder mass is 0.5 M�, which is approxi-
mately equal to the mass of the target star (see Table 1). The in-
truder was set on a collision trajectory at 1500 au from the target
disk, which guarantees a smooth initial start. Two types of colli-
sion are considered: the prograde one (Figure 11) and retrograde"
"Article number, page 11 of 16"

"one (Figure 12). From the calculated eccentricity of target’s tra-
jectory (e > 1) we concluded that the collisions are hyperbolic,
which is a consequence of the chosen initial conditions for the
intruder."
"The first row in both figures shows the time instance when
the intruder approaches the disk. The ambient gas density is too
low so that the intruder is only seen in the temperature distri-
bution through heating of the surrounding medium. The second
row corresponds to the time instance of closest approach be-
tween the target and intruder stars. The periastron distances are
82.4 au (Figure 11) and 75.3 au (Figure 12), while the corre-
sponding velocities of the intruder are 5.21 and 5.43 km s−1. We
experimented with different periastron distances and found that
collisions with rper > 150 au produce weak outbursts hardly ex-
ceeding 30 L�. As the periastron distance increases, the intruder
produces less gravitational perturbation to the disk of the target
star, so that the intruder still dominates in terms of the burst lumi-
nosity of the intruder-target system. For as long as we consider
a disk-penetrating encounter, the majority of the brightening is
therefore due to mass accumulated by the intruder, but we are
interested in the observable kinematic signatures on the target
star’s disk. Collisions with rper <∼ a few ×10 au lead to numeri-
cal instabilities and cannot be completed. Such close encounters
should, however, be quite rare (Forgan & Rice 2010). During the
closest approach the disk is already notably perturbed but the
strongest response is seen in the temperature distribution, which
indicates a strong heating event caused by the burst. The third
row presents the time instance when the intruder starts receding.
At this stage, the disk is strongly perturbed and exhibits char-
acteristic spiral-like tails (see Vorobyov et al. 2020c, for details
on these structures). The intruder is still brighter than the target
in the temperature distribution. Strong shock waves cased by the
intruder passage are also evident in the gas temperature."
"The spatial maps of residual velocities δvφ and δvr at the
peak of the Collision4 and Collision5 bursts are displayed in Fig-
ure 13. We emphasize that all velocities in the collision models
are provided in the local frame of reference of the target star,
which also moves in response to the gravitational force of the
intruder (the simulations are performed in the non-inertial frame
of reference of the target). As can be expected, strong devia-
tions from the Keplerian rotation of the target disk are present. A
certain reflection symmetry is also notable in the residual veloci-
ties of prograde (Collision4) and retrograde (Collision5) models.
This is most clearly seen for δvr but is also evident in the lower
region for δvφ."
"Figure 14 presents the azimuthally averaged residual veloci-
ties δvφ and δvr for the prograde and retrograde collision models
at the peak of the burst. A comparison with the corresponding
Figures 5 and 9 for the MRI and clump-infall bursts reveals that
the collision bursts are characterized by the strongest perturba-
tions to the Keplerian velocity field. The perturbations within
150–200 au can be a factor of several stronger than the Keple-
rian velocity of the target disk. The radial flows are strongest
inside and in the vicinity of the intruder position (see the vertical
dashed lines), while the azimuthal velocity is notably perturbed
at radial distances beyond the intruder position."
"Figure 15 presents the comparison of velocity channel maps
for the Collision4 burst at its luminosity peak (t = 1.595 kyr)
with the channel maps of an idealized Keplerian disk of the tar-
get star. Both disks are inclined by 30◦ with respect to the hor-
izontal axis with the upper part being further out from the ob-
server. This type of the burst is characterized by strongest devi-
ation from Keplerian rotation, as was already noted before. The
kinks in velocities are now located at the disk edges, indicating"

"the expansion and distortion of the target disk in response to the
encounter event. The velocities are also strongly distorted from
the Keplerian pattern in the vicinity of the intruder. The velocity
gradients become much stronger there, which is reflected in the
velocity channel maps becoming narrower near the intruder. The
third row shows the system at different azimuthal angles, where
φ0 is the azimuthal angle of the intruder in the top row. The pic-
ture is qualitatively similar when the system is viewed from dif-
ferent azimuthal angles – the channel maps near the intruder are
extremely narrow and patchy, reflecting a highly perturbed ve-
locity environment."
"Finally, the bottom row in Figure 15 presents the angle and
velocity deviations δφch and δvch calculated using Equations (19)
and (20). The values of δφch and δvch are of a similar magnitude
when compared to those in the clump-infall model (see Fig. 10),
but are much stronger than in the MRI-model (see Fig. 6). Nev-
ertheless, in some velocity channels (the two rows on the left)
the velocity pattern of the target disk is so strongly distorted
that we have difficulty in calculating the corresponding values of
δφch and δvch beyond 50 au. Moreover, the radial profiles of δφch
and δvch have a pattern that is distinct form those of the clump-
infall and MRI-triggered bursts. The pattern is notably asymmet-
ric with respect to the upper and lower halves of the disk only on
the blue-shifted part of the disk where the intruder is located.
The channel maps approach a mirror symmetry on the opposite
side from the intruder (red-shifted velocity channels), although
strong deviations from the Keplerian rotation are still present.
Overall, negative deviations dominate, reflecting the distortion
of the target disk owing to the gravitational pool of the intruder
star during the prograde encounter. We note that strong devia-
tions from the Keplerian rotation linger in the disk of the target"

"for a time period that is longer than the burst duration. However,
the character of these deviations changes with time. In particular,
the mirror symmetry on the opposite side from the intruder dis-
appears. We plan to study in more detail the long-term evolution
of the channel maps in follow-up studies."
4. Model caveats
"In this section, we briefly review several model caveats that are
associated with our study. In the MRI model, the peak α-value in
the disk regions involved in the burst (αmax) is found to affect no-
tably the burst appearance. In the αmax = 1.0 case, the bursts are
the sharpest and strongest, while in the αmax = 0.01 the bursts are
of lower amplitude, longer duration, and lesser frequency. This
is not unexpected, since the α-parameter enters the coefficient of
kinematic viscosity, which in turn determines the characteristic
viscous time of the problem and the burst duration. The value
of α-parameter is found by calculating the Maxwell stress tensor
in numerical simulations of MHD turbulence and varies in wide
limits. While α = 1.0 is a theoretical upper limit and is unlikely
to be reached in real circumstances, values in the 0.01–0.1 limits
are possible (e.g., Yang et al. 2018; Zhu et al. 2020), may depend
on disk conditions and magnetic field strength, and may vary
from burst to burst. Further MHD studies of this phenomenon
are needed to better constrain the value of α if possible."
"In the clump-infall model the burst characteristics may de-
pend on the placement of the inner disk boundary. In the present
study, we set it at 15 au for the clump-infall models to achieve
a high resolution on the log-spaced numerical grid in the r-"
"direction. The smallest inner boundary of 5 au was set in the
clump-infall models of Vorobyov & Basu (2015), which also
showed luminosity bursts. Nevertheless, the physical mecha-
nisms that operate in the innermost regions may alter the light
curve but are unlikely to change the global disk kinematics that
is characteristic of clump-triggered bursts."
"For the cases with clump-infall or collision-triggered bursts,
the systematic analysis of the observed gas velocity profiles re-
mains challenging. When the disk morphology is not axisym-
metric, it may not be possible to measure the inclination of the
disk. Therefore, how to de-project the resolved gas structures in
the line-of-sight dimension is ambiguous. Owing to this uncer-
tainty, it may be difficult to exactly measure how the velocities
of the resolved gas structures are deviated from the Keplerian
rotation curve."
"Finally, the collision-triggered bursts were simulated in a
simplified in-plane geometry and with a parametric rather than
hydrodynamic calculation of accretion rates on the intruder. Ac-
cording to Forgan & Rice (2010), highly inclined collisions do
not produce strong bursts. A moderate inclination may, never-
theless, affect the burst duration, its shape, and kinematic signa-
tures. The chosen parametric method for calculating the mass ac-
cretion rate on the intruder star may also affect our results. This is
a fundamental problem in the grid-based numerical codes, such
as FEOSAD, and we based our choice on previous investigations
of, e.g., Federrath et al. (2010). We did not explore a possibil-
ity that the intruder star may also host a disk. Such a case was
considered in the recent smoothed-particle hydrodynamics sim-
ulations of Cuello et al. (2020) and showed accretion bursts of a
much smaller amplitude (∼ 10−6M� yr−1 during the peak) than
is expected for most FUors."
5. Conclusions
"We compared the accretion and luminosity bursts produced by
three distinct mechanisms: MRI in the innermost disk regions,
infall of clumps formed via disk gravitational fragmentation, and
close encounter with an intruder star. For this purpose, we used
the numerical hydrodynamics code FEOSAD, which computes
the disk formation and dynamics in the thin-disk limit. The MRI
bursts were modelled using the adaptive α-approach based on
the layered disk model (Armitage et al. 2001; Bae et al. 2014;
Kadam et al. 2019), the clump-infall bursts were modelled by
simulating the dynamics of a strongly gravitationally unstable
disk (Vorobyov & Elbakyan 2018), while the collision bursts
were triggered by sending an intruder star of 0.5 M� on a col-
lision trajectory with a protoplanetary disk. We investigated in
detail the gas velocity fields and velocity channel maps for each
burst mechanism. Our conclusions can be summarized as fol-
lows."
"– The considered burst mechanisms operate in circumstel-
lar disks that are characterized by peculiar kinematic features,
which in turn may help to distinguish between different burst ori-
gins. The disks in the collision and clump-infall models are char-
acterized by strong gas velocity deviations from the Keplerian
rotation (reaching tens of per cent for the radial and azimuthal
components), while the disks in the MRI models are character-
ized only by mild deviations (a few per cent) that are mostly
caused by the gravitational instability that fuels the bursts."
"– The velocity channel maps reflect the kinematic perturba-
tions of the disk in each considered burst model. For the MRI
bursts, the velocities are characterized by kinks and wiggles
that are typical for gravitationally unstable disks (Hall et al.
2020). For the clump-infall models, the kinks are stronger and"

"are even discontinuous at the edges of expanding spiral arcs cre-
ated by in-spiraling clumps. For the collision models, the kinks
are strongest and discontinuous near the edges of the target disk.
The channel maps are extremely narrow in the vicinity of the
intruder, thus indication strong velocity gradients and a highly
perturbed velocity environment."
"– The deviations of the model velocity channels from a sym-
metric pattern that is expected for a purely Keplerian disk are
distinct among the considered burst models, which may be help-
ful when distinguishing between the burst mechanisms. In par-
ticular, these deviations are strongest in the clump-infall and col-
lision models and show notable asymmetries with respect to the
upper and lower halves of the disk, while in the MRI model the
deviations are weaker and posses a higher degree of symmetry."
"– Among the three burst mechanisms, the MRI bursts are
less energetic in terms of the peak luminosity during the burst,
although the strength of the collision bursts depends sensitively
on the periastron distance during the closest approach. The burst
amplitudes vary in the ∆m = 2.5 − 3.7 limits, except for the
clump-infall model where ∆m can reach 5.4. We note that a small
considered sample (from a much larger parameter space) and
boundary conditions may affect the derived amplitudes."
"It is worth noting that the disk spatial structures in the consid-
ered models are very different from one another and may provide
important clues for interpreting the disk kinematics. Therefore,
the combination of velocity information and continuum imag-
ing should complement one another and aid in understanding the
burst mechanisms. We warn, however, that continuum imaging"

from that of gas. Numerical simulations that take dust dynam-
ics and growth into account (e.g., Vorobyov et al. 2020a,b) are
needed to better understand the burst mechanisms. Future studies
in this direction should also include the construction of synthetic
velocity channel maps in the emission lines of the disk tracer
species (such as CO isotopologues), as well as a comparative
analysis of the model light curves for different burst-triggering
mechanisms, preferably using similar numerical setups and/or
