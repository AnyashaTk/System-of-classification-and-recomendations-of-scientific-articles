"Intermediate mass planets, from Super-Earth to Neptune-sized bodies, are the most common"
"type of planets in the galaxy 1. The prevailing theory of planet formation, core-accretion 2,"
"predicts significantly fewer intermediate-mass giant planets than observed 3, 4. The compet-"
"ing mechanism for planet formation, disk instability, can produce massive gas giant planets"
"on wide-orbits, such as HR 87995, by direct fragmentation of the protoplanetary disk6. Pre-"
"viously, fragmentation in magnetized protoplanetary disks has only been considered when"
"the magneto-rotational instability is the driving mechanism for magnetic field growth7. Yet,"
"this instability is naturally superseded by the spiral-driven dynamo when more realistic, non-"
"ideal MHD conditions are considered 8, 9. Here we report on MHD simulations of disk frag-"
mentation in the presence of a spiral-driven dynamo. Fragmentation leads to the formation
of long-lived bound protoplanets with masses that are at least one order of magnitude smaller
"than in conventional disk instability models10, 11. These light clumps survive shear and do not"
"grow further due to the shielding effect of the magnetic field, whereby magnetic pressure"
stifles local inflow of matter. The outcome is a population of gaseous-rich planets with in-
"termediate masses, while gas giants are found to be rarer, in qualitative agreement with the"
observed mass distribution of exoplanets.
"We perform 3D MHD simulations with self-gravity, as well as, for comparison, equivalent"
self-gravitating disk simulations without a magnetic field. We model a 0.07M� protoplanetary
disk spanning 5-25 AU around a solar mass (M�) star starting from a quasi-equilibrium state of
"9. Such a disk mass, close to 10% of the mass of the central star, is required for self-gravity"
"to have an important dynamical impact, and is expected to be common in the early stages of"
"disk evolution, being a product of the initial cloud collapse phase 12. We use a novel meshless"
"finite mass scheme13, 14 which is capable of capturing the complex regime of magnetized self-"
"gravitating flows 9, 15 (see Methods). Although fragmentation conditions would be more easily"
"met in a more extended disk, a compact disk model allows to maximize the number of resolution"
"elements per vertical scale height, and to capture correctly MHD effects 15. In order to probe the"
low-mass-end of fragments we use a mass resolution of 2× 10−6MJ in the MHD simulation. The
computational cost of the extremely high resolution prevents the use of radiative transfer. Hence
we adopt a standard parameterized cooling prescription16. The cooling time scale τc is governed
by the dimensionless parameter βc = τcΩ where Ω is the radial dependent Keplerian rotational
"frequency. Our two stage simulations apply βc = 3 to trigger fragmentation16, 17 and βc = 6.28 to"
trace the subsequent evolution of clumps in a gravito-turbulent disk (see Methods). Fast cooling as
"with βc = 3 should occur only in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks, but also mass loading"
due to infall can promote fragmentation if it is fast enough 18. We start the simulation with βc = 3
because we focus on the effect of the magnetic field on fragmentation provided that favourable
conditions hold for fragmentation to take place.
"First of all, we find that βc = 3 is sufficient to trigger fragmentation in the MHD simulations."
The fragmentation simulations were run for 100 yrs (about one outer rotation period). In the MHD
"simulation, four protoplanets (gravitationally bound regions) of 0.01-0.02MJ and five even smaller"
"protoplanets form from condensation of material in the spiral arms (Figure 1, upper left). Two"
"clumps in the equivalent HD simulation, HD-cl1 and HD-cl2 (Extended data figure 1) are formed,"
with protoplanet masses of 0.128MJ and 0.042MJ . The MHD simulation leads to more clumps
"due to the different power spectrum of the density fluctuations relative to the HD simulations,"
"which is skewed to higher order modes with short wavelength 9. The clumps, despite their small"
"masses, begin to stir rotational flow around them locally, and the magnetic fields aligned with the"
spiral arms 8 are curved and amplified by the flow (Figure 1). In this initial phase the magnetic
energy is less than 1% of the gas pressure (plasma beta βp > 100) in the inner region of the clumps
"(Figure 1, upper right). As a result, the collapse of spiral arm and the early growth of protoplanets"
"is hardly affected by the magnetic fields (Figure 2, Time <100 yrs)."
The disk keeps fragmenting in over-dense regions if we keep applying such a fast cool-
"ing. However, this is unrealistic as the dense gas in the dense spiral arms would become rapidly"
"optically thick, which in turn reduces fragmentation and mass accumulation by already existing"
"clumps19, 20. After 100 years, namely after the first orbit on which fragmentation happens, we"
thus both reduce the cooling rate by a factor of two and shut-off cooling above a critical density of

Several gravitationally bound clumps are formed as indicated by the midplane density (in g/cm−3)
in the upper left panel. The upper middle panel zoom in on the clump at 2 o’clock showing the
density field with over-plotted velocity streamlines. The upper right panel shows the ratio between
"gas pressure and magnetic energy, i.e., βp with magnetic fields over-plotted. Lower panels: Same"
as the upper panels but for the disk at t=290 yrs. The zoomed-in lower panels focus on the clump

"10−9g cm−3 to account for the diminishing radiative losses at higher optical depths, as suggested by"
"simulations with radiative transfer (see Methods). We focus on the evolution of low-mass clumps,"
especially on how the strong magnetic fields (βp ∼ 1) around it affect its evolution (Figure 1).
"When we switch βc to 6.28 at t=100 yrs, low-mass fragments are formed. We can follow their"
"long-term evolution in a gravito-turbulent disk, and compare between the HD and MHD simula-"
tions.
"Without continued efficient cooling in the inner region (Extended data figure 2), the light pro-"
toplanets within the HD simulations are quickly disrupted by shear21 (their Figure 5). We verified
that this still occurs even when we increase the resolution by a factor of 4 (see Extended Data Fig-
"ure 3). On the contrary, in the MHD simulations small protoplanets remain gravitationally bound"
"and grow to roughly Neptune mass, The fragments, by perturbing the surrounding flow, trigger the"
"formation of additional even lower mass objects 22 (Figure 2, MHD-cl3). The remarkable differ-"
ence between the HD and MHD runs is caused by the ability of the magnetic field to control the
local flow around the clumps. The lower panels of figure 1 show a snapshot of the MHD evolution
simulation at 290 yrs.
Zoom-in around MHD-cl1 reveals turbulent magnetic fields (Figure 1). In regions interme-
"diately outside of the protoplanet’s Hill sphere, magnetic pressure does not only dominate over the"
gas pressure but it also dominates over the kinetic energy (Extended data figure 4). When clumps
form the fluid settles in rapid rotation around their center. The magnetic field in the clump’s region
"is then amplified efficiently as it twists and folds due to fluid rotation, despite the inclusion of"
Ohmic dissipation (see Methods). Such strong fields near the Hill sphere act to isolate the clump
"from the disk environment. As a result, the material exchange rate across the Hill sphere of a Nep-"
tune mass protoplanet is significantly lower relative to the non-magnetized case (Extended data
figure 5). In order to further investigate the role of MHD turbulence on low-mass clump accre-
"tion, we turned off the MHD module after 400 years (Figure 2), and restarted the simulation. We"
"find that, after only 50 years, all clumps are already ∼10% lighter than their counterparts in the"
"standard MHD simulation, reflecting the missing shielding action of the magnetic field."
The MHD turbulence still allows growth of the very light fragments in the long-term. The
0.5-1 Neptune mass range appears to be a sweet-spot as three out of six protoplanets are within this
"mass range, and the other three clumps have masses of 0.009MJ , 0.018MJ and 0.015MJ at the end"
of the main MHD simulation. This is shown by the mass function in Figure 3. The Neptune-mass
protoplanets arising at distances of 10-20 AU experience chaotic radial migration (Extended data
"figure 6), suggesting that the emerging population of exoplanets is expected to have a wide range"
of distances from the central star.
The exact number of clumps and their final mass could still vary depending the nature of
"the triggering perturbation, such as infall or cooling rate variations (see Methods), and on the de-"
tails of thermodynamics of the local flow near spiral arms. If we allow cooling at all densities
"(unphysical), thus maintaining βc = 6.28 at the clump’s center (all particles) in the main MHD"
"simulation, the protoplanets grow much faster and reach a few tenth of a Jupiter mass in a com-"
"parable simulation time (Figure 2). Yet, the combination of the small initial fragmentation scale"

"the MHD simulation (see Methods, subsection 2). The vertical dashed line separates the fragmen-"
tation simulation with β = 3 and the later evolution with a slower cooling βc = 6.28. The two
protoplanets formed in the HD fragmentation simulation are destroyed quickly after we switch to
"βc = 6.28 and turning off cooling in clump core regions. On the contrary, two light protoplanets,"
"0.018MJ in MHD-cl1 and 0.010MJ in MHD-cl2, in the MHD fragmentation simulation survive"
and grow to 0.035MJ and 0.042MJ at 450 yrs lying in the mass range of 0.5-1 Neptune mass
(shaded green region). One protoplanet (cyan curve) is formed in the dense region in the MHD
fragmentation simulation. When we apply βc = 6.28 to all regions in the MHD evolution simu-
"lation, the protoplanet in MHD-cl1-CoolAll and MHD-cl2-CoolAll grow to 0.42MJ and 0.22MJ"
"after 420 yrs. The wiggles of the red-dashed curve are caused by clump-clump mergers.

and the shielding of low-mass clumps by the magnetic field are unique features of magnetically-
controlled fragmentation that naturally favour the formation of a population of sub-Jovian mass
planets.
"Since Neptune-mass planets are typically heavy-element dominated, in order to explain their"
origin with this new formation path should be accompanied by heavy-element accretion in the
"form of pebbles or planetesimals, and core formation via the settling of the heavy-element material"
towards the center. Core formation might render these relatively light planets further resilient to
"disruption by shear and tidal effects, which, if anything, would act to reduce their mass further11."
"Depending on stochastic local variations in the dynamics of the turbulent flow, a minority of the"
"clumps is observed to grow faster than average, and could become a gas giant (e.g., Figure 2"
MHD-cl2).
The heavy-element mass that can be accreted by the clump at a given radial distance a is
"given by23 dm(a)/dt = πR2capσ(a, t)Ω(a), where Rcap is the capture radius, σ is the surface den-"
sity of solid material and Ω is the clump’s orbital frequency. In this formula the gravitational
enhancement factor is assumed to be unity. The captured mass would depend on the pre-collapse
timescale of the clump and whether it migrates. Accurate simulations of the long-term orbital and
"thermal evolution are clearly required. Nevertheless, if our Neptune-mass clump located at 10.5"
"AU has a pre-collapse timescale of ∼1 Myr, as expected for small objects24, 25, it could accrete at"
least a few M⊕ of heavy elements in the form of planetesimals. If the heavy elements are in the
"form of small dust grains that are coupled to the gas when the clumps are formed, the situation"
Figure 3: The frequency of planets of different masses. The planets are identified in 60 consecutive
snapshots taken between 240-340 yrs and 340-440 yrs of the main MHD simulation. The mass
within one sampling kernel is 0.004MJ . It is clear that the masses of the protoplanets do not
evolve monotonically (Figure 2).
"is somewhat different, although planetesimal accretion could take place at a later time and enrich"
"the planets with heavy elements. In addition, dust grains (sizes of 10cm – 100m) are expected to"
accumulate around spiral arms via dust trapping and lead to an enrichment of the clumps “from
"birth”, where the enrichment was estimated to be about two times stellar26. If most of the heavy"
"elements are in the form of pebbles, they could also be accreted after the clump formation. Pebble"
accretion by small clumps was found to be very efficient and can also be of the order of tens of
"M⊕
27. The exact accreted mass of the heavy elements does not only depend on the sizes of the"
"accreted solids and when they are accreted, but also on the disk’s metallicity and surface density."
"Overall, we suggest that small clumps formed by GI could have a large range of compositions and"
"final masses, which is consistent with the diversity of planets in this mass-range."
We find that in magnetized gravitationally unstable disks the formation of massive gaseous
"planets is less frequent in comparison to intermediate-mass planets, in agreement with the observed"
"exoplanet population. Clearly, the diversity in disks’ masses, compositions, and lifetimes are ex-"
pected to promote a large spread in the inferred planetary properties. Our suggested model does
not require post-formation mechanisms to decrease the mass of fragments such as radiative feed-
"back during collapse28, photoevaporation10 or tidal mass loss6, 11, which depend on quite specific"
"environmental conditions29. In addition, the formation of clumps at early times, along with their"
"dynamical feedback on dust and pebbles, could change the properties of protoplanetary disks and"
"influence the conditions for subsequent planet formation episodes by any mechanism, including"
core-accretion.
The early formation of sub-Jovian mass planets could explain the origin of the dust rings in
"the young protoplanetary disks. For example, the observed rings in IR63 in the Ophiucus molecular"
cloud could be triggered by embedded planets with masses less than half of that of Jupiter30. The
formation of such planets in a disk of age < 5×105 years is unexpected in the standard core-
accretion scenario which typically requires longer formation timescales. In the outer regions of
"the disk, this is also unlikely in the standard disk instability model, as it requires post-formation"
"processes, such as tidal downsizing, that are effective only when the clumps migrate to the inner"
"few AU. Therefore, the direct rapid formation of gaseous sub-Jovian mass planets can change our"
entire view of the process of planet formation.
Methods
Numerical method and initial conditions We simulated gravitationally unstable protoplanetary
"disks using the meshless finite mass (MFM) scheme in the GIZMO code13, 14. We used the HLLD"
"Riemann solver in GIZMO, equivalent to a second order Godunov method, and the Wendland"
"C4 kernel with 200 neighbouring particles. MFM, as a Lagrangian method, demonstrated excel-"
lent conservation property in GI disk simulations 17 and can capture subsonic MHD turbulence in
protoplanetary disks reasonably well 15. The equations we solve are those of compressible self-
gravitating MHD:

"where ρ, U , P , and v are the density, internal energy, gas pressure, and velocity respectively."
Here Φ is the sum of the gravitational potential of the central object and the gravitational potential
"induced by the disk itself, Φs, which satisfies the Poisson equation"
∇2Φs = 4πGρ. (5)
B is the magnetic field and η is the magnetic resistivity which is described by the dimensionless
"parameter Rm = csH/η where cs, H are the sound speed and disk scale height."
"We assume an ideal gas equation of state (EOS),"
"P = (γ − 1)U, (6)"
with γ = 5/3. The ad hoc cooling time scale can be parametrized by the local dynamical time
"scale, βc = τcΩ(r) 16. We performed a two stage simulation using βc = 3 to trigger fragmentation17"
and then switch to a slower cooling with βc = 6.28 to follow fragmentation evolution (Table 1).
"In order to limit the computational burden in preparing the gravito-turbulenct disk model 17,"
we build initial conditions from the saturated gravito-turbulent disks at a cooling rate βc = 6.28
from 9. Both the HD and MHD disk model simulate a solar mass (M�) star with a protoplanetary
disk of 0.07M� spanning from 5-25 au (the surface density is inversely proportional to the helio-
"centric distance). We note that this choice of the disk mass is conservative, as most published disk"
"instability simulations employ disks with masses 0.1 − 0.15M� around solar mass stars, which"
are really at the very high mass end of the observed distribution of disk masses 29. We split the
particles once in the HD gravito-turbulent disk resulting in a mass resolution of ∼ 2 × 10−5MJ
(3.5M particles in total) so that a Neptune mass protoplanet is resolved by ∼ 2500 particles. The
MHD simulation employs ten times more particles to resolve subsonic MHD turbulence9. We used
much more particles than previous MHD simulations of self-gravitating protoplanetary disk of 21.
The low resolution simulation of 21 with simple initial field geometry is hard to interpret due to
potential numerical field growth 15. In order to verify that the markedly different clump evolution
"between the MHD and HD runs is not due to the different resolution, we also performed a test HD"
simulation with four times more particles and found again clump disruption after a similar time as
in the default run (Extended data figure 3). This confirms that is the action of the magnetic field
"to induce a diverging evolution between HD and MHD runs. As a final remark, we note that for"
disks with higher masses as often used in disk instability simulations one expects some clumps to
"survive even without magnetic field. However, these clumps are very massive, ranging from a few"
"times Jupiter’s mass to masses of brown dwarfs 20, 28, 29, unless additional mass-loss mechanisms"
"are invoked6, 11. Future MHD simulations should explore the mass function of clumps in disks of"
"various masses, including disks more massive than those considered here."
The ionization rate and thus the strength of non-ideal MHD effects are highly uncertain 31. As
"the first attempt, we apply Rm = 20 throughout the disk because full non-ideal MHD with coupled"
"ionization chemistry is still challenging even for non-self-gravitating disk 32. Nevertheless, we"
note that the large scale dynamo in gravito-turbulent disk thrives at low Rm in contrast to MRI
"dynamo 8. In the meantime, the fields are amplified by the local circulation near the Hill sphere"
"(Fig. 1) on a time scale tamp = 1/ΩH , where ΩH is the rotational angular speed around the clump"
center. The fields near the Hill sphere can diffuse across one disk scale height (comparable to the
"Hill radius) in tdiff = H2/η = Rm/Ω, where Ω is the orbital angular speed around the star. In"
"our models, tamp = tdiff/(
√"
3Rm) ∼ 0.03tdiff so the fields are amplified faster than they can be
"dissipated near the Hill sphere, hence their action remains effective in isolating the clump from"
the surrounding disk flow. The initial gravito-turbulent ideal-MHD disk model drawn from 9 is
"relaxed with Ohmic dissipation switched on (Rm = 20, βc = 6.28) for 100 years reaching a quasi-"
equilibrium state which serves as the initial condition for run MHD in Table 1. We note that the
MHD simulation has zero net flux.
"Thermodynamics of simulations To trigger fragmentation of the gravito-turbulent disks, we re-"
"duce βc to 3 16, 17. We note that this is just a convenient way to achieve the desired fragmentation"
"conditions, but in the real astrophysical context there are additional phenomena that could bring to"
"the same outcome. Indeed, infall of gas from the molecular cloud envelope can also decrease the"
"Toomre Q parameter rapidly and lead to fragmentation, as shown in previous simulations 18, 33. In"
"our case an infall rate of 1 × 10−4M�/yr, expected in the early stages of disk evolution12, would"
induce a sudden drop of the Toomre parameter on a timescale as small as the cooling timescale
obtained by decreasing βc from 6.28 (initial equilibrium) to 3. The fast cooling leads to collapse
of spiral arms (Fig. 1). We refer to over dense regions within which gravitationally bound region
forms as clumps. We identify gravitationally bound regions (protoplanets) using the friend-of-
"friend group finder SKID 34, 35. In general, the HD simulation gives rise to fewer clumps than the"
MHD simulation because of more prominent spiral arms with smaller azimuthal wavenumber9.

"By switching βc back to 6.28 at t=100 yrs, we account for the suppression of radiative losses"
owing to the increasing optical depth in the dense regions of the spiral arms where clumps form.
"While the optical depth will vary across the disk, and especially between the spirals and the inter-"
"arm regions, our simple choice produces a temperature structure at fragmentation sites that is"
consistent with the results of simulations including radiative transfer with the flux-limited diffusion
"approximation, the current state-of-the-art in the field. We refer, in particular, to the high-resolution"
"HD disk instability simulations in 20, which used a disk with a similar mass and density profile."
"From a clump’s center outward the temperature varies typically from 200 K to 20 K in our runs,"
which is very similar to the temperature profile shown in Fig.6 of the latter paper in the case
"of the flux-limited diffusion run. On the numerical side, we also note that, if we keep βc = 3,"
"fragmentation continues throughout the disk at a fast pace, yet forming clumps with similar initial"
"masses. However, in the meantime the earliest forming clumps contract significantly, thus reducing"
"the minimum time-step size and bringing the numerical integration to a bottleneck, a problem that"
"is avoided by raising βc to 6.28. Further clump formation is suppressed after we increase βc, yet at"
this point we already have enough low mass protoplanet seeds for which to track the subsequent
evolution. We tested that if increase βc to 6.28 after 200 years instead of after 100 years the main
"result does not change, namely the MHD runs still have a dominant population of long-lasting low"
"mass clumps by about 400 years, albeit in this case there are also some clumps approaching the"
mass of Jupiter due to higher accretion rates during the initial phase with rapid cooling.
In the default HD and MHD simulations we also deliberately turn off cooling in the interior
of clumps (Extended data figure 2) where the density is above 10−9g/cm3 (such high density is
never reached in spiral density waves) to account for high opacity and slow cooling in these re-
gions 36. We checked indeed that the photon diffusion timescale from the clump interior to the Hill
radius of the clump would be longer than the local dynamical time. Assuming the chosen density
"threshold ρ0 = 10−9g/cm3, a typical dust opacity value κ = 1 cm2/g, and l = 0.1 AU for the path"
"length from the clump center to its Hill radius, the photon diffusion timescale is tdiff = ρ0κl/c,"
"where c is the speed of light, and must be further augmented by the ratio between thermal gas"
"pressure and radiation pressure (∼ 106, see 19, 36). This is much longer than the free-fall time of"
"the clump, also estimated at the same threshold density, tff ∼ 1/
√"
"(Gρ), which is the timescale"
"over which a clump will contract and heat-up by PdV work. While the latter is a simple estimate,"
"essentially treating clump collapse as an adiabatic process, we stress that incorporating radiative"
transfer 19 into our MHD simulation would be computationally daunting as the current calculations
already required 2 million CPU hours each on nearly a thousand cores on the Cray XC40/XC50
"“PizDaint” of the Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS), the fastest European supercom-"
"puter. Furthermore, purely hydrodynamical fragmentation simulations adopting a similar cooling"
shut-off threshold have obtained results qualitatively similar to radiative transfer simulations once
clumps have formed 29.
"Since the photon diffusion timescale argument reported above is still simplified, neglecting"
for example the possibility that radiation might propagate anisotropically and still manage to leak
"out rapidly of a medium with average high optical depth, we also carried out MHD simulation"
"without turning off cooling in the clump core region, i.e., keeping βc = 6.28 for all particles"
"(Table 1, MHD-CoolAll). The comparison MHD simulation inevitably leads to higher peak central"
density in the clumps than that in our main simulation. To avoid the code to crash due to the
extreme dynamic range arising in this case we merge equal mass particles whose smoothing length
becomes smaller than a minimum gravitational softening of 0.01 au (correspond to > 5 × 10−8
g/cm3 regions in the very center of massive clumps. This particle merging approach results in a
particles mass ceiling with the maximum particle mass forced to be 64 times the minimum particle
mass. We observe no artificial effects at the boundary of different mass particles13. It helps to
avoid introducing a sink particle 37 which artificially remove the pressure support from the clump
"center, potentially leading to unphysical accretion 38."

Extended data figure 1: The disk’s midplane density of the HD fragmentation simulation at 100
"yrs. Two clumps at 4 and 6 o’clock are formed with masses of 0.128MJ and 0.042MJ , respectively."
The over-dense region near 8 o’clock is not gravitationally bound.

Extended data figure 2: Density profiles around two roughly Neptune-mass protoplanets (∼
0.04MJ ) in GI-HD clump (HD-cl2 at 100 yrs) and GI-MHD clump (MHD-cl1 at 290 yrs). The
cooling time-scale beyond 10−9g/cm−3 region is longer than 50 local orbits. This justifies turning
"off cooling in the clump’s core region (see Methods subsection 2). However, we note that only"
regions with a typical density above ∼ 10−8g/cm−3 are gravitationally bound.
Extended data figure 3: The disk’s density maps in the resolution test of the HD simulation
summarized in Table 1. We employed four times more particles in the test than the HD simulation
"of Table 1. Also in this case, all the clumps are disrupted after 400 years."
Extended data figure 4: The magnetic energy to kinetic energy ratio in the co-moving frame of
MHD-cl1 at 290 yrs (see also the lower panels of Fig. 1). The dashed circle indicates the Hill
"radius of the protoplanet in MHD-cl1, 0.3 au. The magnetic energy dominates the kinetic energy"
"outside the Hill sphere, thus controlling the dynamics of the flow."

Extended data figure 5: The refilling rate of material within the Hill sphere of a Neptune-mass
"protoplanet. The refilling rate is defined as the new mass, as a fraction of the total, that enters the"
Hill sphere of the protoplanet every year. The calculation is performed for HD-cl2 (100-170 yrs)
and MHD-cl1 (200-440 yrs) (see Figure 2) using snapshots taken every 3 yrs. The spikes of the
yellow curve are caused by encounters with spiral density waves.

Extended data figure 6: Clump migration. The heliocentric distance of the clumps/protoplanets
(see figure 2) suggests both inwards and outwards migration can happen due to gravito-turbulence.
