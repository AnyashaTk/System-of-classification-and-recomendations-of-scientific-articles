ABSTRACT
"The majority of massive stars (> 8 M�) in OB associations are found in close binary systems. Nonetheless, the formation mechanism
of these close massive binaries is not understood yet. Using literature data, we measured the radial-velocity dispersion (σ1D) as a
proxy for the close binary fraction in ten OB associations in the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud, spanning an age range from
1 to 6 Myrs. We find a positive trend of this dispersion with the cluster’s age, which is consistent with binary hardening. Assuming
a universal binary fraction of fbin= 0.7, we converted the σ1D behavior to an evolution of the minimum orbital period Pcutoff from
∼9.5 years at 1 Myr to ∼1.4 days for the oldest clusters in our sample at ∼6 Myr. Our results suggest that binaries are formed at larger
separations, and they harden in around 1 to 2 Myrs to produce the period distribution observed in few million year-old OB binaries.
Such an inward migration may either be driven by an interaction with a remnant accretion disk or with other young stellar objects
present in the system. Our findings constitute the first empirical evidence in favor of migration as a scenario for the formation of
massive close binaries."

1. Introduction
"It is well established that the vast majority of massive stars
(M > 8 M�) come in pairs or as higher-order multiples (e.g., Ma-
son et al. 2009; Chini et al. 2012; Peter et al. 2012; Kiminki &
Kobulnicky 2012; Kobulnicky et al. 2014; Sana et al. 2014; Dun-
stall et al. 2015). A large fraction of these binaries have orbital
periods on the order of 2 months or shorter (Sana & Evans 2011;
Sana et al. 2012; Kiminki & Kobulnicky 2012; Almeida et al.
2017; Barbá et al. 2017). These binaries are efficiently detected
with spectroscopic techniques measuring periodic Doppler shifts
of the photospheric lines. Massive binaries produce a variety of
exotic products later in their evolution such as X-ray binaries,
rare types of supernovae (Ibc, IIn, super-luminous SNe, Whe-
lan & Iben 1973; Yoon et al. 2010; Langer 2012), gamma-ray
bursts (Woosley et al. 1993; Cantiello et al. 2007), and, eventu-
ally, gravitational wave sources (e.g., Ivanova et al. 2013; Man-
del & de Mink 2016; de Mink & Mandel 2016; Eldridge &
Stanway 2016). However, the origin of massive close binaries
remains unknown."
"The first effort to characterize the binarity properties of a
sample of O stars in compact H ii regions was performed by Apai
et al. (2007). They did a multi-epoch (two to three epochs) radial
velocity (RV) study of a sample of 16 embedded O stars in seven
massive star-forming regions. They identified two close binary
stars based on their RV variations (∼ 90 km s−1) and measured"
"an RV dispersion (σ1D) of 35 km s−1 for the whole sample and
25 km s−1 when excluding the two close binaries."
"After pioneering studies to spectroscopically characterize
single massive young stellar objects (mYSOs) such as those car-
ried out by Bik et al. (2006, 2012), Ochsendorf et al. (2011),
and Ellerbroek et al. (2013), Ramírez-Tannus et al. (2017) per-
formed a single-epoch VLT/X-shooter spectroscopic study of
a sample of eleven candidate mYSOs in the very young gi-
ant H ii region M17 (. 1 Myr). The stars range in mass from
6 − 25 M� which is the mass range that dominates the samples
from which multiplicity characteristics of 2-4 Myr old main-
sequence OB stars are derived (Sana et al. 2012; Kobulnicky
et al. 2014). The measured radial-velocity dispersion of these
mYSOs is σ1D = 5.6 ± 0.2 km s−1. In low density clusters, such
as M17, σ1D of a single epoch is strongly dominated by the or-
bital properties of the binary population. For example, if a given
cluster has several close binaries of similar masses, one would
expect the individual radial velocities of the stars to differ sig-
nificantly from each other and, therefore, for σ1D to be large.
For 2-4 Myr clusters, with binary fractions > 0.5 and minimum
periods of ∼ 1.4 days, a dispersion of 30 to 50 km s−1 is typi-
cal (e.g., Kouwenhoven et al. 2007; Sana et al. 2008, 2012; Sota
et al. 2014; Kobulnicky et al. 2014). The latter is in stark contrast
with our observation of M17, suggesting a lack of close massive
binaries in this region."

"In Sana et al. (2017), two scenarios are explored that may ex-
plain the low σ1D observed in M17: a small binary fraction fbin
and/or a lack of short-period binaries. They conclude that the
observed dispersion can be explained either if fbin = 0.12+0.16−0.09 or
if the minimum orbital period Pcutoff > 9 months. Parent popu-
lations with fbin > 0.42 or Pcutoff < 47 days can be rejected at
the 95% significance level. Since it is unlikely that the binary
fraction for M17 would be so far below that of other clusters,
this very interesting result suggests that massive binaries form
in wide orbits that migrate inward over the course of a few mil-
lion years. In this letter, we refer to the generic mechanism of
shrinking binary periods as the migration scenario. One strong
test for this scenario is to compare the velocity dispersion ob-
served in clusters spanning a range of ages. If the binary orbits
harden with time, one would expectσ1D to increase as the cluster
age increases."
"In Ramírez-Tannus et al. (2020), VLT/KMOS spectra of
around 200 stars in three very young clusters (M8, NGC 6357,
and G333.6-0.2) were obtained. Introducing an automatic
method to classify the spectra, the effective temperatures, and
luminosities of the observed stars were characterized in order
to place them in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). The
age and mass range of the observed populations was constrained
by comparison to MESA evolutionary tracks obtained from the
MIST project (Paxton et al. 2011, 2013, 2015; Dotter 2016; Choi
et al. 2016). The main sequence stars in M8 have masses be-
tween ∼ 5 and ∼ 70 M� and the age of this cluster is between 1
and 3 Myr. In G333.6-0.2, the main sequence population ranges
in mass between ∼ 5 and ∼ 35 M� and the estimated age of this
region is < 3 Myr. The main sequence stars in NGC 6357 have
masses between ∼ 10 and ∼ 100 M� and their ages range from
0.5 − 3 Myr."
"The goal of this paper is to provide a first test of the migration
scenario for the formation of massive close binaries. We aim to
study a possible age evolution of σ1D, and Pcutoff , to constrain a
timescale for binary hardening assuming a universal binary frac-
tion ( fbin= 0.7; Sana et al. 2012). We base our analysis on clus-
ters younger than 6 Myr to ensure that neither secular evolution
nor the effect of binary interactions (Wellstein & Langer 1999;
de Mink et al. 2007) affect our results significantly. In Section 2
we measure the radial velocities of the high-mass stars in M8
and NGC 6357 and calculate their σ1D. Next, we compare our
findings with those presented by Sana et al. (2012) for Galac-
tic clusters of 2-4 Myr, with those from Zeidler et al. (2018)
for Westerlund 2 (Wd2), with those from Hénault-Brunet et al.
(2012) for R136 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and with those
from Ramírez-Tannus et al. (2017) for the very young massive-
star forming region M17. This reveals a temporal behavior of
σ1D (Section 3) that is converted into an evolution of the mini-
mum binary period (Section 4), as binary motion is dominating
the velocity dispersion of young massive clusters. In Section 5
we discuss and conclude this work."
2. Observations
"The sample studied in this paper consists of the OB stars in M8
and NGC 6357. The data acquisition and reduction are described
in detail in Ramírez-Tannus et al. (2020). In short, we obtained
around 200 H and K-band intermediate resolution spectra (with
spectral resolution power, λ/∆λ, between 6700 and 8500, i.e.,
30 < ∆v < 40 km s−1) of stars in the abovementioned giant H ii
regions with VLT/KMOS (Sharples et al. 2013). The final sam-
ples of massive stars consist of 16 stars in M8, 22 in NGC 6357,
and four in G333.6-0.2. We discarded G333.6-0.2 from our anal-"
"ysis because there are not enough stars with RV measurements
to calculate σ1D. A description of the age and mass range de-
termination can be found in Ramírez-Tannus et al. (2020), and
Appendix A presents a detailed discussion about the accuracy of
the age determination."
"The radial velocity (RV) of the intermediate to high-mass
stars was obtained by measuring the Doppler shifts of a suitable
set of photospheric lines. Tables B.1 and B.2 list the RV obtained
for each star together with its error and the spectral lines used in
our analysis."
"The RV-fitting approach is similar to the one adopted by Sana
et al. (2017). First, for the profile fitting, we adopted Gaussian
profiles. Second, we clipped the core of diagnostic lines that
were still contaminated by residuals of the nebular emission.
Third, we simultaneously fit all spectral lines available, thereby
assuming that the Doppler shift is the same for all lines (see Sec-
tion 2 and Appendix B of Sana et al. 2013)."
"Figure C.1 shows the radial-velocity distribution for the two
regions. We calculated the errors of the histogram bins by ran-
domly drawing RV values from a Gaussian centered at each mea-
sured RV and with a sigma corresponding to the measurement
error; we repeated that process 105 times. The value shown for
each bin is the mean of all the RVs in that bin’s measurements
and the error bar corresponds to the standard deviation. We ob-
tained σ1D by calculating the weighted standard deviation of
the measured RVs. The weighted mean and standard deviation
are listed in the top-left corner of each histogram in Fig. C.1.
The measured σ1D for M8 and NGC 6357 are 32.7 ± 2.6 and
26.9 ± 1.3 km s−1, respectively."
3. Velocity dispersion versus cluster age
"Based on single-epoch radial-velocity measurements of young
massive stars in M17, Sana et al. (2017) conclude that this young
(∼1 Myr) star-forming region hosts only a few close binary sys-
tems. This is in contrast to the observation that most massive
stars in somewhat older clusters are in close binaries. Under the
hypothesis that massive stars form in wide binary systems that
harden their orbits within the first million years of evolution, one
would expect that during those initial couple of million years the
radial-velocity dispersion, σ1D, increases with time."
"We plotted σ1D of the clusters studied in this paper and
compare it with the results by Sana et al. (2012, NGC 6231,
IC 2944, IC 1805, IC 1848, NGC 6611), Zeidler et al. (2018,
Wd2), Hénault-Brunet et al. (2012, R136), and Sana et al. (2017,
M17). R136 and Wd2 are very relevant for our study given their
relatively young age (1-2 Myr) which is in between the age
measured for M17 (Ramírez-Tannus et al. 2017) and that of the
somewhat older clusters (Sana et al. 2012). In order to compare
the multi-epoch RV data provided by Sana et al. (2012) with the
single epoch data of M17, M8, NGC 6357, and Wd2, we drew
the RV measured for each star in a given cluster in a random
epoch and we computed the RV dispersion. We repeated this pro-
cedure 105 times and then calculated the most probable σ1D and
its standard deviation. The σ1D obtained for each cluster is listed
in the third column of Table 1. The second and seventh columns
show the age of the clusters and the respective references."
"In Figure 1 we show σ1D versus age of the clusters. We
performed an orthogonal distance regression (ODR; Churchwell
1990) to the data and find a positive correlation between the age
of the clusters and σ1D. The solid black line represents the best
fit to the data and the gray area represents the 1-σ error on the
fit. The Pearson coefficient for the observed relation is 0.7, which"

"Even though the scatter is substantial, we conclude that for
the present data there is a positive correlation between σ1D and
the age of the clusters. Although the number of clusters consid-
ered here remains limited and there are sizable uncertainties as
to the individual age determinations, our results indicate an in-
crease in the fraction of close binary systems as the clusters get
older. M17 seems to be a unique cluster given its very young age
and extremely low σ1D. Trumpler 14 in this sense seems compa-
rable, being ∼1 Myr old and having no evidence for close bina-
ries amongst its O stars (Sana & Evans 2011). We do not include
this cluster in the analysis because there are not enough stars
with RV measurements to calculate σ1D."
4. Physical parameters
"Our aim is to characterize the multiplicity properties of observed
clusters based on the observed σ1D. This section presents the re-
sults of Monte Carlo population syntheses computed with differ-
ent underlying multiplicity properties."
4.1. Binary fraction and minimum period
"We focus on the effect that the binary fraction, fbin, and minimum
orbital period, Pcutoff , have on the observed σ1D. The methodol-
ogy is similar to that used in Sana et al. (2017). A parent pop-
ulation of stars is generated with a certain fbin and Pcutoff . The
binary star systems in this population are described by their or-
bital properties. These are the primary mass, M1, mass ratio, q,
period, P, and eccentricity, e. For the multiplicity properties that
we do not vary, we adopt the values from Sana et al. (2012) for
Galactic young clusters as the basic properties for our popula-
tion. For the primary star, we adopt a Kroupa mass distribu-
tion (Kroupa 2001). The mass ratio distribution is uniform with
0.1 < q < 1. The probability density function of the period is
described as pdf(P) ∝ (log P)−0.5, with the period in days and
log Pcutoff < log P < 3.5. The eccentricity distribution depends
on the period of the binary system. For P < 4 days, we assume
circular orbits; for periods between 4 and 6 days, the eccentric-"

"ities are sampled from pdf(e) ∝ e−0.5, with 0 ≤ e < 0.5; for pe-
riods longer than 6 days the same distribution is used, but with
0 ≤ e < 0.9."
"In order to calculate the radial velocity of the binary star sys-
tems, they are given a randomly generated inclination, i, lon-
gitude of periastron, ω, and eccentric anomaly, E. The latter is
determined by generating a random mean anomaly and numeri-
cally solving Kepler’s equation to find the corresponding eccen-
tric anomaly using Brent’s method (Brent 1973)1. This gives all
of the information required to calculate the binary component of
the radial velocity of the primary star through"

"with K1 being the amplitude of the orbital velocity of the pri-
mary star. The binary component of the radial velocity is added
to the velocity due to cluster dynamics, σdyn. This results in a
population of stars with radial velocities based on either cluster
dynamics only (in the case of fbin=0) or both cluster dynam-
ics and binary orbits. The secondary stars are assumed to be
undetected. We adopt a cluster velocity dispersion for all clus-
ters of 2 km s−1, which corresponds to the typical value found
by Kuhn et al. (2019) who measured σdyn for several massive
clusters in the Milky Way. Adopting σdyn = 1 or σdyn= 5 km s−1
has no significant effect on our results. Sana et al. (2012) also
conclude that the dynamical dispersion of young clusters is neg-
ligible with respect to the dispersion due to binary motions. Each
Monte Carlo run consists of a generated parent population of 105
stars, which is sampled 105 times to simulate the observation of
a cluster. The mass distribution of the stars in the parent distribu-
tion are matched to the mass distribution in the observed cluster.
The samples contain the same number of stars and measurement
accuracy as the observed sample. We then constructed density
distributions of σ1D for each parent population. Each grid point
in Figure 3 shows the median σ1D obtained for a simulated clus-
ter of 20 stars sampled from a parent population with masses
between 15 and 60 M�, where we varied fbin, and Pcutoff . The
color bar corresponds to σ1D in km s−1. The dashed lines show
the σ1D contours for 5.5, 15, 25.3, 30.9, 50.3, and 66 km s−1,
which correspond to the σ1D measured for our clusters. As the
number of stars and the mass ranges are different for each clus-
ter, the contours do not represent the exact way in which we
measured Pcutoff but are meant to show examples of the trends
that a certain σ1D follows in this diagram. A comparison of our
results with Sana et al. (2017) is shown in Appendix D."
4.2. Timescale of binary hardening
"Assuming that the binary fraction of massive stars is consistent
with that observed in OB stars in young open clusters ( fbin = 0.7;
Sana et al. 2012), but that binary stars are born in wider orbits,
we can estimate Pcutoff which best represents the observed σ1D
for each cluster. For each cluster, we kept the distribution of or-
bital properties fixed and we adjusted the sample size and mass
ranges in accordance to those of the observed samples (see Ta-
ble 1). This allowed us to make a similar plot as in Figure 1 but
in terms of Pcutoff . Figure 4 shows the estimated Pcutoff for each
cluster as a function of cluster age. We determined that, assum-
ing fbin = 0.7, the most likely Pcutoff to explain the observed σ1D

generated/scipy.optimize.brentq.html"
"Fig. 3. Median σ1D obtained for distributions with different combina-
tions of fbin and Pcutoff . For this set of simulations, we used a sample
of 20 stars ranging in masses from 15 to 60 M�. The contours show
the trends followed by σ1D values of 5.5, 15, 25.3, 30.9, 50.3, and 66
km s−1."
"of M17 is around 3500 days and that a Pcutoff of 665 days and
126 days can be rejected at the 68% and 95% confidence levels,
respectively. For the clusters with the largest σ1D in our sample,
IC 1805, IC 1848, and NGC 6231, the cutoff period that best ex-
plains the observed σ1D is 1.4 days, which is the Pcutoff adopted
by Sana et al. (2012)."
"In order to get a first estimate of the binary hardening
timescale, we fit a function of the form P(t) = P0e−t/t0 + c to the
data in Figure 4, where P0 is the minimum period at the moment
of binary formation and t0 corresponds to the e-folding time. As
P0 is very uncertain, we assumed a typical value of 105 days,
corresponding to an initial separation of ∼100 AU for a pair of
10 M� stars. In order to find the range of t0, we varied P0 from
104 to 106 days . The resulting fit and corresponding parame-
ter ranges are shown with the blue line and shaded area in Fig-
ure 4. We obtain a typical e-folding time of t0 = 0.19+0.06−0.04 Myr.
To harden an orbit from 3500 to 1.4 days, ∼8 e-foldings are
needed, this implies that a typical binary hardening timescale
is ∼1.6 Myr. Assuming a binary system with two 10 M� stars,
this would imply a mean hardening rate of ∼ 7.5 AU yr−1. For
M17, we discarded periods lower than 665 d with a 68% con-
fidence level. Following the same argument as before, the typi-
cal timescale to harden an orbit from 665 to 1.4 days would be
∼1 Myr equivalent to a mean hardening rate of ∼ 4 AU yr−1."
5. Discussion and conclusions
"In this paper we present observational evidence that the 1D ve-
locity dispersion of massive stars in young clusters (σ1D) in-
creases as they get older (Figure 1). Additionally, we performed
Monte Carlo simulations which allowed us to convert the mea-
sured values of σ1D to physical parameters. Assuming that stars
are born with the binary fraction representative of OB stars in
2 − 4 Myr clusters ( fbin=0.7), we calculated the cutoff period
that would correspond to each of the observed populations. From
Figure 4 we can conclude that the orbits would harden in 1-"

the qualitative results of this paper remain the same."
"Sana et al. (2017) propose that the inward migration process
could be driven either by the interaction with the remnants of an
accretion disk or with other young stellar objects. The hardening
of the orbits would then stop either when the disk is destroyed,

to be transferred for the binary to harden from 3500 (665) to 1.4
days. Rose et al. (2019) explored the possibility of the orbit hard-
ening via the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism, where a
third companion perturbs the orbit of a binary system. They find
that, beginning with a cutoff period of 9 months the EKL mech-
anism is insufficient to reproduce the population of short period
binaries observed by Sana et al. (2012). They suggest that type
II migration (Lin & Papaloizou 1986) might explain the tighten-
ing of binaries in such a time period. Moe & Kratter (2018) find
that the main mechanism to harden binaries should be the dy-
namical disruption of coplanar triples that initially fragmented
in the disk in combination with energy dissipation within this
disk. Other mechanisms include the combination of EKL oscil-
lations with tidal friction both during the pre-main sequence and
the main sequence (Bate et al. 2002; Bate 2009). Given the densi-
ties of the clusters studied, stellar encounters are uncommon and,
therefore, mechanisms such as binary-binary or single-binary in-
teractions should not play a significant role in the formation of
close binaries (Fujii & Portegies Zwart 2011)."
"Our findings affect predictions of binary population synthe-
sis models that follow the evolution of an ensemble of binary
systems subject to, among others, a distribution function for the
zero-age orbital periods. Such models (e.g., Sana et al. 2012;
Schneider et al. 2015) predict that a small fraction of systems in-
teract within a timescale of 3 Myr, almost invariably resulting in
a merging of the two components thus creating a blue straggler."
"Specifically, Schneider et al. (2015) report that of the popula-
tion within two magnitudes in brightness of the main-sequence
turnoff, only 1%, 2%, and 10% is a blue straggler after 1, 2, or 3
Myr. Therefore, unless one is specifically interested in early blue
straggler formation, the temporal evolution of orbital properties
in the first few million years reported here should not affect pre-
dictions made by binary population synthesis models that rely
on initial conditions defined at the zero-age main sequence only.
Except for the caveat mentioned, adopting initial conditions for
the massive star population as reported on by Sana et al. (2012),
for example, remains a justified approach.

Appendix A: Accuracy of the age determination
"The effective temperature and bolometric correction of the lumi-
nosity class V stars are taken from Pecaut & Mamajek (2013);
for the luminosity class III stars, we used the calibrations from
Alonso et al. (1999) for spectral types F0-F9, and for G4-M5
stars we used the calibration of Cox (2000). In order to calcu-
late the luminosity of the observed targets, we used the absolute
K-band magnitude assuming the Indebetouw et al. (2005) ex-
tinction law to derive the K-band extinction AK . We then ob-
tained the absolute magnitudes by scaling the apparent mag-
nitudes to the distance of the clusters (1336+68"
"−76 pc for M8 and
1770+140"
"−120 pc for NGC 6357; Kuhn et al. 2019). The luminosi-
ties were obtained by using the bolometric correction and the
absolute magnitudes. Finally, we determined the age of the re-
gions by comparing the position of the observed stars to MESA
isochrones obtained from the MIST project (Paxton et al. 2011,
2013, 2015; Dotter 2016; Choi et al. 2016). The isochrones
and tracks used have a solar metallicity and an initial rotational
velocity of vini = 0.4 vcrit, the age obtained using tracks with
vini = 0 are within the reported error bars."
"Here we discuss some of the issues that might affect the age
determination and compare our age estimates with those pub-
lished in the literature. i) Binarity could affect the luminosity
determination by making stars look brighter than they actually
are. Given the spacing of the isochrones at the young age of M8
and NGC 6357, this does not have a significant effect on our age
determination. ii) The use of different evolutionary tracks could
lead to different age estimates; for example, Martins & Palacios
(2013) show that the main-sequence age for different models
could vary by ∼ 0.7 Myr for a 20 M� isochrone. In our case, this
uncertainty is likely smaller than that caused by the uncertainty
on the spectral type. iii) The age determination may depend on
the adopted extinction law. By using the Nishiyama et al. (2009)"
"extinction law, we obtain lower AK values and, therefore, slightly
fainter objects. Nevertheless, given that the extinction in these
three regions is relatively modest (AK,max ∼ 2.5), the difference
in luminosity produced by the various extinction laws does not
significantly affect the age determination. iv) The classification
of the earliest spectral type (O3) is normally degenerate (see e.g.,
Wu et al. 2014, 2016). In the case of NGC 6357, the most mas-
sive star is of spectral type O3.5. The fact that its spectral type
is uncertain could affect the lower age limit. To avoid this, we
determined the age based on the whole population, including the
low-mass PMS stars, instead of focusing only on the massive
stars."
"Arias et al. (2007) estimated the age of M8 to be < 3 Myr
based on the low-to-intermediate mass PMS population and
Feigelson et al. (2013) estimated the age of the pre-main se-
quence stars in M8 between ∼ 0.8 − 2.5 Myr, which is in
agreement with our estimate – including the massive stars – of
1 − 3 Myr. Massi et al. (2015) determined the age of NGC 6357
at 1 − 3 Myr based on the visual and NIR color-magnitude and
color-color diagrams. By comparing the whole population of
stars with MIST isochrones, we estimate an age of 0.5 to 3 Myr
for this cluster."
"We find that the age obtained for the studied regions by look-
ing only at the massive stars is consistent with the age obtained
only from the low-mass PMS stars. If the late-K and M-type stars
near the Hayashi track were cluster members, we would obtain a
younger age (∼ 0.1−1 Myr younger) for the PMS stars compared
to that of the massive stars only."

"We compare the σ1D distribution obtained with the distribution
presented in Sana et al. (2017). Therefore, we sampled clus-
ters of 12 stars with Pcutoff= 1.4 days and fbin= 0.7 and the"
"radial velocity measurement errors of M17. This results in a
σ1D= 40.9+18.9−16.1 km s"
"−1 for the method described above. Sana
et al. (2017) found a lower value of σ1D= 35.0+21.9−14.9 km s"
"−1. The
confidence intervals of the two values overlap due to the width
of the distribution."
"We assessed the correctness of our method by generating
a parent population using numerically calculated two body or-
bits. The binary star systems were generated in a similar way as
described above. Each system is described by a primary mass,
mass ratio, period, and eccentricity using identical distributions
as before. The orbits of the binaries were simulated in a two di-
mensional plane. Only a single orbit starting at periastron was
simulated numerically using a fourth order Runge-Kutta method
(Dormand & Prince 1980). The systems were tested on their sta-
bility by integrating for a large number of orbits. The velocity
was obtained by selecting a random time step from the orbit. The
two dimensional x and y velocities were converted to a radial ve-
locity using a randomly generated inclination and longitude of
periastron. Finally, the effect of cluster dynamics was added to
the radial velocity."
"The radial velocities calculated from the numerical two body
orbits were combined with the radial velocities of single stars to
generate a new parent population of 105 stars. This parent popu-
lation can be sampled as described above to generate a σ1D dis-
tribution. Using the same cluster properties, we produced a σ1D
distribution for M17 with fbin= 0.7 and Pcutoff= 1.4 days. This
resulted in σ1D= 40.5+18.6−16.0 km s"
"−1, which agrees closely with this
work. No significant difference with this work was found for any
binary fraction or cutoff period."
