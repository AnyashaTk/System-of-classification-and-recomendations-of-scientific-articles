ABSTRACT
"We use 3,213 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) from the XMM-XXL northern field to investigate the relation of AGN type with host
galaxy properties. Applying a Bayesian method, we derive the hardness ratios (HRs) and through these the hydrogen column density
(NH) for each source. We consider as absorbed sources (type-2) those with NH > 1021.5 cm−2. We examine the star formation rate
(SFR) as well the stellar mass (M∗) distributions for both absorbed and unabsorbed sources. Our work indicates that there is no
significant link between the AGN type and these host galaxy properties. Next, we investigate whether the AGN power, as represented
by its X-ray luminosity, LX, correlates with any deviation of the host galaxy’s place from the so-called Main Sequence of galaxies, and
we examine this separately for the obscured and the unobscured AGN populations. To take into account the effect of M∗ and redshift
on SFR, we use the normalised SFR (SFRnorm). We find that the correlation between LX and SFRnorm, follows approximately the same
trend for both absorbed and unabsorbed sources, a result that favours the standard AGN unification models. Finally, we explore the
connection between the obscuration, NH, and the SFR. We find that there is no relation between these, suggesting that the obscuration
is not related to the large scale SFR in the galaxy."

1. Introduction
"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are among the most luminous
radio, optical and X-ray sources in the Universe. They are pow-
ered by accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs), MBH
> 106 M�, which are located in their centres. Despite the dif-
ference in physical scale between the SMBH and the galaxy
spheroid (nine orders of magnitude; Hickox et al. 2011), there
has been evidence of a causal connection between the growth of
the SMBH and the host galaxy evolution. These pieces of evi-
dence come from both observational (e.g. Magorrian et al. 1998;
Ferrarese & Merritt 2000) and theoretical studies (e.g. Hopkins
& Hernquist 2006; Hopkins et al. 2008; Di Matteo et al. 2008)."
"One popular method to study the AGN−galaxy coevolution
is via examining the correlation, if any, of the SMBH activity
and the star formation of the host galaxy, at different epochs (e.g.
Rovilos et al. 2012; Rosario et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2013; Hickox
et al. 2014; Stanley et al. 2015; Rodighiero et al. 2015; Aird et al.
2016, 2019). The first attempts to examine this coevolution were
hampered by low number statistics (e.g Lutz et al. 2010; Page
et al. 2012), field-to-field variations (Harrison et al. 2012). Re-
cent studies have examined the star formation rate (SFR)−AGN
power relationship using data from wider fields (e.g. Lanzuisi
et al. 2017; Brown et al. 2019). Some of these studies take into
account the evolution of SFR with redshift, by splitting their re-
sults into redshift bins. However, most studies do not compare
the SFR of AGN with that of similar systems that do not host an
AGN. Masoura et al. (2018) used data from both the X-ATLAS
and XMM-XXL North fields and found evolution of the SFR of
AGN with stellar mass and redshift. The mean SFR of AGN at
fixed stellar mass and redshift is higher than star-forming galax-
ies that do not host an AGN, in particular at z > 1 (see also Florez"
"et al. 2020).They also examined the SFRnorm, that is the observed
SFR divided by the expected SFR at a given M∗ and redshift, as a
function of the AGN power (see also Mullaney et al. 2015; Bern-
hard et al. 2019; Grimmett et al. 2020). Based on their results, the
AGN enhances or quenches the star formation of its host galaxy
depending on the location of the host galaxy relative to the star
formation main sequence. Bernhard et al. (2019) used data from
COSMOS field and found that the SFRnorm of powerful AGN has
a narrower distribution that is shifted to higher values compared
to their lower X-ray luminosity (LX) counterparts. However, the
mean SFRs are consistent with a flat relationship between SFR
and LX. In addition to the aforementioned effects, it has been
pointed out that different observed trends could be the conse-
quence of different binning (Volonteri et al. 2015a,b; Lanzuisi
et al. 2017). A possible explanation could be the differences, in
timescales, between the black hole accretion rate and the SFR.
Specifically, AGNs may be expected to vary on a wide range of
timescales (hours to Myr) that are extremely short compared to
the typical timescale for star formation (100 Myr) (Hickox et al.
2014). Recently, Grimmett et al. (2020) presented a novel tech-
nique that removes the need for binning, by applying a hierarchi-
cal Bayesian model. Their results confirmed those of Bernhard
et al. (2019), that higher luminosity AGN have a tighter physical
connection to the star-forming process than lower X-ray lumi-
nosity AGN, in the redshift range probed by their dataset."
"Most of the radiation emitted by AGNs is obscured from our
view, due to the presence of material between the central source
and the observer (Fabian 1999; Treister et al. 2004). Obscured
AGNs consist up to ∼ (70% − 80%) of the total AGN population
(e.g. Akylas & Georgantopoulos 2008; Georgakakis et al. 2017).
As a result, obscuration presents a significant challenge to reveal
the complete AGN population and understand the cosmic evolu-"

"tion of SMBHs. The main reasons of obscuration are, both, the
fuelling of the SMBH (inflows of gas) and the AGN feedback
(for a review see Hickox & Alexander 2018). In terms of the dif-
ferent obscuring material, X-ray energies are obscured by gas,
whereas ultraviolet (UV) and optical wavelengths are extincted
by dust."
"According to the simple unification model, (e.g. Antonucci
1993; Urry & Padovani 1995; Netzer 2015), optical and UV
emission is produced by the accretion disc around the SMBH.
The X-ray emission is produced by the hot corona and is associ-
ated with the accretion disk, having a tight relation with the UV
and optical emission (Lusso & Risaliti 2016). To account for the
strong infrared (IR) emission (Sanders et al. 1989; Elvis et al.
1994), the model includes a torus of gas and dust that forms
around the central engine (SMBH and accretion disc). Specifi-
cally, the dust grains (see Draine 2003) of the toroidal structure
are heated by the radiation from the central engine, which is then
re-emitted at larger wavelengths (IR emission; Barvainis 1987).
The orientation of the dusty torus determines the amount of ob-
scuring material along the observer’s line of sight to the central
regions. Thus, type 1 refers to the face-on (unobscured) and type
2 to the edge-on (obscured) AGNs. As a result, one of the main
predictions of the simple unification model is that type 1 and
type 2 AGNs should live in similar environments and thus have
similar host galaxy properties."
"On the other hand, according to the evolutionary model, dif-
ferent levels of obscuration correspond to different stages of the
growth of the SMBH (Ciotti & Ostriker 1997, 2001; Di Matteo
et al. 2005; Hopkins et al. 2006; Bournaud et al. 2007; Gilli et al.
2007; Somerville et al. 2008; Treister et al. 2009; Fanidakis et al.
2011). The main idea is that the AGN growth coincides with
host galaxy activity which is likely to obscure the AGN (type 2
− phase). Eventually, the powerful AGN pushes away the sur-
rounding star forming material (""blowout""). As a result further
star formation is halted (""quenching"") revealing the unobscured
AGN (type 1 − phase). In the context of this model the same
galaxy material (dust and gas), that obscures the AGN, may also
produce the star formation. It has been claimed that obscuration
can occur not only in the regime around the accretion disk, but
also in galaxy scale (e.g. Maiolino & Rieke 1995; Malkan et al.
1998; Matt 2000; Netzer 2015; Circosta et al. 2019; Malizia et al.
2020). This large-scale extinction, is typical in models where
SMBH−galaxy co-evolution is driven by mergers (e.g. Hopkins
et al. 2008; Alexander & Hickox 2012; Buchner & Bauer 2016).
Early studies indicated large scale morphological differences be-
tween type 2 and type 1 AGN, in Seyfert galaxies, with the for-
mer having more frequent asymmetric/disturbed morphologies
(Maiolino et al. 1997)."
"Many different approaches are used in the literature to exam-
ine the aforementioned theoretical picture of the AGN obscura-
tion, and its possible relation with large scale properties of the
host galaxy. Investigating the relation between AGN type and
host galaxy properties presents a popular approach to achieve
that. The most common way, is to examine whether or not there
are differences in various host galaxy properties of obscured and
unobscured AGN. Merloni et al. (2014) reported no significant
differences between the mean M∗ and SFRs. On the other hand,
Zou et al. (2019), claimed that unobscured AGNs tend to have
lower M∗ than the obscured ones. However, according to the
same study, SFRs are similar for both classifications. According
to Chen et al. (2015), obscured AGNs have higher IR star for-
mation luminosities by a factor of approximately 2, than unob-
scured ones. Furthermore, they studied the connection between
obscuration and SFR and based on their results there is an in-"
"crease of the obscured fraction with SFR. Nevertheless, in their
work the examined sample consists of luminous quasars and
the sources are classified as obscured and unobscured based on
their optical classification. Studies that used X-ray sources found
that the correlation of SFR and X-ray absorption is either non-
existent or mild (e.g. Rovilos & Georgantopoulos 2007; Rovilos
et al. 2012; Rosario et al. 2012; Stemo et al. 2020). Therefore, it
is still an open question, whether there is a connection between
X-ray obscuration and host galaxy properties."
"In this work, we use X-ray AGN in the XMM-XXL field
and examine the relation, if any, between X-ray absorption and
galaxy properties. Applying a Bayesian method, we derive the
hardness ratios (HRs) for the examined sample and through
them the hydrogen column density (NH). Sources with NH >
1021.5 cm−2 considered as absorbed. Taking into account the NH,
we examine the SFR as well the M∗ distributions for both pop-
ulations (absorbed and unabsorbed) and we re-examine the con-
nection between the LX and the SFR of the host galaxy. Ad-
ditionally, we explore the connection between the NH with the
SFR. We assume a ΛCDM cosmology with Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7
and H0 = 70 km s−1Mpc−1."
2. Data
2.1. The XMM-XXL survey
"To carry out our analysis we use sources from the XMM-XXL
field. The XMM − Newton XXL survey (XMM-XXL Pierre et al.
2016) is a medium-depth X-ray survey that covers a total area
of 50 deg2 split into two fields equal in size, the XMM-XXL
North (XXL-N) and the XMM-XXL South (XXL-S). The data,
used for the current work, come from the equatorial sub-region
of the XXL-N, which consists of 8,445 X-ray sources. Of these
X-ray sources, 5,294 have SDSS counterparts and 2,512 have
reliable spectroscopy (Menzel et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2016). The
data reduction, source detection and sensitivity map construction
follow the methods described by Georgakakis & Nandra (2011)."
2.2. The X-ray AGN sample
"The XXL sample used in our analysis is the same sample used in
Masoura et al. (2018). The details on source selection and SED
fitting analysis, are provided in their Sections 2 and 3, respec-
tively (see also their Tables 1 and 2). Here, we outline the most
important parts."
"The dataset consists of 3,213 X-ray selected AGN from the
XXL-N field, within a redshift range of 0.03 < z < 3.5. 1849
sources have spectroscopic redshift (Menzel et al. 2016) and
1364 have photometric redshift (photoz). Photoz were estimated
using TPZ, a machine-learning algorithm (Carrasco Kind &
Brunner 2013), following the process described in Mountrichas
et al. (2017) and Ruiz et al. (2018)."
"All our sources have available optical photometry from
SDSS. mid-IR (WISE) and near-IR (VISTA) photometry was ob-
tained following the likelihood ratio method (Sutherland 1992).
We use catalogues produced by the HELP1 collaboration to
add far-IR counterparts. HELP provides homogeneous and cal-
ibrated multiwavelength data over the Herschel Multitiered Ex-
tragalactic Survey (HerMES, Oliver et al. 2012) and the H-
ATLAS survey (Eales et al. 2010). The strategy adopted by
1 The Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP,
http://herschel.sussex.ac.uk/) is a European funded project to analyse
all the cosmological fields observed with the Herschel satellite. HELP
data products are accessible on HeDaM (http://hedam.lam.fr/HELP/)"

shift. Blue and red colours refer to the unabsorbed and absorbed
sources, respectively. There is a selection bias against low lumi-
nosity sources (log LX < 43 erg s−1) at high redshifts (z > 1). The
effect of this incompleteness is taken into account (for details see
section 4.2)."
"HELP is to build a master list catalog of objects for each field
(Shirley et al. 2019) and to use the near-IR sources from IRAC
surveys as prior information for the IR maps. The XID+ tool
(Hurley et al. 2017), developed for this purpose, uses a Bayesian
probabilistic framework and works with prior positions. At the
end, a flux is measured for all the near-IR sources of the master
list. In this work, only SPIRE fluxes are considered, given the
much lower sensitivity of the PACS observations for this field
(Oliver et al. 2012). 1,276 X-ray AGN have Herschel photome-
try."
"In our analysis, we make SFR estimations, through SED fit-
ting. For this reason, we require our sources to have at least,
WISE (W1-W4) or HERSCHEL detection, in addition to optical
photometry. SFR estimations for sources without HERSCHEL
photometry have been calibrated using the relation presented in
Masoura et al. (2018)(for more details see their section 3.2.2 and
Fig. 4)."
"In table 1, we present the number of sources based on the
available photometry, spectroscopy and X-ray absorption. The
observed LX of our sample, are estimated in the hard energy
band (2−10 keV). Our X-ray sources are selected to have LX
(2−10 keV) > 1041 erg s−1, which minimises contamination from
inactive galaxies. The observed X-ray luminosity as a function
of redshift is presented in Fig. 1. Based on the latter plot, there
is a selection bias against low luminosity sources (log LX < 43
erg s−1) at high redshifts (z > 1). To account for this effect we
adopt the 1Vmax method (e.g. Schmidt 1968; Akylas et al. 2006,
see section 4.2)."
3. Analysis
"In this section, we describe the steps we have followed in our
analysis. The AGN host galaxy properties have been estimated
through SED fitting (section 3.1). Section 3.2 describes the esti-
mation of the X-ray properties of our sample and the methodol-
ogy we have followed to account for selection biases."
3.1. Host galaxy properties
"SFR and M∗ were estimated using the CIGALE code version
0.12 (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission Burgarella et al.
2005; Noll et al. 2009; Boquien et al. 2019). The emission asso-
ciated with AGN is modelled using the Fritz et al. (2006) library,
as described in Ciesla et al. (2015). This allows us to disentangle
the AGN IR emission from the IR emission of the host galaxy
and derive more accurate SFR measurements. Sources with re-
duced χ2 > 5 have been excluded from our analysis. For more
details on the SED fitting, the models used and their parameter
values, see Masoura et al. (2018)."
"Masoura et al. (2018) (see their Fig. 7), found that the aver-
age SFR of AGN host galaxies presents a similar evolution with
stellar mass and redhsift with that of star-forming systems (e.g
Brinchmann et al. 2004; Elbaz et al. 2007; Daddi et al. 2007;
Magdis et al. 2010; Salmon et al. 2015; Schreiber et al. 2015).
To account for the evolution of the MS, we follow their ap-
proach (see also e.g., Bernhard et al. 2019) and make use of
the SFRsnorm parameter to examine whether the AGN type plays
any systematic role in deviations (or dispersion) around it. This
quantity is equal to the observed SFR, divided by the expected
SFR at a given M∗ and redshift (SFRsnorm= SFR/SFRMS ). To es-
timate the SFRMS we use equation 9 of Schreiber et al. (2015)."
3.2. X-ray absorption
"To classify the AGN as X-ray absorbed and unabsorbed we need
to estimate their hydrogen column density. For that purpose, we
first apply a Bayesian method to calculate the HR and then infer
the NH of each source. A detailed description of this process is
provided below:"
3.2.1. X-ray colours
"HR or X-ray colour, is used to quantify and characterise weak
sources and large samples. To alleviate the downsides of the clas-
sical definition (e.g. Gaussian assumption for the error propaga-
tion of counts for faint sources with a significant background,
background subtraction), we apply the Bayesian Estimation of
Hardness Ratios code (BEHR; Park et al. 2006). This method
applies a Bayesian approach to account for the Poissonian na-
ture of the observations. For the estimations, we use the number
of photons in the soft (0.5−2.0 keV) and the hard (2.0−8.0 keV)
bands, provided in Liu et al. (2016) catalogue. The hardness ratio
calculations are based on the following equation:"
"HR =
H − S
H + S"
"where S and H the counts in the soft and the hard bands, respec-
tively."
3.2.2. Hydrogen column density
"The NH values for all the sources in our sample are estimated
using the calculated HRs. PIMMS tool (Portable, Interactive,
Multi-Mission Simulator; Mukai 1993) is used to create a grid of
HR and NH values and convert the HR values from BEHR into
NH. PIMMs is also used to estimate the correction factor, that is
applied for the calculation of the intrinsic fluxes of our sources
(see next paragraph). In our calculations we assumed that the
power law X-ray spectrum has a fixed photon index (Γ) of 1.8.
The value of galactic NH used is log NH,gal/ cm−2 = 20.25."

"Fig. 2: Hydrogen column density, NH, distribution of the AGN
sample. The vertical, dashed line presents the NH cut applied in
our analysis to split the sources into absorbed and unabsorbed."
"The AGN sample is split into X-ray absorbed and unabsorbed
sources, using a NH cut at log NH/ cm−2 = 21.5. This value has
been chosen in a number of previous studies since it provides
a good agreement between the X-ray and optical classification
of type 1 and 2 AGNs (e.g. Merloni et al. 2014; Masoura et al.
2020). Fig. 2 presents the distribution of the hydrogen column
density for the examined sources. Its bimodal nature, was ob-
served in previous works, too (e.g. Civano et al. 2016; Stemo
et al. 2020)."
"Having estimated NH, we compute the correction factor, de-
fined as fint/ fabs, where fabs is the absorbed flux and fint the
intrinsic flux. The latter has been estimated using PIMMS and
assuming an unabsorbed power law with Γ = 1.8. Then, each
observed X-ray luminosity is corrected using this factor, to esti-
mate the intrinsic X-ray luminosity. Fig. 3 presents the distri-
bution of redshift (left panel) and intrinsic, X-ray luminosity
(right panel) of absorbed (red line) and unabsorbed (blue line)
AGN. We notice that the distributions of the two AGN subsam-
ples are similar. This can be explained by the low X-ray absorp-
tion limit we adopt in our analysis. Adoption of a higher NH
cut (log NH/ cm−2 = 22), results in different redshift and X-
ray luminosity distributions between absorbed and unabsorbed
sources, in agreement with the predictions of X-ray luminosity
function studies (e.g. Aird et al. 2015)."
4. Results & Discussion
"In this section, we present our main results and compare them
with previous studies. Specifically, we examine, whether ab-
sorbed and unabsorbed AGN have different host galaxy prop-
erties and if the SFR-LX relation changes with absorption."
"4.1. Host galaxy properties of absorbed and unabsorbed
AGN"
"As presented in Fig. 3, the redshift and LX distributions of X-
ray absorbed and unabsorbed classified AGN in our sample are
similar. However, we account for the small differences between
them, to facilitate a better comparison of the host galaxy prop-
erties of the two populations. For that purpose, we join the red-
shift distributions of the two populations and normalise each one
by the total number of sources in each redshift bin (bin size of
0.1). We repeat the same process for the LX distributions of the
two subsamples (bin size of 0.2 dex). This procedure provides us
with the probability density function (PDF) in this 2−D parame-
ter space (i.e., redshift and LX space). Then, we use the redshift
and LX of each source to weigh it based on the estimated PDF
(see also Mendez et al. 2016; Mountrichas et al. 2016). This cor-
rection method is similar to that applied in previous studies (e.g.
Zou et al. 2019) and allows a fair comparison with their results.
Additionally, each source is weighted based on the statistical sig-
nificance of its stellar mass and SFR measurements (see next
Sections for details)."
4.1.1. Stellar mass distribution
"Stellar mass estimations for AGN may suffer from large uncer-
tainties, in particular in the case of unabsorbed sources. The
AGN emission can outshine the optical emission of the host
galaxy, thus rendering stellar mass calculations uncertain. The
median stellar mass measurements and the median uncertainties,
estimated by CIGALE are 10.6 ± 0.4 and 10.9 ± 0.6, for un-
absorbed and absorbed AGN, respectively. Restricting our sam-
ple to the most X-ray luminous (LX ≥ 1044 ergs−1), unabsorbed
AGN (∼ 20% of our total sample) gives 11.1±0.8. Fig. 4 presents
the distributions of stellar mass uncertainties for absorbed (red
shaded area) and unabsorbed (blue line) AGN. The two popu-
lations have similar distributions, with the bulk of the measure-
ments to have errors ≤ 0.5 − 0.6 dex. We choose not to exclude
sources with large stellar mass errors to avoid reducing the size
of the dataset. Instead we account for the M∗ uncertainties, by
estimating the significance (value/uncertainty), σ, of each stellar
mass measurement and weigh each source based on its σ value
(in addition to the weight presented in the previous paragraph).
We confirm, that excluding from our analysis those sources that
have stellar mass uncertainties larger than 0.6 dex (∼ 25% of un-
absorbed and ∼ 33% of absorbed AGN) does not change our
results and conclusions compared to those presented, using the
weighting method described above."
"Fig. 5 presents the distribution of M∗ for both absorbed and
unabsorbed AGNs, in bins of 0.2 dex. We apply a two-sample
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS-test) to examine whether or not
the two distributions differ. The KS-test reveals that the distribu-
tions are similar for both AGN populations (p − value = 0.72).
We also split the AGN sample into low and high redshift subsam-
ples, using a redshift cut at z = 1.0 and repeat the process. KS-"

tion of absorbed and unabsorbed sources, at any redshift. Specif-
ically, at z < 1.0 KS-test gives p = 0.82 and at z > 1.0, p = 0.39.
Our findings are in agreement with Merloni et al. (2014) who
used 1310 X-ray selected AGN from the XMM-COSMOS sur-
vey with redshift range 0.3 < z < 3.5. In that study, the X-ray
population was split into obscured and unobscured AGN, using
the same NH cut that is applied in our analysis (NH=1021.5 cm−2).
They found no remarkable differences between the mean M∗ of
obscured and unobscured AGNs. On the other hand, Lanzuisi
et al. (2017), used approximately 700 X-ray selected AGNs, in
the COSMOS field in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 4, and found
that unobscured AGNs tend to have lower M∗ than obscured
sources. However, they considered as X-ray absorbed sources
with NH > 1022 cm−2. To be consistent with Lanzuisi et al.
(2017), we apply the KS-test adopting the same NH with them.
The estimated p-value, although is reduced to 0.56 still indicates
that the M∗ distribution is similar, for the two AGN populations.
Furthermore, Zou et al. (2019) used 2463 X-ray selected AGNs
in the COSMOS field and found that unobscured AGNs tend
to have lower M∗ than their obscured counterparts. However, in
their analysis they divided their sample into type 1 and type 2
AGNs based on their optical spectra, morphologies, and variabil-
ity. Thus, the disagreement with our results could be attributed to
the different method applied in the characterisation of a source
as obscured/unobscured."
4.1.2. Star formation rate distribution
"The left panel of Fig. 6 presents the distributions of the SFR, for
both absorbed and unabsorbed AGNs, in bins of 0.3 dex for the
total sample. Each source is weighted based on its X-ray lumi-
nosity and redshift as well as the σ value of its SFR measure-
ment. Application of the two-sample KS-test reveals that the
SFR distributions are similar for both AGN populations, with
p − value equals to 0.95. This is also the case when we split
the AGN sample into low and high redshift subsamples, using a
redshift cut at z = 1.0 (for z < 1.0, p = 0.99 and for z > 1.0,
p = 0.86). In the right panel, we present the SFR distributions
only for those AGN that have available Herschel photometry."

"The results are similar to those for the full sample, i.e. the SFR
distributions of X-ray absorbed and unabsorbed AGN present no
significant differences (p − value = 0.86). Further restricting the
sample to those sources with signal-to-noise ratio greater than 3
for the SPIRE bands (216 AGN), does not change the results."
"Our findings agree with most previous studies (Merloni et al.
2014; Lanzuisi et al. 2017; Zou et al. 2019). On the other hand,
Chen et al. (2015) used AGN from the Böotes field and claimed
that type 2 sources have higher IR star formation luminosities (a
proxy of star formation) by a factor of ∼ 2 than type 1. How-
ever, their dataset consists of mid-IR selected, luminous quasars.
Moreover, they have divided their sample into type 1 and type
2 AGNs using optical/mid-IR colour criteria R−[4.5] = 6.1 (e.g.
Hickox et al. 2007), where R and [4.5] are the Vega magnitudes
in the R and IRAC 4.5µm bands, respectively."

4.1.3. Normalised star formation rate distribution
"We calculate the SFRnorm, to take into account the evolution of
SFR with stellar mass and redshift (see section 3.1). The distri-
bution of SFRnorm of absorbed and unabsorbed AGN is presented
in Fig. 7, in bins of 0.2 dex. Each source is weighted based on
its redshift and luminosity, as described in Section 4.1, as well
as based on the significance of its stellar mass and star formation
rate measurement. The KS-test results in a p-value equal to 0.71,
i.e., the two populations have similar SFRnorm distributions. We
notice that both distributions are bimodal. Further investigation
reveals that, both for the absorbed and the unabsorbed sources,
the first peak is due to low redshift systems (mean z ≈ 0.7), while
the second peak is due to AGN that lie at high redshifts (mean
z ≈ 1.5). This may suggest evolution of the SFRnorm with red-
shift. To investigate this scenario further, we split the AGN sam-
ple into two redshift bins, at z = 1.2. The SFRnorm distributions
are presented in Fig. 8. The results confirm that the SFRnorm dis-
tribution peaks at different values at low and high redshifts. AGN
in the lower redshift bin have SFR comparable with galaxies
in the star-forming main sequence (log SFRnorm = 0), whereas
AGN at higher redshift have enhanced SFR compared to galax-
ies in the main sequence. We discuss this in more detail in the
next section."
"Bernhard et al. (2019) examined the SFR distribution of X-
ray AGN, taking into consideration its evolution with M∗ and
redshift. Specifically, they used X-ray sources in the COSMOS
field and investigated the SFRnorm distribution as a function of
LX. Based on their analysis, more powerful AGN present a nar-
rower SFRnorm distribution that peaks close to that of the MS
galaxies. Their sample consists of AGN at intermediate redshifts,
i.e., 0.8 < z < 1.2. Based on the mean redshift values of the
systems contained in the two peaks of our SFRnorm distributions
presented above, this would place their sources in between our
two peaks and close to SFR of MS galaxies. Furthermore, Bern-
hard et al. sample spans a narrower LX range and lacks sources
both at low and in particular at high LX compared to the sam-
ple used in our analysis (see our Fig. 1 and their Fig. 1). There
are only ∼ 500 AGN in our dataset that are within the redshift
and luminosity range of Bernhard et al. Further restricting the"
"sample to only obscured sources, in accordance with Bernhard
et al., results in less than 200 sources. Applying their luminos-
ity cut (LX = 2 × 1043 ergs−1) we divide AGN into high and
low luminosity systems. We note that there are less than 30 low
luminosity sources in our sample. The SFRnorm distribution of
high (green) and low (blue) LX AGN is presented in Fig. 9. High
luminosity AGN still present a two-peaked SFRnorm. We note,
however, that although we have matched the redshift and LX
range with that of Bernhard et al., the LX distributions of the two
datasets are still different. Nevertheless, the two results agree that
higher X-ray luminosity AGN exhibit higher SFRnorm values. We
conclude, that the different results between our study and Bern-
hard et al. could be due to the different LX, redshift plane probed
by the samples of the two studies and in particular the different
luminosity distributions between the two datasets."
4.2. SFRnorm − LX correlation for different AGN types
"In this section, we study the effect of obscuration on the SFR−LX
relation. To account for the evolution of SFR with stellar mass
and redshift (see also section 3.1), we plot SFRnorm estimations
versus LX."
"Luminous sources are observed within a larger volume com-
pared to their faint counterparts, in flux limited surveys (Fig. 1).
This introduces a selection bias to our analysis. To account for
this effect, we adopt the 1Vmax correction method (Akylas et al.
2006; Page & Carrera 2000). Specifically, we estimate for each
source of a given LX, the maximum available volume that it can
be observed, using the following equation:"
"Vmax =
∫ zmax"
"0
Ω(f)"
"dz, (2)"
"where Ω( f ) is the value of the sensitivity curve at a given flux,
corresponding to a source at a redshift z with observed luminos-
ity LX. zmax is the maximum redshift at which the source can be
observed at the flux limit of the survey. The area curve used in
our calculations is presented in Liu et al. (2016) (see their Fig. 3).
Therefore, each source is weighted by the 1Vmax value, depending
on their LX and redshift. An additional weight is also considered,
based on the σ value of the M∗ and SFR measurements."
"In Fig. 10 (left panel), we present our measurements in LX
bins, for absorbed and unabsorbed AGN, in bins of size 0.5 dex.
Median SFR and LX values are presented. The error bars rep-
resent the 1σ dispersion of each bin, i.e., they do not take into
account the errors of the individual SFR and stellar mass mea-
surements. The number of sources varies in each bin, but our
results are not sensitive to the choice of the number and size
of bins. Based on our findings, both X-ray absorbed and unab-
sorbed AGN present a similar SFR-LX relation, at all X-ray lumi-
nosities spanned by our sample. Complementary, we present our
measurements in SFRnorm bins (bin size 0.5 dex, right panel of
Fig. 10). Previous studies have also found that different binning
affects the observed trends (e.g., Lanzuisi et al. 2017; Hickox
et al. 2014). However, further examination of the underlying
reasons that could be responsible for this effect are beyond the
scope of this paper. Based on our findings, X-ray absorption does
not play a significant role in the SFR−LX relation, regardless of
whether our measurements are binned in LX or SFR bins."
"Additionally, we examine, if and how the redshift range af-
fects our estimations. The NH values, estimated in section 3.2.2
could be considered less secure, as we move to higher redshifts.
This is because the absorption redshifts out of the soft-Xray band
in the observed frame. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1 our sample"

relation."

in the lower redshift bin have SFR comparable with galaxies
in the star-forming main sequence (log SFRnorm = 0), whereas
AGN at higher redshift have enhanced SFR compared to galax-
ies in the main sequence. This suggests evolution of the SFRnorm
with redshift (see text for more details)."
"AGN (also seen in Fig. 7). This evolution does not appear statis-
tical significant for redshift below z < 1.2 (≤ 1σ), but its statis-
tical significance increases (≈ 2 − 2.5σ, estimated by adding in
quadrature the errors of the bins) between the lowest and high-
est of our redshift bins. This result suggests, that as we move to
higher redshifts, galaxies that host AGN tend to have a higher in-
crease of their SFR compared to star-forming galaxies. At higher
redshifts, galaxy mergers are more common than at low redshifts
(e.g. Lin et al. 2008). These mergers can drive gas towards the
centre of galaxies leading to enhanced star-formation and AGN
activity when some of this gas is deposited on the central black"

quist 1992; Hopkins & Hernquist 2006; Hopkins et al. 2008)
and observational studies (e.g. Hung et al. 2013). Galaxies in
the late stages of a merger have increased SFR and AGN activ-
ity (e.g. Stierwalt et al. 2013). Therefore, our findings that SFR
of AGN increases more rapidly with redshift compared to non-
AGN systems, may indicate that AGN are observed at a late(r)
evolutionary merger stage when the central black hole has been
activated and the SFR of the galaxy is at its peak. Alternatively,
the enhanced SFR of AGN compared to normal galaxies at high
redshifts, may be due to the different AGN fueling processes and
different star formation trigger mechanisms at high and low red-
shifts (e.g. mergers vs. disc instabilities Somerville et al. 2001;
Kereš et al. 2005)."
"Mullaney et al. (2015), used X-ray AGN from Chandra Deep
Field South and Chandra Deep Field North and found no evo-
lution of SFRnorm with redshift. However, their sample is ex-
tracted from narrow fields and therefore does not probe as high
and many luminous sources as those detected in XXL. Based on
our results, presented in Fig. 11, the SFRnorm evolution becomes
apparent at high X-ray luminosities (LX ≥ 1044 ergs−1), that are
rare in deep fields."
4.3. Star formation as a function of X-ray absorption
"SFR is a galaxy wide quantity while X-ray obscuration occurs in
the regime around the black hole. However, it has been claimed
that obscuration can also occur in galaxy scale (e.g. Fabbiano
et al. 2017; Malizia et al. 2020). In the latter case, the two prop-
erties may be correlated. Thus, in this part of our analysis, we
investigate whether there is a dependence of SFR with the X-ray
absorption."
"Rosario et al. (2012) used a sample of AGNs from GOODS-
South, GOODS-North and COSMOS fields, spanning the red-
shifts 0.2 < z < 2.5. The NH values were estimated using either
spectral fits for X-ray sources with sufficient counts or scalings
based on hardness ratios for faint X-ray sources. They found
a mild dependence between the mean far IR luminosity (SFR
proxy) and the X-ray obscuring column, NH. On the other hand,
Rovilos et al. (2012)used AGNs from the 3Ms XMM − Newton"
"survey with z ' 0.5−4 and reported that there is no correlation
between SFR and NH. They claimed that the absorption is likely
to be linked to the nuclear region rather than the host galaxy.
Their findings were recently confirmed, by Stemo et al. (2020).
This group used X-ray and/or IR selected AGN (Spitzer and
Chandra data) and composed a sample of 2585 sources with red-
shift range 0.2 < z < 2.5. They compiled data come from the
GEMS, COSMOS, GOODS and AEGIS surveys. They used ex-
tinction parameter, EB−V , values (estimated through SED fitting)
to infer the NH values, using a conversion factor of EB−V / NH =
1.80±0.15×10−23. Based on their findings, the relation between
the SFR and NH is flat, up to z = 2.5. According to their interpre-
tation, this behaviour indicates a difference in fuelling processes
or timescales between SMBH growth and host galaxy star for-
mation."
"In Fig. 12, we plot the star formation as a function of NH for
our X-ray AGN sources. All sources are weighted based on the"
"1
Vmax"
"method, as well as on the significance of the SFR measure-
ments. Median SFR and NH values are presented. The error bars
represent the 1σ dispersion of each bin, i.e., they do not take
into account the errors of the individual SFR calculations. Mea-
surements are binned in NH, with bin size of 0.5 dex. We detect a
flat relation between the two parameters, at all redshifts spanned
by our sample. Our results are in agreement with previous works
that have used AGN with similar X-ray properties, i.e. low to
moderate levels of X-ray absorption. We note, however, that this
result may not hold at higher NH values."
5. Summary
"In this study, we use 3,213 AGNs from the XMM-XXL north-
ern field to investigate the relation of the AGN type with the
host galaxy properties. About 60% of our sources have available
spectroscopic redshift while for the remaining we use photo-
metric redshifts estimated through a machine learning technique
(TPZ). The host galaxy properties, SFR and stellar mass are es-
timated via the SED fitting code CIGALE. A statistical method,
based on bayesian statistics (BEHR), is applied to derive the HRs
for the examined sample. AGN with NH > 1021.5 cm−2 are con-
sidered as absorbed."
"First, we study whether there is a connection between AGN
type and the properties of the host galaxy. We estimate the SFR
and M∗ distributions of both X-ray absorbed and unabsorbed
AGN. A KS-test reveals that the galaxy properties of the two
AGN populations are similar."
"Next, we disentangle the effects of M∗ and redshift on SFR
and examine the SFR-LX relation, as a function of AGN type.
Based on our findings, the SFR-LX relation is similar for ab-
sorbed and unabsorbed AGN, at all redshifts spanned by our
sample. This behaviour indicates that the interplay between the
AGN and its host galaxy is independent of the obscuration."
"Finally, we explore whether the SFR varies as a function of
the absorbing column density. Our results show that there is no
relation between the two, suggesting that either the two pro-
cesses take place in different scales or that even if absorption
extents to galactic scales does not relate with the SFR of the host
galaxy."
"Overall, our results suggest that there is no connection be-
tween X-ray absorption and the properties of the host galaxy
nor the AGN-galaxy co-evolution. This, provides support to the
unification model, i.e. X-ray absorption seems to be an incli-
nation effect and not a phase in the lifetime of the AGN. We
note, however, that in our analysis we have adopted a rather
low X-ray absorption limit. XMM-XXL is a shallow exposure"

sources (NH ∼ 1023 cm−2). Future surveys that will provide
larger datasets of obscured AGN and/or with higher column den-
