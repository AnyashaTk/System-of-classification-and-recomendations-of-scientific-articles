Abstract
Open clusters are host the several identical stars in the similar physical and chemi-
cal environment. They become interesting objects to identify the variable stars in the
"lower metallicity domain. In the present paper, the CCD time series observations of"
cluster NGC 1960 and DOLIDZE 14 are performed to search the variable stars within
them. A comprehensive study of differential phototometry and secondary standard-
ization transformation is carried out to search the stellar pulsation. A total of 18 and 4
short periodic variables found in the field of NGC 1960 and DOLIDZE 14 respectively.
Fast Fourier transformation techniques are utilized to compute the pulsation. Author
also discovered an exo-planet aorund ID 900 of NGC 1960 with periodicity about 99

1. Introduction
An open cluster (OCL) is loosely bounded group of up to a few thousand stars due
to mutual gravitational attraction of cluster members. Such objects are useful to carry
out the study of stellar evolution due to similar age and chemical composition of their
members. The member stars of an OCL are formed from the same giant molecular
"cloud. In this connection, a young OCL may be found within its parental molecular"
cloud and their mutual interaction mechanism is illuminated a process of creation of
"HII region [A good example of this region is NGC 2244 (Johnson, 1962).]. Such re-"
gions are active star formation sites and formed young stars with the highest metallicity.
The chemical composition or metallicity are used to know the type of stellar population
"and stars, having high metallicity, belong to Population I (abbreviated as Pop I). As a"
"result, OCLs are host the stars of Pop I. Analysis of observations of the Kepler data-set"
"confirms that the larger, potential gas giants planets are only concentrated around stars"
"of Pop I (Buchhave et al., 2012), whereas smaller planets are found around of stars of"
"all stellar populations. Such planets are traced through the transit method, based on"

"
observing the short (≈ 10 hours) periodic (P = ≈ months to years) dips in stel-"
"lar light curves caused by a planet passing in front of the star’s disk (Carpano et al.,"
"2003). Thus, fluctuation of stellar light curves becomes an important tool to search"
"exo-planets, however fluctuations of stellar brightness also occur due to other ongoing"
physical phenomena within their interior and surrounding.
The brightness fluctuations are found for some stars among members of stellar
population and such stars are known to be variable stars. The stellar variability may
"be arise either due to intrinsic properties (pulsations, eruptions, stellar swelling and"
shrinking) or extrinsic reasons (eclipsed by stellar rotation by another star or planet
etc.). Extrinsic reasons of stellar variability are stellar eclipsing in the binary and triplet
"stellar systems, properties of interstellar medium, planet transition and accretion pro-"
"cess of surrounding matter of stars. Other hand, the change of intrinsic properties of"
"variables are driven by the plasma transportation on the stellar surface, nucleus stel-"
"lar activities in their interior parts, effect of tidal force on stellar environment due to"
"nearby stars, their masses and ages. As a result, the variable stars are natural targets"
of study for any civilization due to their correlation between period and total light out-
"put, which allowed them to become the first rung in the astronomical distance ladder"
"(Hippke et al., 2015). In this connection, Cepheids of pulsating variables are impor-"
tant indicators of cosmic benchmarks for scaling galactic and extra-galactic distance
"(Majaess et al., 2009; Freedman & Madore, 2010) due to a strong direct relationship"
"between a Cepheid variable’s luminosity and pulsation period (Soszynski et al., 2008)."
Pulsating variables are most important objects due to the periodic expansion and con-
traction of the surface layers of the stars to maintain its equilibrium. Their census
"including pulsators and binaries, can provide important clues to stellar evolution and"
"the host star clusters (Luo et al., 2012). The several classes of pulsating variables are"
largely found at instability strip region of the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram.
The colour magnitude diagram (CMD) is an observational HR diagram for clusters
and its plots the apparent magnitude of detected stars of studied cluster against their
colour. Such CMD of an OCL contains a continuous and distinctive band of stars
and stars of this band are known as main sequence (MS) stars of studied cluster. In
"this connection, theoretical models of isochrone curve have constrained to show the"
stellar population of the same age. Through the visual fitting of theoretical models
"on observed CMDs of the cluster, we can be computed the distance, age and chemical"
"compositions (i.e. metallicity) of stellar population of its MS. Since, pulsating variables"
"has an associated instability strip (Dupret et al., 2004) above the MS, therefore, an OCL"
provides an opportunity to estimate the properties of its stellar variables through its own
"characteristic parameters. In addition, scientific study of variable stars are carried out"
"by using the comparison stars, have observed with the same telescopic field of view of"
studied variables.
The comparison stars of a variable are have approximate similar stellar magnitudes
and colours as found for that variable. Such comparison stars are easily assigned for
"identified variables of an OCL through their positions in an observed CMD. Thus,"
open clusters become excellent objects to search variable stars and their associated exo-
planets within the clusters. OCLs can also be effectively used to compute the stellar
properties of detected variables within them and to modify the age-period relations of
pulsating variables for precise measurements.
"In this background, we are carried out analysis of the time series observations of"
NGC 1960 and DOLIDZE 14 to search the variable stars within them. The previous
parametric studies of both clusters are given in the Section 2. The observational details
of these clusters are given in the Section 3. The methodology of data reduction is
discussed in the Section 4. The identification procedure of variable stars of DOLIDZE
14 and NGC 1960 is given in the Section 5.
2. Previous studies
2.1. NGC 1960
A complete UBVRIJHKW1W2 photometric catalogue has been constructed by
Joshi & Tyagi (2015a) by complying the PPMXL catalogue with the obtained UBVRI
"standard photometric magnitude of gathered data on date of 30 Nov, 2010. In this con-"
"nection, constructed catalogue has been utilized as reference catalogue for searching"
the variable stars in the observational field of view of cluster NGC 1960. It contains
"ten stars of a visual magnitude brighter than 10 (Jeffries et al., 2013), one B-type Vari-"
"able of 9th magnitude (Delgado et al., 1984), 178 down to magnitude 14 (Sanner et al.,"
"2000) and 38 members have infrared excess (Smith & Jeffries, 2012). As a result,"
flux of detected stars of this cluster will be contaminated due to the presence of these
brighter stars during its deep CCD photometric observations.
2.2. DOLIDZE 14
An infrared photometric study of DOLIDZE 14 is carried out by Joshi et al. (2015).
"This cluster have stellar enhancement in the B-band of USNB1.0, whereas it does not"
"show the properties of cluster in the infra-red bands (Joshi & Tyagi, 2015b)."
3. Data Collection and Extraction
Collection and observation of time series data of both clusters (NGC 1960 and
DOLIDZE 14) performed by GCJ under already ongoing project on cluster variability
"Since 2009 at ARIES, Nainital ( Letter No. AO/ARIES/459 on the date 27 June 2017)"
"during 18 September 2012 to 27 April 2015. The Honourable Director, ARIES gave"
permission to GCJ to use project work for constructing Thesis entitled “PHOTOMET-
RIC ANALYSIS OF OPEN STAR CLUSTERS AND VARIABILITY OF STARS” via
letter no. AO/2018/41 on date 12 April 2018 and related research papers. The time
series observations of both clusters are carried out by utilizing observational facilities
"of 1.04-m Sampurnand telescope of ARIES, Manora Peak, Nainital. The CCD cam-"
era of 1.04-m Sampunanad telescope of ARIES covers 15×15 arcmin2 field of view
"of the target objects. Since, the size of both clusters is more than the telescopic field"
"of view, therefore, we have performed an analysis of the time series observations of"
"the core regions of both clusters. In this connection, the bias and flat frames are also"
observed for each observational night of studied clusters. To detect the short periodic
"pulsation of stars of target cluster, we need time series observation of the whole night"
as per availability of target in the telescopic field of view. The weather conditions (see-
"ing, humidity, wind flow, passing clouds etc.) and declination of target object affect"
"the receiving flux of stars. Thus, the quality of observational data is most important to"
"perform the crucial task of identification of variables. In this connection, the selection"
"procedure of exposure times and observational details of clusters are given as below,"
3.1. Characteristics of observational data of NGC 1960
"To identified the short periodic pulsations of stars, time series observations of NGC"
1960 are carried out in V-band during 5 observational nights (2012-2015). The brief
detail of these observations is listed in the Table 1. It noted that our telescopic field
of view for NGC 1960 has fulfilled by several brighter stars. We found that these
"brighter stars are saturated during an exposure time of 5 seconds. In this connection,"
the value of 5 seconds exposure time in V-band becomes too high for the saturation
counts of brighter stars of NGC 1960 and leads the contamination of the observed
"science frames through 1.04-m telescope at ARIES, Nainital. Similarly, the value of 1"
second exposure time is too low for collecting the stellar information of fainter stars of
"NGC 1960 below 17 mag in V-band. Environment effects (seeing, air flow, humidity,"
passing clouds etc.) and higher declination of target cluster from zenith are further
lowered the value of stellar magnitudes and altered the rate of stellar detection. As a
"result, the different number of fainter stars are detected in different science frames of"
"NGC 1960. To overcome prescribed difficulty of fainter stars, we performed the deep"
"CCD photometric observation of core region of NGC 1960, have exposure times of 10,"
"20 and 60 seconds. We need continuous observations of 4-6 hours or more, therefore,"
we have captured science frames of NGC 1960 in the alternating order of low (5 or 6
seconds) and high (10 or 20 or 60 seconds) exposure times during observation session
"of night. Thus, we have obtained two data sets of NGC 1960, have different exposure"
"times, in the same session of observational night. In this background, the exposure"
time is play major role to collect the stellar information. The details of exposure times
of observed data are also given in the Table 1.
3.2. Characteristics of observational data of DOLIDZE 14
DOLIZE 14 has an open cluster of fainter stars and shows stellar enhancement in
"B-band. Due to its faintness, the deep CCD photometric observations are needed to"
"stellar detection. In this connection, this cluster is observed in I-band on the date 13"
"Oct, 2014 through 1.04-m Sampurnanand telescope at ARIES, Manora Peak, Nainital."
A total of 52 science frames are captured in the duration of 3 hours 15 min. It noted
that the positions of stars are slightly shifted during exposure time of 300 seconds.
"As a result, observations of longer exposure times are avoided for open cluster. Thus,"
exposure time of each frame is fixed to be 150 seconds according to the pixel capacity
and characteristic of CCD camera.
4. Methodology of Data reduction
"The raw science frame of target contains the electronic noise, counts of nonuni-"
"form pixel sensitivity and cosmic rays. The data reduction procedures (cleaning, stan-"
dardization) of observed data would required to overcome these defects from science
frames of targets to search variable stars within them. The brief detail of data reduction
"of observed frames of studied cluster is given below,"

within them.

4.1. Cleaning of raw science frames
"The bias-subtraction, flat fielding and cosmic-ray reduction are compulsory steps"
"in the cleaning procedure of raw science frames. In this connection, the bias correction"
and flat-fielding of observed science frames of NGC 1960 and DOLIDZE 14 have
"been carried out by using those bias and flat frames, which are observed in the same"
observational night of object. We are also utilized bias and flat frames of nearby night
for the science frames of NGC 1960 due to the lack of these frames in observed
"data. For this purpose, the ‘ZEROCOMBINE’ and ‘FLATCOMBINE’ tasks of ‘IRAF’"
package are utilized. ‘COSMICRAYS’ task of ‘IRAF’ software are used to remove
cosmic rays from the science frames. Such cleaned science frames are used to compute
instrumental magnitudes of detected stars in observed field of view of the targets. These
instrumental magnitudes of stars may convert into the standard magnitudes by either
the transformation coefficients of the standardization night or solution of linear fitting
of secondary standard stars of cluster.
4.2. Astrometry and alignment of frames
The coordinates of detecting stars are found in the term of pixels through 2k×2k
"charge couple device (CCD) camera of 1.04-m telescope. Since, the pixel coordinates"
"of identified stars are shifting due to telescopic motion and observed field of view,"
"therefore, ’GEOMAP’ and ’GEOTRAN’ tasks of IRAF software are utilized to align"
"the all science frames for analysis. In the astrometry, pixel coordinates of detected"
"stars have been transformed into celestial coordinates (α2000, δ2000) by using a linear"
astrometric solution as derived by matching a set of stars in common between our
"reference catalogue and the 2MASS catalogue. For this purpose, the visualization of"
images and access to catalogues has been done by ‘SKYCAT’ tool of ESO1.
4.3. Secondary standardization method
In order to perform consistent photometry from night to night on the aligned images
"(Joshi et al., 2012), we need a master list of stars from science frames of target cluster,"
which have the best seeing and coverage of the observed core region of both clusters.
"In this connection, the secondary standardization method [SSM Joshi et al. (2015)]"
used to compute the absolute photometric magnitude of detected stars of core region
of cluster NGC 1960 through a data-set of standardized night (30 November 2010) and
the data-set of standardized night of NGC 1960 is taken to be reference catalogue for
searching the variable stars within NGC 1960. This method is effective to estimate the
absolute stellar magnitudes of variable of NGC 1960 through the calibrated magnitudes
of its stable stars in the terms of standardized reference catalogue.
"It is noted that OCL, DOLDIZE 14 have not calibrated by any standardized field at"
"present. In this background, data set of detected stars of its first science frame of our"
work considered to be its reference catalogue for further analysis of stellar variability
within it. Other observed science frames of DOLIDZE 14 are calibrated according to
this reference catalogue by using the technique of SSM to reduce atmospheric-effect
and estimation-errors of stellar magnitudes during the data collection. In this con-
"nection, we need a set of common stars of each cluster, which are available in their"
reference frame and science frames. We have selected 29 and 63 common stars in the
observed field of DOLIDZE 14 and NGC 1960 respectively. These common stars are
used to find out a linear fit between the standard magnitudes and instrumental mag-
"nitudes of each frames, assuming that most of the stars have stable magnitude. We"
"reject those stars for linear fitting, which deviate more than 3σ limit of deviations of"
fitting. Resultant linear solution are used to transform instrumental magnitudes of stars
of studied clusters into their absolute magnitudes.
5. Identification of variable stars
The collective information of variation of stellar magnitude with time is known to
"be light curve of target. If, we find the deviation of absolute magnitudes of star more"
"than 3σ limit of mean value of its light curve, then, it will be considered a possible"
"candidate of variable stars. As a result, the possible variable candidates identify by"
"inspecting of their light curves (Sariya et al., 2014). In this connection, the shapes of"
light curves of a variable star give valuable information for examining the nature of
stellar variability and underlying physical processes producing the brightness changes.
The light curves of regular variables (such as Cepheids) are repeating with a constant
value of time (i.e. its period). Mira variables have less regular light curves with large
"amplitudes of several magnitudes, while semi-regular variables are less regular with the"
"smaller amplitudes (Samus et al., 2017). In this connection, amplitudes of light curves"
of irregular variables does not occur after a fixed time interval and shape of their light

curves have found in an uncertain pattern. The amplitude or period of the pulsations
can be related to the luminosity of the pulsating stars and shape of their light curves
"can be an indicator of the pulsation mode (Wood & Sebo, 1996). As a result, pulsating"
variables are distinguished by their periods of pulsation and the shapes of their light
"curves (Lata et al., 2014). For this purpose, the interesting magnitude ranges of CMD"
"plane of NGC 1960 and DOLIDZE 14 are discussed as follow,"
5.1. Instability Strips of CMDs
"The instability strip is a narrow, almost vertical region in HR diagram, which con-"
tains many different type of variable stars. Most stars more massive than Sun enter
the instability and become variable at least once after they have left the main sequence
(MS) 2. This strip intersect the MS in the region of A and F stars (have mass 1-2 M⊙)
of studied clusters and extends to G and early K bright super-giants. Joshi & Tyagi
(2015a) shown the most probable members (MPMs) in (B − V) vs V CMD by com-
"prehensive analysis of photometric, kinematic and spatial probabilistic criteria. These"
MPMs are found along with MS of NGC 1960 and also well aligned with a well fitted
theoretical isochrone as depicted in the Figure 1(A). We did not find stellar alignment
along with theoretical isochrone in the magnitude range of 12.5-13.2 H−mag of (J−H)
vs H CMD as constructed in the Figure 1(B) by MPMs. This fact indicates contami-
nation of fluxes of fainter stars by their nearby brighter stars. The contamination effect
of brighter stars also experienced in W2 − W1 vs W1 CMD as depicted in the Figure
1(C). Brighter stars do not satisfy the pattern of theoretical isochrone in W2 − W1 vs
W1 CMD while they have found along with theoretical isochrones in (B − V) vs V and
"(J − H) vs H CMDs. In this connection, we are found very high scatter data points"
in the light curves of brighter stars of NGC 1960 due to their unresolved centers in
"the present deep photometric observations. As a result, we did not analysis the time"
series observations of brighter and their nearby stars within the observed field of clus-
ter NGC 1960 for stellar variability. The common area of instability strip and MS of
OCL NGC 1960 seems to be important region (includes A and F stars) to understand
"the cluster dynamics through the stellar variability and vice-versa. In this connection,"
"the upper and lower limit of region, have A and F stars, are found to be 13.17 mag of"
"V − band and 16.61 mag of V − band, respectively and prescribed intercepted region"
"also least affected by the brighter stars and their neighbourhood. As a result, we are car-"
ried out time series analysis for finding stellar variability within this magnitude-range.
A total of nine variables of NGC 1960 are identified in this magnitude-range.
"In the case of DOLIDZE 14, we have not found such saturated brighter stars of"
"unresolved center. As a result, there are no need of any selected range of stellar magni-"
tudes to overcome the difficulty of contaminated stellar fluxes. The identified variables
of both clusters are depicted in the various CMDs of Figure 1. The red dots of each
panel of Figure 1 represent the previous known probable members of studied clusters.

5.2. Nature of stellar light curves
"We have detected 200±50 stars in each frame for DOLIDZE 14, whereas, a total"
of 1800-3000 stars are detected in the science frames of NGC 1960. The number of
detected stars of a frame depends on the exposure time of observed science frame. The
reference frame of NGC 1960 is standardized with respect to the Landolt field stars. As
"a result, we found absolute stellar magnitudes for NGC 1960 through the application"
"of SSM. Other hand, the reference frame of DOLIDIZE 14 did not standardized due"
"to the lack of data. Since, the transformation of stellar magnitudes of detected stars of"
"each science frame of DOLIDZE 14 is carried out with respect to its reference frame,"
"therefore, this methodology provides the apparent stellar magnitudes for DOLIDZE 14"
to consider the uniform sky conditions of whole session of observations. These trans-
formed stellar magnitudes are used to generate the light curves of stars. These light
curves contain the information of stellar variability with the aliases of noise. The noise
and instrumental errors are produced due to the varying sky conditions during the ob-
"servations and lead the scattering of data points in stellar light curves. Since, sky condi-"
"tions are changed with unpredictable way, therefore, the transformation coefficients are"
also varied accordingly. It leads the irregular variation of stellar magnitudes and these
variations are very closed to estimated/considered standard stellar magnitudes of refer-
ence frame. These variation can also produce the pseudo stellar variability. It noted that
these irregular variations have the similar pattern for all stars and may reduced through
the differential photometry. A varied sky condition is changed the similar amount of
"stellar fluxes of all detected stars of a science frame, which leads the variation of appar-"
ent stellar magnitudes of different orders due to the different amount of received fluxes
"of stars. In this connection, pattern of variations of light curves have different for the"
stars of different magnitudes. It indicates that the differential photometry can be per-
"formed for stars of approximate similar magnitudes. Thus, the selection of comparison"
stars are basic requirement in the differential photometry. It is preferable to select the
comparison star of any variable in such way that the stellar magnitude and reddening
of comparison star have nearly closed to the variable.
"The possible candidature of variable stars are assigned for those stars, which hav-"
ing the sufficient variation of amplitudes (above the 3σ limit of its mean) in their light
"curves. After the visual inspection of light curves of detected stars of both clusters, we"
found a total of 4 and 18 possible variable candidates in the observed field of DOLIDZE
"14 and NGC 1960, respectively. The exact confirmation of stellar variability can not"
possible through the light curve of a star due to unavailable information of the obtained
stellar variability. It may possible that a selected comparison star have also contained
"the stellar variability. In this connection, its differential photometry can further increase"
the scattering of data points and leads a weak information of stellar variability. As a
"result, the practice has been avoided to select the single comparison star for a possible"
"variable. In the present analysis, we have selected two comparison stars for each possi-"
ble variable star as depicted in the Figure 2 to 8. The pixel coordinates and differences
of stellar magnitudes of identified variables and their comparison stars are listed in the
"Table 2. To distinguish the instrumental variations from the stellar light curves, we have"
been subtracted the stellar magnitudes from each other and resultant curves are known
as comparative light curves. The light curves of variable and its selected comparison
stars are shown in the different panels of these figures in the set of three stars. Each
set of stars (one variable and two comparison stars) contained four panels. Top panel
shows the light curve of possible variables and middle panels show the light curves of
"selected comparison stars. The fourth panel of each set have three lines of blue, red and"
black colour for representing the comparative light curves. The blue and red lines are
"shown the field subtracted light curves of variable through comparison stars, whereas"
black line represents the difference of stellar magnitudes of selected comparison stars.
The constant spacing of comparative light curves are obtained for the stable compari-
"son stars, whereas the varied spacing of these curves confirms the signature of stellar"
"variability. Since, obtained information of stellar variability is rapidly changed with the"
"sky and weather conditions, therefore, we can not find the stellar variability of order of"
"mmag during the session of bright moon and observational nights, having fog and high"
"humidity. As a result, we have selected smoother light curve to compute the period of"
identified variable after the visual inspection of individual light curve of each observa-
tional night. This procedure becomes more reliable to evaluate the variable nature of
stellar members of studied clusters.
6. FFP of variables and their Pulsations
The light curves of stars contain aliases frequencies due to the interaction of pul-
sation of variables and the noise or instrumental errors. Such summation of noise and
pulsation signal of variable is removed through the utilization of comparison star dur-
ing differentiate photometry and becomes an effective method to reduce the uncertainty
of identify the pulsation signal in the scattered data points of light curves of variables.
"After confirming the pulsation signal of stars, we need a periodogram to estimate the"

"folded light curves of variables of DOLIDZE 14 have been depicted in the Figure 8(B),"
whereas these curves of variables of NGC 1960 are shown in the Figure 9. In these
"diagrams, the phase values of any variable at time t is defined to the decimal part of"
"(t − JD)/P, where JD and P represent the Initial Julian Date and Period of the vari-"
"ables. In this connection, the value of JD is 2455951.11037 and 2456943.35851 for"
NGC 1960 and DOLIDZE 14 respectively.
6.1. Smoothness of phase diagrams and change in amplitude of pulsation
The scattering of data points of original phase diagrams is too high to check and
"to shape the nature of stellar variability. Since, scattering of data points indicates that"
"curves also contained the information of instrumental errors and noise, therefore, the"
constraint of exact model does not possible to classify the nature of variability. To
"overcome from this problem, we are adopted the average moving procedure to con-"
"struct these diagrams. In this procedure, data points are arranged in increasing order"
"according to their phase values from 0 to 1. In this connection, the average values are"
"determined for sets of five data points such as 1-5, 2-6, 3-7 and so on. This procedure"
is repeated until we are not computed the average of last remaining five data points.
"However, a sufficient fraction of the amplitude of light curve also decreases during"
adoption of this procedure. The resultant phase-folded curves of variables are found to
"be smooth in comparison of original diagrams. As a result, we conclude that amplitude"
of stellar pulsation decreases with the increment of smoothness of the phase-folded di-
"agram of variables due to the moving average procedure. In the Figures 8(B) and 9(A),"
the depicted phase diagrams of variables constructed through the resultant data points
as found after applying the average moving procedure. The variation of stellar magni-
tudes of variables are shown in these phase diagrams after transforming mean standard
magnitudes of variables of NGC 1960 and mean apparent magnitudes of variables of
DOLIDZE 14 into zero.
6.2. Confirmation Index of Stellar Variability
We have computed amplitudes of identified variables by two different programs
"PerSea and PERIOD04. Other hand, we also computed the amplitudes of variables"
"through the visual inspection of phase-folded diagrams. In this connection, these val-"
"ues are listed in the table 3 and table 4. Since, the amplitudes of identified variables"
are varied to observational night to night due to observational conditions and aliases
"frequencies of noise, therefore, we are purposed to a parameter ’confirmation index’"
"C to verify the stellar variability and it is expressed as C = −∆P/P, where ∆P is the"
"difference of powers of variables through the PERIOD04 and Phase Curve, whereas,"
P is the power of variable through the PERIOD04. The values of information indexes
"of variables are given in the Table 4. The conformation index, having lower than 0.20,"
"shows the irregular type variables, whereas,confirmation index above 0.60 are shown"
strong signal of stellar variables either the transition of exo-planet or pulsating stars.
7. Conclusion
"Pulsations lead the information about the physical properties (amplitude, period"
"etc.) of stars, including their masses, luminosities, surface velocities, temperatures and"
"metallicities. In this paper, we analysis the time series data of 5 nights for NGC 1960"
"and one night for DOLIZE 14, to search out the short periodic variables within them."
The secondary standardization methodology (SSM) has been utilied to convert instru-
mental magnitudes of science frames into the stellar magnitude of reference catalogue.
This methodology depends on the apparent stellar magnitudes and the varying sky
conditions lead the variation of apparent magnitude of stars. The nature of variation
of apparent stellar magnitudes differs according to the values of stellar magnitudes.
"As a result, we found different sets of transformation coefficients for different science"
frames and leads different corrections of stellar magnitudes for different frames. In this
"connection, SSM method may be contained the aliases of varying sky conditions as"
"well as estimation errors of transformation coefficients. To overcome these difficulties,"
we are applied the differential photometry over absolute photometry and this procedure
defines as the differential-absolute photometry. The effective reduction of influenced of
sky conditions of observational night is the major advantage of this applied procedure.
"We are performed present analysis to search the short periodic variables, having period"
"less than 1 day. In this connection, we visually inspected the stellar light curves of 5"
observational nights for NGC 1960 and one observational night for DOLIDZE 14. By
"deep investigate of light curves of stars, a total of 18 and 4 variable stars are identified"
in the field of view of cluster NGC 1960 and DOLIDZE 14 respectively. Due to the ob-
"servational limitations of CCD camera of 1.04 m telescope at ARIES, there are a need"
of telescopic observations with a CCD camera of very high well capacity to carry out
the work of searching the signature of variability in brighter stars of NGC 1960. The
Fourier transformation technique is utilized to estimate the amplitudes and frequencies
"for regular variables, which use to compute the periods of stellar variable. Author also"
"confirm that ID 900 of NGC 1960 host a exo-planet, having orbital time about ∼ 99"
