"ABSTRACT
Whether tidal disruption events (TDEs) circularise or accrete directly as a highly
eccentric disc is the subject of current research and appears to depend sensitively on
the disc thermodynamics. In a previous paper we applied the theory of eccentric discs
to TDE discs using an α−prescription for the disc stress, which leads to solutions that
exhibit extreme, potentially unphysical, behaviour. In this paper we further explore the
dynamical vertical structure of highly eccentric discs using alternative stress models
that are better motivated by the behaviour of magnetic fields in eccentric discs. We find
that the presence of a coherent magnetic field has a stabilising effect on the dynamics
and can significantly alter the behaviour of highly eccentric radiation dominated discs.
We conclude that magnetic fields are important for the evolution of TDE discs."

1 INTRODUCTION
"Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are transient phenomena
where an object on a nearly parabolic orbit passes within
the tidal radius and is disrupted by the tidal forces, typ-
ically a star being disrupted by a supermassive black hole
(SMBH). Bound material from the disruption forms a highly
eccentric disc, which in the classic TDE model of Rees (1988)
are rapidly circularised as the material returns to pericentre.
It has, however, been proposed that circularisation in TDEs
may be inefficient resulting in the disc remaining highly ec-
centric (Guillochon et al. 2014; Piran et al. 2015; Krolik
et al. 2016; Svirski et al. 2017). In Lynch & Ogilvie (2020)
(henceforth Paper I) we presented a hydrodynamical model
of these highly eccentric discs applied to TDEs where circu-
larisation is inefficient."
"Two issues were highlighted in Paper I. One was con-
firming that radiation pressure dominated discs are ther-
mally unstable when the viscous stress scales with total pres-
sure in highly eccentric discs, a result that has long been
known for circular discs (Shakura & Sunyaev 1976; Pringle
1976; Piran 1978). Circular radiation pressure dominated
discs can be stabilised by assuming stress scales with gas
pressure (Meier 1979; Sakimoto & Coroniti 1981). For highly
eccentric discs it appears that the thermal instability is still
present when stress scales with gas pressure; however there
exists a stable radiation pressure dominated branch which"
? E-mail: eml52@cam.ac.uk
"is the outcome of the thermal instability. For typical TDE
parameters, this branch is very hot and often violates the
thin-disc assumptions."
"The second issue was the extreme behaviour that can
occur during pericentre passage. For the radiation pressure
dominated disc where stress scales with gas pressure the so-
lution is nearly adiabatic and undergoes extreme compres-
sion near pericentre. In models where the viscous stresses
contribute to the dynamics we typically found that the ver-
tical viscous stress is comparable to or exceeds the (total)
pressure, which is possibly problematic for the α-model as it
would indicate transonic turbulence. In some of the solutions
the vertical viscous stress can exceed the total pressure by
an order of magnitude, strongly violating the assumptions
of the α-model."
"In this paper we focus on the second of the two issues
by considering alternative turbulent stress models which are
better motivated by the physics of the underlying magnetic
field to see if this resolves some of the extreme behaviour
seen in the α-models. We will also see if alternative stress
models are more thermally stable than the α-model, al-
though it’s possible the solution to this issue is outside the
scope of a thin disc model ."
"Two additional physical effects, not present in an α-
model, may be important for regulating the extreme be-
haviour at pericentre. One is the finite response time of the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) (see for instance the
viscoelastic model of Ogilvie (2001) and discussion therein)
which means the viscous stress cannot respond instantly to"

"the rapid increase in pressure and velocity gradients dur-
ing pericentre passage, potentially weakening the viscous
stresses so they no longer exceed the pressure. Another is
the relative incompressibility of the magnetic field, com-
pared with the radiation or the gas, with the magnetic pres-
sure providing additional support during pericentre passage
which could prevent the extreme compression seen in some
models."
"Various attempts have been made to rectify some of
the deficiencies of the α−prescription using alternative clo-
sure models for the turbulent stress. Ogilvie (2000, 2001)
proposed a viscoelastic model for the dyadic part of the
Maxwell stress (i.e. the contribution from magnetic tension
BiBj"
"µ0
) to account for the finite response time of the MRI."
"It was shown in Ogilvie & Proctor (2003) that for incom-
pressible fluids there is an exact asymptotic correspondence
between MHD in the limit of large magnetic Reynolds num-
ber and viscoelastic fluids (specifically an Oldroyd-B fluid)
in the limit of large relaxation time. Ogilvie (2002) improved
upon the compressible viscoelastic model of Ogilvie (2000,
2001) by including an isotropic part to the stress to model
the effects of magnetic pressure and correcting the heating
rate so that total energy is conserved. Ogilvie (2003) pro-
posed solving for both the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses
and suggested a nonlinear closure model based on requiring
the turbulent stresses to exhibit certain properties (such as
positive definiteness, and relaxation towards equipartition
and isotropy) known from simulations and experiments."
"Simulations of MRI in circular discs typically find that
the magnetic pressure tends to saturate at about 10% of the
gas pressure. However in the local linear stability analysis
of Pessah & Psaltis (2005) the toroidal magnetic field only
stabilises the MRI when it is highly suprathermal (specifi-
cally when the Alfvén speed is greater than the geometric
mean of the sound speed and the Keplerian speed). Das
et al. (2018) confirmed this result persists in a global linear
eigenmode calculation. In light of this, Begelman & Pringle
(2007) have suggested that, for a strongly magnetised disc,
the viscous stress may scale with the magnetic pressure and
showed that such a disc would be thermally stable even when
radiation pressure dominates over gas pressure. Such a disc
was simulated by S"

"This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we dis-
cuss the geometry of eccentric discs and restate the coor-
dinate system of Ogilvie & Lynch (2019). In Section 3 we
derive the equations for the dynamical vertical structure, in-
cluding the effects of a Maxwell stress, in this coordinate sys-
tem. In Section 4 we consider a model with an α−viscosity
and a coherent magnetic field which obeys the ideal induc-
tion equation. In Section 5 we consider a nonlinear consti-
tutive model for the magnetic field. In our discussion we
discuss the stability of our solutions (Section 6.1) and the"
"possibility of dynamo action in the disc (6.2). We present
our conclusions in Section 7 and additional mathematical
details are in the appendices."
2 ORBITAL COORDINATES
"Similar to Paper I we assume the dominant motion in a
TDE disc consists of elliptical Keplerian orbits, subject to
relatively weak perturbations from relativistic precessional
effects, pressure and Maxwell stresses. This model is unlikely
to be applicable to TDEs where the tidal radius is compara-
ble to the gravitational radius owing to the strong relativistic
precession."
"Let (r, φ) be polar coordinates in the disc plane. The
polar equation for an elliptical Keplerian orbit of semimajor
axis a, eccentricity e and longitude of periapsis $ is"
"r =
a(1− e2)
1 + e cos f"
"where f = φ − $ is the true anomaly. A planar eccentric
disc involves a continuous set of nested elliptical orbits. The
shape of the disc can be described by considering e and
$ to be functions of a. The derivatives of these functions
are written as ea and $a, which can be thought of as the
eccentricity gradient and the twist, respectively. The disc
evolution is then described by the slow variation in time
of the orbital elements e and $ due to secular forces such
as pressure gradients in the disc and departures from the
gravitational field of a Newtonian point mass."
"In this work we adopt the (semimajor axis a, eccentric
anomaly E) orbital coordinate system described in Ogilvie
& Lynch (2019). The eccentric anomaly is related to the true
anomaly by"

"A local model of a thin, Keplerian eccentric disc was devel-
oped in Ogilvie & Barker (2014). In Paper I we developed a
purely hydrodynamic model, which included an α-viscosity
prescription along with radiative cooling, allowing for contri-
butions to the pressure from both radiation and the gas, in
the (a,E) coordinate system of Ogilvie & Lynch (2019). In
a similar vein we here develop a local model that allows for
a more general treatment of the turbulent/magnetic stress."

of the disc, H(t) is the dynamical vertical scaleheight of the
disc, and the quantities with tildes are normalized variables
that satisfy a standard dimensionless form of the equations
of vertical structure."
"In order to preserve separability the (modified) Maxwell
stress M ij must have the same vertical structure as the pres-
sure (M̃ = p̃)1. This assumption has a couple of important
consequences. It corresponds to a plasma-β, defined as the
ratio of hydrodynamic to magnetic pressure βm := p/pm,
independent of height. Additionally it has implications for
the realisability of M ij : for a large scale field we require
Mzz = 0 in order that the underlying magnetic field obeys
the solenoidal condition. For small scale/turbulent fields the
solenoidal condition instead implies the mean of Bz is inde-
pendent of height; however Mzz has the same vertical struc-
ture as pressure."

4 EFFECT OF MAGNETIC FIELDS
4.1 Magnetic fields in eccentric discs
"In Paper I we found that (when pv = pg) our radiation
dominated solutions exhibit extreme compression at peri-
centre, similar to the extreme behaviour of the adiabatic
solutions of Ogilvie & Barker (2014). Many of our solutions
with more moderate behaviour have strong viscous stresses
at pericentre which call into question the validity of the
α−prescription."
"What additional physical processes could reverse the
collapse of the fluid column and prevent the extreme com-
pression seen in the radiation dominated model? Can the col-
lapse be reversed without encountering unphysically strong
viscous stresses? An obvious possibility is the presence of a
large scale horizontal magnetic field within the disc which
will resist vertical compression. Such a field could be weak
for the majority of the orbit but, owing to the relative in-
compressibility of magnetic fields, become dynamically im-
portant during the maximum compression at pericentre. In
Appendix E we show that in an eccentric disc, a solution to
the steady ideal induction equation in an inertial frame is"

"Here BE is the component parallel to the orbital motion
(quasi-toroidal) and Bz is the vertical component. We use
quasi-poloidal to indicate the components Ba and Bz."
"The magnetic field of a star undergoing tidal disrup-
tion has been studied by Guillochon & McCourt (2017) and
Bonnerot et al. (2017). In these papers it was found that
the stretching of the fields during the disruption causes an
increase in the magnetic pressure from the field aligned with
the orbital direction. Meanwhile the gas pressure and mag-
netic pressure from the field perpendicular to the orbit drop.
Guillochon & McCourt (2017) found that this tends to re-
sult in the magnetic pressure from the parallel field becoming
comparable to the gas pressure. Similar results were found
in Bonnerot et al. (2017), although with a dependence on
the initial field direction. This supports our adopted field
configuration, with the vertical field set to zero. As the ver-
tical field does not contribute to the dynamics of the vertical
oscillator we can do so without loss of generality."

that the effects of the small-scale/turbulent magnetic field
can be modelled by an α-viscosity,"

some choice of pressure. As in Paper I we set the bulk vis-
cosity to zero (αb = 0)."
"As discussed in Section 3, in order to preserve separa-
bility of the equations we require BE0 (a, z̃) to depend on z̃
in such a way as to make βm independent of height. The di-
mensionless equations for the variation of the dimensionless

equations with low β◦m (i.e. strong magnetic fields through-
out the disc) as the method does not always converge to a
periodic solution (or at least takes an excessively long time
to do so). This is most likely due to the absence of dissipative
effects acting on the magnetic field, so any free oscillations
in the magnetic field are not easily damped out. We believe
that the quasiperiodic solutions we find for low β◦m are the
superposition of the forced solution and a free fast magne-
tosonic mode. For now we only consider values of β◦m which
successfully converge to a periodic solution."

similar to the moderately radiation pressure dominated hy-

the nearly adiabatic radiation dominated solution."
"Most of the solutions in Figures 1-3 are not sufficiently
radiation pressure dominated to represent most TDEs. Fig-
ures 4-6 show solutions which attain much higher βr. We see
it is possible to attain significantly radiation pressure dom-
inated solutions which do not possess the extreme variation
of the scale height around the orbit present in the hydro-
dynamic case. In particular, consider the green curve with

"◦
m = 0.005. Like the radiation dominated hydro-"
"dynamic solutions the solution with β◦r = 1, β
◦
m = 0.005"
"is nearly adiabatic; however magnetic pressure dominates
over radiation pressure during pericentre passage. This ad-
ditional support at pericentre prevents the extreme com-
pression, and resultant heating, seen in the hydrodynamic
model - resulting in more moderate variation of the scale
height around the orbit. Unlike the similarly radiation dom-
inated, unmagnetised, solutions considered in Paper I, this
solution remains consistent with the thin disc assumptions
for typical TDE parameters."
"It should be cautioned that the grey solution (with β◦r =
1, β◦m = 1) in Figures 4-6 has not converged. The magnetic
field is unimportant for this solution. Based on the radiation
dominated hydrodynamic models of Paper I, the disc with
β◦r = 1 will converge on a solution with βr much larger
than the βr ∼ 105 − 106 which were the most radiation
dominated, converged, solutions obtained in Paper I. As the
entropy gained per orbit is small compared to the entropy
in the disc, this will take a large number of orbits (> 10000
orbits) to converge, so the converged solution isn’t of much
interest when considering transient phenomena like a TDE."

"gests that dynamics of radiation pressure dominated TDEs
may be controlled by the magnetic field. Being the least
compressible pressure term, the magnetic pressure tends to
dominate at pericentre, even if it is fairly weak throughout
the rest of the disc. However for radiation dominated TDEs
pressure is only important near pericentre so even a weak
magnetic field will have a disproportionate contribution to
the dynamics. This suggests that ignoring even subdomi-
nant magnetic fields in TDE discs can lead to fundamental
changes to the TDE dynamics."
"While it is possible to find a combination of β◦r and β

"which yields a solution with the desired βr exhibiting “rea-
sonable” behaviour, it is not clear that the magnetic field
in the disc will always be strong enough to produce the de-

problem for β◦m."

tially too weak to stabilise against the thermal instability

in fact increases with time and remains close to that of the

field strength, and does not transition to a value consistent
with the green solution. This suggests that the solution is
sensitive to the path taken and that a magnetic field which
grows (from an initially weak seed field), in a nearly adia-
batic radiation pressure dominated disc, may not cause the
disc to collapse to the gas pressure dominated branch. This
is likely because the disc is very expanded meaning the mag-
netic field is still quite weak and incapable of influencing the

disc."

haviour as the nearly adiabatic radiation pressure dominated

when it scales with either of these pressures. Increasing the
magnetic field strength stabilises the “gas pressure domi-
nated” branch, where the magnetic field and viscous dissi-
pation become important. This branch can have pr � pg
around the entire orbit; this is similar to the behaviour of
the radiation pressure dominated hydrodynamic discs con-
sidered in Paper I with large αs."
"Figures 13-15 show the variation of the scale height, βr
and βm for a disc with pv = p + pm, αs = 0.1, αb = 0,
e = q = 0.9 and E0 = 0. Here we find that, with a strong
enough magnetic field, we can obtain thermally stable solu-
tions despite the dependence of the stress on the radiation
pressure. Generally for thermal stability the magnetic field
needs to dominate (over radiation pressure) over part of the
orbit. Having such a strong horizontal magnetic field over
a sizable fraction of the orbit may lead to flux expulsion
through magnetic buoyancy, an effect we do not treat here.
If the magnetic field is too weak, however, we encounter the
thermal instability similar to the hydrodynamic radiation
pressure dominated discs when pv = p."
"Part of the motivation for introducing the magnetic field
was to regularise some of the extreme behaviour encoun-
tered at pericentre. Unfortunately, while the prescriptions
pv = pm and pv = p+ pm are promising as a way of taming
the thermal instability they exhibit the same extreme be-
haviour that the hydrodynamic models possess. In particu-
lar when pv = pm the solutions exhibit extreme compression
at pericentre, while for the more magnetised discs (with ei-
ther pv = pm or pv = p+ pm) we again encounter the issue
of the viscous stresses being comparable to or exceeding the
pressure (including the magnetic pressure). See, for exam-
ple, Figure 16 which shows that the viscous stresses exceed
the magnetic, gas and radiation pressures during pericentre
passage."

"5 NONLINEAR CONSTITUTIVE MODEL FOR THE
MAGNETIC FIELD"
"The model considered in Section 4 has a number of draw-
backs. The first is that the viscous stress and the coherent
magnetic field are treated as separate physical effects when
they are in fact intrinsically linked (although subsection 4.3
partially addresses this issue). Secondly, the turbulent mag-
netic field, responsible for the effective viscosity, cannot store
energy. Lastly the model neglects resistive effects and, while
nonideal MHD effects would be weak if the flow were strictly
laminar, the turbulent cascade should always move magnetic
energy to scales on which nonideal effects become important.
Thus the coherent magnetic field should be affected by some
dissipative process."
"To address these issues we consider a model of the (mod-
ified) Maxwell stress where the magnetic field is forced by a
turbulent emf and relaxes to a isotropic field proportional to
some pressure pv on a timescale τ . While the “turbulence”
in this model acts to isotropise the magnetic field, the pres-"

the constitutive model here. Compared with the ideal induc-
tion equation model the plasma-β is more uniform around

magnetic field during pericentre passage."

there is no obvious justification. However, instead of stabil-
ising the thermal instability, it is possible to delay its onset
by choosing a small enough De0, so that the thermal run-
away occurs on a timescale much longer than the orbital
time (occurring after ∼ 1000 orbits). However, these solu-
tions never settle down into a periodic (or nearly periodic)"

"solution and instead have a long phase of quasi-periodic evo-
lution, where the mean scale height remains close to its ini-
tial value, before eventually experiencing thermal runaway.
A quasi-periodic solution of our model is not self consistent,
so the possibility that the thermal instability is delayed in
the nonlinear-constitutive MRI model needs to be explored
using an alternative method."
"The possibility that the thermal instability stalls or is
delayed has some support from simulations looking at the
thermal stability of MRI active discs (Jiang et al. 2013;
Ross et al. 2017). In both these papers it was found that
the disc was quasi-stable, with thermal instability occur-
ring when a particularly large turbulent fluctuation caused
a strong enough perturbation away from the equilibrium.
The (modified) Maxwell stress considered here is equal to
the expectation value of a modified Maxwell stress which is
stochastically forced by fluctuation with amplitude propor-
tional to pv (see Equation E5 of Appendix E and discussion
therein), so it is possible that our stress model captures the
thermal quasi-stability seen in Jiang et al. (2013) and Ross
et al. (2017) in some averaged sense. The possibility that the
thermal instability is delayed or slowed is particularly rele-
vant for TDEs which are inherently transient phenomena –
if the timescale for thermal runaway is made long enough
then eccentric TDE discs maybe thermally stable over the
lifetime of the disc."
6 DISCUSSION
6.1 Stability of the solutions
"As discussed in Paper I, one advantage of our solution
method is that the solutions it finds are typically nonlin-
ear attractors (or at least long lived transients) and so are
stable against (nonlinear) perturbations to the solution vari-
ables (H,Ḣ, T and M ij when present). Generally we expect
such perturbations to damp on the thermal time or faster.
Instabilities such as the thermal instability manifest as a
failure to converge to a 2π−periodic solution."
"For the ideal induction equation model, our method
cannot tell us about the stability of the solution to pertur-
bations to the horizontal magnetic field. Showing this would
require a separate linear stability analysis. Perturbations to
the vertical field typically have no influence on the dynamics
of the disc vertical structure."
"However, for the constitutive model, perturbations to
the magnetic field are encapsulated in perturbations to M ij"
"so these solutions are stable against (large scale) pertur-
bations to the magnetic field. This is most likely because,
unlike the ideal induction equation, dissipation acts on the
magnetic field."
"Our solution method doesn’t tell us about the stability
of our solutions to short wavelength (comparable or less than
the scale height) perturbations to our system. So our disc
structure could be unstable to such perturbations. Like the
hydrodynamic solutions in Paper I, it is likely our discs are
unstable to the parametric instability (Papaloizou 2005a,b;
Wienkers & Ogilvie 2018; Barker & Ogilvie 2014; Pierens
et al. 2020). Additionally if, as assumed, turbulence in highly
eccentric discs is caused by the MRI then there must be
perturbations to the magnetic field in the ideal induction
equation model which are unstable."
"Interestingly the simulations of S
↪"
"adowski (2016) found
that the strength of turbulence in magnetised and unmag-
netised TDE discs is broadly comparable, something that
would not be expected in a circular disc. S"
"↪
adowski (2016)"
"suggested that a hydrodynamic instability might be respon-
sible for the disc turbulence. The discs considered by S"
"dowski (2016) still have appreciable eccentricity at the end
of their simulation (with e ≈ 0.2) so an obvious contender
would be the parametric instability feeding off the disc ec-
centricity and breathing mode."
6.2 Resistivity and dynamo action
"Even when the magnetic field in our models does a good
job of resisting the collapse of the disc, the stream will still
be highly compressed at pericentre. The highly compressed
flow combined with a very strong field (with βm � 1) makes
the nozzle a prime site for magnetic reconnection. This will
require that magnetic field lines on neighbouring orbits can
have opposite polarities. Our solutions are agnostic to the
magnetic field polarity and, in principle, support this possi-
bility."
"The simulations of Guillochon & McCourt (2017) sug-
gest that the initial magnetic field in the disc will be (quasi-
)toroidal with periodic reversals in direction. When such
a field is compressed both horizontally and vertically dur-
ing pericentre passage, neighbouring toroidal magnetic field
lines of opposite polarity can undergo reconnection, gener-
ating a quasi-poloidal field. We thus have a basis for an
eccentric α − Ω dynamo, where strong reconnection in the
nozzle creates quasi-poloidal field, which in turn creates a
source term in the quasi-toroidal induction equation from
the shearing of this quasi-radial field (see Appendix C). In
highly eccentric TDE discs, with their large vertical and hor-
izontal compression, this dynamo could potentially be quite
strong."
"The constitutive model we considered in Section 5 im-
plicitly possesses a dynamo through the source term propor-
tional to pv. This is a small scale dynamo which arises from
the action of the turbulent velocity field and will be limited
by the kinetic energy in the turbulence. A dynamo closed by
reconnection in the nozzle would be a large scale dynamo
and the coherent field produced could potentially greatly
exceed equipartition with the turbulent velocity field."
"Lastly reconnection sites can accelerate charged parti-
cles. We would therefore expect that TDEs in which there is
a line of sight to the pericentre should include a flux of high-
energy particles. From most look angles the line of sight to
the pericentre“bright point”will be blocked (see also Zanazzi
& Ogilvie (2020)). This will both block the X-ray flux from
the disc and any particles accelerated by reconnection in the
nozzle. Hence these high energy particles should only be seen
in X-ray bright TDEs."
7 CONCLUSION
"In this paper we considered alternative models of the
Maxwell stress from the standard α−prescription applied
to highly eccentric TDE discs. In particular we focus on the
effects of the coherent magnetic field on the dynamics. We"

Magnetic fields in eccentric TDE Discs 13
"consider two separate stress models: an α−disc with an ad-
ditional coherent magnetic field obeying the ideal induction
equation and a nonlinear constitutive (viscoelastic) model
of the magnetic field. In summery our results are"
"1) The coherent magnetic field in both models has a sta-
bilising effect on the dynamics, making the gas pressure
dominated branch stable at larger radiation pressures and
reducing or removing the extreme variation in scale height
around the orbit for radiation pressure dominated solutions."
"2) The coherent magnetic field is capable of reversing the
collapse at pericentre without the presumably unphysically
strong viscous stresses seen in some of the hydrodynamic
models."
"3) For the radiation pressure dominated ideal induction
equation model with a moderate magnetic field the dynamics
of the scale height is set by the magnetic field (along with
gravity and vertical motion) and doesn’t feel the effects of
gas or radiation pressure. This is because magnetic pressure
dominates during pericentre passage which is the only part
of the orbit where pressure is important."
"At present the behaviour of magnetic fields in eccen-
tric discs is an understudied area. Our investigation suggests
that magnetic fields can play an important role in TDE discs
and that further work in this area is needed."

APPENDIX A: PROPERTIES OF OUR STRESS MODEL
"In this appendix we show some important properties of our constitutive model for the Maxwell stress. Restated here for clarity,
our model for the (modified) Maxwell stress is"
"+ τDM ij = Bpvgij , (A1)"
where pv is some pressure which controls the magnitude of the magnetic fluctuations. The Deborah number is given by
"De = τn = De0
n"
"√
pv
M
, (A2)"
"where Ωz =
√
GM•/r3 and De0 is a dimensionless constant. This matches the decay term in the compressible version of"
Ogilvie (2003).
A1 Viscoelastic behaviour
"This model is part of a large class of possible viscoelastic models for M ij . The elastic limit τ → ∞ of this equation is
fairly obvious, corresponding to a magnetic field which obeys the ideal induction equation through the “freezing in” of M ij"
"(DM ij = 0). However, to obtain the viscous behaviour responsible for the effective viscosity of circular accretion discs requires
more work. The viscous limit is obtained when De � 1. For simplicity, in what follows, we shall assume τ and pv are
independent of the magnetic field (M ij)."
"We propose a series expansion in τ ,"
"∞∑
k=0"
"ij
k . (A3)"
"This expansion is only likely to be valid in the short τ limit and may break down for material variations on timescales shorter
than τ . With that caveat we can find a series solution for equation A1,"
"= B
∞∑
k=0"
(−τD)kpvgij . (A4)
Keeping the lowest order terms in the expansion we have
= Bpvgij − BτD(pvgij) +O(τ2) . (A5)
"The lowest order term is an isotropic stress and evidently a form of magnetic pressure. The operator D = D when acting on
a scalar and when acting on the metric tensor Dgij = −2Sij + 2∇kukgij . Using the product rule,"
"M
ij ≈ Bpvgij + 2BτpvSij − 2Bτ(pv∇kuk +Dpv)gij"
"= Bpvgij + 2BτpvSij + 2Bτ
(("
"∂pv
∂ ln ρ"
"− pv
)
∇kukgij − 2Bτ"
"(
∂pv
∂s"
"(Ds) g
ij"
".
(A6)"
"So the first O(1) term gives rise to a magnetic pressure, the first O(τ) term is a shear viscous stress, the second is a bulk
viscous stress and the final term is an additional nonadiabatic correction which has no obvious analogue in the standard
viscous or magnetic models. Higher order terms contain time derivatives of the pressure pv and the velocity gradients ∇iuj .
This dependence produces a memory effect in the fluid causing the dynamics of the fluid to depend on its history. The fluid
has a finite memory and becomes insensitive to (“forgets about”) its state at times & τ in the past."
"If τ and pv depend on M
ij then the terms in equation A6 are modified. However the equation still decomposes into an"
"isotropic magnetic pressure term, a shear stress term ∝ Sij , a bulk stress term ∝ ∇kukgij and a non-adiabatic term ∝ (Ds) gij
(as in equation A6)."
A2 Realisability
In addition to its behaviour in the viscous and elastic limits another necessary property of a model of a Maxwell stress is its
"realisability from actual magnetic fields. As M ij = B
iBj"
"µ0
, M ij must be positive semi-definite. Thus for all positive semi-definite"
"initial conditions M ij(0) our constitutive model equation A1 must conserve the positive semi-definite character of M ij . This
is equivalent to requiring that the quadratic form Q = M ijYiYj satisfy Q ≥ 0 for all vectors Yi, at all points in the fluid."
"We will show by contradiction that an initially positive semi-definite M ij cannot evolve into one that is not positive
semi-definite. Suppose, to the contrary, that at some point in the flow Q < 0 for some vector Xi at some time after the initial"
"MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2019)"
Magnetic fields in eccentric TDE Discs 15
"state. Then let us consider a smooth, evolving vector field Yi that matches the vector Xi at the given point and time. The
corresponding quadratic form Q is then a scalar field that evolves according to"
DQ = YiYjDM ij +M ijD(YiYj)
"=
(
BpvY 2 −Q"
")
/τ +M"
"ijDYiYj .
(A7)"
"By assumption, Q is initially positive and evolves continuously to a negative value at the given later time. Therefore Q
must pass through zero at some intermediate time, which we denote by t = 0 without loss of generality. We can also assume,
without loss of generality, that the vector field evolves according to DYi = 0, which means that it is advected by the flow.
The equation for Q then becomes"
"DQ =
(
BpvY 2 −Q"
")
/τ , (A8)"
"where we have made use of the fact that D = D when acting on a scalar. Within the disc we expect pv > 0, additionally as
M ij is positive semi-definite M ≥ 0. Thus at t = 0, Q = 0 and the time derivative of Q is given by"
DQ|t=0 = BpvY 2/τ ≥ 0 . (A9)
"This contradicts the assumption that Q passes through zero from positive to negative at t = 0. We conclude that M ij remains
positive semi-definite if it is initially so."
A3 Energy Conservation
"In order that the interior of our disc conserve total energy we need to derive the appropriate magnetic heating/cooling rate
so that energy lost/gained by the magnetic field is transferred to/from the thermal energy. The MHD total energy equation
with radiative flux is"

"this contains a term that grows linearly in time. This means that Bη can be expected to grow linearly in the presence of a
“quasiradial” field."
"The ideal induction equation can be written in tensorial form using the operator D as D(BiBj) = 0 (Ogilvie 2001). The
solution to this equation for a horizontally invariant laminar flow (along with the solenoidal condition) in an eccentric shearing
box is given by Equation C10. In the limit τ →∞ the Maxwell stress obeys DM ij = 0 and the corresponding magnetic field

APPENDIX D: DERIVATION OF THE IDEAL INDUCTION EQUATION MODEL
"We here derive the full set of equations for a horizontally invariant laminar flow in an eccentric disc with a magnetic field.
Assume the magnetic field can be split into mean and fluctuating parts:"
B = B̄ + b . (D1)
"In order that we have a steady field we require Bξ = 0, otherwise there is a source term in the η component of the induction
equation from the winding up of the “quasiradial” (Bξ) field. This trivially satisfies the ξ component of the induction equation.
We assume the fluctuating field b is caused by the MRI and its effect on the dynamics is captured by the turbulent stress
prescription. Thus keeping the mean field only and dropping the overbar the equations for a horizontally invariant laminar
flow in a magnetised disc in the eccentric shearing coordinates of Ogilvie & Barker (2014) are the η and ζ components of the
induction equation"

"where Tension are the magnetic tension terms. The solenoidal condition gives ∂ζB
ζ = 0, thus Bζ is independent of ζ and the"
magnetic tension terms in the vertical momentum equation are zero. Finally the thermal energy equation is
"Dp = −Γ1p (∆ + ∂ζvζ) + (Γ3 − 1)(H− ∂ζFζ) , (D5)"
"and we must specify the equation of state. Making use of the solutions to the induction equation (Equation C13), we obtain

"with v2 = |vorbital|2 is the square of the magnitude of the orbital velocity.
The contribution of the vertical component of the magnetic field to the magnetic pressure is independent of the height in"
"the disc (in order to satisfy the solenoidal condition) and makes no contribution to the dynamics of the vertical structure. As
such we neglect the vertical component of the magnetic field from this point on. The magnetic pressure simplifies to"

"On a circular orbit v2 = (na)2 so that pm ∝ (JH)−2 ∝ ρ2 and the magnetic pressure behaves like perfect gas with γ = 2.
Thus, for a magnetised radiation-gas mixture, the magnetic field is the least compressible constituent of the plasma and will
be the dominant source of pressure when the plasma is sufficiently compressed. On an eccentric orbit there is an additional
source of variability owing to the stretching and compressing of the field by the periodic variation of the velocity tangent to
the field lines."

APPENDIX E: MICROPHYSICAL BASIS OF THE NONLINEAR CONSTITUTIVE MODEL
"Several authors have looked at the possibility of using stochastic calculus as a model of the MRI (Janiuk & Misra 2012; Ross
et al. 2017). Here we assume the magnetic field satisfies a Langevin equation:"
"dB + (B · ∇u−B∇ · u)dt = −λdt+ FdX , (E1)"
"where X is a Wiener process in the sense of Ito calculus. The left hand side of this equation is the ideal terms in the
induction equation, the −λdt term models damping from resistivity, while the FdX represents stochastic forcing by a turbulent
electromotive force, where F is some scale factor controlling the strength of the forcing. In the absence of a mean velocity
field u, the magnetic field would evolve like a damped Brownian motion."
"Introducing 〈·〉 to denote the expectation value, we have the standard result for the Wiener process X,"
"〈XiXj〉 = gijt , (E2)"
"where gij is the inverse metric tensor. So X is a statistically isotropic vector field. Physically, in this model, turbulent
fluctuations act to isotropise the magnetic field. The orbital shear can feed on these fluctuations and induce a highly anisotropic
magnetic field that is predominantly aligned/antialigned with the orbital motion. The change in the Maxwell stress can be
obtained from Ito’s formula,"

"We should caution that this procedure may not be valid if F depends on B. Henceforth we shall drop the angle brackets on

"What’s left now is to determine appropriate forms for λi and F . A priori there is no obvious way of directly obtaining
these using the underlying physics. However, in a similar vein to Ogilvie (2003), we can place certain constraints on the
possible forms of λi and F . In particular on dimensional grounds they both have dimensions of magnetic field over time. λi
transforms as a vector and F transforms as a scalar. Other than this we assume:"
"1) Following Ogilvie (2003) neither λi or F directly know about the mean velocity field, although they could know about
the various orbital frequencies."
"2) F is non-negative.
3) There is no preferred direction."
"This leaves us to construct a vector and a scalar which have the same dimensions as magnetic field over time from Bi, pg,
pr, ρ, µ0 along with the vertical and horizontal epicyclic frequencies and mean motion Ωz, κ, n. Immediately it is apparent
that the the only vectorial quantity we have available is the magnetic field Bi. As such λi must have the form"

"where τ is some relaxation time which can depend on the mean field quantities. Next on dimensional grounds ρ cannot appear
in either F or τ and the other terms must only appear in the combination |B|, µ0pg and µ0pr along with the various orbital
frequencies. Without loss of generality we can write"
"F =

our equation for M ij becomes"

"where we must specify how the relaxation time and fluctuation pressure depend on M , pg, pr and the orbital frequencies in
order to close the model."
