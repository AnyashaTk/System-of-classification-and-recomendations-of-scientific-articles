"Lile Wang1, Fei Dai2"
ABSTRACT
The metastable Helium (He∗) lines near 10830 Å are ideal probes of atmospheric erosion–a common
phenomenon of close-in exoplanet evolution. A handful of exoplanet observations yielded well-resolved
"He∗ absorption features in transits, yet they were mostly analyzed with 1D isothermal models prescrib-"
ing mass-loss rates. This work devises 3D hydrodynamics co-evolved with ray-tracing radiative transfer
and non-equilibrium thermochemsitry. Starting from the observed stellar/planetary properties with
"reasonable assumptions about the host’s high energy irradiation, we predict from first principle the"
"mass loss rate, the temperature and ionization profiles, and 3D outflow kinematics. Our simulations"
well reproduce the observed He∗ line profiles and light curves of WASP-69b. We further investigate the
dependence of He∗ observables on simulation conditions and host radiation. The key findings are: (1)
"Simulations reveal a photoevaporative outflow (∼ 0.5 M⊕ Gyr−1) for WASP-69b without a prominent
comet-like tail, consistent with the symmetric transit shape (Vissapragada et al. 2020). (2) 3D sim-"
"ulations are mandatory for hydrodynamic features, including Coriolis force, advection, and kinematic"
line broadening. (3) EUV (> 13.6 eV) photons dominate photoevaporative outflows and populate He∗
via recombination; FUV is also detrimental by destroying He∗; X-ray plays a secondary role. (4) K
"stars hit the sweet spot of EUV/FUV balance for He∗ line observation, while G and M stars are also"
worthy targets. (5) Stellar flars create characteristic responses in the He∗ line profiles.

1. INTRODUCTION
One of the most exciting discoveries in exoplanetary
sciences in recent years is that the radii of sub-Neptune
planets have a bimodal distribution (Fulton et al. 2017).
The prevailing explanation is the atmospheric erosion by
"either photoevaporation (e.g. Owen & Wu 2013, 2017)"
or core-powered mass loss (Ginzburg et al. 2018; Gupta
"& Schlichting 2019, 2020). In any case, the promi-"
nence of the radius gap implies that atmospheric ero-
sion is probably a stage of evolution that close-in exo-
planets very commonly go through. Since the discovery
of the Lyman α (Lyα hereafter) transit of hot Jupiter
"HD209458 b (Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003), Lyα has been a"
workhorse for studying atmospheric erosion (e.g. Lecave-
lier Des Etangs et al. 2010; Kulow et al. 2014). How-
"ever, Lyα has some unavoidable limitations, namely, it"
"1 Center for Computational Astrophysics, Flatiron Institute,
New York, NY 10010; lwang@flatironinstitute.org"
"2 Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences,
California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125"
"is heavily contaminated by geocoronal emission, and in-"
terstellar absorption saturating the very center of the
"line (e.g. Ehrenreich et al. 2015). Moreover, one has to"
go space to observe this UV transition. These effects
significantly limit the number of systems for which we
can study Lyα transits.
"Besides Lyα , helium lines are emerging as promis-"
ing outflow indicators. The 23S state of helium is often
"called the “metastable state” (He∗ hereafter), because"
"the 23S→ 11S transition is a magnetic dipole process
with a slow spontaneous decay rate of A ' 1.3×10−3 s−1
(Drake 1971, 2006). Meanwhile, the transition between"
the lower 23S and the upper 23PJ states of helium con-
"sists of three lines with A > 107 s−1, whose wavelengths"
"in vacuum are 10832.08 Å (for the J = 0 upper state),"
"10833.24 Å (J = 1), and 10833.33 Å (J = 2) respec-"
tively. These lines are often referred to as “He i 10830 Å
"lines” or the “metastable helium lines”, as they are ra-"
diatively decoupled from the ground state. The abun-
"dance of helium, the absence of geocoronal or intersteal-"
"lar containmination, the longevity of metastable state,"
and observability from the ground together enabled the
He∗ lines as an excellent probe of ionized flows in various
"scenarios of astrophysics, including quasars (e.g. Leighly"
"et al. 2011), stellar atmospheres and outflows (see Ed-"
"wards et al. 2003, and references to the article), and T"
Tauri stars (Kwan et al. 2007).
"Over the years, researchers have proposed the He∗"
lines as a tracer of mass loss of close-in exoplanets (Sea-
ger & Sasselov 2000; Turner et al. 2016; Oklopčić & Hi-
rata 2018). It was the secure detection of Spake et al.
(2018) that revitalized interest in this unique transi-
"tion. At the time of writing this paper, several close-in"
exoplanets have transmission He∗ line profiles resolved
by ground-based spectrographs (e.g. Allart et al. 2018;
Nortmann et al. 2018; Salz et al. 2018; Kirk et al. 2020;
"Ninan et al. 2020). More recently, Vissapragada et al."
(2020) custom made a narrow band filter specifically for
the He∗ transitions on the diffuser-based photometric
system on Palomar/WIRC. The resultant precise light
curves of the He∗ is complementary to the line profiles
from the near-infradred spectrographs. A lot of infor-
mation about atmospheric outflow is hiding in these line
profiles and light curves waiting to be interpreted. The
models that are commonly used in the literature to inter-
pret these He∗ observations are 1D spherical symmetric
models that are isothermal (Oklopčić & Hirata 2018;
"Oklopčić 2019; Palle et al. 2020), or have prescribed"
heating efficiency (Lampón et al. 2020). The model
"is widely recognized for its simplicity and effectiveness,"
"however it has to prescribe, rather than predict, a mass"
loss rate or a temperature profile.
"In this work, we build upon our previous model that"
"conducts hydrodynamics, self-consistent thermochem-"
"istry, and ray-tracing radiative transfer to study the"
photoevaporation of sub-Neptune planets (Wang & Dai
"2018, WD18 hereafter). We have streamlined the code"
so that it is sufficiently fast to run in 3D to fully capture
"outflow dynamics, and added various processes that are"
relevant to the (de)population of He∗. We will show
in this paper that using the observed stellar/planetary
properties and making reasonable estimate of the high
energy spectral energy distribution (SED) about the
"host star, our model can predict mass loss rate, the tem-"
"perature profile, the ionization states, and synthesize the"
observed He∗ line observables from first principles.
"In this first work of a series, we focus on WASP-69b,"
which is one of the first detections of He∗ line absorption
with well-resolved line profile (Nortmann et al. 2018).
Acknowledging the many limitations of a 1D isother-
"mal model, Nortmann et al. (2018) did not tie their He∗"
line observation with a theoretical model. Instead they
"only reported what the data showed directly. Notably,"
Nortmann et al. (2018) reported an asymmetric transit
profile characterized by a longer-than-expected egress
that could be caused by a comet-like tail associated with
"the mass loss. However, Vissapragada et al. (2020) sug-"
gests a symmetric shape of transit using better-sampled
light curves with higher precision and signal-to-noise ra-
tio (SNR). Another interesting point about WASP-69b
is the apparent temporal variability of the He∗ transit
depth seen in Nortmann et al. (2018). We will try to un-
derstand these observations of WASP-69b in the frame-
"work of our 3D hydrodynamic simulations. Afterwards,"
we will use WASP-69 as a fiducial case to investigate
"the impact of dimensionality, XUV flux level, and host"
spectral types on the observables of the He∗ lines.
"This paper is structured as follows. §2 describes our
methods of numerical simulations and synthetic obser-"
"vations. In §3, we present a fiducial model of WASP-69b
that well reproduces all current observations. Based on"
"this model, §4 studies how various system parameters
impact the rate of photoevaporation and He∗ observ-"
"ables. §5 explores the possibility that stellar flare may
cause the observed temporal variability of WASP-69b."
§6 summarizes the findings of this paper.
2. METHODS
2.1. Basic Setup
We conceptually divided a planet into four regions:
"(1) a dense core, (2) a convective inner atmosphere, (3)"
a quasi-isothermal outer atmosphere with equilibrium
temperature Teq and (4) an outflowing region irradiated
by high energy photons (e.g. Rafikov 2006; Ginzburg
et al. 2016; Owen & Wu 2016). The equilibrium tem-
"perature Teq satisfies,"
"Teq ' 886 K
(
L∗
L�"
")1/4 ( a
0.1 AU"
")−1/2
, (1)"
"where L∗ is the bolometric luminosity of the star, and"
a is the semi-major axis of the planetary orbit. Our
"simulations will focus on regions (3) and (4), whereas"
the structure of regions (1) and (2) provide the correct
boundary conditions crucial for correctly reproducing
the measured mass and radius of the planet. We re-
fer the reader to Appendix A for the details of how we
set up the internal structures of our planet and resultant
boundary conditions for our simulations.
We characterize the high energy radiation spectral en-
ergy distribution (SED) of the host star with 5 differ-
ent characteristic energy bins: (1) hν = 2 eV for in-
"frared, optical and near ultraviolet (NUV) photons, (2)"
hν = 7 eV for “soft” far ultraviolet (FUV) photons that
"can photoionize He∗, (3) hν = 12 eV for the Lyman-"
Werner band FUV photons that can photodissociate
"molecular hydrogen, (4) hν = 20 eV for “soft” extreme"
ultraviolet (soft EUV) photons that can ionize hydrogen
"but not helium, (5) hν = 40 eV for hard EUV photons"
"that ionize hydrogen and helium, and (6) hν = 3 keV"
for the X-ray.
Our simulation combines ray-tracing radiative trans-
"fer, real-time non-equilibrium thermochemistry, and full"
hydrodynamics calculations (based on a higher order
Godunov hydrodynamic solver Athena++; Stone et al.
2020). The simulation is mostly based on our WD18
work with a few modifications and improvements added
for the higher dimensionality and the inclusion of He∗.
2.2. Geometry and Boundary Conditions
"The density distribution, temperature profile and the"
dynamics of outflowing atmosphere all play a part in
the He∗ observables. To capture the outflow dynamics
"accurately, simulations should include the gravity of the"
star and the planet and the effects of orbital motion:
"the centrifugal and Coriolis forces. Therefore, 3D simu-"
lations are required. Given its short orbital period and
"observed radial velocities (Anderson et al. 2014), we as-"
sume that WASP-69b is tidally locked and circularized.
Our simulation is run in a co-rotating frame centered
on the planet. We adopt a spherical polar coordinate
"(r, θ, φ) with θ = 0 pointing towards the host star and"
φ = 0 pointing in the direction of orbital motion.
"The mesh covers the domain (r, θ, φ) ∈ [rin, rout] ⊗
[0, π] ⊗ [0, π]. Planet-specific radial boundaries rin and
rout usually extend from the the base of the quasi-"
isothermal layer to a relatively large radii (150R⊕ in this
case) such that the density/opacity drops low enough.
The radial grids are placed logarithmically to strategi-
"cally capture the steep change of density, while latitu-"
dinal and azimuthal grids are spaced evenly. Reflecting
"boundary conditions are enforced at the r = rin, φ = 0"
"and φ = π boundaries, while the r = rout boundary is"
"an outflowing boundary. The θ = 0, θ = π boundaries"
are polar wedges to avoid coordinate singularity. The
"whole mesh, with its polar axis always pointing towards"
"the host star, co-rotates with the orbital motion and the"
rotation of the tidally-locked planet.
"In a 3D spherical polar mesh, the grids near the po-"
"lar axis are narrow in the azimuthal direction (δxφ '
rcc sin θccδφ; subscripts “cc” stand for “cell center”)."
This can result in highly non-unitary aspect ratios
"(δxθ ' rccδθ), and a stringent Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy
(CFL) condition. We thus introduce an adaptive “mesh"
coarsening” technique for the azimuthal grids near the
"poles. Without any violations of conservation laws, the"
effective aspect ratio of the high-latitude zones become
close to one and the timestep constraints imposed by
CFL condition is not as severe (see also Nakamura et al.
2019; Müller et al. 2019). This helps to greatly speed
up our model.
2.3. He∗ in non-LTE Thermochemistry
Our simulation includes a non-local-thermodynamic-
equilibrium reaction network that coevolves with the hy-
drodynamics (see WD18 for detail). With the addition
of the metastable state of neutral helium and all relevant
reactions that populate and de-populate this state (see
Oklopčić & Hirata 2018 and references therein). Our
reaction network now has 26 thermochemical “species”
"(24 chemical species in WD18, He∗, and internal energy"
"density) and 135 reactions such as ionization, recom-"
"bination, collisional (de-)excitation, photodissociation,"
and cooling and heating processes. The ordinary differ-
ential equations (ODEs) of the thermochemical network
were solved efficiently using the semi-implicit method
specially optimized for the graphics processing units
(GPUs). The resultant efficiency allows us to coevolve
"the hydrodynamics with the thermodynamics, rather"
than including thermodynamics as a post-processing
"step that is often done in the literature. Again, we refer"
interested readers to WD18 for more details.
2.4. Synthetic Observations
We synthesize both the transmission line profiles
(Nortmann et al. 2018) and the narrow-band light curves
(Vissapragada et al. 2020) of He∗ transitions using our
simulations. At each wavelength λ and a particular or-
"bital phase, the optical depth along a line of sight (LoS"
"hereafter) is given by,"
τ(λ; Φ) =
"∫
|dx| n(He∗;x; Φ)"
"σi[λ; n̂LoS · v(x; Φ), T (x; Φ)] .
(2)"
where we have transformed from our planet-centered co-
ordinate systems in the simulations to a star-centered
coordinate system for the synthetic observations. Thus
x and v are the position and velocity vector measured
from the host star. The integration goes along the des-
"ignated LoS, and the summation index i runs over He∗’s"
three lines with different upper state quantum number
J . The cross-section σi is assumed to be a Voigt profile
"which convolves the intrinsic Lorentz profile (γ = A/4π,"
"A = 1.0216× 107 s−1; see Drake 2006) with a Gaussian
profile from thermal broadening at temperature T (x)."
This Voigt profile is shifted by the local bulk velocity
including orbital motion and outflow kinematics and the
projection onto the LoS n̂LoS · v(x).
This integration is performed for all relevant LoS that
originate from the surface of the host star:
"�(λ; Φ) = 1−
∫"
"dΣ Se−τ(λ;Φ) , (3)"
"where �(λ) is the relative extinction at wavelength λ,"
"S(λ) is the normalized surface brightness (
∫"
dΣS(λ) =
1) of the star after accounting for limb darkening and
stellar rotation. The integral runs through the entire
projected stellar surface.
�(λ; Φ) is the absorption line profile as a function of
wavelength and orbital phase (time). We mimic what
observers often do in He∗ observations i.e. time aver-
aging �(λ; Φ) over the entire transit event from nominal
"ingress to egress (tii through tiii)
1. The outcome ∆�(λ)"
is a line profile of excess absorption to be compared with
observations directly.
We report a number of summary statistics including
"the equivalent widths 〈Wλ〉 ≡
∫"
"∆�(λ) dλ, the radial ve-"
locity shift of the absorption peak ∆vpeak and the full-
width-half-maximum (FWHM) of the absorption line
profile. These summary statistics help us to compare
between models and observations efficiently and are less
"prone to measurement uncertainty, bad pixels and other"
instrumental effects.
"Finally, we integrated �(λ; Φ) multiplied by a filter"
bandpass function over λ. The result is a transit light
"curve near the He∗ transitions. In this work, we use"
the bandpass function provided by Vissapragada et al.
(2020) for a direct comparison with their results.
3. FIDUCIAL MODEL OF WASP-69b
"In this section, we will show how we arrived at a fidu-"
cial model that gives rather remarkable agreement with
the observed He∗ line profiles (Nortmann et al. 2018)
and light curves (Vissapragada et al. 2020). We note
that our 3D hydrodynamic model is not fast enough 2
for a full exploration of the parameter space with tech-
niques such Markov Chain Monte Carlo or even simple
gradient descent. Instead we had to rely on the reported
system parameters and making reasonable assumption
as well as hand tuning the high energy SED of the host
"star. We will see shortly, without much tuning, we can"
arrive at a fiducial model that fits various observations
of WASP-69b very well.
"1 Following the conventions, in this paper, we use ti and tii for the
start/end of the ingress, and tiii and tiv for those of the egress."
"2 Even with a GPU-accelerated infrastructures, each simulation
takes about 5 hours on one computation node with 40 CPU cores
(Intel Skylake) and 4 GPUs (Nvidia Tesla V100) on the Popeye-
Simons Computing Cluster."

3 keV photons)"
We set up our simulations to match the reported sys-
tem properties of WASP-69b (Anderson et al. 2014).
"The host star is K star with M∗ = 0.826 M�, R∗ ="
0.813 R� and Teff = 4715 K. WASP-69b has a circu-
lar orbit with semi-major axis a = 0.04525 AU. The
equilibrium temperature is estimated using Eqn. 1
Teq = 965 K. The planet has an optical transit radius of
"Rp ' 1.057 RJup and a mass of Mp ' 0.26 MJup from
radial velocity follow-ups. Details of the fiducial model"
are presented in Table 1.
The interior of our WASP-69b model is set up as de-
"scribed in Appendix A. The core size, the equation of"
state and other details of the interior of a giant planet is
still subject to a lot of uncertainties even in the case of
"Jupiter (see e.g. Wahl et al. 2017). However, the details"
of the interior should not affect the outflowing region
of the envelope which is what we are interested in this
work. We set the inner boundary of our simulation at
11.37 R⊕ so that we capture several scale heights be-
"low the optical transit radius 〈reff〉 ' Rp at 1.057 RJup.
The outer boundary is located at 150 R⊕. For simplic-"
"ity, we assumed an atmospheric metallicity often seen"
in protoplanetary disk (WD18) which is slightly below
solar value (Table 1). We will explore any metallicity
dependence in a future work.
"Optical and infrared fluxes, represented by the hν ="
"2 eV photon energy bin, are calculated using the host"
star radius and effective temperature. For the high en-
"ergy photons, more uncertainties are involved depend-"
ing on the age/activity of the host star; while direct
measurements are also lacking. We note that WASP-
69 is moderately active indicated by the Ca ii H and
"K lines log R′H,K = −4.54 (Anderson et al. 2014). As
we will see later in §4.2, the He∗ absorption line pro-
file depends critically on the shares taken by various"
high-energy radiation bins. After gaining intuition on
how each energy bin affects the He∗ line profiles (again
"§4.2), we varied the high energy SED of WASP-69 un-
til we achieved a reasonable agreement with both the"
line profile and light curve measurements. The resul-
tant high energy SED is quite typical of a K5 star when
compared to observational constraint of FUV and EUV
flux of the MUSCLES survey (France et al. 2016; Young-
blood et al. 2016; Loyd et al. 2016; Youngblood et al.
"2017), the X-ray flux according to Gudel (1992), and the"
more comprehensive compilation of Oklopčić (2019).
3.1. A Photoevaporative Outflow on WASP-69b
"Before analyzing our simulations, we ensured that"
quasi-steady states have been achieved. This usually
involved running the simulations for many dynamical
"timescales, specifically we set tsim & 30 τdyn. The dy-
namical timescale τdyn is estimated by the sound cross-"
ing time of the Bondi radius:
"τdyn ∼
GMp
c3s
∼ 1.2×103 s×"
")−3/2
."
"Here, cs is the sound speed. For a typical T = 10
4 K"
"outflow we see for WASP-69b, τdyn ∼ 104 s. More-
over, we also check explicitly if the simulation has settled"
down to a quasi-steady state by comparing key hydrody-
namic/thermodynamic properties in neighboring dump
files.
Our fiducial model for WASP-69b shows clear signs
"of a photoevaporative outflow. In Figure 1, we show"
"2D slices of the density, temperature and LOS velocity"
distributions of our 3D simulations looking down the
"North pole of the planet. We see a T & 104 K hot
ionized supersonic outflow originating at a wind base of"
"r ' 13 R⊕ which eventually accelerates to ∼ 23 km s−1
when leaving the domain of our simulation. This outflow"
disperses the planet atmosphere at a mass-loss rate of
"Ṁ ' 5.5×10−10 M⊕ yr−1. Since we assumed a constant
high energy radiation output from the host star, the"
mass-loss rates and the hydrodynamic/thermodynamic
profiles remain nearly constant after reaching the quasi-
steady state. We also note that we did not put in any
"stellar wind from the host star, as the current wind-"
less model fits the data reasonably well and is preferred
by Occam’s Razor. However in a companion paper on
WASP-107 we will show that stellar winds may generate
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that leads to fluctuations of
a photoevporative outflow.
Which mechanisms control the population of the He∗
state? The bottom row in Figure 2 compares the rates of
different (de-)population processes along the two partic-
ular streamlines (thickened curves in Figure 1). We com-
"pute the rate of ionization, recombination, spontaneous"
"decay, collisional excitation and de-excitation as well as"
"an advection attenuation term |v · ∇n(He∗)|. Along the
representative streamline presented by the left column,"
the abundance of He∗ is determined by the relatively stiff
"balance between the recombination (He+ + e− → He∗)
and the collisional de-excitation at small radii . 30 R⊕.
As expected these two processes are efficient at higher"
densities consistent with the law of mass action. Pho-
toionization of He∗ by soft FUV starts to take over the
destruction channel of He∗ where the density of free elec-
trons declines at higher altitudes. The other channels
have negligible importance: e.g. collisional excitation
from 11S to the metastable state is more than five orders
of magnitude slower than recombination. On the right
"column of Figure 2, we show an interesting streamline"
that crosses in the shadow of the planet. The number
density of He∗ soars in the shadow because the photoion-
ization of He∗ by soft FUV vanishes here.
Beneath the base of the photoevaporative outflow
"(r . 13 R⊕), the temperature gradient between the
day-side and the night-side generates a slow ”zonal” cir-"
"culation (∼ 0.1 km s−1). However, this region has lit-
tle observational effect on the overall He∗∗ observables
which are mostly controlled by the much more extended"
low density regions of the outflowing atmosphere. We
will return to this point shortly. Moving to higher alti-
"tude, this day-night advection continues, amounting to"
"a 2−3km s−1 blueshift at about 20−40 R⊕. Going fur-
ther away from the planet, the Coriolis effect starts to"
shape the outflow streamlines into spiral curves result-
ing in blueshifts on the leading edge and redshifts on
the trailing edge. Considering that the outflow is still
"primarily radial, increments in the latitudinal velocity"
|∆vθ| after traveling through a radial distance ∆r can

This estimation is confirmed by the velocity profile in

"∆vLoS ∼ 11 km s−1, and eq. (5) yields ∼ 10.8 km s−1.
This effect re-distributes He∗ atoms in the velocity space"

see shortly.

3.2. Comparison with Observations
Figure 3 shows our synthetic observations of both the
line profiles and light curves of WASP-69b (Nortmann
et al. 2018; Vissapragada et al. 2020). We have binned
the light curve data from Vissapragada et al. (2020)
for better clarity and the uncertainty represents the
standard deviation within each phase bin. Our fiducial
model of WASP-69 seems to fit both the spectroscopic
and photometric observations well simultaneously. In
"particular, the synthetic line profile reproduced the sub-"
"tle blueshift of the peak absorption, the overall line"
"depth, and the relative ratio between the lines of this"
"triplet. Numerically, Nortmann et al. (2018) reported a"
net blueshift of −3.58±0.23 km s−1. This blueshift was
based on fitting Gaussians to the observed line profiles;
"however, as we argued in the previous section, kinematic"
shift of the outflow introduces significant distortion of
the spectral shape. Instead of fitting Gaussian to our
"line profile, we compared our simulations directly to the"
line profile itself which shows great agreement. We also
use a different way to measure the blueshift: we report
the blueshift of the peak absorption relative to a line-
ratio-weighted average of the rest-frame line center for
the two longer wavelength transistions that are usually
blended together.
Nortmann et al. (2018) hinted at the possibility of a
comet-like tail trailing behind WASP-69b. The basis of
their suggestion is that additional He∗ absorption can

"still be seen ∼ 20 min after the nominal egress of the
planet. The higher precision, better temporally sam-"
pled photometric data from Vissapragada et al. (2020)
nontheless favors a symmetric transit. The symmetric
transit shape (lower panel of Figure 3) does not sup-
port an extended comet-like tail. Our simulation seems
"to be more consistent with Vissapragada et al. (2020),"
the photoevaporative outflow of WASP-69b in our fidu-
cial model is largely symmetric between the leading and
"trailing edge, hence it produces a more symmetric tran-"
sit shape. We note that an extended comet-like tail will
also introduce significant distortion to He∗ line profile
(see our Companion paper on WASP-107b for strong
comet-like tail generated by strong stellar wind in that
"system). Here in the case of WASP-69b, our fiducial"
model produces a good fit the resolved line profile (Nort-
mann et al. 2018) while it does not need to invoke a
prominent comet-like tail.
Another point we would like to emphasize is that a sig-
nificant part of the He∗ absorption for WASP-69 seems
"to be produced by an extended, optically thin (τ < 1)"
outer layer of the photoevaporative outflow. In Fig-
"ure 4, we show the mid-transit extinction (1 − exp−τ )
at three different wavelengths near the He∗ transitions."
The outer regions (10s of R⊕) contribute significantly
to the overall extinction thanks to their extended area
and the slow decrease of He∗ number density in the out-
"flow. Because of the unsaturated optical depth, the line"
ratios between the He∗ triplet are close to 1 : 3 : 5
"i.e. their quantum degeneracies. More accurately, the"
line ratios are close to 1 : 8 as the longer two lines are
blended by kinematics and thermal broadening. This
suggests that the line ratios between the He∗ triplet can
be a diagnostic of the number density in the outflow.
If most of the He∗ absorption is due to higher-density
"region where one of the line may saturate first, the line"
ratio will deviate from the quantum degeneracy ratio;
this would tell us about the density of the outflow re-
gion in a model-independent way (see also discussions in
Salz et al. 2018). This does not seem to be the case for
"WASP-69b, as most He∗ absorption happens in lower"
density regions.
"It is worth noting that, due to heavy computational"
"cost of our 3D simulations, we could not afford to nu-"
merically fit the data with multiple simulation runs.
"Instead, our fiducial model serves as a validation our"
self-consistent 3D hydrodynamic simulations: with rea-
sonable assumptions of the planetary/stellar properties
"and high energy SED, we can at least qualitatively re-"
"produce the various He∗ observables. That said, the"
degree to which our simulation agrees with observations
is quite encouraging if not remarkable. After this vali-
"dation of model, we stand at a position to perturb our"
fiducial model and investigate how the He∗ observables
are impacted by various factors that control the under-
lying photoevaporative outflow and He∗ population in
the following section.
4. PARAMETRIC STUDY
How do the photoevaporative outflow and the resul-
tant He∗ observables depend on key parameters in our
"simulations? In this section, we explore the impact of"
"simulation dimensionality, XUV flux levels, host star"
"Figure 4. Extinction [1 − exp(−τ)] for Model 69-0 at three representative wavelengths (λ/Å) ∈ {10832.5, 10833.2, 10833.7}
near the He∗ transitions. The profiles are measured at mid-transit (viz., all LoS are parallel to the star-planet line) and in a
frame centered around the planet. The white dashed circles indicate the projected host star (with reported stellar radius and
orbital inclination). The directions of orbit motion (vK), orbital angular momentum vector (ΩK), and the direction to the host
star are indicated at the lower-left corner of the whole figure."
"spectral type, and planet surface gravity. This is done"
by perturbing validated fiducial model in these parame-
"ters. Before that, we did a further convergence test. We"
reran the fiducial model with a much finer simulation
"grid of Nlog r ×Nθ ×Nφ = 192× 192× 128 (versus the
fiducial model, Nlog r×Nθ×Nφ = 144× 128× 64). The
resultant He∗ observables in the convergence test are"
almost identical (Figure 3) to the much faster fiducial
model. This gives us confidence that the adopted spa-
tial grid is fine enough to resolve the photoevaporative
outflow on WASP-69b.
4.1. Dimensionality
To test how our model depends on the spatial dimen-
"sions of the simulations, we ran a 2D model with ax-"
isymmetry (about the φ axis i.e. Nφ = 1) while keep
all system parameters the same as the fiducial model.
The Coriolis forces is not captured in this 2D simula-
tion while stellar gravity and orbital centrifugal forces
are still involved. A reference 1D spherical symmetric
"model is also implemented using the θ = π/2, φ = π/2"
radial line and removing the θ and φ components of the
velocity.
Figure 3 compares the synthesized line profiles and
light curves with all three dimensionality models. The
1D spherically symmetric model suffers from the loss of
all non-radial kinematic information. It is clearly incon-
sistent with the observed line profile with no blueshift
and limited kinematic broadening. The 2D axisymmet-
ric test is able to capture the day-night advection. It
shows good agreement with the observed line profile.
The 3D fiducial model further modifies the line profile
by including the Coriolis force. In this case of WASP-
"69b such a modification is quite subtle, which again tes-"
tifies that the photoevaporative outflow on WASP-69b
is largely symmetric between the leading and trailing
edge. Again see our companion paper on WASP-107b
for how this symmetry is broken by the inclusion of stel-
lar winds.
The three models from 1D through 3D have almost
"identical equivalent width (〈Wλ〉 ∼ 3.1 Å) and light
curves. This stresses the importance of spectrally re-"
solving the He∗ line profiles which are seen to vary
the most between dimensions. The mass-loss rate are
again quite similar between 3D and 2D models at about
"Ṁ ' 5.5×10−10 M⊕ yr−1. The mass-loss rate in our 1D
model is off (Ṁ ' 6.9× 10−10 M⊕ yr−1) because it as-
sumes perfect spherical symmetry. However, the stream-"
lines in Figure 1 are clearly non-radial. We also compare
our results with that from a 1D isothermal model (Ok-
lopčić & Hirata 2018; Vissapragada et al. 2020) of
"9.5 × 10−10 M⊕ yr−1 (' 3 × 10−3 MJup Gyr−1) at
an assumed temperature of 12000K. The results are in"
rough agreement with differences arising from more care-
"ful treatment of the hydrodynamics, thermodynamics"
and radiative transfer.
4.2. XUV Flux Intensity
Photoevaporative outflows are driven by high energy
"radiation from the host star. Moreover, the population"
of He∗ states are also controlled by the critical balance
high energy photons of different energy bins. We exam-
ine the impact of high energy radiation in each energy
bin by perturbing the fidual model. The amount of high
energy radiation a star outputs is variable depending
"on the evolution stage, activity and spectral types of"
the host star. Direct measurements are also lacking as
the XUV measurements have to be performed in space.

on the dashed lines mark the exact energy of incident pho-
tons in the simulations (as represetatives of the correspond-
ing energy bands; see §2.3). For reference, the model spectra
of stellar spectral types A7, G2, K6 and M1.5 (based on
the compilation in Oklopčić 2019) are shown in solid curves.
Vertical dotted lines mark the boundary between different
energy bands: “Hard EUV” for hν > 24.6 eV photons that

Werner) for 11.2 < (hν/eV) < 13.6 photons that can pho-
todissociate H2; “Soft FUV” for hν < 7 eV photons."
"Therefore, in our Models 69-1 to 69-5 (soft FUV for 69-"
"1, LW for 69-2, soft EUV for 69-3, hard EUV for 69-4,"
"X-ray for 69-5), we bump up the flux level in each high"
energy bin by a whole order of magnitude to reflect the
intrinsic variation in high energy flux level. We summa-
rize key He∗ observables in Table 3; we also show the
synthetic line profiles and light curves in Figure 6 and
the relative abundance of He∗ as a function of radius in
Figure 8.
The He∗ line profiles are controlled mainly by the FUV
(adverse effect) and the EUV bands (positive effect);
the LW and X-ray bands only play minor roles under

relative abundance of He∗ is suppressed by soft FUV be-
"cause it photoionizes the He∗ states, thus significantly"
reducing its population and the He∗ absorption depth.
"In Model 69-1 (×10 soft FUV flux), the over-all mass-
loss rate is enhanced by a few percent thanks to ex-"
tra energy deposited into the atmosphere. However the
stronger soft FUV flux significantly lowered the number
"density of He∗ at a larger radial extent (r & 20 R⊕).
The He∗ line profile depth and the light curve depth"
are both reduced by about a factor of two (3.16 Å to
1.75 Å). The line width also decreased (FWHM from
17.3 Å down to 14.0 Å) because the high-altitude region
with a higher velocity dispersion contribute less to the
He∗ extinction.
"In Model 69-2 (×10 LW flux) the He∗ observables
are mostly unaltered from the fiducial model. This is"
because the LW band is intrinsically narrow thus only
amount to a very small fraction of the overall high en-
"ergy radiation flux. Moreover, most molecular H2 are"
already dissociated at the ∼ 104K in our simulations.

specifically compares the results of different types of host
stars (Model 69-0 for the K star WASP-69, and Models 69-

"At higher EUV fluxes (Model 69-3 and 69-4), the much"
faster outflows not only bring more He∗ into the exo-
sphere but also spread them out in velocity space effec-
tively broadening the line profiles. This confirms our
earlier picture that EUV flux are most effective in driv-
ing photoevaporative outflows (WD18).
"Finally, X-ray seems to play a secondary role in pho-"
"toevaporation and He∗ observables. Model 69-5 (×10
X-ray flux) has very similar observables as the fiducial"
"model. Although X-rays photons are very energetic,"
they also have much smaller cross sections than EUV
"photons. As a result, X-ray penetrate deeper into the at-"
mosphere where collisional processes and dust particles
quickly convert the X-ray energies to infrared radiation
that escapes easily. This limits the heating potential of
X-ray. We reached a similar conclusion in WD18.
4.3. Host Spectral Type
"Among the handful of reported He∗ detections, 4"
out of 6 are planets around K-type hosts (Spake et al.
2018; Venzmer & Bothmer 2018; Allart et al. 2018; Salz
et al. 2018; Ninan et al. 2020; Alonso-Floriano et al.
"2019). Oklopčić (2019) confirmed that K-stars, at least"
"in 1D isothermal models, may be at the sweet spot of"
FUV/EUV flux balance that best promote the He∗ pop-
ulation and thus observablity. This section re-evaluates
such a claim with our 3D hydrodynamic simulation cou-
pled with self-consistent thermodynamics and radiative
transfer.
"We set up three additional models 69-F, 69-G, and 69-"
"M, whose luminosities in different high energy bins emu-"
"late typical F-type, G-type, and M-type main-sequence"
stars based on the compilation of Oklopčić 2019. We
remind the reader the fiducial model 69-0 has a K-star
SED. The flux in each high energy bin is summarized
"in Table 2). Broadly speaking, F-type and G-type stars"
output similar levels of soft and hard EUV fluxes as
"K-type stars, however their FUV luminosities are signif-"
"icantly higher by a factor of ∼ 3000 and ∼ 130 respec-
tively. For a typical M star, fluxes in all high energy"
bands are lower by about one order of magnitude.
He∗ observables of these models are summarized in
Table 3 for their mass-loss rates and a few key diagnos-
tics etc. We show the line profiles and light curves in
Figure 6 and the radial distribution of He∗ in Figure 8.
"With a soft FUV flux ∼ 3000 times higher than our fidu-
cial model, F-type stars significantly suppress the popu-"
lation and observability of He∗ with an equivalent width
reduced by almost two orders of magnitude (3.16 to 0.04
"Å). However, the mass loss rate of the photoevaporative"
"outflow is similar to that of the fiducial model. Again,"
photoevaporation is driven mostly by EUV which have
similar flux levels between F and K stars. On the other
"hand, for a typical M star host, whose higher energy"
"flux levels are weaker in all bands, the mass loss rate"
"is reduced by one order of magnitude. Nonetheless, the"
equivalent width of He∗ in the transmission spectrum
only decline by a factor of 2 (3.16 to 1.4 Å). Again this
is because its much weaker soft FUV flux allows pro-
portionally more He∗ to exist in the outflow (Figure 8).
"G-star represents some middle ground, its ∼ 130 times
higher soft FUV flux suppress the equivalent width He∗"
by a factor of 6.
"In summary, our findings suggest that K-star planet"
hosts are indeed favorable targets for He∗ observations
consistent with the suggestion of Oklopčić (2019). The
"high-energy SED, nonetheless, is expected to change sig-"
nificantly as a function of host star age and activity level.
The suppression factor of He∗ around G and M type
stars are often only a factor of a few. We encourage
observers to keep them in their target list particularly
the young and active ones. We also predict that there
will be more reports of He∗ detection around G and M
type hosts soon. Another important point we would like
to stress is that the depth of He∗ line profile can not
be translated to the underlying mass loss rate without
knowing the high energy SED of the host star. In other
"words, measuring the XUV SED of the host star directly"
is crucial for correctly interpreting the He∗ observations.
4.4. Surface gravity
The mass-loss rate of photoevaporation depends quite
strong on the depth of gravitational potential well of
the planet. A shallower potential allows faster outflow
with the same high energy irradiation. In Model 69-
6 we adjusted the planet interior such that the planet
mass is reduced by half while keeping the transit radius
the same. This effectively lowers the surface gravity of
the planet by a factor of two. The mass loss rate in
"Model 69-6 increases to Ṁ ' 9.3×10−10 M⊕ yr−1 which
is ∼ 70 % larger than the fiducial model. This larger
mass loss rate can be decomposed into an increase in"
"the terminal outflow velocity by ∼ 10 % and an increase
of the outflow density by ∼ 60 %."
The He∗ line profile depth responds to this increase of
"mass loss rate sub-linearly. In Figure 6, the line profile"
"has ∼ 40 % larger depth than that in the fiducial model,
while the equivalent width increases by about ∼ 30 %.
However, the He∗ line profile maintains a similar mor-"
phology with the peak velocity shift and the FWHM
"unchanged from the fiducial model (Table 3). In short,"
"puffier, low surface gravity planets are more likely to"
undergo strong photoevaporative mass loss and should
prove great target for He∗ observations.

for the observed variability (see §5 for detail)."
drop in magnitude that lasted for about 20 minutes.
"This variability could well be instrumental in origin, but"
here we explore an alternative explanation that it is gen-
erated by a stellar flare on the host star.
Solar/stellar flares are associated with the surface
magnetic activity of the host star. Their amplitudes
can range below a percent to even orders of magnitude
"in extreme cases (“superflares” Günther et al. 2020, and"
references therein). The sudden rise of luminosity is of-
ten followed by exponential decays to nominal flux level
on minutes or hours timescale. To investigate the con-
"sequences of flaring events on He∗ observables, we first"
inject a simple flare model in which fluxes across all en-
ergy bands energy bands increase by a factor 10 and 100
times which then quickly decay to the quiescent state
exponentially with a timescale of 500 s.
The temporal response of our fiducial model to these
flares are shown in Figure 9. Independent of the energy
"injected, the common mode of response is as follows. Be-"
fore the dynamics of the outflowing atmosphere can fully
"respond to the flares, the photoionization of He∗ by soft"
FUV photons reduces the number density of He∗ and
cause a significant decrease in the equivalent width. It
"is only after the dynamical timescale t− tflare ∼ τdyn ∼
hours that the flare-generated surge of photoevaporative"
mass-loss reach the higher altitudes where most of He∗
"absorption occurs. As a result, the equivalent width of"
He∗ increases after the first hour or so and remains high
for several hours. Looking at the mass-loss rate across
the outer boundary of the simulation (lower panel of
"Figure 9), it experiences several oscillations on dynam-"
ical timescales as the systems response to the increased
flux from the flare. The equivalent width (and other
observables) however are the spatially integrated quan-
"tities, thus it effectively smears out most of these oscil-"
lations and has a much smoother variation (upper panel
of Figure 9). Comparing with variability seen in WASP-
"69b (Nortmann et al. 2018), a flare that simultaneously"
raises all high energy radiation does not appear to be a
good explanation. This is because it should be observed
as a decrease followed by an increase of He∗ absorption
rather than the decrease only in the observations (Nort-
mann et al. 2018).
We therefore explore a different flare model in which
only the soft FUV band. We do not have observational
support that flares of this kind exist. We explore this
rather contrived scenario just out of curiosity. Remem-
"ber from §4.2 that the soft FUV primarily suppresses the
He∗ abundance by photoionization without significantly"
changing the overall kinematics. A soft-FUV-only flare
may produce the observed decrease of He∗ line depths.
"We setup three extra simulation runs, again based on the"
fiducial model of WASP-69b. We put in soft FUV flares
"(10, 100 and 1000 times the nominal value) that start at"
the middle of the transits and last for 30 min. In Fig-
"ure 10, we can see that the light curves respond to these"
soft-FUV-only flares quickly. In order to reproduce the
"∼30% variation, a soft FUV flare between 10 − 100×
the nominal level is required. This should be readily"
"observable in the Ca ii H, K lines of the CARMENES"
"spectra in Nortmann et al. (2018). Nevertheless, en-"
hanced activity was not observed in the spectra during
or preceding the observed light curve variation (private
"communications, Nortmann). Afterall, stellar flares do"
not seem to be a viable explanation of the temporal
variability seen the He∗ line profiles of Nortmann et al.
(2018); instrumental effect is perhaps a better solution.
6. SUMMARY
"In this work, we simulate the ionized mass loss of"
close-in exoplanets and the metastable helium absorp-
tion during the planetary transit. We produce synthetic
spectrally resolved line profiles and the light curves in a
narrow filter band around the He∗ transitions. Dynam-
ics of such synthesis requires 3D hydrodynamic simula-
tions of photoevaporating planetary atmospheres; non-
equilibrium thermochemistry and ray-tracing radiative
transfer are co-evolved with the hydrodynamics. The
processes that populate and depopulate the metastable
state of neutral helium are included in a thermochemical
network and solved efficiently on GPUs.
With reasonable assumptions about the system pa-
"rameters and high energy SED of WASP-69, we find a"
plausible model that launches a photoevaporative out-
"flow with a mass-loss rate of Ṁ ' 5.5×10−10 M⊕ yr−1.
The model yields a spectrum and a light curve that are
in remarkable agreement with the observations in terms"
"equivalent width, line-ratios, blueshift and line broad-"
ening (Nortmann et al. 2018; Vissapragada et al. 2020).
"Inside this outflow, metastable helium is formed almost"
solely by recombination. Its destruction is mainly due to
collisional de-excitation at small radii where the density
is high and photoionization by FUV photons at outer
lower-density regions.
"With this fiducial model of WASP-69b, we investi-"
gated how the photoevaporative outflow and He∗ ob-
servables depend on various input parameters. 3D sim-
ulations are crucial for capturing the full hydrodynam-
ics including Coriolis force and advection. These effects
are needed for producing correct line profile including
"the line ratios, kinematic broadening and the overall"
blueshift. We found that EUV photons are most effi-
cient in driving the photoevaporation dynamics and in
producing He+ as the progenitors of recombination ex-
citation of He∗. The soft FUV photons that can ionize
He∗ often play an adverse effect on the He∗ observabil-
"ity. X-ray photons, having much lower interaction cross"
"section, are of secondary importance. Surface gravity"
also determines the effectiveness of photoevaporative
outflows with puffier planets experiencing significantly
"stronger outflows, but the response of He* equivalent"
width is sub-linear.
K-stars are at a sweet spot of FUV/EUV balance that
maximize the detectability of He∗ lines. F or earlier type
stars have excessive FUV fluxes that suppresses the He∗
lines by orders of magnitude. G and M dwarfs represent
a middle ground: He∗ lines should still be observable
particularly for the younger and more active ones. In
"any case, the depth He∗ line profiles cannot be translated"
to a mass-loss rate without knowing the host star high
energy SED.
We also investigated whether stellar flares could ex-
plain some of the temporal variability of WASP-69b
(Nortmann et al. 2018). We found that a flare which
enhances all high energy radiations initially suppresses
He∗ lines due to FUV fluxes ionizing the He∗ before the
whole system can adjust to higher mass-loss state af-
ter some dynamical timescales (usually hour-timescale).
This characteristic shape is not consistent with the ob-
served temporal variability of WASP-69b which only
shows a decline of He∗ line depth before returing to nom-
inal levels. Stellar flares are unlikely to be the explana-
tion for this type of variability.

APPENDIX
A. CORES AND INTERAL ATMOSPHERES OF MODEL PLANETS
Gas giants like WASP-69b may have degenerate hydrogen and helium in their interior. We adopt the equations of
"state (EoS hereafter) tabulated by Miguel et al. (2016), which describe the behaviors of hydrogen and helium over"
"wide ranges of pressure and temperature, from the degenerate states to ideal gases. Those tabulated EoS present the"
density and entropy of hydrogen and helium as functions of temperature and density. The combined EoS for a mixture
"of hydrogen and helium at a fixed atom number fraction xH is given by solving the equation for xp,H (the partial"
"pressure of hydrogen),
mHxH"
"mHe(1− xH)
="
"ρH(p xp,H, T )"
"ρHe[p(1− xp,H), T ]
, (A1)"
"in which p is the total pressure, T is the temperature, mH and mHe are the atomic masses of hydrogen and helium"
"respectively, and ρH, ρHe are interpolated from the EoS tables. The overall density then reads ρ = ρH + ρHe. The"
"entropy density s of the materials is also calculated, so that we can obtain the adiabatic gradient,"
"∇ad ≡
(
∂ ln p"
"= − (∂ ln s/∂ ln p)T
(∂ ln s/∂ lnT )p"
. (A2)
Note that the entropy of mixing does not affect these derivatives.
The spherical symmetric isentropic hydrostatics are calculated by solving a boundary value problem for the set of
ordinary differential equations:
"dr
= −GMρ"
"dr
= 4πr2ρ ,"
"dr
= ∇ad"
")
. (A3)"
"where M denotes the mass enclosed by radius r. Specifying the boundary conditions (pc, Tc) as the “eigenvalues”,"
we can integrate these ODEs from a the boundary of a dense solid core with radius rc and given mass Mc up to
the radiative-convective boundary r = rrcb. At rrcb the temperature approaches the equilibrium temperature of the
quasi-isothermal layer T = Teq. Thus the convective inner atmosphere is smoothly connected to an quasi-isothermal
"outer atmosphere whose density profile obeys (µ is the dimensional mean molecular mass),"
ρ = ρrcb exp
"[(
GMrcbµ"
rrcbkBTeq
")(rrcb
r
− 1
)]"
. (A4)
"The density profile is then used to calculate the effective transiting radius,"
"〈reff〉 =
{"
"∫ rcut
0"
"db 2πb
[
1− e−τ(b)"
"]}1/2
, (A5)"
"where rcut is an arbitrary cutoff size (to calculate the effective transiting radius in the broad optical band, we use"
"rcut = 100 R⊕), τ(b) is the optical depth along the LoS at impact parameter b,"
"τ(b) ≡
∫ rcut
−rcut"
"dz σn|r=√b2+z2 , (A6)"
"n is the number density of the extinction particle, and σ is the extinction cross section per particle. The eigenvalues"
"(pc, Tc) are searched iteratively until both Mrcb and 〈reff〉 match the observed the mass Mp and optical transiting
radius Rp of the planet being simulated. In all models discussed in this paper, for simplicity, we assume that there is"
"no rocky cores rc = 0, Mc = 0. This assumption hardly affects the properties of the upper atmosphere. We also use κ"
"of the Thomson scattering to estimate calculate 〈reff〉. We have also tested other plausible values of opacity (e.g. the
optical κ for rdust = 5 Å very small grains with 10"
"−4 dust-to-gas mass ratio), and the 〈reff〉 varies by only ∼ 2% under
the same boundary conditions. Again the specific choice of opacity hardly affects the upper atmosphere."
