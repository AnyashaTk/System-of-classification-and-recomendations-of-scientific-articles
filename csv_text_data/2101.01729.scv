ABSTRACT
We analyze a suite of 30 high resolution zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of massive
"galaxies with stellar masses M∗ > 10
10.9M�, with the goal of better understanding merger activity in"
"AGN, AGN activity in merging systems, SMBH growth during mergers, and the role of gas content."
"Using the radiative transfer code Powderday, we generate HST-WFC3 F160W synthetic observations"
"of redshift 0.5 < z < 3 central galaxies, add noise properties similar to the CANDELS survey, and"
measure morphological properties from the synthetic images using commonly adopted non-parametric
statistics. We compare the distributions of morphological properties measured from the synthetic
images with a sample of inactive galaxies and X-ray selected AGN hosts from CANDELS. We study
"the connection between mergers and AGN activity in the simulations, the synthetic images, and the"
"observed CANDELS sample. We find that, in both the simulations and CANDELS, even the most"
"luminous (Lbol > 10
45 erg s−1) AGN in our sample are no more likely than inactive galaxies (Lbol <"
1043 erg s−1) to be found in merging systems. We also find that AGN activity is not overall enhanced
"by mergers, nor enhanced at any specific time in the 1 Gyr preceding and following a merger. Even gas"
rich major mergers (stellar mass ratio >1:4) do not necessarily enhance AGN activity or significantly
"grow the central SMBH. We conclude that in the simulated massive galaxies studied here, mergers are"
not the primary drivers of AGN.
1. INTRODUCTION
Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to be
ubiquitous within massive galaxies (Magorrian et al.
"1997; Kormendy & Ho 2013), but it is still a mystery"
why gas accretion rates onto these SMBH are low to neg-
"ligible in some galaxies, and extremely high in others."
"In order to power the most luminous quasars, nearly the"
whole gas content of a massive galaxy must be funneled
"onto the black hole in a few hundred million years, or"
roughly a dynamical time (Hopkins et al. 2008b). The
primary mechanism that triggers episodes of rapid ac-
"cretion, which give rise to the observational signatures"
"of active galactic nuclei (AGN), is still unclear. Galaxy"
interactions offer a compelling candidate for a number of
reasons. Mergers and interactions can dissipate angular
momentum and channel gas into galactic nuclei (Barnes
& Hernquist 1991; Springel et al. 2005a; Gabor et al.
2016; Blumenthal & Barnes 2018). This may simultane-
ously funnel gas onto the central SMBH and drive star
"formation in the bulge, helping to explain tight observed"
correlations between SMBH and galaxy bulge properties
(Gebhardt et al. 2000; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; Mar-
coni & Hunt 2003; Häring & Rix 2004).
2 Sharma et al.
"Furthermore, major mergers can transform rota-"
tion supported disk-dominated galaxies into pressure-
"supported spheroid dominated galaxies, while AGN"
feedback may efficiently heat and drive gas out of the
"galaxy, leading to quenching of star formation. Thus,"
a link between mergers and AGN triggering could ex-
plain the observed correlation between spheroid-like
"morphologies and kinematics, and old stellar popula-"
"tions (Somerville & Davé 2015; Kormendy & Ho 2013,"
and references therein). It has been shown using em-
"pirical and semi-analytic models that, under the ansatz"
"that mergers trigger AGN activity, the observed merger"
rate can account for the observed evolution of the AGN
"luminosity function (Hopkins et al. 2006, 2008b), as well"
"as the observed growth rate of quenched, spheroid dom-"
"inated galaxies (Hopkins et al. 2006, 2008a; Somerville"
et al. 2008; Brennan et al. 2015).
"However, there are numerous other possible mecha-"
nisms for fueling accretion onto black holes and thereby
AGN activity. Alternative mechanisms that can fun-
nel gas toward the centers of galaxies have been iden-
"tified, including secular processes such as bar instabil-"
ities (Kormendy & Kennicutt 2004; Hirschmann et al.
2012) and violently unstable and/or clumpy disks (Dekel
et al. 2009; Bournaud et al. 2011). Recycled gas from
the evolution of stars in the galaxy’s nucleus can fuel
"significant AGN activity (Ciotti & Ostriker 1997, 2007)."
Cooling flows from the hot halo are another proposed fu-
eling mechanism (Nulsen & Fabian 2000). Recent work
using high resolution simulations of massive ellipticals
have highlighted the importance of cooling flows fueled
by stellar evolution in generating AGN outbursts (Gan
et al. 2019; Pellegrini et al. 2020; Gan et al. 2020).
Observations do not offer a clear picture of the connec-
tion between AGN and galaxy mergers. Some observa-
"tional studies, using a variety of techniques, find mergers"
to be correlated with AGN activity (Sanders et al. 1988;
"Koss et al. 2010, 2012; Ellison et al. 2011; Silverman"
et al. 2011; Bessiere et al. 2012; Cotini et al. 2013; Lack-
ner et al. 2014; Satyapal et al. 2014; Weston et al. 2017;
"Ellison et al. 2019), while many others find that mergers"
do not correlate with AGN activity (De Robertis et al.
1998; Grogin et al. 2005; Li et al. 2008; Gabor et al.
2009; Reichard et al. 2009; Cisternas et al. 2011; Ko-
cevski et al. 2012; Schawinski et al. 2012; Sabater et al.
2015; Mechtley et al. 2016; Marian et al. 2019). Studies
supporting an AGN-merger connection typically find the
"most luminous AGN (Lbol > 10
45 erg/s) are preferen-"
tially found in disturbed systems (Goulding et al. 2018;
"Treister et al. 2012; Glikman et al. 2015). Further, AGN"
with significant obscuration are more likely than unob-
scured AGN to be found in galaxies showing evidence of
interactions or merging (Satyapal et al. 2014; Kocevski
et al. 2015; Glikman et al. 2015; Fan et al. 2016; Weston
et al. 2017; Goulding et al. 2018; Donley et al. 2018;
Ellison et al. 2019).
Simulations draw similar mixed conclusions on the
AGN-merger connection. Studies using hydrodynamic
simulations of binary mergers of idealized galaxies
demonstrated clear triggering of gas inflows to the nu-
cleus and resulting starburst and AGN activity (Springel
et al. 2005b; Di Matteo et al. 2005; Hopkins et al. 2005;
Choi et al. 2012). Dubois et al. (2015) find that mergers
are the dominant mechanism for AGN fueling within
their zoom-in cosmological simulation of 1012M� halo
at z = 2. Once a galaxy grows above stellar mass
"M∗ > 10
9M� threshold, they found that galaxies are"
able to confine nuclear inflows from mergers and sus-
tain BH accretion. McAlpine et al. (2020) find an over-
abundance of luminous AGN in disturbed systems with
"M∗ ∼ 1010M� within the Eagle cosmological hydrody-
namic simulation (Schaye et al. 2015; Crain et al. 2015),"
with AGN activity peaking immediately after galaxy
"coalescence. However, they also find the majority of"
SMBH growth does not occur during mergers.
Some simulations find that mergers are difficult to dis-
"entangle from smooth accretion of gas, as these pro-"
cesses tend to occur together in cosmological simula-
tions. Bellovary et al. (2013) trace the origins of gas
particles accreted by SMBHs in cosmological zoom simu-
"lations, and find SMBHs are not preferentially fueled by"
either smoothly-accreted or merger-accreted gas. Simi-
"larly, Menci et al. (2014) use semi-analytic models to in-"
"vestigate disk instabilities in AGN, and find both merg-"
ers and disk instabilities are viable candidates as the
dominant fueling mechanism.
"Finally, other simulations find little to no connec-"
tion between AGN activity and galaxy mergers. Stein-
born et al. (2018) find that AGN in the Magneticum
Pathfinder cosmological simulation are nearly as likely
"as inactive galaxies to be found in a merging state, and"
the majority of AGN activity is driven by stochastic
"gas accretion. Using cosmological zoom simulations,"
Pontzen et al. (2017) find that mergers serve to en-
hance the quenching effects of AGN feedback by me-
"chanically disrupting the cold disk, but do not enhance"
"AGN activity. Finally, Hirschmann et al. (2012) show"
that semi-analytic models where SMBH growth is driven
by mergers can reproduce the AGN luminosity function
"at intermediate redshifts and luminosities, but an ad-"
ditional accretion mode via disc instabilities is required
in order to fully reproduce the number densities of the
most luminous AGN.
There are a number of explanations for the confus-
ing status on the question of whether mergers play a
"vital role in AGN activity and BH growth. First, select-"
ing AGN is not a straightforward task. AGN emission
"spans a broad range of wavelengths, and the radiation"
can originate from many different phenomena including
"the accretion disk, dust obscuring structures, and jets."
"Second, identifying galaxy mergers is also not a straight-"
forward task. Mergers have been commonly identified by
visual inspection (Bridge et al. 2007; Jogee et al. 2009;
Darg et al. 2010; Kartaltepe et al. 2015; Rosario et al.
"2015), close pairs (Lackner et al. 2014; Mundy et al."
"2017; Mantha et al. 2018), non-parametric morphologi-"
cal diagnostics (Conselice et al. 2003; Lotz et al. 2004;
"Pawlik et al. 2016; Nevin et al. 2019), and statistical"
learning techniques (Hocking et al. 2018; Goulding et al.
2018; Ackermann et al. 2018; Snyder et al. 2019). Each
method may be particularly sensitive or insensitive to
"certain merger stages, or may be limited by availability"
of data. Few previous studies have attempted to select
both mergers and AGN in the same way in an obser-
vational sample and a cosmological simulation in order
to robustly determine whether the AGN-merger connec-
tion seen in current simulations is consistent with obser-
vations.
In this work we analyze a set of zoom-in cosmologi-
cal simulations to better understand the connection be-
tween mergers and AGN activity. In particular we aim
to answer whether 1) AGN are more likely to be found in
"disturbed or merging galaxies than a control sample, and"
2) mergers/disturbed galaxies are more likely to host
AGN. Studying high-resolution galaxy simulations in a
cosmological context allows us to better understand how
"AGN may be triggered by mergers, how SMBHs grow"
"during periods of merger activity, and how gas content"
plays into SMBH fueling. In order to enable us to se-
"lect mergers in the same way as observers do, we mock-"
observe the simulations and generate noise-added im-
ages similar to HST-WFC3 F160W images. By compar-
ing both intrinsic and mock-observational merger statis-
"tics, we hope to better understand the role of observa-"
tional selection effects in this problem. We compute a
standard suite of non-parametric morphological statis-
tics on both the synthetic images and the real CAN-
"DELS images, and use machine learning to identify se-"
lection criteria that more accurately and robustly iden-
tify true mergers in the simulations.
In Section 2 we summarize the basic physical ingredi-
ents of the cosmological zoom-in simulations used in this
study. In Section 3 we detail the pipeline for generat-
"ing synthetic images, adding noise, and measuring mor-"
phological parameters. We also detail the training and
testing of an automated classifier for identifying mergers
from the synthetic images. In Section 4 we explore how
merger statistics vary for AGN versus inactive galaxies.
"We also explore how mergers influence AGN activity,"
"how they impact overall SMBH growth, and what role"
gas plays in the fueling of AGN.
2. SIMULATION
We use the cosmological zoom-in simulations of mas-
sive galaxy formation presented in Choi et al. (2017).
"Here we give a brief summary of the code basics, physics,"
"and feedback models we use in the simulation, but we"
refer the readers to Choi et al. (2017) for a detailed de-
scription of the simulations.
2.1. Simulation properties
"The SPHGal (Hu et al. 2014) code, a modified version"
of the parallel smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
code GADGET-3 (Springel 2005) was used to run the
simulations. SPHGal includes many improvements to
overcome the numerical fluid-mixing problems of classi-
"cal SPH codes, such as a density-independent pressure-"
entropy SPH formulation and an improved artificial
"viscosity implementation (see Hu et al. 2014, for de-"
tails). The initial conditions are from Oser et al. (2010)
with cosmological parameters of WMAP3 (Spergel et al.
"2007, h = 0.72, Ωb = 0.044, Ωdm = 0.26, ΩΛ ="
"0.74, σ8 = 0.77, and ns = 0.95). In this work we"
use cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of
30 massive halos adopting the fiducial model of Choi
et al. (2017). The total masses of central galaxies are
"1.4× 1012 ≤ Mvir/M� ≤ 2.3× 1013, and stellar masses
are 8.2 × 1010 ≤ M∗/M� ≤ 1.5 × 1012 at z = 0.
The baryonic (star and gas particle) mass resolution is"
"m∗,gas = 5.8 × 106 M�, and the dark matter particle
resolution is mdm = 3.4× 107 M�. The comoving grav-
itational softening lengths are �gas,star = 0.556 kpc for"
the gas and star particles and �halo = 1.236 kpc for the
dark matter particles.
"The simulations include chemical evolution, metal"
cooling and diffusion. The chemical evolution of 11 dif-
"ferent species, H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca and"
"Fe, are traced explicitly for star and gas particles with"
the chemical yields adopted respectively from Iwamoto
et al. (1999); Woosley & Weaver (1995); Karakas (2010)
"for Type I, Type II SNe and AGB stars. We include a"
redshift dependent UV/X-ray cosmic microwave back-
"ground from Haardt & Madau (2001), and the cooling"
rate from Wiersma et al. (2009) for optically thin gas
in ionization equilibrium. The metal diffusion model is
"adopted from Aumer et al. (2013), and allows the metal"
enriched gas particles to mix their metals with neigh-
boring gas particles via turbulent diffusion.
4 Sharma et al.
2.2. Star Formation and Stellar Feedback
The star formation rate is calculated as dρ∗/dt =
"ηρgas/tdyn where ρ∗, ρgas and tdyn are the stellar and"
"gas densities, and local dynamical time for gas parti-"
"cle respectively, with the star formation efficiency set to"
η = 0.025. We stochastically spawn star particles in high
density regions where the gas density exceeds a density
"threshold, nth ≡ n0 (Tgas/T0)
3"
"(M0/Mgas)
2
. The critical"
"threshold density and temperature are n0 = 2.0 cm
−3"
and T0 = 12000 K and M0 is the gas particle mass at
the fiducial resolution.
The simulations include the stellar feedback model
"of Núñez et al. (2017), which consists of the winds"
"from young massive stars, UV heating within Strömgren"
"spheres of young stars, the three-phase supernova feed-"
"back from type I and type II SNe, and metals and out-"
flows from low-mass AGB stars.
"Before the moment of the SN explosion, the young"
stellar particles inject the same amount of mass and mo-
mentum as those of type II SN explosions evenly spread
in time to the surrounding ISM via winds from young
massive stars. Their ionizing radiation also gradually
heats the neighboring gas particles to T = 104 K within
a Strömgren radius (Strömgren 1939).
We assume that a single SN event ejects mass in
"an outflow with a velocity vout,SN = 4, 500 km s
−1 to"
the surrounding ISM when star particles explode as
SNe. Each neighboring gas particle is affected by one
of the three successive phases of SN depending on the
physical distance from the SN particle: (i) momentum-
"conserving free expansion phase, (ii) energy-conserving"
Sedov-Taylor phase where SN energy is transferred
"with 30% as kinetic and 70% as thermal, and (iii) the"
snowplow phase where radiative cooling becomes domi-
"nant. This “snowplow” SN feedback model mimics three
phases of supernova remnants, launching the standard"
Sedov-Taylor blast-waves carrying 30% kinetic and 70%
"thermal energy, and then both energy modes dissipate"
with distance from the SN in the pressure-driven snow-
plow phase of SN remnants.
"Even after a SN event, old stellar particles keep"
"distributing energy, momentum, and metals via AGB"
winds. The outflowing wind velocity of AGB stars is
"assumed to be vout,AGB = 10 km s
−1, following the typ-"
ical observed outflowing velocities of AGB driven winds
(e.g. Nyman et al. 1992).
"In our model, various mass-loss events such as winds"
"from young stars, SNe and AGB stars provide recycled"
gas which can fuel late star formation and also AGN ac-
tivity by feeding the central super massive black holes
(e.g. Ciotti et al. 2010). With our assumed Kroupa
"(2001) IMF, over 30% of the total mass in stellar parti-"
cles returns to the ISM within ∼ 13 Gyr of evolution.
2.3. Black Hole Physics and AGN Feedback
"In the simulations, the black holes are treated as"
collisionless sink particles and seeded with a mass of
105 h−1M� in newly formed dark matter halos with
mass above 1011 h−1M�. The black hole can grow
via mergers with other black holes and direct accretion
of gas. Two black holes merge when they are within
"their local SPH smoothing lengths, and their relative"
velocities are less than the local sound speed. The
rate of the gas infall onto the black hole is estimated
with a Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton parameterization (Hoyle
& Lyttleton 1939; Bondi & Hoyle 1944; Bondi 1952):
"Ṁinf = (4πG
2M2BHρ)/((c"
"2
s + v"
"2)3/2), where ρ, cs, and v"
"are respectively the gas density, the sound speed and the"
velocity of the gas relative to the black hole. We also
include the soft Bondi criterion introduced in Choi et al.
(2012) to prevent the unphysical infall of gas from out-
side of the Bondi radius. This model statistically limits
the accretion to the gas within the Bondi radius.
We include the mechanical and radiative AGN feed-
"back model described in Choi et al. (2012, 2015). In"
"this model, the BH imparts mass and momentum to"
the surrounding gas in a manner that mimics observed
AGN-driven outflows (e.g. Arav et al. 2020). As AGN
"winds carry a mass, only a fraction of inflowing gas mass"
will actually accrete onto the black hole as Ṁoutf =
"Ṁinf−Ṁacc where Ṁoutf , Ṁinf and Ṁacc are the outflow-
ing/inflowing mass rate and the mass accretion rate to"
the black hole respectively. We assume a constant AGN-
"driven wind velocity of voutf,AGN = 10, 000 km s
−1, and"
"the wind energy is calculated as Ėw ≡ �wṀaccc2 =
0.5Ṁoutfv"
"2
outf,AGN, where the feedback efficiency param-"
eter is set to �w = 0.005 to reproduce the present day
"MBH − σ relation (Choi et al. 2017). Then the mass
flux and momentum flux carried by the AGN-driven"
"winds are calculated as Ṁoutf = 2Ṁacc�wc
2/v2outf,AGN"
"and ṗ = Ṁoutfvoutf,AGN = 2�wṀaccc
2/voutf,AGN. In"
"short, when the inflow of gas feeds the central black"
"hole, it launches fast winds carrying a momentum flux"
of ṗ = 30LBH/c. We set the direction of the wind to be
parallel or anti-parallel to the angular momentum vector
of each gas particle accreted by the black hole to mimic
a wind perpendicular to the disk plane.
The heating and associated radiation pressure effect
"from moderately hard X-ray radiation (∼ 50 keV) from
the accreting black hole are also included. We use the"
AGN spectrum and Compton/photoionization heating
"prescription from Sazonov et al. (2004, 2005) and the"
associated radiation pressure directed away from the
"black hole is also included. In our simulation, super-"
Eddington gas accretion occasionally happens as the ac-
cretion rate onto the black holes is not artificially capped
"at the Eddington rate. Instead, we include the Edding-"
"ton force acting on electrons in gas particles, directed"
radially away from the black hole so that the correspond-
ing feedback effects can reduce the gas inflow.
3. METHODS
3.1. Synthetic Image Generation
3.1.1. Radiative Transfer
"We generate noiseless, high-resolution images from"
our galaxy simulation data using the open-source radia-
tive transfer (RT) code Powderday (Narayanan et al.
"2021), which combines dust RT from Hyperion (Ro-"
bitaille 2011) with stellar population synthesis models
"from FSPS (Conroy et al. 2009; Conroy & Gunn 2010),"
and uses yt as a bridge between simulation codes (Turk
et al. 2011). Each star particle is assigned a spectral en-
"ergy distribution (SED) according to its mass, age, and"
"stellar metallicity, with an underlying Kroupa (2001) ini-"
"tial mass function. Similarly, each black hole particle is"
assigned an empirical Hopkins et al. (2007) SED accord-
ing to its bolometric luminosity. These SEDs are then
projected through the interstellar medium to generate
"broadband (912Å−1 mm) galaxy SEDs. We use Pow-
derday to form a dust grid with constant dust-to-metal"
"ratio of 0.4 and a Draine (2003) Milky Way dust model,"
then generate galaxy SEDs as well as filter-convolved
photometric images.
Each of our 30 galaxies are “observed” at 3 random
"orientations at each stored simulation snapshot, and run"
through Powderday. We then convolve the output
galaxy SEDs with the HST-WFC3 F160W filter to gen-
erate a total of 3145 IR photometric images at a resolu-
"tion of 512×512 pixels. Each image has a physical scale
of 200 kpc, yielding pixel sizes of 390 pc. The angular"
size of each image is appropriately scaled with the as-
sumed distance to the object. We apply a cosmological
surface brightness dimming by a factor of (1 + z)−5 to
"each image, in the original units of erg s−1 cm−2 nm−1"
3.1.2. Simulation of mock HST images
To convert our ideal sky images into HST-like syn-
"thetic images, we follow a process similar to Snyder et al."
"(2015b, 2019) by convolving with a point-spread func-"
tion (PSF) then introducing noise. The 390 pc pixel size
of the ideal sky images is approximately 0.05 arcsec at
"0.5 < z < 3, similar to the WFC3-IR mosaic pixel sizes"
"(0.06 arcsec) of the CANDELS drizzled images, and we"
choose PSF and noise parameters to approximate the
quality of those data products (Koekemoer et al. 2011;
Grogin et al. 2011).
We first convolve each pristine image with a Gaus-
sian PSF with full-width at half-maximum of 0.145 arc-
"sec, corresponding to the 0.145 arcsec core PSF of HST-"
WFC3 in the F160W filter. Next we add normally dis-
tributed sky shot noise to each image pixel so the fi-
nal image reaches a 5σ limiting surface brightness of 25
"mag arcsec−2, corresponding to a CANDELS-like imag-"
ing depth.
"Lastly, we inject each of our PSF-convolved + noise-"
added images into a randomly selected CANDELS im-
age. We use a modified version of the RealSim package
(Bottrell et al. 2019) to generate what they label “fully
realistic images”. They find that convolving synthetic
images into real fields dramatically improves the per-
formance of automated merger classifiers. We follow a
similar prescription to Bottrell et al.:
"1. Randomly select a CANDELS field, choosing from"
"the EGS, UDS, COSMOS, and GOODS-S fields."
We omit GOODS-N because of its different F160W
photometric resolution.
2. Randomly select a galaxy from the correspond-
"ing EGS (Stefanon et al. 2017), UDS (Galametz"
"et al. 2013), COSMOS (Nayyeri et al. 2017), or"
GOODS-S (Guo et al. 2013) full multiband cata-
3. Generate a deblended segmentation map (see Sec-
"tion 3.2) for the F160W image, within a 1024 ×
1024 cutout centered on the selected galaxy."
4. Randomly select an injection site within the
"cutout, with the restriction that the center of the"
injected image does not land on another object in
the segmentation map.
"5. Inject the mock image at the selected site, and"
extract the final 512×512 synthetic image cutout.
Figure 1 illustrates each step of the synthetic image gen-
eration pipeline for a randomly selected image.
3.2. Morphological Measurements
"Prior to measuring morphological statistics, we back-"
ground subtract each of our images and generate de-
blended segmentation maps using photutils. We first
estimate the background by iteratively measuring the 3σ
clipped median pixel flux until convergence. We then as-
"sume all pixels 1.2σ above the background are sources,"
and measure the morphology of the central source.
We measure non-parametric morphological statistics
designed to detect the presence of disturbance or multi-
ple nuclei. We use statmorph (Rodriguez-Gomez et al.
6 Sharma et al.

"Gini’s coefficient, G, measures inequality among pixel"
"flux values, and is normalized such that it ranges from"
0 (all pixels have equal flux) to 1 (one pixel contains all
flux). G is location-independent and hence is able to
detect multiple bright nuclei but is sensitive to which
pixels are selected for measurement. Building off the
"original construction in Glasser (1962), Lotz et al. (2004)"
find that G can be robustly calculated for galaxies above

3.3. Merger Identification
There is no single definitive way of identifying galaxy
mergers from either simulations or observational images.
"In this work, we explore multiple methods of identifying"
mergers from both the simulations and from our syn-
thetic images. We use a machine learning classifier in
order to enable a more unbiased comparison between
theory and observations. It is important to note that
our synthetic images have been specifically generated to
"emulate CANDELS-like observations, and our observa-"
tional merger diagnostics likely perform differently at
different image resolutions or depths.
3.3.1. Identifying Intrinsic Mergers
Observations of AGN within merging systems find the
most luminous AGN in the latest stages of major merg-
ers (Ellison et al. 2013; Koss et al. 2018). If galaxy merg-

between companion coalescence and the start of AGN
activity. The observability timescales of merger features
"have been found to be between 0.2−0.4 Gyr (Lotz et al.
2010; Ji et al. 2014), though Mantha et al. (2018) find"
that observability timescales evolve with redshift.
We define the time of merger in the simulation using
a close pairs method (Kocevski et al. 2012; Thompson
et al. 2015) in which stellar companions above a stellar
"mass ratio, M1/M2, fall within some 3D physical dis-"
"tance, R, of the central galaxy. We explore a number"
of time windows over which to capture pre- and post-
merger states. After identifying the simulation time at
"which a given central galaxy has a close pair, tmerger, we"
classify the galaxy as being in a “merging state” for a
"time range of ±500 Myr. This typically amounts to 3
simulation timesteps in each direction. We explore other"
definitions such as a time range centered on tmerger +250
"Myr, shorter and longer time ranges, and a redshift de-"
pendent observation timescale as discussed in Mantha
"et al. (2018); O’Leary et al. (2021), all of which have lit-"
tle to negative effect on automated merger classification
(see Section 3.3.3). We omit results using these other
time ranges for clarity. In this work we explore 4 close
pair definitions:
"• Major mergers, wide separation: M1/M2 ≥ 0.25,
R ≤ 50 kpc."
"• Major+minor mergers, wide separation:
M1/M2 ≥ 0.1, R ≤ 50 kpc."
"• Major mergers, narrow separation: M1/M2 ≥
0.25, R ≤ 30 kpc."
"• Major+minor mergers, narrow separation:
M1/M2 ≥ 0.1, R ≤ 30 kpc."
"We choose pair separations similar to those commonly
used in the literature (e.g. Lotz et al. 2010; Bignone"
et al. 2017). We track results for each of these 4 in-
trinsic merger definitions separately. For comparisons
"with observational merger classifications, we ultimately"
choose major mergers at wide separations as the baseline
intrinsic merger definition.
Rodriguez-Gomez et al. (2015) find that calculating
mass fractions based on companion stellar mass prior
to infall helps mitigate the various effects of merging on
"stellar mass (e.g, through stripping or induced star for-"
mation). Due to the complexity of tracing stellar com-
"panions through time, and since we mostly focus on the"
"effects of major mergers, we instead take the stellar mass"
of the companions at the times that close pairs are iden-
"tified. In particular, we expect this choice to signifi-"
cantly impact our results for minor mergers by reducing
the number of minor mergers we detect.
8 Sharma et al.
3.3.2. Observational Merger Classifiers
Next we explore various merger diagnostics and de-
termine how they perform for merger classification. We
"first explore merger diagnostics based purely in G−M20
and asymmetry - concentration space."
"Following Snyder et al. (2019), we rotate the G−M20
space to define two simplifying diagnostics relative to"
"the locus of points found in Lotz et al. (2008), the bulge"
"statistic F (G,M20) and the merger statistic S(G,M20):"
"F (G,M20) ="
"
|F | G ≥ −0.14M20 + 0.778−|F |, G < −0.14M20 + 0.778, (6)"
"where |F | = | − 0.693M20 + 4.95G− 3.85| (Snyder et al.
2015b). F , which extends parallel to the locus of points,"
is less sensitive than M20 to the effects of dust and merg-
"ers, which tend to move galaxies perpendicular to the"
locus of points. S instead extends perpendicular to the
locus of points:
"S(G,M20) ="
"
|S| G ≥ −0.14M20 + 0.33−|S|, G < −0.14M20 + 0.33, (7)"
"where |S| = |0.139M20 + 0.990G− 0.327| (Snyder et al.
2015a). Positive values tend to identify multiple cores"
(high M20) and starbursts (high G).
"Simple cuts in S(G,M20) have been found to success-"
fully identify mergers in low-redshift systems (Lotz et al.
"2004), where mergers are identified with S(G,M20) & 0.
Similarly, simple cuts in asymmetry have been found"
to identify mergers in large and bright galaxies out to
"z ∼ 3 (Conselice et al. 2003). However, when using these
statistics for identifying mergers in our synthetic images,"
we find that flat cuts on a single diagnostic do not ac-
curately select intrinsic mergers in our simulations. We
instead pursue an automated approach to merger clas-
"sification, which we find gives more precise merger clas-"
sifications.
3.3.3. A new automated method to select mergers
There are a number of approaches to automated
merger classification based on either the multidimen-
sional space of morphological diagnostics or based on the
image pixel values themselves. Nevin et al. (2019) per-
form linear discriminant analysis on a seven-dimensional
morphological diagnostic parameter space to generate
a merger classifier that robustly classifies major merg-
"ers and minors mergers separately, but not together."
Both Goulding et al. (2018) and Snyder et al. (2019)
use a random forest ensemble learning method to clas-
sify mergers based on a number of parametric and non-
parametric diagnostics including those described in this
work. Such an approach allows for direct comparisons
"with other diagnostic-based classifiers in the literature,"
at the potential cost of missing features not present in
the diagnostics used. Other studies such as Huertas-
"Company et al. (2018, 2019); Ćiprijanović et al. (2020);"
Bickley et al. (2021) use deep-learning methods to ro-
bustly identify morphological features from image pixel
values at the cost of large training set size requirements
and greater difficulty in direct comparisons with other
We choose a random forest (RF) ensemble learning
method for classifying mergers from our synthetic im-
ages. RFs are a non-parametric method that generates
decision trees to subdivide the multidimensional param-
"eter space. At each step of a given tree, a feature subdi-"
vision is chosen by identifying the subdivision with the
largest reduction in entropy. RFs benefit from their abil-
ity to be trained on high-level summary statistics rather
"than full astronomical images. However, as many other"
"methods, they require careful tuning of the many hy-"
perparameters. They may also present biases toward
the majority class when trained on unbalanced train-
ing sets. Since intrinsic mergers are more rare relative
"to non-mergers, we perform a random undersampling of"
the majority class (non-mergers) to bring the two classes
into balance. Results change little when we instead
apply random oversampling of the minority (mergers)
"class. However, these sampling techniques are not per-"
"fect, and any classifier will still suffer from the lack of"
intrinsic balance in the binary classes.
We use the Scikit-learn package (Pedregosa et al.
2011) to train and test a RF classifier on the non-
"parametric morphological statistics extracted from our
synthetic images (G, M20, A, and C) as well as redshift."
We label each image with a True or False binary classifi-
cation based on a given intrinsic merger definition. For
"simplicity, we show results for a single intrinsic merger"
definition that performed the best (major pairs with sep-
arations of at most 50 kpc) as the “true” merger classifi-
cation. Other intrinsic merger definitions exhibit worse
classification performance. We use cross-validation to
tune the maximum RF depth up to a maximum of 20
layers. We train the RF on a random subset of 2/3 of
"the synthetic images, then test classifications and re-"
"port results on the remaining, untouched 1/3. We use"
the Imbalanced-learn package (Lemâıtre et al. 2017)
to perform random undersampling of the majority class
within cross-validation. The RF outputs the classifica-

"tion probability for each image, which we transform into"
a classification prediction.
In order to map classification probabilities to binary
"classifications, we must first define common classifica-"
tion measures:
"• True Positive (TP): True mergers selected by clas-
sification."
"• False Positive (FP): Non-mergers selected by clas-
sification."
"• True Negative (TN): Non-mergers rejected by clas-
sification."
"• False Negative (FN): True mergers rejected by
classification."
Using these measures we also define the True Positive
Rate (or recall):
"TPR =
TP"
"TP + FN
, (8)"
10 Sharma et al.
the False Positive Rate:
"FPR =
FP"
"FP + TN
, (9)"
and the Positive Predictive Value (or precision):
"PPV =
TP"
"TP + FP
. (10)"
A classifier that perfectly includes mergers and ex-
"cludes non-mergers would hence have a TPR = 1,"
"FPR = 0, and PPV = 1. We select a classification"
"probability threshold using the F1 statistic, which iden-"
tifies the probability threshold at which:
"F1 =
TP"
"TP + 1
2
(FP + FN)"
", (11)"
is maximized. The F1 statistic attempts to strike a bal-
ance between the precision and recall. Scoring based
on precision and recall is especially important in un-
"balanced data sets like ours, which has fewer intrinsic"
mergers than non-mergers.
Figure 2 shows the Receiver Operating Characteris-
"tics (ROC) curve for the RF-trained classifier, which"
measures the diagnostic ability of the classifier as the
decision boundary changes. We show the ROC curve
and AUC values for the training set as well as the vali-
"dation set, marking the maximal F1 probability thresh-"
old on the validation set with a circle. We also include
the ROC curves for classification based solely on sliding
"S(G,M20) and asymmetry thresholds. The RF classifier"
"significantly out-performs the simple classifiers, where"
the simple classifiers effectively perform no better than
a random selection.
Figure 3 shows the confusion matrix for the full data
"set, training + validation. In each classification bin, we"
include the number of images as well as the fraction of
"true mergers/non-mergers (i.e, fraction of images in each"
row) that fall within each bin.
Figure 4 shows randomly selected synthetic images af-
ter classification along with the deblended segmentation
maps used for morphological analysis. Each image is
"cropped to a physical scale of 50 kpc, and indicates the"
target object redshift along with the classification prob-
ability.
Classifying mergers in this way has a few drawbacks.
"Foremost, the precision of the RF classifier is low, where"
only 47% of positive classifications are true positives.
"As seen in the confusion matrix, while most true merg-"
"ers are identified, merger fractions are typically overesti-"
mated relative to the intrinsic since many false positives
are also included. Further training shows that using only
"S(G,M20) & F (G,M20) as features for low redshift im-"
"ages, and asymmetry & concentration for high redshift"
images increases the precision at the cost of ROC perfor-
mance. This result confirms that certain morphological
diagnostics are most applicable in discerning mergers in
"certain redshift ranges, as has been shown before (Lotz"
et al. 2004; Conselice et al. 2003).
4. RESULTS
We now search for any connection between mergers
and triggering of AGN activity by 1) analyzing proper-
"ties of intrinsic mergers, 2) analyzing properties of merg-"
"ers classified from the synthetic images, and 3) compar-"
"ing intrinsic, classified, and observational merger statis-"
When we examine intrinsic mergers in our following
"analysis, we only focus on widely separated (< 50 kpc)"
pairs with a major companion (> 1 : 4). This definition
provides the best performance when training our au-
"tomated classifier, and hence provides the most robust"
comparisons.
A vital aspect of our analysis is accurately estimating
the luminosities of our SMBHs. We assume a piecewise
expression for bolometric luminosity that depends on
"the Eddington ratio, fEdd, such that radiatively ineffi-"
cient BHs have reduced luminosities:
Lbol =
"�r
1−�r"
"ṀBHc
2 fEdd > 0.1"
"10fEdd�rṀBHc
2 fEdd < 0.1,"
"where ṀBH is the accretion rate of the SMBH, and we"
choose �r = 0.1 (Churazov et al. 2005; Hirschmann et al.
2014; Habouzit et al. 2019). We also apply adjustments
to our AGN luminosities to account for AGN variabil-
ity on timescales below the simulation resolution limit.
Hickox et al. (2014) find that models where AGN spend
fractionally more time at low luminosities are able to re-
produce observed relationships between AGN luminos-
ity and star formation rate. We adopt their fiducial
"model, which follows a Schechter function of the form:"
"d logL
= t0"
")−α
exp (−L/Lcut) , (12)"
"where L is a relative luminosity, α = 0.2, and"
"Lcut = 100 〈Lbol〉. For each of our galaxies, we sam-
ple the distribution and extract a new Lbol. Including"
short-timescale variability adds additional variance to
"our AGN luminosities, with a longer tail toward dim"
SMBHs.
"Throughout our analysis, we frequently compare prop-"
erties of galaxies to properties of appropriately chosen
control galaxies. There are many ways to choose control
"galaxies, including selecting based on redshift, galaxy"
"physical properties, or environment. In this work we"
"select according to stellar mass, redshift, and an addi-"
tional criterion based on the quantity we wish to explore.
"For example, in studying the prevalence of mergers in"
"AGN, our sample of AGN with bolometric luminosities"
"Lbol > 10
43 erg s−1 is paired with inactive control galax-"
"ies with Lbol < 10
43 erg s−1. In general, to generate a"
"control sample, we first choose a suitable control crite-"
"ria, then select control galaxies within a factor of 2 of"
"the target galaxy’s stellar mass, from snapshots within"
"±500 Myr of the target galaxy’s snapshot. Each target
galaxy is paired with 2 control galaxies. We find that"
strengthening or relaxing any of these criteria does not
"strongly affect results, though it does influence the scale"
of our uncertainties.
4.1. Properties of Intrinsic Mergers
We begin by exploring the properties of intrinsic merg-
ers obtained from the simulation. We examine the
"merger fractions predicted by the simulation, the role"
"of mergers in fueling SMBH growth, and the role of gas"
content in potentially triggering AGN activity.
4.1.1. True merger statistics
In Figure 5 we compare the time evolution of merger
fraction for each merger definition. Following Cameron
"(2011), we calculate the 95% binomial confidence in-"
terval given the number of mergers identified by each
"definition, in each time bin. As expected, intrinsic def-"
initions with narrow separations exhibit lower merger
fractions overall than those with wide separations. All
close pair definitions peak in merger activity around
"z = 1 − 1.5. The inclusion of minor mergers has little
effect on merger fractions, increasing the merger frac-"
"tion by at most 5%. For comparison, we show pre-"
dicted companion fractions of massive central galaxies
"(M∗ > 10
10.3M�) with major (>1:4) stellar companions"
out to a projected 50 kpc from the empirical model of
O’Leary et al. (2021). We also compare with companion
"fractions of massive galaxies (M∗ > 2 × 1010M�) with
major companions (>1:4) out to a projected 50 kpc, ob-"
tained from all five CANDELS fields with corrections
with projection effects (Mantha et al. 2018). Our com-
panion fractions at comparable separation are signifi-
"cantly higher than these observational estimates, which"
generally agree with other estimates from observations
in the literature. Our merger fractions are sensitive to
"the merging timescale we choose. However, choosing"
"timescales smaller than ±500 Myr, results in substan-
tially worse performance in our automated merger clas-"
sifier (see Section 3.3.3)

"Figure 5. Intrinsic merger fractions versus cosmic time for
each close pair definition. Error bars indicate 95% binomial
confidence intervals. Widely separated pairs (blue curves)
exhibit substantially higher merger fractions at all times,
peaking at 35%, while narrowly separated pairs (red curves)
peak at 15%. Definitions that include both minor and ma-
jor mergers (solid curves) naturally exhibit slightly elevated
merger fractions relative to only major mergers (dashed
curves). All close pairs definitions peak in merger fraction
at intermediate redshifts around z = 1 − 1.5. At compara-
ble separations, our simulations predict higher merger frac-
tions than are predicted by the EMERGE empirical model
(O’Leary et al. 2021) and estimated from CANDELS obser-
vations (Mantha et al. 2018)."
An additional goal of our analysis is understand-
ing how important mergers are to the total growth of
SMBHs via gas accretion. By tracing the growth his-
"tories of all central SMBHs and identifying times when
the host halo has undergone a merger, we can deter-"
mine the fraction of total SMBH growth attributable to
merger activity.
Figure 6 shows the fraction of SMBH mass accreted
"during mergers, as a function of fractional time the cen-"
tral galaxy spent in a merging state. We define mergers
"here by the ±500 Myr period where a major companion
within 50 kpc is identified. Here MBH,acc is the mass"
accreted by all SMBHs within the galaxy during merg-
"ers, MBH,tot is the total mass of all SMBHs within the"
"galaxy by z = 0.5, tmerger is the time spent by the host"
"in a merging state, and ttot is the total amount of time"
the host galaxy has hosted a SMBH. We identify SMBHs
"within 0.1×R200 of the galaxy center.
More time spent in a merging state does not guar-"
antee increased accretion onto SMBHs. While three
SMBHs accrete the majority of their mass during pe-

ing periods of host mergers, as a function of time spent by
the host in a merging state. We define mergers as intrinsic
major mergers within 50 kpc. We track the growth of all
SMBHs within 0.1×R200 at each simulation timestep. Only
three halos grow the majority of their SMBH mass while un-
dergoing mergers. However, the majority of halos grow their
central SMBHs little during periods of merger activity. The
time a halo spends in mergers does not correlate clearly with
how much mass accretes onto SMBHs."
"riods of galaxy mergers, the majority of SMBHs do not"
experience most of their growth during these periods.
"Though we plot growth for all SMBHs within each host,"
the growth is entirely dominated by the central SMBH
in all cases.
4.1.3. Role of gas content in driving AGN activity
We now explore the role of gas content in the ignition
of AGN via galaxy interactions. If mergers occur when
there is very little gas in either of the merging galaxies
"(i.e, dry mergers), it is to be expected that they would"
not trigger BH growth or AGN activity. We track the
total gas mass of the central galaxy and all stellar com-
panions falling within 50 kpc.
Figure 7 shows the number of satellites with total gas
"mass (satellite + central, solid lines) above the given"
"threshold, binned by redshift. We also include the num-"
ber of satellites with satellite gas mass above the thresh-
old (dashed). Each redshift bin is chosen to contain
equal numbers of timesteps between 0.5 < z < 3.
"Central galaxies at high redshift 1) contain more gas,"
"2) host more satellites overall, and 3) host higher num-"
"bers of gas rich satellites. By redshift z = 0.5, satellites"
"are often devoid of gas. Hence, if gas content plays an"
"important role, it is the higher redshift mergers that"
"would be most likely to trigger AGN, if such a connec-"
tion exists.

High redshift galaxies tend to be more gas rich and undergo
more mergers. At low redshifts, there are fewer total satel-
lites and galaxies tend to be more gas poor, suggesting high

redshift mergers."
We next choose three central galaxies that were gas
"rich at z ∼ 3 and track both their central gas density
and the total bolometric luminosity of all SMBHs resid-"
ing within. Bolometric luminosities are dominated by
the central SMBH in all cases. We first define the gas

"fore the merger, stay consistent throughout, then plum-"
met as the central gas content is evacuated. This halo’s
growth history shows that some mergers do appear to
"be connected with enhanced accretion onto the SMBH,"
leading to observable levels of AGN activity.
Halo m0908 instead undergoes a major merger with-
out significant AGN activity and only a slight variation
"in central gas density. Instead, AGN activity slowly in-"
creases over time as the SMBH grows. The SMBH grows
via slow gas accretion from a central gas supply that is
constantly replenished by the rest of the galaxy.
"Finally, halo m0220 has one major merger which ap-"
pears to slightly affect AGN activity. Distinct from the
"other two halos, AGN activity increases slightly during"
"the merger, then quickly increases some time after the"
"merger completes. As found in Choi et al. (2018), gas"
"is quickly consumed or ejected until the AGN shuts off,"
likely from lack of fuel.
Neither halo m0908 nor halo m0220 are consistent
with gas-rich mergers as the primary driver of AGN ac-
tivity. This set of halos illustrates that major merg-
ers may sometimes appear to be connected with major
"episodes of black hole accretion, but not all AGN activ-"
ity is connected with mergers and not all mergers are
"connected with enhanced AGN activity. Further, it ap-"
"pears that even when galaxies are gas rich, mergers are"
not guaranteed to trigger significant accretion onto the
SMBH. Criteria in addition to gas richness are likely
required in order to trigger AGN activity.
4.2. Comparison of Intrinsic and Classified Mergers
Next we explore the characteristics of our merger clas-
sifier applied to the synthetic images. We examine the
morphologies exhibited by the central galaxy in each
"synthetic image, then search for any connection between"
major mergers identified through the classifier and in-
trinsic AGN activity. We then determine the effects
of including short-timescale AGN variability on any in-
ferred AGN-merger connections.
When estimating merger fractions derived from the
"synthetic images, we apply an additional correction for"
"the known incompleteness of the automated classifier,"
in order to form more equal comparisons with intrinsic
"merger fractions. Following Snyder et al. (2019), we"
define the merger fraction for classified mergers as:
14 Sharma et al.
"fmerger =
NRF
N"
"TPR
, (15)"
for NRF number of mergers identified by the classi-
fier and N total images. The additional factor of
PPV/TPR is sensitive to the degree of precision the
"classifier is able to reach, and especially sensitive to the"
probability threshold selected for the classifier. The
trained classifier yields a correction of approximately
PPV/TPR ∼ 0.6.
4.2.1. Synthetic galaxy morphologies
We first look at the distribution of morphologies from
our simulated images and compare to the morphologies
from CANDELS. Figure 9 shows the distribution of the
data from the simulated images in Gini-M20 space in
bins of redshift. Our synthetic morphologies tend to
lie just below the Lotz et al. (2008) dividing line be-
tween mergers and non-mergers and exhibit a similar
slope to the corresponding locus of CANDELS galaxies.
The merger dividing line corresponds with the line of
"S(G,M20) = 0. At all redshifts, disk-dominated galax-"
"ies make up the largest fraction (∼ 65%), while bulge-
dominated galaxies make up ∼ 20% of galaxies. The
fraction of merging galaxies peaks at high redshifts, at"
approximately 21%. These fractions are in approximate
agreement with CANDELS in each redshift bin.
We also compare the simulation morphologies to
"CANDELS in asymmetry-concentration space, shown in"
Figure 10. We include Bershady et al. (2000) divisions
"between bulge- and disk-dominated galaxies, and merg-"
"ing systems. At all redshifts, it is now bulge-dominated"
"galaxies that make up the largest fraction (∼ 70%),
while disk-dominated galaxies make up ∼ 30% of galax-
ies. Mergers identified through a single cut in asymme-"
"try make up a small fraction of the sample, 1% or lower."
Synthetic image morphologies do not agree with CAN-
DELS in asymmetry-concentration space. CANDELS
"galaxies tend to be more disk-dominated, and have more"
mergers at high redshift.
4.2.2. Merger fraction does not depend on AGN activity
"With intrinsic merger statistics in hand, we now study"
the classifier merger statistics and explore the connec-
tion between AGN activity and merger selection. For
"AGN identified by Lbol > 10
43 erg s−1, we select mass-"
matched and redshift-matched control galaxies such that
"Lbol < 10
43 erg s−1. Following Kocevski et al. (2012,"
"2017), we compare our merger and AGN statistics to"
those from mass-matched galaxies at 0.5 < z < 3 from
"the F160W CANDELS observations in the EGS, UDS,"
and GOODS fields. X-ray followup in all but the UDS
CANDELS fields come from publicly available Chandra
point-source catalogs. We use the 4 Ms (Xue et al. 2011)
and 2 Ms (Xue et al. 2016) point-source catalogs for
"GOODS South and North, the 800 ks catalog (Nandra"
"et al. 2015) for EGS. For UDS, we use a 600 ks source"
catalog from the X-UDS survey (Kocevski et al. 2018).
We compile stellar masses for GOODS South and UDS
"(Santini et al. 2015), EGS (Stefanon et al. 2017), and"
GOODS North (Barro et al. 2019). We also apply our
"automated classifier, trained on the synthetic images,"
to the same 4 non-parametric morphological statistics
derived from the CANDELS photometry.
"Figure 11 compares intrinsic, classified, and CAN-"
"DELS merger fractions as a function of cosmic time, for"
"galaxies hosting AGN (Lbol > 10
43 erg s−1) versus the"
"inactive (Lbol < 10
43 erg s−1) control sample. In par-"
"ticular, we compare intrinsic merger fractions to merger"
"fractions derived from the RF classifier, applied to both"
CANDELS and the synthetic images. We show the com-
"panion pair fraction from Kocevski et al. (2012), as well"
"as the interaction fractions from Rosario et al. (2015),"
both of which are comparable quantities derived from
"CANDELS observations. As before, we apply a correc-"
tion to classifier-based merger fractions.
There is no strong evidence of an excess in intrinsic
merger fraction among AGN. Our intrinsic merger frac-
tions are consistent with merger fractions from Kocevski
"et al. (2012) and Rosario et al. (2015) across time, hov-"
"ering between 10−30%. Classified merger fractions tend
to be slightly higher above z & 1, and lower below. The
lowest redshift bin shows a factor of 10× excess in the
classified synthetic merger fractions. It is also worth not-"
ing this excess is not seen in the classified CANDELS im-
ages despite the classifier reproducing consistent merger
"fractions, suggesting that the classifier performs funda-"
mentally differently from the human visual classification
"system used in Rosario et al. However, it could also indi-"
cate that the classifier trained on synthetic images does
not transfer well to real images. The latter would not be
surprising considering the slightly different distributions
of asymmetry and concentration in CANDELS relative
to the synthetic images.
Next we explore how merger fraction depends on
AGN luminosity between redshifts 0.5 < z < 3. We
make sequentially higher cuts on bolometric luminosity
and examine the merger fraction relative to the corre-
sponding inactive control sample. Figure 12 shows how
merger fractions vary with increasing bolometric lumi-
nosity thresholds relative to the inactive control sam-
"ples, in both the intrinsic and classified cases. We also"
plot the fractional excess merger fraction for AGN ver-

Even the most luminous AGN in our sample do not
exhibit a significant enhancement of merger fraction rel-
ative to the control galaxies. Neither the intrinsic nor
the classified merger fractions are significantly different
from their corresponding control samples in any lumi-
nosity bin.
4.2.3. AGN fraction is not correlated with mergers
Previously we asked whether we could detect a dif-
ference in the merger fraction of AGN hosts compared
with an inactive control sample. We now ask the reverse
question: do we see a difference in the AGN fraction of
"a sample of galaxy mergers, compared to a non-merging"
control sample.

merging systems is consistent with the AGN fraction in

"Next we track the evolution of AGN fraction before,"
"during, and after mergers between redshifts 0.5 < z < 3,"
and search for enhancement relative to the control sam-
ple. We relax our merger definition by tracking each halo

criterion such that the most recent/soonest merger is"

Figure 14 shows AGN fractions for galaxies during
"each stage of a merger, compared to the AGN frac-"
tion of the corresponding control galaxies. We center
the merger times at the simulation timestep where a
"merger was identified, such that positive/negative values"
"of t − tmerger correspond with post-/pre-merger states,
respectively. Similar to Figure 12, we plot the fractional"
excess in AGN fraction at each merger stage.
"Within ±1 Gyr of merger identification, both intrin-
sic mergers and those identified from the synthetic im-"
ages show similar AGN fractions throughout all merger
"stages, and show no statistically significant difference"
relative to their corresponding control sets. It is worth
noting that AGN fractions both show a slight excess at
"250 Myr prior to merger, but the residual uncertainties"
are consistent with no significant excess. AGN fractions
for the classified mergers are consistently slightly offset
"from the non-merging control sample, but show little"
difference in shape at any merger stage.
5. DISCUSSION
5.1. Caveats
Our analysis has a few caveats that must be consid-
"ered, including the impact of torus-scale dust obscu-"
"ration on identifying AGN, the impact of simulation"
"resolution and sub-grid physics, the subtleties of our"
"methodology, and the impact of our merger detection"
methods.
Many studies have found that mid-IR selected AGN
show a stronger correlation with mergers than AGN
"selected at other wavelengths (e.g, Satyapal et al."
2014; Ellison et al. 2019). Donley et al. (2018) find
"that IR-selected, heavily obscured AGN in the CAN-"
DELS/COSMOS field are more likely than X-ray-
"selected AGN to be identified as disturbed, potentially"
"post-merger, systems. Kocevski et al. (2015) find heav-"

than unobscured AGN to show signatures of galaxy in-
teractions.
"Although our RT model includes galaxy-scale dust, it"
does not include dust on the scale of the accretion struc-
ture surrounding the black hole. While we know what
"the intrinsic accretion rates onto the central SMBHs are,"
we do not take into account the torus-scale obscuration
"in the generation of our synthetic images, or our bolo-"
metric luminosity cuts. The inclusion of torus-scale ob-
scuration may be an important ingredient in realistically
selecting AGN from the simulations. Future work may
benefit from more detailed modeling of AGN emission
"(e.g, Done et al. 2012) and torus-scale obscuration (such"
"as the models detailed in Nenkova et al. 2008b,a)."
Simulation resolution and sub-grid physics could also
impact our results. Our choices of SMBH accretion and
feedback physics within the simulation directly impact
"the measured AGN activity, and are themselves depen-"
dent on simulation resolution. In order to study the im-
"pact of mergers on AGN activity, both AGN scales and"
cosmological scales must be simulated at high resolu-
tion. Simulations run at higher spatial resolution would
"allow the inclusion of more detailed physics, that occurs"
well below the resolution limit of our simulations. For
"example, hyper-zoom simulations that study accretion"
onto SMBH find that the Bondi-Hoyle approximation
used in our simulation suite may be quite inaccurate
(Angles-Alcazar et al. 2020). This can further wash out
the correlation between merger events and a detectable
enhancement in AGN activity.
Due to the nature of high-resolution zoom-in simu-
"lations, we do not have a cosmologically representative"
"sample relative to larger, uniform cosmological simula-"
tions and observational surveys. Although we can in-
crease our image sample size by observing each galaxy
"from multiple orientations, we likely suffer from system-"
"atics. For example, our simulation suite does not include"
the very massive systems that likely give rise to the most
"luminous AGN and quasars at high redshifts, and may"
not provide good statistical representation of rare major
"mergers. With only 30 halos, we are likely not sampling"
the full diversity of halo merger histories.
Our methodology itself has some caveats as well. As
"seen in Figure 3, our automated classifier performs well"
in finding true mergers at the cost of incorrectly classi-
fying many non-mergers. The high impurity in our clas-
sifier means that it is often difficult to disentangle the
effects of the mock-observation process from the short-
falls of the classifier. At low redshifts in Figures 11 and
"13, we found an excess of merger fraction and AGN frac-"
"tion, respectively, for classified synthetic images. How-"
"ever, because of the above discussion along with the rel-"
"atively large uncertainties on the intrinsic fractions, we"
caution against over-interpretation of the excess in the
classified synthetic image fractions.
The intrinsic merger fractions in the lowest redshift
"bin hint at a similar excess, however we are limited"
by number statistics and cannot properly constrain the
difference. Although we partially mitigate the small
sample size in the synthetic images by generating im-
"ages from multiple orientations, we caution against over-
interpreting the strength of this excess merger fraction."
"Finally, there are many ways that mergers can be"
identified both within the simulation and in observa-
"tions. As discussed in Section 3.3, we choose to iden-"
tify mergers within the simulation based on a close
"pairs method. Similar studies (e.g, Rodriguez-Gomez"
et al. 2015; Abruzzo et al. 2018) instead generate galaxy
merger trees to identify galaxy mergers. The generated
merger tree depends on the precise algorithm used to
link galaxies to their progenitors. It is not clear how
the choice of merger selection method or merger tree
generation algorithm affects the end sample of selected
"mergers, or even if such methods are directly compara-"

images exhibit higher AGN fractions than expected at high redshift."
Our study has yielded some important insights into
the AGN-merger connection and our ability to probe it
with observations. It is clear that the simple picture
painted by binary merger simulations such as those pre-
sented by Hopkins et al. (2005) is not representative
of the results of modern cosmological simulations. The
"reasons for these differences are not yet entirely clear,"
"and will be the subject of future studies, but we can"
speculate on some of them. The most commonly used
initial conditions for the binary merger simulations are
"1:1 mergers of thin, rotationally supported (Milky Way"
like) spiral galaxies. These are likely very different from
"the progenitors of most AGN hosts, particularly at high"
"redshift, which based on both simulations and observa-"
"tions, are more likely to be highly turbulent, thickened,"
and more gas rich. Extremely gas rich galaxies are ac-
tually thought to be less susceptible to strong merger-
"driven nuclear inflows, as most of the torque that drives"
gas inwards is caused by the lag between the gaseous and
stellar bar (Robertson et al. 2006; Hopkins et al. 2009).
"Moreover, there have been few studies on the impact of"
"minor mergers on AGN triggering, though studies of nu-"
clear inflows and starbursts indicate that minor mergers
would be expected to have a less dramatic impact (Cox
et al. 2008). The response of the disk to a perturber is
also sensitive to the radial extent and presence of a pre-
"existing bulge in the primary, and to the satellite orbit"
"(Cox et al. 2008). Finally, the idealized binary merger"
simulations did not include cosmological accretion or ac-
cretion of cold gas from a hot halo.
"On the other hand, modern cosmological simulations"
also give varying results. McAlpine et al. (2020) find
that mergers strongly correlate with an enhancement of
"AGN fraction within gas-rich M∗ ∼ 1010M� galaxies
in the EAGLE cosmological simulation, in slight ten-"
sion with our findings of similar mass galaxies. Both
this work and McAlpine et al use comparable meth-
"ods of identifying intrinsic mergers, and we both find"
"1) similar merger and AGN fractions across time, and"
2) that mergers are not a significant growth mode for
"the BH, either because accretion enhancement is too lit-"
"tle, mergers do not last long enough, or there are too"
few significant mergers. Using the “genetic modifica-
tion” technique on a zoom-in cosmological simulation
"of similar resolution to our simulations, Pontzen et al."
(2017) find that changing the merger history of a halo
"with virial mass Mvir ∼ 1012M� can change the impact
of AGN feedback on star formation, but does not sig-"
nificantly alter the AGN activity or BH growth during
periods of mergers. BH accretion is instead sustained
by a turbulent disk sweeping cold gas onto the BH.

ers (red). The bottom panel shows the fractional residual

"Ultimately, all simulation results are impacted by"
the simulation characteristics and implementation of
physics. Given the interaction of all of the physical fac-
tors with the expected sensitivity to the sub-grid recipes
"for star formation, stellar feedback, black hole accretion,"
"and to resolution, it is perhaps not surprising that even"
recent cosmological simulations present a mixed picture
of the AGN-merger connection. More detailed studies
that look at the effect of mergers in different simula-
tions while controlling for these other variables (progen-
"itor structure and morphology, gas fraction, orbit, etc)"
will be needed to begin to disentangle these effects.
Another very important conclusion of our study is
that we do not expect to see significant enhancement
"of AGN activity in early stage mergers, when galaxies"
can be identified as close pairs. Any enhancement is
"expected to manifest in late stage mergers, after the"
"nuclei have coalesced, as seen in e.g, McAlpine et al."
(2020). Traditional methods used to identify mergers
"from images, including those based on non-parametric"
"morphological statistics, are not even very effective at"
identifying early stage mergers — identifying a post-
"merger system is likely much more difficult. However,"
pixel-based deep learning techniques such as those uti-
lized by Huertas-Company et al. (2018) may be able to
"identify these late-stage mergers more effectively, and"
this is something that we can test with our synthetic
images.
Although our results are consistent with the observa-
tional CANDELS sample that was the target compar-
"ison sample for our study, our results are on the face"
of it in tension with those of some observational studies
that have found evidence for significant enhancement in
"the merger fraction of AGN hosts, and of the AGN frac-"
"tion of mergers/post-mergers especially around z ∼ 0
(e.g. Satyapal et al. 2014; Ellison et al. 2019). Rosario"
et al. (2015) suggest that evolving gas fractions may
mean mergers are required to trigger AGN in the local
"universe, but are not necessary at high redshifts. We em-"
phasize that in order to assess the consistency between
a particular simulation and a particular observational
"analysis, it is critical to carry out the analysis in a con-"
sistent manner on synthetic observations created with
great care to match the observational characteristics of
the sample to be compared with.
6. CONCLUSION
In this paper we explored the connection between
mergers and SMBH growth and activity in a set of cos-
mological zoom-in simulations and the CANDELS sur-
vey. We identify “true” mergers within the simulation
by identifying close pairs of both minor and major com-
panions. We run the dust radiative transfer code Pow-
derday in post-processing to generate mock observa-
tions that emulate the characteristics of the CANDELS
survey. We then train a Random Forest based classifier
to identify mergers based on non-parametric morpholog-
ical statistics measured from the synthetic images.
"Comparing intrinsic mergers, mergers identified from"
"the synthetic images, and mergers identified from CAN-"
"DELS images, we study how AGN activity correlates"
with these merger events. By carefully selecting mass-
"matched control samples, we compare how the merger"
"fraction varies between AGN hosts and inactive galaxies,"
as well as how AGN fractions vary between merging and
"non-merging systems. Finally, we explore the role gas"
content may play in driving AGN activity via mergers.
We find that:
1. AGN hosts do not exhibit higher close-pair frac-
tions than inactive galaxies. Merging systems
identified from the simulation and those identi-
fied from the synthetic images are typically equally
likely to host an AGN as an inactive SMBH in
"the control sample. Further, the most luminous"
20 Sharma et al.
AGN are no more likely than inactive galaxies to
be found within merging systems.
2. The AGN fraction in merging (close-pair) systems
is consistent with that in non-merging systems.
3. The predictions of our state-of-the-art cosmolog-
ical simulations for the AGN-merger connection
are consistent with the CANDELS observational
"sample, when the analysis is carried out in a rea-"
sonably comparable manner.
4. Merger-induced enhancement of AGN activity
"likely occurs, if at all, at a rather subtle level, and"
in late stages of mergers.
5. Most SMBHs in our simulations do not grow sig-
"nificantly during periods of merger activity, al-"
though some do. The time period that a galaxy
spends in a merging state has no clear bearing on
how much a SMBH grows.
6. The lack of correlation seen between merging and
AGN activity is not due to most mergers being
gas poor. Even gas rich mergers do not necessarily
trigger activity in the central SMBH.
"Together this evidence suggests that, while gas-rich"
mergers may sometimes trigger observable AGN activ-
"ity, there are probably other mechanisms that play a"
significant role in fueling moderate luminosity AGN and
driving the growth of SMBH. We plan to further in-
vestigate the role of torus-scale obscuration and short-
timescale AGN variability on the detection of an AGN-
merger connection in future work.
