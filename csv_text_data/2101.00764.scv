ABSTRACT
We use Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO(2–1) observations of six low-redshift
Palomar-Green quasars to study the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas of their host
"galaxies at kpc-scale resolution. While the molecular gas content, molecular gas fraction, and star"
"formation rates are similar to those of nearby massive, star-forming galaxies, the quasar host galaxies"
"possess exceptionally compact, disky molecular gas distributions with a median half-light radius of"
"1.8 kpc and molecular gas mass surface densities & 22M� pc
−2. While the overall velocity field of the"
"molecular gas is dominated by regular rotation out to large radii, with rotation velocity-to-velocity"
"dispersion ratio & 9, the nuclear region displays substantial kinematic complexity associated with
small-scale substructure in the gas distribution. A tilted-ring analysis reveals that the kinematic"
"and photometric position angles are misaligned on average by ∼ 34 ± 26◦, and provides evidence of
kinematic twisting. These observations provide tantalizing clues to the detailed physical conditions of"
the circumnuclear environments of actively accreting supermassive black holes.
Keywords: galaxies: active — galaxies: kinematics and dynamics — quasars: general
1. INTRODUCTION
Correlations between host galaxy bulge properties and
supermassive black hole (BH) mass (Kormendy & Rich-
stone 1995; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; Gebhardt et al.
2000; Tremaine et al. 2002) have led to the conclusion
that galaxies and BHs coevolve (Richstone et al. 1998;
"Kormendy & Ho 2013), perhaps mediated by feedback"
mechanisms from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that reg-
ulate gas accretion toward the center and star formation
"on galactic scales (e.g., Fabian 2012; Heckman & Best"
2014). AGN feedback can produce strong multi-phase
"gas outflows (e.g., Cicone et al. 2014; Perna et al. 2015;"
Feruglio et al. 2015; Karouzos et al. 2016; Morganti 2017;

"Cicone et al. 2018; Fluetsch et al. 2019) that are powerful
enough to heat or remove the interstellar medium from"
"the host galaxy (Silk & Rees 1998; Harrison et al. 2018),"
thereby suppressing subsequent star formation activity
"(e.g., Dubois et al. 2016) and keeping the host galaxy"
quiescent (Fabian 2012). It is a key ingredient in numer-
"ical, theoretical and semi-analytic models to reproduce"
the lack of massive galaxies in the high-mass end of the
mass function (e.g. Kauffmann & Haehnelt 2000; Cro-
ton et al. 2006; Schaye et al. 2015; Sijacki et al. 2015;
Lacey et al. 2016).
"Notwithstanding these compelling arguments, serious"
doubts remain as to whether AGN feedback effectively
removes sufficient cold gas from the host galaxy to cur-
tail its ongoing star formation activity. The interstellar
medium content of the host galaxies of nearby AGNs
shows no evidence of depletion relative to star-forming
"galaxies of similar stellar mass, based on gas masses de-"

rived from direct observations of neutral atomic hydro-
gen (Ho et al. 2008; Fabello et al. 2011; Geréb et al. 2015;
Zhu & Wu 2015; Ellison et al. 2019) and CO (Maiolino
et al. 1997; Evans et al. 2001; Scoville et al. 2003; Evans
et al. 2006; Bertram et al. 2007; Shangguan et al. 2020a;
"Jarvis et al. 2020), as well as inferred indirectly from"
dust emission (Shangguan et al. 2018; Shangguan & Ho
2019) or dust extinction (Zhuang & Ho 2020; Yesuf &
"Ho 2020). Far from being quenched, stars seem to form"
with even greater efficiency in the host galaxies of lu-
minous AGNs (Shangguan et al. 2020b; Zhuang & Ho
2020). It should be further noted that AGN host galax-
"ies possess not only a “normal” gas reservoir, but the"
"gas appears largely kinematically regular, as evidenced"
by their global line widths in H I (Ho et al. 2008) and
"CO (Shangguan et al. 2020b), which are consistent with"
"rotational support, and by the absence of significant"
molecular outflows (Shangguan et al. 2020a).
The above-mentioned observations suggest that AGN
"feedback, if present, imparts only a modest, likely lo-"
"calized effect on the cold gas. For example, the exist-"
ing molecular gas observations cannot rule out that the
cold gas is in the process of being expelled from nuclei
but still associated with the host galaxy. And while
AGNs can heat the molecular gas and suppress star
formation through “negative” feedback (Papadopoulos
"et al. 2010), they can also exert the opposite effect—"
“positive” feedback—that can compress the cold gas
and enhance star formation (Cresci et al. 2015; Carniani
et al. 2016; Maiolino et al. 2017; Cresci & Maiolino 2018;
Gallagher et al. 2019). From an observational point
"of view, the impact of AGN feedback is still far from"
"settled, and it is essential to obtain spatially resolved"
information on the molecular gas in active galaxies to
gain further insight into the physical processes that gov-
ern the coevolution of supermassive BHs and their host
galaxies.
"Quasars, the most luminous of the active galaxies, are"
the ideal sites to investigate the possible interplay be-
tween AGN feedback and the molecular gas of their host
galaxies. In the popular merger-driven evolutionary sce-
"nario of quasars (Sanders et al. 1988), two gas-rich galax-"
"ies merge, gravitational torques drive the cold gas to the"
"center of the merger remnant, and vigorous starburst ac-"
tivity and BH growth ensue. The prodigious energy re-
"leased by the AGN expels the enshrouding gas and dust,"
"giving birth to an optically visible, largely unobscured"
quasar (Hopkins et al. 2008).
The frequent association of a young stellar population
with quasar host galaxies supports the notion that star
"formation accompanies or precedes AGN activity (e.g.,"

"However, stellar morphology studies of quasar host"
galaxies suggest that only a fraction of the systems
show tidal and/or dynamical perturbation signatures
that may be associated to recent merger activity (e.g.
Veilleux et al. 2009). Not all the quasar hosts with en-
hanced star formation activity show evidence of dynam-
ical perturbations (Shangguan et al. 2020b). The equal
mass merger scenario may be applicable to ultralumi-
nous infrared galaxies and AGNs hosted in ellipticals.
"But, in other cases, unequal mass mergers which do not"
perturb the more massive interacting galaxy may be re-
quired.

"sample has been studied extensively, enjoying a rich"

"1992; Ho & Kim 2009), radio properties (Kellermann"

We benefit from our Cycle 5 Atacama Compact
"(Morita) Array (ACA) survey (Shangguan et al. 2020a),"
which targeted the carbon monoxide molecule (12CO)
"J = 2 → 1 transition [νrest = 230.538 GHz; here-
inafter CO(2–1)] for a subset of 23 z < 0.1 PG quasars"
selected from our previous infrared study (Shangguan
et al. 2018). Along with other molecular gas observa-
"tions reported in the literature, we now have CO mea-"
surements for a representative subset of 40 PG quasars
at z < 0.3 (Shangguan et al. 2020a). The main goal of
this study is to characterize in greater detail the spa-
tial distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas
for the small subset of PG quasars with brightest CO
"emission. By using these selection criteria, we aim to"
maximize source detection coverage and facilitate the
morpho-kinematic analysis. We employed no further
constraint to select our targets.
"The paper is organized as follows. Our sample, mea-"
"surements, and comparison sample are described in Sec-"
tion 2. Section 3 presents the models used to analyze the
data and their basic results. We further discuss our find-
"ings from a global perspective in Section 4, and we con-"
clude in Section 5. We adopt a ΛCDM cosmology with
"Ωm = 0.308, ΩΛ = 0.692, and H0 = 67.8 km s
−1 Mpc−1"
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2016).
2. SAMPLE AND OBSERVATIONS
2.1. ALMA Observations and Data Reduction
We analyze Cycle 6 ALMA follow-up observations
(program 2018.1.00006.S; PI: F. Bauer) of the six PG
quasar host galaxies (Table 1) taken from our z < 0.1
PG quasar subsample (Shangguan et al. 2020a). These
six objects constitute the brightest CO(2–1) sources
"within the ACA sample, which enables us to obtain"
"deep, . 0.′′4–1.′′4-scale imaging with reasonable expo-
sure times. They are representative of low-z PG quasars"
with low to moderate BH masses and luminosities (Fig-
ure 1) and disk-like stellar morphology (Table 1). The
ALMA observations were carried during November 2018
to March 2019 in good weather conditions with pre-
"cipitate water vapor (PWV) . 2.1 mm. All the tar-
gets were observed by 43 antennas. These observations"
were designed to detect the continuum and CO(2–1)
"line in Band 6 using four spectral windows, each cov-"
ering 1.875 GHz in bandwidth with a spectral resolu-
"tion of 7.8125 MHz, equivalent to a channel resolution"
"of ∼ 11 km s−1. The observational setup for each source
is described in Table 2. The ALMA flux calibration un-"
"certainty is . 10 % (Fomalont et al. 2014; Bonato et al.
2018)."
We use the Common Astronomy Software Application
(CASA; McMullin et al. 2007) to reduce the ALMA
"data, employing the standard pipeline to calibrate the"
data to generate the uv visibilities. To minimize miss-
ing flux from possible extended source emission and to
obtain more sensitive imaging of the total CO(2–1) emis-
"sion, we concatenate our Cycle 6 observations with the"
previous Cycle 5 ACA observations using the task con-
cat. For the ACA data we consider the same spec-
tral channel flagging that Shangguan et al. (2020a) em-
"ployed in their work, while for the 12-m antenna data"
we flag the spectral channels near a sky feature found
"at ∼ 233.7 GHz. The flagged channels are then input to
the task uvcontsub to subtract the continuum, before"
proceeding with imaging the line emission.
The emission-line imaging is performed using tclean
with robust weighting (robust = 0.5) and a channel
resolution of 11 km s−1. The spatial pixel scale is set to
sample the synthesized beam by five pixels. Visual in-
spection of the masks constructed by the masking proce-
dure auto-multithresh indicates that optimal results
"can be obtained by setting the noise, sidelobe, and low-"
"noise thresholds to 4.0, 1.0, and 1.5, respectively, and"
the fractional beam size to 0.4. All other parameters of
"auto-multithresh were left at their default values, as"
recommended for combined ACA and 12-m data.1 The
RMS values and the sizes of the synthesized beam are
given in Table 2.
2.2. Emission-line Characterization and Map
Construction
We implement a three-step procedure to characterize
"the CO(2–1) emission-line shapes. For each pixel, we"
first average the spectrum by considering a box/squared
region with size comparable to the synthesized beam
"(e.g., Swinbank et al. 2012), and we estimate the noise"
from the line-free channels. We fit a Gaussian model
to the spectrum using the least-squares minimization
procedure implemented in the Python package lm-
"fit (Newville et al. 2014). As initial guesses, we as-"
sume that the line centroid equals to the line peak loca-
"tion in the spectrum, and that the line width equals to"
20 km s−1. The line width is restricted to a maximum
value of 500 km s−1. We use the Bayesian information
"criterion (BIC; Schwarz 1978), which penalizes by the"

"model parameter number, instead of a χ2-based crite-"
rion to determine whether a line is detected. We esti-
mate the likelihood of the best-fit Gaussian model by
"comparing it with a straight line fit (i.e., no emission"
line present). We consider a 5σ probability threshold
"for detection. If this threshold is not achieved, we bin"
the spectrum over a larger area by increasing the size
"of the extraction box by one pixel per side, and then"
repeat the fit until either the probability threshold is
achieved or the third iteration is reached. If no detec-
"tion is achieved after three iterations, we assume that"
"no emission is present, mask the pixel, and skip to the"
next one. We stop at the third binning iteration in or-
der to avoid large binned zones when compared to the
beam size. We also exclude highly uncertain models
by masking pixels that have lines with peak signal-to-
noise (S/N) lower than 3. Pixels with high S/N often
"show asymmetric, occasionally highly complicated line"
"shapes. When an emission line is detected, we increase"
the number of Gaussian components and we repeat the
fit. We compute the multi-Gaussian model likelihood
by calculating BIC with respect to the last accepted
"model. Again, we consider a 5σ probability threshold"
for model acceptance. Most spectra that are symmetric
"can be well fit with a single Gaussian component, those"
"that are asymmetric can be described by two Gaussians,"
and three components are necessary for even more com-
plex shapes. Figure 2 gives some examples for the case
of PG 1126−041. We find that multiple Gaussians per-

form better than a high-order Gauss-Hermite function
(van der Marel & Franx 1993).
The least-squares minimization technique can be
highly sensitive to the given initial guesses. To mit-
"igate this issue, we refit the detected emission lines by"
considering a series of new initial guesses taken from the
best-fit parameters obtained from the neighboring pix-
els and from the pixel itself during the first step. The
neighbor pixels are defined as those within the binning
box used to extract the averaged spectrum. We select
"the final model that gives the lowest BIC. Note that the
fitting procedure can give rise to false positive detections"
from noisy peaks in the spectrum. We mask these noisy
pixels by applying a procedure that mimics the prun-
ing routine employed by the auto-multithresh task
"within tclean, by masking detected pixel groups that"
have projected sizes smaller than 0.6 times the beam
"Finally, we use Monte Carlo resampling to derive the"
model parameter uncertainties. We measure the average
spectrum noise level for each pixel and assume that the
noise follows a normal distribution. We then add the
simulated noise to the observed spectrum and fit the
line. We iterate 300 times to obtain a distribution for
"each parameter, and we estimate the 1σ uncertainties"
of the parameter from the 16th and 84th percentiles of
the distribution.
"The intensity, line-of-sight (LOS) velocity, and veloc-"
ity dispersion maps are shown in Figure 3. The latter
two maps are constructed by calculating the luminosity-
weighted moment one and two from the best-fit models
of the emission line in each pixel.
We perform a sanity check to determine how much
CO(2–1) emission is missed by our line shape fitting
procedure. We calculate the total velocity-integrated
line intensity (SCO(2−1)∆v) from the intensity maps
and we compare these to the values obtained by sum-
ming the flux densities from the channels above the 2σ
level for each target. We find that our emission-line fit-
"ting procedure recovers ∼ 97 % of SCO(2−1)∆v for the
two worst cases (PG 0050+124, PG 0923+129), while for"
"the best case (PG 1011−040) it estimates ∼ 7 % more
SCO(2−1)∆v value. These estimates indicate that our"
emission line procedure recovers most of the reliable
CO(2–1) emission recorded in the datacubes.
2.3. CO(2–1) Luminosity and Molecular Gas

We estimate the SCO(2−1)∆v values by summing all
the pixel values from the intensity maps. The luminos-

"olution of ∼ 1.4 kpc, the EDGE-CALIFA observations
are well-matched to our ALMA observational setup."
Bolatto et al. (2017) calculate molecular gas masses2
"assuming αCO = 4.36M� (K km s
−1 pc2)−1, similar to"
but somewhat higher than our preferred value of αCO =
"3.1M� (K km s
−1 pc2)−1. For consistency with our con-"
"vention, we scale the EDGE-CALIFA molecular gas"
"masses by a factor of ∼ 0.71. We only consider the
EDGE-CALIFA galaxies with measured CO sizes (69"
systems). We further discard five sources that are likely
to be AGN hosts based on the optical line intensity ratio
diagnostics of Baldwin et al. (1981) and Hα linewidth
analysis (Lacerda et al. 2020). These five AGN hosts
do not show any particular trend when compared to
the main EDGE-CALIFA sample and only one of these
"(MRK 79) is classified as type-I AGN (log λLλ(5100Å) ∼
43.16 erg s−1; Lu et al. 2019). Therefore, our compari-"
son sample corresponds to a total of 64 galaxies taken
from the EDGE-CALIFA survey.
Figure 4 compares the PG quasar host galaxies (the
six sources mapped by ALMA plus the larger sample
of sources with CO observations from Shangguan et al.
"2020a) with the EDGE-CALIFA galaxies, in terms of"
"their SFR, stellar mass (M?), molecular gas mass (MH2),"
"and molecular gas mass fraction [fH2 ≡ MH2/(M? +
MH2)]. To improve further the statistics of the in-"
"active galaxies, we also include the larger sample of"
nearby galaxies from xCOLD GASS (Saintonge et al.
"2017). As discussed in Shangguan et al. (2020b, see"
"also Xie et al. submitted), the PG quasars generally"
track the main sequence of star-forming galaxies as de-
"fined by Saintonge et al. (2016), with a non-negligible"
"fraction lying significantly above it, to the extent that"
they can be deemed starburst systems. The ALMA
"sample, by virtue of their selection, is biased toward"
"higher SFRs, MH2 , and fH2 compared to the overall PG"
sample with CO observations: all six objects lie on or
"above the main sequence, half of them formally exceed-"
ing the main sequence 1σ scatter of 0.4 dex. The EDGE-
CALIFA subsample overlaps well with the overall sam-
"ple of quasar hosts in terms of M?, SFR, MH2 , and"
"fH2 , but for the purposes of achieving a better match"
"with the ALMA-mapped quasars, we further distinguish"
the EDGE-CALIFA galaxies that lie above the main se-
quence (blue squares in Figure 4).

emission-line fluxes published in Shangguan et al. (2020a).
The dashed line show the unity ratio. The 1σ errorbars of
the data (without including flux calibration uncertainties)
are smaller than the symbol sizes. We find good agreement
between both estimates (∆[SCO(2−1)∆v] . 24 %), suggest-
ing that the concatenated data can recover well both the
compact and extended CO(2–1) emission."
3.1. Sensitivity of the Concatenated Data Compared to
the ACA Data
To verify whether our process of data concatenation
(12 m + ACA) properly recovers the CO line emission
"on extended scales, Figure 5 compares SCO(2−1)∆v mea-"
sured from our intensity maps with the ACA-only values
reported by Shangguan et al. (2020a). The two sets of
"measurements show good agreement, but there is a mild
tendency for the concatenated data to recover somewhat"
higher fluxes than the ACA data alone. Four of the six
"sources recover extra CO emission, ranging from ∼ 9%
to 24%, with an average of ∼ 12%. This can be at-
tributed to the higher sensitivity of the concatenated"
data compared to the ACA observations. For exam-
"ple, Figure 6 of Shangguan et al. (2020a) shows that"
the CO emission of PG 0923+129 is confined to the in-
"ner . 8′′ region of the galaxy, whereas our map (Fig-
ure 3) shows that the host galaxy exhibits CO spiral"
"arms that extend up to ∼ 14′′ (∼8.7 kpc) from its cen-
ter; the ACA observations miss the flux coming from"
these spiral arms. The flux of PG 2130+099 offers an-
other example. Whereas the integrated spectrum based
on ACA observations does not show an unambiguous
double-horned profile characteristic of unresolved galac-
"tic rotation (Figure 6 of Shangguan et al. 2020a), our"
concatenated data clearly do show disk-like rotation
"(Figure 3), again indicating that the ACA data miss"
flux from the outskirts of this galaxy. PG 1244+026 is
"practically indistinguishable (within ∼ 1%) between the
two data sets, perhaps to be expected considering its"
highly compact gas distribution. Only PG 0050+124
"(I Zw 1) stands with its ∼ 6% flux deficit in the con-
catenated data set, but this is insignificant compared to"
"the ∼ 5% − 10% uncertainty of the absolute flux scale
(Fomalont et al. 2014; Bonato et al. 2018). We con-"
clude that the concatenated data are sensitive enough
to trace most of the CO(2–1) line emission coming from
the central part of the host galaxies.
3.2. CO(2–1) Intensity Map Modeling
We model the two-dimensional intensity maps using a
"radial profile described by a Sérsic (1963) function,"
I(R) = Ie exp
")1/n
− 1"
"]}
, (2)"
where bn is a constant that sets Re as the effective (half-
"light) radius, Ie is the intensity measured at Re, and"
"n is the Sérsic index. An exponential function, which"
"often describes a cold disk, corresponds to n = 1. The"
two-dimensional model considers seven free parameters
"(Ie, n, Re, PApho, b/a minor-to-major axis ratio, [x0, y0]"
"on-sky center location, and background) and the Sérsic"
model is convolved with the synthesized beam to recover
unbiased estimates.
"To model the galaxy projection on the sky, we assume"
that the host galaxies follow an oblate spheroidal geom-
"etry (Hubble 1926), such that"
"cos2 i =
(b/a)2 − q20"
"1− q20
, (3)"
where q0 is the intrinsic thickness. We set q0 = 0.14
based on the mean value reported for edge-on galaxies
at nearly the same redshift range (z < 0.05; Mosenkov
et al. 2015; see Yu et al. 2020 for a more complicated
prescription).
We use the Python package emcee (Foreman-
"Mackey et al. 2013) to find the best-fit model. Briefly,"
emcee implements the affine invariant ensemble sam-
pler for the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method
to characterize the model probability density function.
This allows the algorithm to perform equally well un-
der affine transformations (including linear transforma-
"tions) between the model parameters, and therefore is"
less sensitive to the possible covariances among them
(see Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013 for more details). We
optimize the log-likelihood

The stellar component of the six quasar host galax-
ies are all observed by HST with high spatial res-

"ages of PG 0050+124, PG 0923+129, PG 1011−040, and
PG 1244+026 are taken from WFC3 camera in rest-"
"frame I-band (PI: L. C. Ho). Images of PG 1126−041
and PG 2130+099 are taken by NICMOS (H-band; PI:"
S. Veilleux) and WFPC2 (B-band; PI: S. R. Heap). We
collect them in Figure 3 as a reference for the CO emis-
sion. The molecular gas tends to be distributed within
the stellar component delineated by the HST images.
"In four sources (PG 0050+124, PG 0923+129,"
"PG 1126−041, PG 2130+099), CO emission is detected
as far out as ∼ 10 kpc from the center, although the
bulk of it is confined to a more compact, disk-like mor-"
phology. The CO morphology of PG 1244+026 is the
"most compact, with a total radial extension . 4 kpc
(Figure 6). PG 1011−040 exhibits a complex structure.
Appendix A gives comments on the morpho-kinematics"
"of each source.
Despite the observed variety of CO morphologies,"
the two-dimensional flux distributions are well fitted
"by Sérsic models with indexes in the range of n ≈
0.4−1.9. Subtracting the best-fitting global component
from each map reveals complex sub-structures in the"
"residual maps, ranging from clumps (PG 1126−041 and
PG 1011−040) to inner spiral arms (PG 0923+129 and
PG 1126−041). PG 0923+129 and PG 2130+099 further
show a central cavity surrounded by a ring-like struc-"
"ture. However, we caution that PG 0923+129 seems to"
present a central plateau in its CO surface brightness
"distribution, as can be seen from its radial profile (Fig-"
ure 6). It is possible that the apparent central depression
is produced by model over-subtraction.

"Figure 7. Radial variation of the kinemetry coefficient

line corresponds to 〈kv,5/kv,1〉 = 0.02 threshold that sep-
arates between “regular” and “non-regular” rotators (Kra-
jnović et al. 2008). The colored arrows indicate the host
galaxy radius at which kv,5/kv,1 is consistent with the thresh-
old value. We find that four host galaxies are classified as
regular rotators, while only one system, PG 1011−040, dis-
plays perturbed molecular gas kinematics."
We investigate whether the observed molecular gas ro-
tational motions resemble those expected from an ideal
disk by analyzing the two-dimensional LOS velocity
maps using the tilted-ring approach as implemented in
kinemetry (Krajnović et al. 2006)3. kinemetry quan-
tifies the deviations from disk-like kinematics for an ob-
served velocity field by parameterizing it as a function
of the radius (R) and the azimuthal angle (ψ). For an
"ideal disk, the velocity profile is only a function of the"
"galaxy radius, and the sky projection adds a variation"
in terms of azimuthal angle that follows a cosine law:
"v(R,ψ) = v(R) cos(ψ). To test this condition, kineme-"
try decomposes the LOS velocity into a series of tilted
"rings. Along each elliptical path, it parameterizes the"
velocity profile in terms of a Fourier series that only
depends on the azimuthal angle:
"vLOS(a, ψ) = A0(a)+"
"N∑
n=1"
"kv,n(a) cos[n(ψ−φn(a))], (5)"
"where kv,n and φn are the amplitude and phase coeffi-"
"cients, and a is the length of the kinematic major axis."
The kinematic position angle (PAkin) is accurately re-
"covered in tilted rings dominated by a single component,"
whereas in the ellipses between multiple components it
traces the position of maximum velocity amplitude. The
"case of an ideal disk is recovered when all the kv,n coef-"
"ficients are zero except kv,1. Hence, the high-order am-"
plitude coefficients quantify the kinematic deviations or

“asymmetries” observed in the velocity maps (see Kra-
jnović et al. 2006 for more details).
"kinemetry does not fit the kinematic center, and this"
parameter must be given in advance. We use the center
determined by the best-fit Sérsic model as input. We
also fix the axis ratio equal to the value given by our
"morphological modeling, as this parameter is not well-"
constrained by fitting the LOS velocity map alone. The
tilted ring thickness is set equal to half of the beam
"FWHM, and we skip the first tilted ring iteration in"
each map because the radius is smaller than the beam
FWHM. We restrict the analysis to the central zone of
"the galaxy, which, in any case, is our primary interest."
We find that kinemetry does not interpolate reliably
"the maps in the outer regions, where spiral arms may"
"be present (e.g., PG 0050+124), producing spurious re-"
sults such as inverted kinematic position angles at large
radii. This restriction also helps to avoiding outer zones
that may be under-sampled due to incomplete azimuthal
"coverage. For each tilted ring, we use the default 75%"
pixel sampling limit required by kinemetry to obtain
reliable estimates (Krajnović et al. 2006).
To consider the uncertainties associated with the kine-
"matic center and the LOS velocity map, we bootstrap"
these values within their 3σ error range and repeat the
"kinemetry procedure 100 times. Then, the 1σ uncer-"
"tainties of the kn,v amplitude coefficient are estimated"
from the corresponding distribution by calculating the
16th and 84th percentiles.
We quantify the non-regular motions by calculating
"the ratio k5,v/k1,v (e.g., Krajnović et al. 2008, 2011; van"
de Sande et al. 2017). The fifth-order amplitude co-
efficient is used because kinemetry adjusts the lower
order coefficients to find the best-fit tilted ring. Kra-
jnović et al. (2011) used an average threshold ratio
"of 〈k5,v/k1,v〉 = 0.04 to classify galaxies as “regular”
or “non-regular” rotators for the the ATLAS3D sur-"
"vey (Cappellari et al. 2011). However, this threshold"
depends on data quality measured by the typical un-
"certainty in k5,v/k1,v. For example, Krajnović et al."
"(2008) used a limit of 〈k5,v/k1,v〉 = 0.02 to determine if
a galaxy presents ‘disk-like rotation’ for the SAURON"
project (de Zeeuw et al. 2002). Based on the typi-
"cal uncertainty of k5,v/k1,v measured for our systems"
"(∼ 0.001), we adopt a threshold of 〈k5,v/k1,v〉 = 0.02 for
this study. We apply the kinemetry analysis for five"
"of the six PG quasars4. The radial median of kv,5/kv,1
spans 0.006 − 0.027 (Table 4), such that four would be
classified as regular rotators, with kv,5/kv,1 < 0.02 over"
"almost all radii, with no clear trend toward the inner"
"or outer regions. PG 0050+124 and PG 1126−041 have
local values of kv,5/kv,1 ≈ 0.02 (as indicated by the ar-
rows in Figure 7), but they are localized galaxy sub-"
structures observed in the intensity residual maps. Only
"PG 1011−040 shows kv,5/kv,1 > 0.02 at R & 2.5 kpc,
qualifying it as perturbed."
The top panel of Figure 8 shows the variation of the
kinematic position angle (PAkin) with respect to the
median value (P̃Akin) and as a function of radius for
the host galaxies. We find that PAkin varies smoothly
"with radius in each source, with a maximum difference"
"of ∆PAkin ≈ 30◦ for PG 1011−040. Three of the five
systems (PG 0050+124, PG 1011−040, PG 1126−041)
present a “kinematic twist”, that is, ∆PAkin > 10"
cording to the criteria of Krajnović et al. (2008). For
"each galaxy, we assume that the direction of the kine-"
"matic major axis is given by P̃Akin (Table 4). The P̃Akin
values differ on average by ∼ 30◦ from the PApho val-
ues determined by the Sérsic models. PG 0050+124"
shows the higher difference between both estimates
"(P̃Akin − PApho ∼ 71◦), whereas PG 1126−041 presents
the smaller difference (P̃Akin − PApho ∼ 4◦). Similar
differences are found when we compare P̃Akin with the"
stellar photometric position angles measured from the
HST images (Veilleux et al. 2009; Zhao et al. in prep.).
"In this case, we find differences in the range of 0− 132◦,
with an average difference of ∼ 25◦."
To understand the difference between P̃Akin and
"PApho values, we also analyze the PG quasars CO(2–1)"
"intensity maps using kinemetry. In this case, kineme-"
"try performs a simple ellipse fitting method. We apply
the same restrictions that we assumed for the LOS ve-"
locity map analyzes. In the bottom panel of Figure 8
we show the difference of the position angles derived
from the intensity maps (PAint) with respect to P̃Akin.
"We measure larger radial variations of PAint (∆PAint ≈
130◦) when compared to PAkin (∆PAkin ≈ 30◦), high-
lighting the effect of molecular gas sub-structure on"

a static bar potential can produce the same kinematic
"signature of a radial flow (see Wong et al. 2004, for more"
details). We obtain the s1 and s3 radial profiles directly
"from kinemetry for the host galaxies. The s1 and s3
coefficients absolute values are within . 7 km s−1, with
no clear evidence of gas elliptical streaming or axisym-"
metric radial flows in any host galaxy. It is worth to
mention that results obtained from the harmonic de-
composition analyses of the velocity fields must not be
considered as conclusive. Kinematic features produced
by non-axysimmetric sub-structures in disk galaxies lim-
itate further interpretation (Wong et al. 2004). More-
"over, radial flows signatures suggested by gravitational"
torque modeling do not necessarily coincide with the
expectation from the purely kinematic decomposition
analysis (Haan et al. 2009). Any interpretation of the
observed kinematics requires a detailed knowledge of the
galaxy potential (e.g. Alonso-Herrero et al. 2018).
3.4. Regular Motions and Velocity Dispersion
Rotational patterns can be seen in the LOS velocity
"maps, while velocity dispersion rises toward the center"
"(Figure 3). To further study the kinematics, we extract"
velocity radial profiles along the kinematic major axis
to avoid any effect produced by the disk azimuthal pro-
"jection. These velocity radial profiles, available for five"
"of the six sources (Figure 9), are derived in the same"
"manner as the intensity radial profiles, but we simu-"
late a slit aligned with the kinematic major axis instead
of the photometric major axis. We can measure rota-
"tion curves to & 8 kpc in all cases, and the flat part of
the rotation curve is reached for at least PG 0923+129,"
"PG 1126−041, and PG 2130+099.
We calculate the local projected velocity gradients"
from the rotation curves. Prior to estimating represen-
"tative rotation velocities for each system, it is first nec-"
"essary to avoid the central region of the galaxy, where"
the LOS velocities are biased toward lower values due to
"beam-smearing. From an observational point of view,"
beam-smearing effects are minimized in regions where
the local projected velocity gradient is smaller than the
"spectral resolution. Under these conditions, the line"
centroids are located at nearly the same spectral chan-
"nel, and the rotation velocities can be recovered directly"
"from the data. Thus, we mask the data from the nu-"
cleus to the radius where the local velocity gradient de-
creases below the spectral resolution limit of 11 km s−1;
the masked region is denoted by the shaded blue area in
Figure 9. Representative values of the rotation velocity
(vrot; Table 4) are estimated by the mean value of the
"unmasked data points on the rotation curve, and the 1σ"
uncertainty is estimated from their standard deviation.

We correct these values for inclination projection. An
analogous treatment is applied to the velocity disper-
"sion (σv), using the same mask applied to the rotation"
velocity curve so as to avoid the central pixels affected
"by beam-smearing (e.g., Davies et al. 2011; Wisnioski"
et al. 2015; Stott et al. 2016).
We find vrot/σv = 9–42 for the five analyzed host
"galaxies, indicating that the gas kinematics are dom-"
inated by rotation. This is consistent with the range
measured for the EDGE-CALIFA galaxies (vrot/σv =
"10–28; Levy et al. 2018). However, different from the"
"EDGE-CALIFA systems, σv varies considerably from"
"object to object. For example, the average dispersion"
"of PG 0050+124 (σv = 36± 27 km s−1) is 6 times higher
than that of PG 0923+129 (σv = 6± 4 km s−1). The av-
erage σv values reported for the EDGE-CALIFA galax-
ies are in the range of ∼ 9 − 19 km s−1 (Levy et al.
2018). The average value of PG 0923+129 is consistent"
with the estimate traditionally adopted for nearby star-
"forming galaxies (∼ 6 km s−1; Leroy et al. 2008). On
the other hand, PG 0050+124 presents an average σv
value larger than any of those reported for the EDGE-"
CALIFA systems. These values are calculated over por-
tions of the dispersion velocity profile that should be
"immune from beam-smearing, and thus these may re-"
flect different physical properties of each host galaxy or
degree of AGN activity. Detailed study of the molecu-
lar gas velocity dispersion will be addressed in a future

one missing key information is the spatial distribution of
"the molecular gas, which now can be investigated with"
our new observations.
Figure 10 shows the molecular gas content of the PG
quasars plotted as a function of the half-light radius
(R1/2) measured from the intensity maps by implement-
ing a tilted ring approach using the best-fit Sérsic model
parameters. We use R1/2 instead of Re for consistency
with the methodology employed by Bolatto et al. (2017)
"for the EDGE-CALIFA galaxies, which serve as a di-"
rect comparison.5 The blue squares in Figure 10 high-
light the subset of EDGE-CALIFA galaxies that better
matches the quasars in terms of their global physical
properties (Figure 4).
"5 The R1/2 estimates agree with the Re values for the six host
galaxies (Appendix B)."
The six quasar hosts tend to have compact molecu-
"lar gas distributions: R1/2 = 0.9 − 3.7 kpc, with a me-
dian value of 1.8 kpc. Defining the molecular gas sur-"

−2 (see dashed curves
in Figure 10). The PG quasars tend to be located at
"the high-ΣH2 , small-R1/2 region of the CO mass-size"
plane compared to the EDGE-CALIFA galaxies. We
"note, however, that a minority of inactive galaxies also"
"have comparable ΣH2 and R1/2, and compact molecu-"
lar gas distribution is not a property unique to AGNs.6
We further distinguish between the galaxies that belong
to a multiple system (filled orange symbols). This is
based on the visual detection of any system (indepen-
dent of its size or brightness) within the HST image
field-of-view for the PG sources (Figure 3) and litera-
ture morphological classifications of the EDGE-CALIFA

to draw any meaningful conclusions in this regard.
Our statements on ΣH2 obviously depend on the
choice of αCO. This is especially worrisome if αCO drops
in environments of high surface density (Bolatto et al.
"2013). Shangguan et al. (2020a), in comparing CO"
observations of the PG quasars with independent gas

the line flux distribution on each side of v50. Note that,"

"with Pearson’s coefficient r = −0.2 to −0.8 and very low
null-hypothesis probability (p < 0.01). This strongly"
suggests that the emission-line asymmetry is related to
projected rotational motions from beam-smearing. The
observed line shape corresponds to the flux-weighted
convolution of many intrinsically narrow emission lines
that emanate from a projected beam-sized area on the

"rotation. However, due to the surface brightness dis-"
"tribution of the line-emitting gas, the brighter lines lie"
near the spectral channel that is representative of the
"galaxy systemic velocity (i.e., the one that is located"

and this asymmetry is correlated inversely with the pro-
jected rotation velocity of the galaxy (see Appendix C
for an example).

Although our sample is admittedly small and possibly

galaxies of nearby AGNs luminous enough to qualify
as quasars. Earlier studies have already established
"that, as a group, the optically/UV-selected low-redshift"
(z < 0.5) PG quasars are characteristically gas-rich
"(Shangguan et al. 2018, 2020a) galaxies forming stars"
with an efficiency equal to or even exceeding that of
star-forming galaxies on the main sequence (Shangguan
et al. 2020b; Xie et al. submitted). What is respon-
sible for the apparent coeval episodes of vigorous BH
accretion and star formation activity? The external en-
vironment provides no obvious clue. While the stellar
morphologies of some host galaxies suggest that they
have experienced tidal interactions or recent merger ac-
"tivity, not all hosts with enhanced star formation show"
evidence of dynamical perturbations (Shangguan et al.
2020b; Xie et al. submitted). The current ALMA sam-
ple exemplifies the problem well. Of the three quasars
that clearly lie above the 1σ scatter of the star-forming
"galaxy main sequence (see top panel of Figure 4), only"
PG 0050+124 (I Zw 1) is known to belong to a multiple
system (Lim & Ho 1999; Scharwächter et al. 2003). The
"morphologies of PG 1126−041 and PG 2130+099 resem-
ble those of regular systems. Their CO surface bright-"
ness distribution closely follow an exponential disk dis-
tribution as the best-fit Sérsic indexes suggest. Their
velocity fields (third column of Figure 3) show little evi-
"dence of perturbation (Figure 7), further confirming the"
regular disk-like kinematics.
The present high-resolution ALMA observations fur-
nish some potentially useful insights. First and fore-
"most, we find that most of the gas resides in a com-"
"pact, central disky (rotationally dominated) structure"
"with half-light radii ∼1.8 kpc. Molecular disks of such
small dimensions can be found among some star-forming"
galaxies in the EDGE-CALIFA survey—particularly
those belonging to multiple systems (Bolatto et al.
2017)—but they are not common. The compactness of
"the disks, of course, naturally lead to large molecular"
"gas surface densities, and presumably to elevated star"
formation activity. Such conditions are reminiscent of
the conditions found in luminous and ultraluminous in-
"frared galaxies (CO emission extension ∼ 0.3 − 3 kpc,
ΣH2 & 300M� pc"
−2; Downes & Solomon 1998; Iono
"et al. 2009; Wilson et al. 2019), as well as in the hosts"
galaxies of infrared-bright quasars (CO emission exten-
"sion ∼ 1 − 7 kpc, Tan et al. 2019). What is unusual is
that our PG quasars were not infrared-selected nor do"
our selection criteria strongly biases our sample in terms
"of LIR values (or SFRs, Figure 4), and none is experi-"
encing a major merger event or strong tidal interactions.
Apart from the compact dimensions and high molec-
"ular gas mass surface densities, another intriguing prop-"
erty of the sample is the apparent misalignment between
"the global kinematic and photometric axes of the gas,"
"which appears to be significant in four out of five sources,"
as well as the detection of significant smooth variation
of the kinematic position angle with radius (kinematic
"twisting, Krajnović et al. 2008) in three of the sources"
(see also Ramakrishnan et al. 2019). Given the lack of
obvious signs of recent merging events or tidal interac-
"tions, the origin of these kinematic features is unclear."
How common are these signatures? Do they play a role
in fueling the nucleus? Much better statistics are re-
"quired, as well as observations of more luminous AGNs"
and more massive BHs to extend the relevant parameter
"range, to ultimately test against numerical simulations"
"(e.g., Weinberger et al. 2017; Terrazas et al. 2020). Com-"
parison with a proper control sample of inactive galaxies
is also essential.
5. CONCLUSIONS
We present new Cycle 6 ALMA observations trac-
"ing the CO(2–1) emission line from six nearby (z .
0.06) Palomar-Green quasars selected from our previ-"
"ous Cycle 5 ACA program (Shangguan et al. 2020a,b)."
The host galaxies have normal molecular gas content
"(MH2 ≈ 108.9 − 1010.2M�) for their stellar masses
(M? ≈ 1010.2−1011.1M�) and star formation rates (SFR
≈ 2 − 26M� yr−1). The ALMA observations were de-
signed to resolve the molecular gas in the host galax-"
"ies on scales of . 1 kpc (beam FWHM ≈ 0.′′4 − 1.′′4).
We concatenate the ALMA data with the previous ACA"
data to minimize missing flux from extended emission.
Our main results are as follows:
"• The quasar host galaxies tend to have disk-like
(Sérsic index n = 0.87), exceptionally compact"
(median half-light radius 1.8 kpc) molecular gas
"distributions compared to inactive, star-forming"
"galaxies of similar stellar mass, star formation"
"rate, and molecular gas content, although some"
star-forming galaxies can also have similarly cen-
trally concentrated molecular gas distributions.
"• The velocity field of the molecular gas in five of
the quasar hosts is dominated by regular rotation,"
"with vrot/σv & 9, and σv = 6 − 36 km s−1. The
remaining system (PG 1244+026) is too compact"
to be analyzed with confidence. Four host galaxies
"exhibit a flat rotation curve out to radii & 8 −
10 kpc from the nucleus; however, one of these"
"systems (PG 1011−040) has perturbed molecular
gas kinematics."
"• Among the five objects amenable to tilted-ring
analysis, the kinematic position angle deviates"
"18 Molina, J. et al."
"from the photometric angle on average by ∼ 30◦.
Three sources show evidence of a significant kine-"
matic twist.
"• The pixelwise spectra show a diversity of line
shapes, from symmetric to asymmetric and more"
complex profiles. We argue that asymmetric pro-
files predominantly arise from beam-smearing ef-
"fects, while complex lines are predominantly as-"
sociated with gas sub-structures in the central re-
gions of the galaxies.

APPENDIX
A. NOTES FOR INDIVIDUAL HOST GALAXIES
PG0050+124: The CO(2–1) observation shows
a compact central distribution along with two
extended molecular gas outer spiral arm struc-
tures that match the morphology in the restframe
I-band HST/WFC3 image. The LOS velocity
map clearly shows a disk-like rotational pattern
with projected peak-to-peak rotational velocity
"vrot sin i ≈ 440 km s−1. The detection of the outer
spiral structures allow us to trace the rotation ve-"
"locities at R & 8 kpc. At this radius, the rota-
tion curve shows lower values than in the inner"
zone. The velocity dispersion increases sharply at
"R ≈ 0.8 and 2.8 kpc. We were unable to detect any
CO(2–1) line emission coming from the companion"
systems.
PG0923+129: The CO(2–1) line emission is
distributed along a central disk-like zone from
which two molecular gas spiral arms extend to-
ward the outskirts of the HST broad-band im-
age surface brightness distribution. We detect an
inner ring-like structure. The host galaxy dis-
"plays a rotational pattern, and we observe a ve-"
locity profile that extends up to the flat part of
the rotation curve with projected peak-to-peak
"vrot sin i ≈ 330 km s−1. The velocity dispersions
increase mainly smoothly toward the galactic cen-"
"ter, and a sharp increase is seen at R ≈ 2.5 kpc."
"PG1011−040: The complex CO(2–1) morphol-
ogy can be roughly separated into a central bulge-"
"like component surrounded by a ring-like, clumpy"
structure. The LOS velocity map shows complex
dynamics with a smooth variation of the veloc-
ity field across the field-of-view. This suggests
that the two main structures are spatially con-
nected. Comparison with the restframe I-band
HST/WFC3 image reveals a possible spatial corre-
Molecular Gas in Quasar Hosts 19
lation between the molecular gas distribution and
"the stellar bar structure, suggesting molecular gas"
inflow toward the central zone due to gravitational
torques.
"PG1126−041: A clear disk-like morphology and
rotational pattern can be seen. The central CO(2–"
1) emission seems to be distributed in a bar-like
structure. The system also shows clumpy mor-
phology. The intensity map is spatially correlated
"with the HST/NICMOS image, suggesting that"
the stellar and molecular gas components follow
similar distribution. The CO emission traces the
"flat part of the rotation curve, from which we mea-"
sure a projected peak-to-peak rotational velocity
"of vrot sin i ≈ 390 km s−1. The velocity disper-
sion increases smoothly toward the galactic center,"
reaching ∼ 160 km s−1.
PG1244+026: The CO(2–1) observation shows
a compact molecular gas distribution with iso-
velocity contours that depart somewhat from pure
rotation. The velocity dispersion map shows very
"high values across most of the disk, suggesting"
strong beam smearing due to the compactness of
the gas distribution.
PG2130+099: The regular gas distribution
shows an outer spiral-like structure that matches
the morphology seen in the HST/WFC3 broad-
band image. Disk-like rotation can be seen from
"the LOS velocity map, which is sufficiently ex-"
tended to allow the detection of the flat part of the
rotation curve. We measure a projected peak-to-
"peak rotational velocity of vrot sin i ≈ 470 km s−1
from the galaxy outskirts. The outer sub-structure"
"seen at R & 10 kpc presents systematically lower
velocity dispersion compared to the central, more"
disky region.
B. COMPARISON OF RADIAL SIZES
Figure 14 compares the half-light radius obtained from
"the best-fit Sérsic model (i.e, the “effective radius” Re)"
and the estimates obtained using the tilted-ring ap-
proach (R1/2) following Bolatto et al. (2017). We find a
good agreement between both measurements for the six
host galaxies. This suggests that the main CO(2–1) line
emission components closely resemble those expected
from the ideal axisymmetric two-dimensional Sérsic pro-
files.

C. BEAM SMEARING EFFECT ON THE
OBSERVED EMISSION LINE SHAPES
We simulate a galaxy observation datacube to exem-
plify the effect of beam-smearing on the observed emis-
sion line shapes. The simulated galaxy has an expo-
nential surface density profile with no dark mater halo
contribution. The half-light radius is set to 1.5 kpc fol-
lowing our estimates reported in Table 3 for the host
galaxies. We assume intrinsic Gaussian emission line
shapes with line widths equal to 20 km s−1 (Table 4)
"for simplicity. For sky-projection effects, we consider a"
"redshift of 0.06, b/a = 0.6 and galaxy major axis di-"
rection parallel to the datacube x-axis. Following our
"observational setup, we construct the datacube by set-"
ting the channel resolution equal to 11 km s−1 and the
pixel size to 0.′′2 (Section 2). We set an elliptical beam
"with FWHMx×FWHMy = 1′′ × 0.′′1. We choose this
beam setup to simulate the beam-smearing effect only"
along the galaxy major axis direction and to improve the
visualization of the intrinsic emission lines contribution
to the resultant asymmetric emission line shape.
Figure 15 shows our simulated galaxy observation and
the emission line shape extracted from the green-colored
pixel. The luminosity-weighted convolution produces
the emission line asymmetry as the relative contribu-
tion of the brighter neighbor pixels (representative of
the systemic velocity) is greater than that of the fainter
ones. The convolved emission line tail is observed at
"20 Molina, J. et al."
