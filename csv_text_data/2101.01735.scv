"ABSTRACT
The detection of the binary events GW170817 and GW190814 has provided invaluable constraints on the"
"maximum mass of nonrotating configurations of neutron stars, 𝑀TOV . However, the large differences in the
neutron-star masses measured in GW170817 and GW190814 has also lead to a significant tension between
the predictions for such maximum masses, with GW170817 suggesting that 𝑀TOV . 2.3 𝑀�, and GW190814
requiring 𝑀TOV & 2.5 𝑀� if the secondary was a (non- or slowly rotating) neutron star at merger. Using a genetic
algorithm, we sample the multidimensional space of parameters spanned by gravitational-wave and astronomical
observations associated with GW170817. Consistent with previous estimates, we find that all of the physical
quantities are in agreement with the observations if the maximum mass is in the range 𝑀TOV = 2.210"

−0.123 𝑀�"
"within a 2-𝜎 confidence level. By contrast, maximum masses with 𝑀TOV & 2.5 𝑀�, not only require efficiencies
in the gravitational-wave emission that are well above the numerical-relativity estimates, but they also lead to
a significant under-production of the ejected mass. Hence, the tension can be released by assuming that the
secondary in GW190814 was a black hole at merger, although it could have been a rotating neutron star before."

"1. INTRODUCTION
The recent detection of the gravitational-wave (GW) event"
"GW190814 has seen involved the merger of black hole (BH),
with a mass of 22.2− 24.3 𝑀�, with a compact object having
a much smaller mass of 2.50−2.67 𝑀� (The LIGO Scientific
Collaboration et al. 2020). The unclear nature of the sec-
ondary component has raised questions about the astrophys-
ical evolutionary paths that would yield objects with these
masses in a binary system. When assigning a NS nature to
the secondary in GW190814, two scenarios are possible. In
the first one, the secondary was a nonrotating or slowly ro-
tating NS at merger, so that GW190814 should effectively be
considered a BH-NS merger (see, e.g., Zevin et al. 2020; Sa-
farzadeh et al. 2020; Kinugawa et al. 2020; Liu & Lai 2020;
Lu et al. 2020; Ertl et al. 2020, for some possible formation
scenarios). In this case, the maximum mass 𝑀TOV of nonrotat-
ing NSs needs to reach values as large as & 2.5 𝑀� (Fattoyev
et al. 2020; Sedrakian et al. 2020; Tan et al. 2020; Tsokaros
et al. 2020; Godzieba et al. 2020; Biswas et al. 2020). In the
second scenario, the need for a large maximum mass can be
replaced by the presence of rapid rotation. In fact, it has been"
"shown that uniformly rotating NS can support about 20%
more mass than nonspinning ones (Breu & Rezzolla 2016;
Shao et al. 2020). Note that in the case of NSs with a phase
transition, universal relations are still present, but depend on
the properties of the phase transition (Bozzola et al. 2019;
Demircik et al. 2020)."
"Based on these universal relations, Most et al. (2020b) and
Zhang & Li (2020) have pointed out that a massive (rapidly)
rotating NS with a mass > 2.5 𝑀� is perfectly consistent
with a maximum mass 𝑀TOV ' 2.3 𝑀� inferred from the
GW170817 event (see, e.g., Rezzolla et al. 2018; Shibata
et al. 2019). Given the difficulty of sustaining rapid rotation
over the very long timescales associated with the inspiral of
the binary, the secondary must have collapsed at one point
before merger, so that in this second scenario GW190814
should effectively be considered a BH-BH merger."
"While a priori both scenarios are plausible, shedding light
on which of them is the most likely is important from several
points of view. To this scope, we here exploit the rich vari-
ety of GW and electromagnetic observables that have been
obtained with GW170817 to explore the two scenarios com-"

"bining the constraints set from the GW and electromagnetic
signal from GW170817. In particular, we employ a genetic
algorithm to sample through the distributions of maximum
masses, ejected matter (Drout et al. 2017; Cowperthwaite
et al. 2017; Kasen et al. 2017; Villar et al. 2017; Cough-
lin et al. 2018), and GW emission from numerical-relativity
(NR) simulations (Zappa et al. 2018). Consistent with pre-
vious results (Rezzolla et al. 2018; Shibata et al. 2019) we
find that GW170817’s observations clearly set an upper limit
for the maximum mass of 𝑀TOV . 2.33 𝑀�. When forcing
the algorithm to allow for maximum masses 𝑀TOV & 2.4 𝑀�,
we find that this requires unrealistically large GW efficiencies
from the merger remnant and a deficit in the ejected matter."
"2. FRAMEWORK FOR THE GENETIC ALGORITHM
The observations of a bright blue kilonova has provided"
"convincing evidence that the merger remnant in GW170817
could not have collapsed promptly to a BH. Rather, it must
have survived for a timescale of the order of one second (Gill
et al. 2019; Lazzati et al. 2020; Hamidani et al. 2020), and suf-
ficiently large so that the hypermassive NS (HMNS) produced
by the merger has reached uniform rotation at least in its core
(Margalit & Metzger 2017; Rezzolla et al. 2018). Following
Rezzolla et al. (2018), we recall that quasi-universal relations
exist between the masses of uniformly rotating stellar models
along the stability line to BH formation and the correspond-
ing dimensionless angular momentum 𝑗coll normalised to the
maximum (Keplerian) one 𝑗Kep (Breu & Rezzolla 2016). We
here express this relation as"
"𝜒( 𝑗coll/ 𝑗Kep) :=
𝑀crit
𝑀TOV"
"= 1 + 𝛼2
(
𝑗coll
𝑗Kep"
")2
+ 𝛼4"
"(
𝑗coll
𝑗Kep"
")4
, (1)"
"where 𝛼2 = 1.316×10−1 and 𝛼4 = 7.111×10−2, and the value
of the Keplerian specific angular momentum is approximately
given by 𝑗Kep ∼ 0.68 (see Eq. (4) in Most et al. 2020b, for
more accurate estimates). The function 𝜒 is defined between
0 and 1 and describes all models with a mass that is critical
for collapse to a BH. To fix ideas, in the case of nonorotating
models, 𝑗coll = 0 and 𝜒(0) = 1, while for maximally rotating
models 𝑗coll = 𝑗Kep and (Breu & Rezzolla 2016) 𝜒(1) :=
𝑀max/𝑀TOV ≈ 1.20+0.02−0.05, where 𝑀max is the maximum mass
that can be sustained through uniform rotation (see Weih et al.
2018, for differentially rotating stars). Note that range 𝜒(1) is
based on a specific set of hadronic equations of state (EOSs)
and that a different estimate suggests 𝜒(1) = 1.17+0.02−0.05 (Shao
et al. 2020)."
"Because Eq. (1) expresses a relation between gravitational
masses, while the electromagnetic emission from GW170817
informs us about the ejected baryonic mass, we need a relation
between gravitational and baryonic mass 𝑀𝑏 for uniformly
rotating NSs at the mass-shedding limit (see, e.g., Timmes
et al. 1996; Gao et al. 2020, for a detailed discussion). Also in"
"this case, this relation obeys a quasi-universal relation near the
values of the maximum mass that, with a 2-𝜎 uncertainty, is
given by [ := 𝑀𝑏,max/𝑀max ≈ 1.171±0.014 at the maximum-
mass limit (Rezzolla et al. 2018). Note that [ is in principle
a function of 𝑀 and that the value reported above is for 𝑀 =
𝑀max. However, [ is almost constant in the neighbourhood
of 𝑀max – where all of our considerations are made – so that
hereafter we simply write the conversion between the two
masses as 𝑀𝑏 = [𝑀 ."
"The total gravitational mass of GW170817 as inferred from
the GW signal is 𝑀𝑔 = 2.73+0.04−0.01 (The LIGO Scientific Col-
laboration et al. 2019), whose corresponding baryonic mass
𝑀𝑏 soon after the merger can be thought of as being given by
the combination of the baryonic mass in the HMNS 𝑀𝑏,HMNS
– itself composed of the mass in the core and in a Keplerian
disk – and of the mass ejected dynamically, i.e.,"

but also with in the electron fraction 𝑌𝑒, which is again larger
in the blue component (0.2 . 𝑌𝑒 . 0.3 for the blue part and
𝑌𝑒 . 0.2 for the red part). Numerical simulations of remnant
disks indicate that most of the red ejecta originate from the
disk, whereas most of the blue ejecta will come from the hot
surface of the HMNS. Hence, for simplicity we will assume
that the blue ejecta originate from the HMNS only, while the"

can be estimated based on numerical simulations (Siegel
& Metzger 2017; Fernández et al. 2019; Fujibayashi et al.

GW170817, where the remnant may have lived for about one
second (Gill et al. 2019), BH formation is triggered when the
gravitational mass is reduced by the emission of GWs and the

"post

"introduce an additional constraint between 𝑗coll – which we
derive from Eq. (1) – and 𝑀postGW ."
"Two more remarks before concluding the presentation of
our methodology. First, not all of the merger remnant’s an-
gular momentum will end up in the collapsed object. A
number of physical processes will move part of the angu-
lar momentum outwards, placing it on stable orbits relative
to the newly formed BH. Because the efficiency of this pro-
cess depends on microphysics that is poorly understood, we
account for this by introducing a fudge factor 𝑓𝐵 defined as
𝑗coll =: (1− 𝑓𝐵) 𝑗rem,20, so that the specific angular momentum
of the disk is 𝑗disk := 𝑓𝐵 𝑗rem,20. Second, since in Eqs. (7), (8)
and (9) the function 𝜒 always appears together with 𝑀TOV , it
is difficult to set reasonable ranges for 𝜒. However, numerical
simulations have revealed that the dimensionless spin of the
BH produced by the merger 𝑗BH (and hence 𝑗coll . 𝑗BH ) is actu-
ally constrained in a rather limited range, i.e., 0.7 . 𝑗BH . 0.9
(Kastaun et al. 2013; Bernuzzi et al. 2014). Exploiting this
information, and assuming conservatively that 80% of the spe-
cific angular momentum at collapse is inherited by the BH,
i.e., 𝑗coll = 0.8 𝑗BH , we can effectively constrain 𝜒 to be in
the range 1.11 ≤ 𝜒 . 1.22. Very similar results are obtained
when making the more drastic assumption that only half of
the BH spin comes from the remnant, i.e., 𝑗coll = 0.5 𝑗BH ,
which further reduces the lower limit to be 𝜒 = 1.05 (see
Supplement Material for details)."
"In summary, we need to solve a multidimensional para-
metric problem as expressed by Eqs. (7), (8) and (9) after
varying in the appropriate ranges the (ten) free parameters in
the system: 𝜒, b, [, 𝑀 inspGW , 𝑀"
"blue
ej , 𝑀"
"dyn
ej , 𝑀TOV , a, 𝑓disk and 𝑓𝐵."
"While we treat all these parameters equally, some of them
([, 𝑀dynej , a), vary in very narrow ranges and their variations
do not significantly affect the overall results. In practice, at
any iteration of the genetic algorithm we ensure that: (i) the
total gravitational mass of the system is 𝑀𝑔 = 2.73+0.04−0.01 (The
LIGO Scientific Collaboration & The Virgo Collaboration
2017; The LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al. 2019); (ii)
the total ejected mass is 𝑀 totej = 0.0537 ± 0.013 𝑀� (Arcavi

larger upper bound on the blue ejecta, i.e., 𝑀blueej /𝑀� < 0.05,
finding no significant difference; see Supplemental Mate-
rial; (v) the maximum mass is taken to be in the range

−0.123 𝑀�, where the errors reported here are"
"for 2-𝜎 uncertainty. Overall, this yields a lower bound of
𝑀TOV > 2.087 𝑀� and an upper bound of 𝑀TOV < 2.326 𝑀�
at 2-𝜎 level (vertical dashed lines), and thus in good agree-
ment with massive-pulsar measurements (Antoniadis et al.
2013; Cromartie et al. 2020) and previous estimates (Rez-
zolla et al. 2018; Shibata et al. 2019). Interestingly, our
results are in good agreement with the conclusions reached
by Shao et al. (2020) and Fan et al. (2020), who have also
considered the post-merger GW emission to deduce bounds
on the maximum mass."
"As a consistency check, we can use set of parameters that
yield the maximum-mass distribution in Fig. 1, to estimate the
GW energy lost both in the inspiral and in the post-merger.
This is shown in the left panel of Fig. 2, where we re-
port the posterior distributions for 𝑀 inspGW (black dotted line)
and 𝑀postGW (black dashed line), as well as their sum, 𝑀"

"shaded is the upper limit estimated by Zappa et al. (2018),
𝐸 totGW/𝑀𝑔 ≤ 0.045 𝑀�𝑐"
"2, on the basis of a large number
of NR simulations, with an associated uncertainty of 20%.
A similar consistency is found in the right panel of Fig. 2,
where we report the posterior of the total ejected mass consis-
tent with the maximum-mass distribution in Fig. 1. Indicated
with a green-shaded area are the constraints obtained from
the kilonova observations of GW170817. More specifically,
the width of the shaded area represents the standard deviation
using various estimates for the total ejected mass 𝑀 totej esti-
mated for GW170817 (Arcavi et al. 2017; Nicholl et al. 2017;
Chornock et al. 2017; Cowperthwaite et al. 2017; Villar et al.
2017; Drout et al. 2017; Kasen et al. 2017; Tanaka et al. 2017;
Waxman et al. 2018; Coughlin et al. 2018). Clearly, also the
ejected-mass distribution is in perfect agreement with obser-
vational bounds when the maximum mass is below 2.326 𝑀�."
"Given these results, it is natural to ask: does anything break
down when larger maximum masses are considered? The
positive answer to this question is contained in Fig. 3, whose
panels are similar to those in Fig. 2, when however the genetic
algorithm is forced to consider two specific values of the
maximum mass, namely, 𝑀TOV = 2.4 𝑀� and 𝑀TOV = 2.5 𝑀�.
Concentrating first on the left panel of Fig. 3, it is clear
that when allowing for large maximum masses, the mass
radiated in GWs after the merger, 𝑀postGW (red dashed line), is
significantly larger than what NR simulations predict; this is
true both for 𝑀TOV = 2.4 𝑀� and for 𝑀TOV = 2.5 𝑀�. This
behaviour is due to the fact that remnants with a given 𝜒 will
radiate more GWs if they are more massive [cf., Eq. (9)].
Next, when considering the right panel of Fig. 3 it is also
easy to realize that large maximum masses lead to a deficit
in the ejected matter. This is simply due to the fact that
considering large-mass stars inevitably reduces the portion of
the budget available for the ejecta. We have confirmed that,
even if (unrealistically) large additional angular momentum
transport was assumed, these results remain unchanged for
𝑀TOV & 2.5 𝑀�, (see Supplemental Material)."
"In summary, while a value 𝑀TOV . 2.3 𝑀� is fully con-
sistent with the GW emission from NR simulations and the
observed ejected mass, a value 𝑀TOV & 2.5 𝑀� requires effi-
ciencies in the GW emission that are well above the estimates
from a large number of accurate NR simulations and, overall,
leads to an under-production of ejected mass."
"4. CONCLUSIONS
We have carried out a systematic investigation to ascer-"
"tain whether the tension on the maximum mass following
the detections of GW170817 and GW190814 can in some
way be resolved or at least attenuated. In particular, we have
employed a genetic algorithm to sample through the multidi-
mensional space of parameters that can be built on the basis of
the astronomical observations (i.e., ejected mass in the vari-"

𝑀TOV = 2.210"
"+0.117
−0.123 𝑀� within a 2-𝜎 confidence level. In"
"this range, all of the physical quantities are in very good
agreement with the estimates coming from the observations.
By contrast, we find that considering maximum masses with
𝑀TOV & 2.4 − 2.5 𝑀� requires efficiencies in the GW emis-
sion well above the NR estimates and leads to a significant
under-production of the ejected mass, well below the values
expected from the observations. Although robust, our results"
"can be strengthened in a number of ways. Improved post-
merger modeling and long-term NR simulations (Fujibayashi
et al. 2018) can help to narrow the uncertainties in the pa-
rameter ranges for 𝜒 and 𝑗rem. Refined universal relations
of uniformly rotating NSs including temperature dependence
(Koliogiannis & Moustakidis 2020), will also help narrowing
down the errors in [ and the upper limit of 𝜒. Such im-
provements will be crucial to understand the viability of the
maximum-mass constraint for 𝑀TOV . 2.3 𝑀�."
"In light of these considerations, we conclude that the sec-
ondary in GW190814 was most likely a BH at merger, al-
though it may well have been a rotating NS at some stage
during the evolution of the binary system."

"SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
In what follows we provide additional information that complements the one provided in the main text. While the details"
"illustrated below do not vary the conclusions drawn in the main text, they provide additional technical details on the genetic
algorithm employed in our analysis. In addition, they help investigate how the results change when the parameters are varied
beyond the (reasonable) ranges assumed so far."
"For the solution of our multidimensional parametric problem the procedure we adopt is as follows (see also Fromm et al.
2019; Nathanail et al. 2020, for additional information). We start by recalling that genetic algorithms are designed to generate
high-quality solutions to problems of this type where a searching optimization is sought. The name follows from the operators of
mutation, crossover and selection that are normally found in biological systems. Our choice of a genetic algorithm in place of a
more traditional Bayesian analysis based on a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo approach is motivated mostly by the overall simplicity
of our problem and the reduced computational costs that are associated with a genetic algorithm."
"In practice, our algorithm samples through the parameter space of the ten free parameters. From those it computes the 𝑀 redej
through Eqs. (3) and (5), 𝑀postGW through Eq. (10) and the specific angular momentum at collapse 𝑗coll via Eq. (1), using the
sampled value of𝜒. Subsequently, Eqs. (7), (8), and (9) are solved to match the observed values of 𝑀𝑔 and 𝑀 totej within the errors,
finding the best-fit values. The genetic algorithm employed here makes use of Python packages from the SciPY software library
(Virtanen et al. 2020)."
"As a corollary to the discussion made in the main text and relative to Figs. 1–3, we provide with the corner plots in Fig. 4
information on the probability distribution functions of the various quantities involved in our analysis. More specifically, Fig.
4 shows the corner plot relative to maximum-mass posterior shown in Fig. 1 and should therefore accompany the information
presented in Fig. 2. On the other hand, Fig. 5 refers to the case when the genetic algorithm is forced to consider 𝑀TOV = 2.5 𝑀�.
In this case, the maximum-mass is set to vary uniformly in the very small interval around 𝑀TOV = 2.5"
"+0.0001
−0.0001 𝑀�, leaving all the"
"other parameters free to be adjusted till a best-fit is found. In this sense, the information in Fig. 5 complements what is reported in
Fig. 3 and shows that all the posterior distributions are pushed to be very narrow at the edges of the allowed ranges. For instance,
the dimensionless spin 𝜒 is narrowly peaked around its minimum value 1.1, the mass in the disk is much smaller and of the order
of ' 0.035 𝑀�, while the blue and red ejecta are comparable and equal to ' 0.019 𝑀�."
"Note that to avoid having a large number of small panels, we have limited ourselves either to the most salient ones, omitting
those quantities for which the distributions are either almost constant or restricted to a very small region. More specifically, in
Fig. 4 the values found are: b = 0.973+0.011−0.035, [ = 1.171"

−0.209, and a = 0.243"
"+0.005
−0.000,"
"which corresponds to 𝑞 = 0.719+0.136−0.006. We have also explored a modified scenario in which the blue ejecta are larger than
inferred from observations. In particular, we have adjusted the upper bound on the blue ejecta from 𝑀blueej /𝑀� < 0.02 to
𝑀blueej /𝑀� < 0.05. In this case, we find that the blue ejecta converge to a distribution with a median around ∼ 0.03 𝑀�, while the
red ejecta component decreases to ∼ 0.02 𝑀�. At the same time, the changes in the posterior for the maximum mass are minute,
i.e., 𝑀TOV = 2.192"
"+0.125
−0.092 𝑀�."
"Finally, in Fig. 6 we provide information that is similar in content to that in Fig. 3, but when we allow for the dimensionless
spin to attain even smaller values, i.e., 1.05 ≤ 𝜒 . 1.22. Note that in this case, the ejected mass for 𝑀TOV = 2.4 𝑀� is within the
observational bounds, but the excess in radiated mass is more severe. The disagreement becomes even stronger for 𝑀TOV = 2.5 𝑀�."
"As a concluding remark we note that the interpretation of the nature of GW190425 is likely unaffected by our findings on the
maximum masses of neutron stars. While a BH-NS nature cannot be fully ruled out, the most plausible case of a NS-NS nature
of the system is perfectly compatible with our findings on the maximum mass, as the initial masses in GW190425 are both well
below the maximum-mass limit we have presented here (see also Most et al. 2020a, for a discussion on GW190425). On the other
hand, an indirect impact that our results have on GW190425 is on whether the merger led to a prompt collapse (i.e., where the
hypermassive neutron star collapses to a black hole either at or shortly after merger), or to a stable long lived remnant. Using the
results of Koeppel et al. (2019) (but see also Bauswein et al. 2017), and given the values for the maximum mass found here, a
prompt or delayed collapse scenario seems likely for GW190425."
