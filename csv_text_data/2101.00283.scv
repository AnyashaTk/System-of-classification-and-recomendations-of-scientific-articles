ABSTRACT
"Using a combination of ground-based and HST imaging, we have constructed a"
catalog of 179 supernova remnants (SNRs) and SNR candidates in the nearby spiral
galaxy M51. Follow-up spectroscopy of 66 of the candidates confirms 61 of these as

well. A total of 55 of the candidates are coincident with (mostly soft) X-ray sources
identified in deep Chandra observations of M51; searching the positions of other soft
X-ray sources resulted in several additional possible optical candidates. There are
16 objects in the catalog coincident with known radio sources. None of the sources

1. INTRODUCTION
"Following the violent death of a star as a supernova, material rich in heavy elements"
is ejected and drives shock waves into the surrounding circumstellar and/or interstellar
material to form a supernova remnant (SNR). Supernovae (SNe) are a key part of
the cycle that gradually enriches the cosmos; they can trigger new episodes of star
"formation, and collectively they may influence the evolution of the galaxies in which"
"they take place. For understanding these processes, it is most efficacious to study"
"SNR samples in nearby galaxies, especially spirals that are oriented nearly face-on."
"Here we typically find large numbers of SNRs, all at effectively the same distance,"
and in most cases with minimal foreground absorption. All this contrasts with our
"own Galaxy, where most of the hundreds of identified SNRs are at poorly determined"
distances and suffer from significant extinction—in many cases so much so that they
have not even been detected optically.
"Relatively nearby, face-on, and with well-defined spiral arms with active star for-"
"mation, M51 presents an ideal venue for this study of SNRs. M51 (NGC 5194/5)"
has the distinction of being the first galaxy classified as a spiral (Rosse 1850) and is
"one of the most well known interacting systems, comprising the grand-design spiral"
M51A = NGC 5194 and smaller companion M51B = NGC 5195. M51A is classified
"as a late-type grand-design Sbc, while its early-type northern companion M51b is"
"classified as a barred S0. At a distance of 8.58 ± 0.10 Mpc (McQuinn et al. 2016),
where 1′′ corresponds to a linear size of 41.6 pc, the Whirlpool Galaxy has been the"
"site of four supernovae since 1945, and is thus expected to host a rich population of"
"Most extragalactic SNRs have been first identified optically, through their [S II]"
"λλ6716, 6731 lines, where we typically find [S II]:Hα flux ratios > 0.4, significantly"
"higher than in H II regions, where [S II]:Hα is usually . 0.2 (e.g., Mathewson & Clarke
1973; Levenson et al. 1995; Long 2017). Most of the bright optical emission from SNRs"
stems from secondary shocks driven into dense clouds. The passing shock rapidly
"heats the material, which then gradually cools in a long-lasting post-shock tail, where"
we find a variety of low-ionization and even neutral species that radiate following
"electron collisional excitation, producing optical spectra with strong forbidden lines"
"from (especially) [S II], [N II], [O II], and [O I], in addition to Balmer lines. By"
"contrast, the emission from H II regions stems from photoionized gas that is kept in"
predominantly higher ionization states by ongoing UV radiation from hot stars.
"This paper presents the first catalog of SNRs in M51, derived from a combination"
of HST and ground-based imaging surveys. We use the traditional [S II]:Hα ratio
SNRs in M51 3
criterion to identify likely shock-heated SNR candidates.1 We also obtain and analyze
"spectra from many of these, along with a selection of H II regions, to better measure"
"the [S II]:Hα ratios, along with other low-ionization lines that characterize shock-"
heated SNRs. The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 2 we describe our imaging
"observations, candidate selection, and subsequent spectroscopy. Sec. 3 presents the"
results: our complete catalog of 179 SNR candidates and the spectra we obtained
"for 66 of these. In Sec. 4 we discuss several aspects of our results, including the"
"unusually strong [N II] lines that dominate the spectra of many M51 SNRs, overlaps"
"between objects in our search and ones from X-ray and radio surveys, historical SNe"
"in M51, and the population of SNRs in M51 relative to the populations in other"
"similar galaxies. Finally, Sec. 5 gives a brief summary of our conclusions."
"2. OBSERVATIONS, DATA REDUCTION, AND CANDIDATE SELECTION"
M51 is the most distant galaxy for which an extensive population of SNRs has been
"identified (Long 2017). The most common approach for these studies, which we have"
"followed in our own previous studies of M83 (Blair et al. 2012, 2014; Winkler et al."
"2017) and NGC 6946 (Long et al. 2019, 2020), is to start with a ground-based imaging"
"survey and follow up with HST. In the case of M51, the availability of HST data"
for Hα and several broad bands meant that only [S II] imaging was missing in order
"to allow an SNR search. Hence, our observations of M51 began with narrow-band"
"imaging from HST, and then continued to ground-based survey work with the 8.2m"
"Gemini North telescope, where we first obtained images, and then spectra for over"
"100 objects, all using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS). Below we"
"describe these data sets in the order they were obtained. In reality, the order makes"
"little difference; as with our previous studies, the ground- and space-based survey"
work is largely complementary.
2.1. HST Imagery
The HST imagery used in this program is summarized in Table 1 Program GO-10452
"(Beckwith, PI) was a Director’s Discretionary program that used the ACS/WFC"
and resulted in the image of M51 that was widely distributed at the Hubble 15th
anniversary.2 This imaging covered six overlapping ACS/WFC fields with the data
"from each field dithered over four exposures, resulting in the total times for each field"
"listed in Table 1. These observations included three broadband filters plus F658N,"
"which captured Hα (plus [N II] λλ6548, 6583) emission from nebular regions of active"
star formation. These data have been used by Lee et al. (2011) for a comprehensive
"study of H II regions in M51, and by many other authors, but alone they are not"
"sufficient for an SNR search, since a shock diagnostic such as [S II] λλ6716, 6731 is"
also needed.
"1 Although our SNR search was limited to M51A = NGC 5194, we refer to the galaxy as M51 for
simplicity."

"Hence, we leveraged these earlier observations by obtaining WFC3/UVIS imagery"
"in two additional filters, also shown in Table 1. Program GO-12762 (K. Kuntz, PI)"
"used F673N to capture [S II] λλ6716, 6731 emission from four fields, and used F689M"
to provide a continuum band for subtracting the galaxy background. These data
"were also dithered, to help mitigate cosmic ray effects and chip gaps in the processed"
data. These data were obtained just prior to the recommendation that a pedestal of
"electrons (using the FLASH parameter) was advised by STScI, especially for narrow-"
"band imagery, to control charge transfer inefficiency in the CCDs. While no FLASH"
"parameters were set, we see no obvious ill effects from not having done so. Fig. 1"
shows the relative field coverage of these two data sets after they were aligned and
mosaicked. The newer [S II] data cover the main body of M51A but miss some of the
outermost spiral arms; they do not cover the companion galaxy M51B.
All of these data were retrieved from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes
(MAST) for processing. The individual dither frames were aligned and combined for
"each field, then placed into a mosaic. Since the native pixel scales are different for"
"ACS and WFC3, we used the AstroDrizzle package (Fruchter 2010; Gonzaga & et al."
2012) to produce aligned mosaics on a common grid that allow direct comparison.
"The procedure closely followed that described in Blair et al. (2014, see Sec. 2 and"
the Appendix of that paper) for M83 and will not be repeated here. Astrometric
alignments relied on centroids of isolated stars in the overlap regions between fields
"of the mosaic to align all of the frames to a single grid, and then used stars from"
"the UCAC3 astrometric catalog (Zacharias et al. 2010) and 2MASS, selecting objects"
with small positional uncertainties and checking visually to eliminate close doubles
"and a few background galaxies.3 Finally, the WCS keywords in the FITS file headers"
"were adjusted to place the entire data set on the same absolute astrometric scale,"
with relative alignment accurate to < 0.′′1.
"Once the images were mosaicked and aligned, the initial search process was straight-"
forward. We used standard IRAF4 techniques to scale and subtract continuum from
"the emission-line images. After some experimentation, we ultimately used the ACS"
F555W continuum image to scale and subtract from both the Hα and [S II] mosaics.
"This choice provided a subtraction of the Hα image over the entire ACS mosaic area,"
though our [S II] coverage was more restricted. The color differences between the
galaxy background in the nuclear region and the outer arms made it difficult to use a
"single scaling of the continuum image for subtraction, so a separate subtraction (that"
over-subtracted the outer galaxy) was used specifically for the inner portion of the
galaxy.
The search procedure was to simultaneously display the subtracted Hα and [S II]
frames along with a continuum band for reference using SAOimage DS9 (Joye &

enough for our present purposes, the astrometry has not been revisited."

background image is the ACS 6-field mosaic with the F658N filter. The box shows the

Mandel 2003). Sub-regions of the WFC3 mosaic were then enlarged to an appropriate
scale and inspected visually to locate compact emission nebulae with enhanced [S II]
emission. Comparison against the continuum frame prevented us from mistaking
stellar residuals for possibly interesting compact nebulae. Cursor readings could be

"Figure 2. HST image data for a small region, located in the first spiral arm south of
the nucleus, that contains four SNR candidates. The region is centered at R.A.(J2000) =
13:29:55.93, Decl.(J2000) = +47:10:45.4, and is oriented N-up, E-left. The green circles
indicate three candidates identified in our blind search of the HST images, where we looked
for compact nebulae with elevated [S II]:Hα ratios. The Hα + [N II] and [S II] panels have
been continuum-subtracted using the F555W data shown at lower right. The color panel
has been scaled to show the SNR candidates as green to yellow, while photoionized regions
appear as red. The yellow circle indicates a large-diameter, low surface-brightness SNR
candidate found in the ground-based search that was later corroborated by the HST data
when an appropriate display stretch was used. For scale, the object in the largest green
circle is approximately half the size as the Cygnus Loop in our Galaxy."
used to estimate the observed ratio of [S II] to Hα. Fig. 2 shows an example of
"a small region containing several SNR candidates as an example, including a color"
image that also highlights the different relative line intensities for the nebulae in the
region shown.
A significant caveat that made this process less determinative than in previous
galaxy searches was that the ACS filter used for Hα (F658N) was broad enough to
fully include the [N II] lines that bracket Hα. [N II] is both strong and variable in
"M51, especially in the SNRs (a fact later confirmed with our spectroscopy), effec-"
tively making the images a comparison of the [S II]:(Hα + [N II]) instead of [S II]:Hα.
This had the effect of decreasing the contrast between the ratio for SNRs and H II
"regions that we normally depend on to identify the SNRs. Nonetheless, with appro-"
"priate scaling, a set of compact nebulae that were relatively strong in [S II] could be"
"identified, as illustrated by the example shown in Fig. 2. The overall blind search"
of the HST data resulted in 80 compact nebulae that were judged to have observed
"ratios significantly elevated over what was typical for obvious H II regions, but with"

somewhat less certainty as to their quality as SNR candidates than had been the case
for our previous surveys of other galaxies. The spatial distribution of these objects
across the region observed is shown by the yellow circles in Fig. 3.
Circular DS9 regions were set on these objects and re-sized to provide a measurement
of both the position and the angular size of each object. Although some objects show
"some extent and morphology in the HST data (cf. Fig. 2), these objects are almost"
"all below 1′′ in size, extending down almost to the resolution limit of the WFC3 data"
"for the smallest nebulae. (Note: One WFC3 pixel = 0.′′04, or ∼ 2 pc at the distance
of M51.)"
2.2. GMOS-N Images
Although the exquisite resolution of the HST WFC3 images enabled us to identify
"these small objects of interest, the exposures were not deep enough to see larger, lower"
8 Winkler et al.
"surface-brightness (and presumably older) SNRs. Hence, as a complement to the HST"
"survey, we received approval for imaging M51 with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectro-"
graph (GMOS) on the 8.2m Gemini-North telescope through the “Fast Turnaround”
"program GN-2017A-FT-7 (Long, PI). Through this program, we obtained narrow-"
band images of two overlapping fields covering most of M51 with GMOS in 3 bands:
"Hα, [S II], and a matched continuum band (HaC filter). The observing details are"
given in Table 2.
"We processed these images using standard IRAF techniques in the gmos package,"
using dozens of stars from Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) to improve the
"World Coordinate system, and mosaicked the two fields together. To enhance the"
"search for faint nebulae, it is useful to use continuum-subtracted images, obtained"
by scaling and subtracting the continuum image (separately) from the Hα and [S II]
"layers. Finally, we flux calibrated the continuum-subtracted images, using short Hα"
and [S II] observations of two spectrophotometric standards from the list of Massey
et al. (1988).
"Unfortunately, this procedure was not efficacious for the [S II] images of M51, be-"
"cause at the 600 km s−1 redshift of M51, the [N II] 6584 Å line was shifted well into"
"the bandpass of the HaC filter, with a transmission of almost 50%. Since (as we"
"later discovered through our spectroscopy), the [N II] lines are extremely strong in"
"many M51 SNRs, subtracting the “continuum” effectively removed much of the neb-"
"ular emission along with the stars. We had, in effect, “thrown out the baby with"
"the bath water!” To search for SNR candidates, we thus displayed the unsubtracted"
"flux-calibrated Hα and [S II] images in DS9, carefully compared small regions, and"
marked nebulae that appeared to have a relatively strong [S II]:Hα ratio when com-
pared to obvious H II regions. While this ersatz procedure was less stringent than
"using continuum-subtracted images, as we have done for similar searches in other"
"galaxies, we were nevertheless able to identify 107 SNR candidates from the GMOS"
images. After eliminating duplicates with candidates already identified from the HST
"images, this left 71 new candidates from the GMOS search alone, and a total of 151"
from both HST and GMOS. All of these are listed in Table 3. In order to establish
"priorities to use in designing masks for our subsequent multi-object spectroscopy, we"
"assigned each of these a confidence grade of A, B, or C, based on their [S II]:Hα ratio"
"as estimated from the images, morphology, and lack of confusion with surrounding"
emission.
"Subsequent to our spectroscopy, we made another careful pass through both the"
GMOS and the HST images to search for additional candidates that might have been
missed earlier. The GMOS search was aided by the late acquisition of broad r-band
images of exactly the same fields we had imaged previously using narrow-band filters.
"By precisely aligning the r-band images with those in [S II], we were at last able"
SNRs in M51 9
"to make useful continuum-subtracted [S II] images.5 In these improved images, the"
"candidates we had selected earlier became more obvious, and several new candidates"
appeared as well. Our later search of both HST and GMOS images yielded 28 new
"candidates, which we have also included in Table 3 for a grand total of 179."
2.3. GMOS-N Spectroscopy
We pursued follow-up multi-object spectroscopy from GMOS-N under program GN-
"2018A-Q-302 (Winkler, PI). Based on the spatial distribution of SNR candidates, we"
determined that masks with slits oriented north-south would give greater efficiency
"than an east-west orientation, which would have been required had we used our 2017"
"GMOS images for mask design. Therefore, we did short dithered exposures in the"
"broad r filter of two overlapping M51 fields with the GMOS chips oriented N-S, which"
we then used as pre-images to design the MOS masks.
"Three masks were designed and observed, giving preference to higher graded can-"
"didates; in total, these included 44 ‘A’ candidates, 18 ‘B’ candidates, and 3 ‘C’ ones,"
plus one additional SNR that appeared serendipitously on one of the slits:6 a total
of 66 SNR candidates with spectra. The locations of all the SNR candidates with
"spectra are indicated by the red squares in Fig. 3. In addition, we explicitly targeted"
"a number of H II regions, and obtained spectra for several others that serendipitously"
lay along slits with other targets: a total of 44 H II regions spanning a wide range in
"location, surface brightness, and size. We list these H II regions in Table 4."
"Our GMOS-N program used the B600 grating (G5307, 600 lines mm−1) and GG455"
"blocking filter, with the Hamamatsu detector binned ×4 in the dispersion direction,
and ×2 spatially, to give a dispersion of 2.06 Å pixel−1 and a spatial scale of 0.16
′′ pixel−1. The spectral coverage varied with the position of the object, but for almost"
"all the objects coverage extended at least from Hβ through [S II] λλ6716, 6731, with"
a resolution of about 5.2 Å. Spectra were then taken with each of the three masks
"in May - July 2018. For each mask, four exposures of 1100 s each were acquired at"
"each of three grating tilts, giving three central wavelength (CWL) settings: 5800 Å,"
"5900 Å, and 6000 Å, to assure that gaps in spectral coverage (resulting from the chip"
gaps on the GMOS detector) would be fully covered.7 Immediately before or after
"the science frames at each CWL setting, quartz flat and CuAr arc calibration frames"
were obtained.
The data were processed using standard procedures from the gemini package in
"IRAF for bias subtraction, flat-fielding, wavelength calibration, and combination of"
spectra with different CWL settings to provide the final 2-dimensional spectra. Flux
"5 The broad r filter passes Hα, [N II], and [S II] lines, but its far greater bandwidth (1360 Å, compared
with ∼ 40-70 Å for the emission-line filters) makes it relatively more sensitive to stars, and thus
effective for continuum subtraction."
"6 Subsequent inspection of the HST images showed that this was clearly a strong candidate that we
had overlooked in our initial search; henceforth, we count it among the ‘A’ candidates."
"7 An exception is mask 3, where four 1100 s exposures were obtained at 5800 Å and 5900 Å, but only
two 1100 s exposures at 6000 Å."
10 Winkler et al.
calibration was based on baseline GMOS observations of a few spectrophotometric
"standard stars, carried out in the same semester as part of standard GMOS operations."
"During the processing, the 2-D spectra from different slitlets were separated to give"
individual 2-D spectra from each slitlet. We examined each of these individually to
determine the optimum background sky subtraction region. Many of the objects are
located in regions with bright surrounding galactic background (both continuum and
"emission lines) from M51, so the ability to subtract a representative local background"
in the vicinity of each object is important for obtaining accurate spectra. In most cases
"this limited the precision of our eventual line flux measurements. Finally, we summed"
rows containing each object to yield our final one-dimensional spectra. Several typical
examples are shown in Fig. 4.
"We then performed fits to obtain emission-line fluxes from the spectra, assuming"
"Gaussian profiles, for the following lines and line complexes: Hβ alone, the [O III]"
"doublet, the [O I] doublet, the Hα-[N II] complex, and the [S II] doublet. For the fits,"
we assumed that the background varied linearly with wavelength around each line or
"complex, and that the FWHM of all lines in each complex was the same."
3. RESULTS
Table 5 lists the information we obtained for the SNR candidates for which we
"obtained spectra. Specifically we list (1) the source name, (2) the extracted Hα flux,"
"(3-9) the fluxes of primary emission lines, relative to Hα= 300, and (10) the total"
"[S II]:Hα ratio. For doublets where the line ratio is constrained by atomic physics,"
"i.e. [O III], [O I], and [N II], we have listed only the stronger line. We visually"
inspected all the spectra and the fits to them; values which we judged to be more
uncertain are indicated by a tilde in the table. No allowance has been made for
additional uncertainties associated with background sky subtraction. A few objects
"were observed with two different masks; in these cases, we used the spectrum that we"
judged to be of higher quality. Table 6 lists the same information for the H II region
spectra.
"Fig. 5, (left panel) shows a plot of the [S II]:Hα ratio for all the objects for which"
"we obtained spectra. Of the 66 SNR candidates with spectra, we measured [S II]:Hα"
"ratios > 0.4 for 60 of them, leading us to conclude that these may be considered"
"bona fide SNRs. (This number includes 43 of the 44 ‘A’ candidates we observed,"
"and 15 of the 18 ‘B’ ones.) Furthermore, of these 60 with strong [S II]:Hα ratios, 56"
also show clear evidence for [O I] λ6300 emission—another strong indicator of shock
excitation. So too does one of the candidates with a marginal [S II]:Hα ratio; hence
we conclude there are at least 61 bona fide SNRs in our sample. The five candidates
"not yet confirmed are W21-006, -021, -062, -124, and -179. While we cannot confirm"
"that these objects are SNRs, neither can we conclude the opposite, since coincident"
"photo-ionized gas could dilute emission from SNR shocks. Instead, these remain SNR"
candidates.

4. DISCUSSION
4.1. Unusually Strong Forbidden Lines
The most noticeable feature of our M51 SNR spectra are the extremely strong
"[N II] λλ6548, 6583 lines, and to a lesser extent, the [S II] λλ6716, 6731 lines, both"
"with respect to Hα. Other spiral galaxies with rich SNR populations, e.g., M33"
"(Long et al. 2018), M81 (Matonick & Fesen 1997; Lee et al. 2015), M83 (Winkler"
"et al. 2017), M101 (Matonick & Fesen 1997), and NGC 6946 (Long et al. 2019), show"
"a similar effect, but it is more extreme in M51. In fact, in a few cases the weaker"
[N II] 6548 Å line is stronger than Hα—something we are unaware of in SNRs from
"any of the other galaxy samples. As shown in Fig. 6, the [N II] lines are significantly"
"stronger for smaller remnants, and they also show a strong gradient with increasing"
"galactocentric distance (GCD; listed as R in the tables), albeit with very significant"

"W21-088, -064, -074, -106, -085, and -051. These are all near the center of M51:"
"five of the six have R < 2 kpc, and the sixth, W21-106, is at R = 4.0 kpc. All are"
"relatively small, D < 26 pc, and all have [S II]:Hα ratios > 1.29. Looking instead at"
"the SNRs with the largest [S II]:Hα ratios, the six with [S II]:Hα > 1.65, three are also"
"among the six with the strongest [N II] lines: W21-051, -088, and -074. The others,"
"W21-025, -068, and -034 also have strong [N II] lines, [N II]:Hα > 2.8. The ones with"

Bresolin et al. (2004) obtained electron temperatures directly and thus improved (over previous

out an analysis similar to that of Bresolin et al. (2004) for more H II regions in M51 and reached
similar conclusions, though they did measure a modest N/O abundance gradient."

background subtractions for the most extreme cases. If Hα was being over- or under-
"subtracted significantly on an object-by-object basis, this could impact the ratios to"
"Hα. Our inspection of the 2-D spectra, however, provides confidence that this is not"
the case to any significant extent. Even for the object with the single most extreme
"[N II]:Hα ratio (W21-088), we find the background subtraction to have been nominal."
"The vast majority of the spectra are well-detected in the red, and low signal-to-noise"
or poor sky subtraction cannot explain the observed line ratios. We also note that
"the H II region sample, processed in the same manner as the SNR sample, shows no"
such effect.
Could variations in abundances be responsible for the unusually strong lines? The
"smaller SNRs are almost certainly younger than the larger ones, and have conse-"

quently swept up less interstellar material. If many of these smaller/younger rem-
"nants encounter circumstellar shells, enriched in N as a result of He-burning and shed"
during the red-giant and/or asymptotic-giant-branch phases of their progenitors’ evo-
"lution, this would naturally lead to the strong [N II] lines we observe. However, any"
impact from this effect would be expected only for the very smallest/youngest SNRs.
"As the left panel in Fig. 6 shows, the effect is present for objects as large as 40-50 pc—"
"surely not very young objects. Furthermore, the H II region sample is well-behaved"
and shows no hint of any large N-abundance variations from object to object. While
this might have been masked in previous studies that have observed giant H II region
"complexes, our H II region sample includes many smaller, compact H II regions and"
ones directly adjacent to many of the SNR candidates themselves. If large local vari-
"ations in abundances were present, our H II sample might be expected to show it, yet"
it does not.
Less extreme versions of this effect for SNR samples in other galaxies have been
attributed to variations in the shock conditions from object to object. There are many
"parameters that can be varied in shock models (e.g., magnetic field, preshock density,"
"precursor emission, shock completeness, in addition to abundances), and perhaps"
some combination of parameter variations could be responsible for the observed effect.
The more extreme variations seen in M51 SNRs have caused us to revisit this idea in
"more detail, and to conclude that within the context of currently published models,"
it appears difficult to account for the observations.
We have used the extensive grid of shock models from Allen et al. (2008) to inves-
tigate the variations in [N II]:Hα and [S II]:Hα for the broad range of the parameter
"space covered by the grid, as shown in Fig. 8. This grid includes both models with"
"and without self-consistent pre-ionization, over a velocity range from 100 to 1000"
"km s−1, and over a broad range of assumed pre-shock densities and magnetic field"
"strengths. Additionally, the grid covers three separate abundance sets, characteristic"
"of the LMC, solar, and 2×solar abundances. Our inspections of these models find no
cases where the expected [N II]:Hα ratio exceeds a value of 2, let alone our observed"
"values for many objects up to 4 and above. Indeed, the 2×solar-abundance models
actually have somewhat lower ratios than the solar models; apparently, raising the"
"overall abundances affects the cooling carried in various lines, with an overall effect of"
lowering the [N II]:Hα ratio. Fig. 9 shows a plot of [N II]:Hα vs/ [S II]:Hα for several
"other galaxies in addition to M51, emphasizing M51’s extreme nature."
The model grids tend to hold one parameter constant while varying other param-
eters. While it could be true that varying multiple parameters all in the direction
that seems to increase the [N II]:Hα and [S II]:Hα somewhat might produce higher
"values of the ratios than seen in the grid, this remains conjecture until such models"
are actually calculated. One could also selectively increase the N abundance in the
"models, but as mentioned above, there is no indication of such an abundance anomaly"
in the H II sample.

The main difficulty with such elevated ratios is that these singly-ionized species are
"normally formed in about the same temperature zone behind the shock; hence, driving"
the ratios to widely variable values is difficult. It could be that thermal instabilities
"in combination with magnetic field or other shock parameters are at play, favoring"
"regions where hydrogen is ionized even as N and S are able to recombine, and thus"
"driving up the observed ratios. However, for these distant SNRs, we are obtaining"
"what are effectively global spectra of their radiative filaments, not localized filaments"
that might be expected to show such effects more clearly if they were present. It also
would not explain why there is such dramatic variation between different objects.
"Hence, at present we are left with a conundrum."
4.2. Other Emission Line Ratios
"The [S II] λ6717:λ6731 line ratio is a well-known density diagnostic (e.g., Osterbrock"
"& Ferland 2006). In SNR spectra, this density refers to the density in the post-shock"
"recombination zone, but it is related to pre-shock density (depending on the details of"
"the model assumptions one uses), which in turn is an indication of the ISM conditions"
"surrounding each SNR. In Fig. 10, left, we show this ratio, and there is a trend toward"
lower values of the ratio (higher densities) for smaller diameter (generally younger)
"objects, but there is significant variation from object to object. This is a pattern"
"we have seen in other galaxies as well, and is consistent with an interpretation that"
varying conditions in the ISM is a significant driver of the evolution of the SNR
sample as a whole.
"In Fig. 10, right, we show the Hβ:Hα Balmer line ratio, which is nominally an"
"indicator of extinction. Assuming case B, the unreddened ratio would be 0.35, as"
"shown in the figure, with lower values indicating increased extinction. One caveat"
"is that there is a complication with fainter objects and higher extinctions, both of"
"which can make the Hβ line weaker and more uncertain, thus affecting the measured"
ratio. The few values above 0.35 are unphysical and are likely afflicted by this effect.
"Objects with lower ratios may have weak, poorly determined Hβ values, and hence"
"uncertain (but high) extinction. However, for well-measured objects, the figure shows"
"significant variation, with the lowest ratios indicating E(B − V ) values of ∼ 1.5.
Similarly, Calzetti et al. (2005) found a high dispersion for H II-emitting knots in"
"M51, especially near the center of the galaxy. Since most of the SNRs are found"
"within the spiral arms and dust lanes, this variation is not surprising, and is similar"
to what is observed in other spiral galaxies.

"SNRs have been identified, 155 were detected at radio wavelengths by White et al."

"112 were detected (with > 3σ) at X-ray wavelengths, either with XMM-Newton"

et al. (2020) in unconfused regions of a radio image created from data obtained with
the Australia Telescope Compact Array. A total of 87 of the SNRs in M83 have been
detected using Chandra (Long et al. 2014).
"M51 has, of course, also been studied at radio and X-ray wavelengths. Maddox et al."
"(2007) compiled a catalog of 107 compact radio sources using the VLA, identifying"
"five as likely SNRs, based on their non-thermal spectral indices and association with"
resolved shells in Hα images obtained with HST. Kilgard et al. (2005) gave a catalog
"of 116 X-ray sources from Chandra observations of M51, and Kuntz et al. (2016)"
reported a catalog of 297 X-ray sources within the D25 contour for M51 in a much
deeper Chandra image of the galaxy. Both these papers suggested that a substantial
number of the sources with soft X-ray hardness ratios were likely SNRs. With our
"data, we can shed additional light on these."
We have investigated positional coincidences of sources from both the Maddox radio
and Kuntz X-ray catalogs with the 179 objects we have identified as SNRs or SNR
candidates (Table 3). There are 16 radio sources that lie within 1′′ of one of our SNR
"candidates, compared with three expected by chance.9 These include four of the five"
radio sources identified by Maddox et al. (2007) as probable SNRs. There are 55
"X-ray sources that lie within 1′′ of a SNR candidate, compared with four expected by"
"chance. Of the 16 optical-radio coincidences, 15 are triple coincidences with an X-ray"
source as well. The identification of an X-ray and/or radio source at the position of
"9 We estimate chance coincidences by shifting the source positions of one of the catalogs by several
arcsec in various directions and recalculating the the number of coincidences. We also allow for a
small systematic offset (<0.3′′) in position between any two catalogs when carrying out the matching."

one of the optical SNR candidates clearly increases the likelihood that the object is
a bona fide SNR.
Most X-ray sources in deep X-ray studies of nearby galaxies are black-hole or
"neutron-star binaries, or background AGNs—all sources with hard X-ray spectra."
"In contrast, SNRs emit X-rays from shock-heated gas and typically have soft X-ray"
spectra. The two types of objects can be isolated in X-ray hardness-ratio diagrams.
"As shown in Fig. 11, most of the X-ray sources that are spatially coincident with"
nebulae in our SNR candidate catalog lie in the region where soft X-ray photons
"dominate, as expected."

1′′ of SNRs or SNR candidates from Table 3 are shown in red, while others are in grey.
Not surprisingly, those associated with SNRs are concentrated in the “soft” region of the
diagram (lower vertex of the triangle)."
We have also turned this technique around and asked what are the other soft X-
ray sources in Fig. 11. Is there optical evidence of possible SNR emission at those
locations? We projected the previously unidentified soft-source positions (those with
"(M – S)/Total values < −0.5) from Kuntz et al. (2016) onto our HST and GMOS
images and performed a visual search for objects of interest. The majority of these"
positions were empty or were projected onto general star fields in M51. If these are

"cloudlets, thus producing no bright optical remnant. This may favor a SN Ia origin,"
since the time delay between star formation and SN explosion is generally longer for
"SNe Ia than for core-collapse SNe (e.g., Totani et al. 2008). Nine additional X-ray"
sources do have coincident emission nebulae and are thus of possible interest; these
are listed in Table 7.
A selection of these objects is shown in Fig. 12. Three of the objects could be bona
"fide SNRs with elevated [S II]:Hα ratios, such as X-336, shown in the top panels."
Several of the objects found are very small-diameter emission nebulae with relatively
"low [S II]:Hα ratios, as in X-269 (middle panels), but the presence of the soft X-ray"
"counterpart certainly makes them intriguing. Two objects are fainter, more extended"
"nebulae that show some clumpiness or other structure, such as X-317 (bottom panels),"
"but it is difficult to measure accurate ratios from the imagery. Finally, one object is"
just south of the active nuclear region and aligned with a complex and very extended
"region of emission; while shocks may be involved in this region, it is unlikely to be a"
SNR in the sense of the other objects we have found.
We have also checked other sources identified by Maddox et al. (2007) as possible
radio SNRs but that are not included in Table 3. There are only two of these:
"M07-073 and M07-076.10 As shown in Fig. 13, both of these objects have coincident"
"10 Maddox et al. (2007) identified M07-076 as a probable SNR based on its radio spectral index and
association with an Hα nebula. M07-073 also has a slightly non-thermal spectral index (−0.19±0.30),
but it had been identified as a likely SNR in the Chandra survey of M51 by Kilgard et al. (2005)."

"(really [S II]:(Hα+ [N II]) ratios of ∼ 0.15 - 0.17, somewhat lower than for most
of the SNRs in our sample (Fig. 5, right). The source M07-073 is also coincident"
"with the soft X-ray source X271, enhancing the likelihood that it is, indeed, a SNR."
Information about these two sources is also given in Table 7.
"Figure 13. HST and Chandra images of the optical objects found to align with radio
sources 73 and 76 from the catalog of M51 sources by Maddox et al. (2007). Panels are
similar to those in Fig. 12: left to right are the HST Hα, [S II], and F814W (I-band)
continuum; the right panels show Chandra 0.35 - 1.1 keV in red, 1.1 - 2.6 keV in green, and

"At the very least, these comparisons hint at the incompleteness of our current"
"catalog, which is not surprising in the case of M51, since it is the most distant galaxy"
for which an extensive search for SNRs has so far been carried out.
"Finally, we mention that M51 is host to a number of ultraluminous X-ray sources"
"(ULXs), some of which show eclipses, and others show variability (Terashima & Wil-"
son 2004; Urquhart et al. 2018; Brightman et al. 2020). The numbering of these
sources among various authors and the accuracy of the coordinates given are not
"always clear. However, projecting those nominal sources onto our data (including"
"the Chandra data), we find two objects of likely interest. Urquhart et al. (2018)"
"source ULX-1 corresponds to our source W21-004, a very elongated optical nebula"
with elevated [S II]:Hα. Urquhart et al. (2018) show a spectrum and conclude this
SNRs in M51 21
"is a shock-heated jet from the ULX, with some weaker lines possibly indicating some"
"X-ray photoionization as well. By way of comparison, their ULX-2 is also surrounded"
"by a faint semi-circular nebula, but their spectrum in this case indicates a much lower"
[S II]:Hα ratio and normal stellar photoionization.
"From Brightman et al. (2020), the source they list as ULX-2 is near our source"
"W21-011, but the coordinate given is significantly off. However, projecting onto the"
Chandra images shows the very bright X-ray source (also Terashima & Wilson (2004)
"source 5) to be aligned with W21-011, so the coordinate accuracy in Brightman et al."
"(2020) may be suspect. The optical source in this case is compact and circular, not"
jet-like. Our spectrum of this source shows [S II]:Hα = 0.45 and a fairly high density
"from the λ6717:λ6731 ratio of 0.85 (∼1000 cm−3). It is not clear whether this source
is a SNR with very bright soft X-ray emission or whether the source is more similar"
to Urquhart et al. (2018) ULX-1 mentioned above but with a different geometry.
"Of the remaining ULXs listed by Brightman et al. (2020), ULX-9 is not within"
"our field of view, but none of the others aligns even approximately with any of our"
"sources. Although we retain W21-004 and W21-011 in our catalog, the exceedingly"
strong X-ray emission from these two sources makes it clear they are not normal
"SNRs per se, but the [S II]:Hα ratio criterion found them anyway. This is directly"
"analogous to the situation in M83, where the jet-like microquasar MQ1 was initially"
"associated with a SNR candidate (Soria et al. 2014), and where a second nebula with"
elevated [S II]:Hα may align with another microquasar (Soria et al. 2020).
4.4. Historical Supernovae
"While M51’s four historical SNe within the past 75 years (SN 1945A, SN 1994I,"
"SN 2005cs, and SN 2011dh) may not be remarkable in an absolute sense, it does place"
M51 among the top five galaxies within 10 Mpc in SN productivity. The only one of
"M51’s historical SNe detected in the images discussed here is the Type IIb SN 2011dh,"
"located in the galaxy’s outer spiral arm, ∼ 2.′6 SE of the nucleus. The declining SN is
shown in the [S II] and F689M images from 2012, over 10 months after the explosion"
"(Fig. 14, panels b and c). The progenitor candidate was first identified by Li et al."
"(2011b), and is discussed by Van Dyk et al. (2011). Fig. 14a shows the progenitor (or"
"more likely its brighter companion, see Van Dyk et al. 2011) in the 2005 data. By"
taking a difference image between the [S II] image and the F689M image from our 2012
"data (Fig. 14d), we see that the SN itself appears somewhat over-subtracted, while"
residuals from several stars remain visible. This indicates that no nebular emission
"(at least in the [S II] lines) had developed at the time these images were taken, 10"
months post-explosion. The late-time evolution of SN 2011dh is discussed in detail
by Maund (2019).
We have also examined the positions of the other three historical SNe. The Type I
"SN 1945A took place in M51B = NGC 5195, at a location only about ∼ 7′′ southwest
of the bright nucleus, with a large uncertainty in its position. Nothing stands out in"

"was located 18′′ SE from the nucleus of M51A, also in a crowded field. Fig. 15 shows"
the ACS images of this field; there is no evidence for nebulosity that might indicate
a remnant from SN 1994I .

"a continuum-subtracted Hα image (ACS F658N – WFC3 F689M), which shows two"
small nebulae just NE and SE of the SN position (also faintly visible in [S II] in the
central panel). These are present both before and after the SN event; there is no
apparent remnant from the SN itself.

4.5. Comparison with Other Spiral Galaxies
"In recent years, large populations of SNRs have been identified in numerous galaxies,"
"including M31 (Lee & Lee 2014a), M33 (Lee & Lee 2014a; Long et al. 2018), M81 (Lee"
"et al. 2015), M83 (Winkler et al. 2017), and NGC 6946 (Long et al. 2019). How does"
the population of SNRs in M51 compare with ones in many of these other galaxies?
"We show a plot of the cumulative size distribution, N(< D) as a function of the"
"diameter, D, for SNRs in M51, and for three other spiral galaxies with extensive"
"SNR samples, in Fig. 17. (Data sources are in the figure caption.) For M51, as for"
"M83 and NGC 6946, all the diameters have been measured from HST images.11 The"
"number-diameter distributions for SNRs in other galaxies are similar. For example,"
"Long (2017) shows number-diameter plots for several galaxies, including the SMC"
"11 For NGC 6946, data are from Tables 1 and 2 of Long et al. (2020). Virtually all diameters were
measured from HST images—Hα where available, but some objects were detected only in the [Fe II]
1.644 µm line so were measured on those images. A very few objects lay outside the HST footprint,
so those diameters were estimated from ground-based images."

M51 and for several other spiral galaxies. (For M51 we show both the complete sample
(Table 3) and those for which we have obtained spectra, to demonstrate that those with
spectra represent a fair subset of the entire sample.) For each of the galaxies, the heart
of the distribution, where there are a few dozen SNRs, has a slope consistent with Sedov
expansion (D(t) ∝ t2/5, so N(< D) ∝ D5/2 for a uniform SN rate). References: M83: Blair
et al. (2012, 2014); NGC 6946: Long et al. (2020); M33: Lee & Lee (2014b); Long et al.

and LMC (based on data from Badenes et al. 2010) and M31 (based on data from
Lee & Lee 2014a) that resemble those for the galaxies shown here.
"It is interesting to note that for all four galaxies in Fig. 17, that portion of the"
distributions with a few to a few tens of objects have slopes approximately consistent
"with Sedov expansion and a uniform average supernova rate, N(< D) ∝ D5/2; in
contrast, one expects N(< D) ∝ D for free expansion. In actuality, this result is
most likely due to a combination of selection effects rather than something physical."
SNRs in M51 25
The optical emission that we observe from (most) SNRs arises from relatively low
velocity (100 - 300 km s−1) radiative shocks propelled by the primary shock into dense
cloudlets in the ISM. Because the surface area of the primary shock increases with
"time, we generally expect the optical luminosity to increase with time as well, until"
the primary shock velocity drops to the point where it can no longer drive secondary
shocks into these cloudlets. We then expect the SNR (now in the so-called radiative
phase) to fade.
The maximum luminosity a SNR reaches—and importantly the radius at which it
"reaches maximum—depends on a variety of factors, including the average density"
"of the ISM, the number of cloudlets, and the energy of the SNR explosion. SNRs"
"expanding into dense media brighten, and eventually fade, at smaller radii than those"
"expanding into less dense material. At some level, the samples of SNRs that we have"
"observed in all of these galaxies is luminosity-limited at small diameters, and surface-"
"brightness-limited at large diameters. At the small-diameter end of the distribution,"
"we are unable to measure diameters of unresolved objects, which effectively sets a"
"lower limit at the point-spread function (PSF) of the detector used. Furthermore,"
SNRs with sizes on the order of the PSF are hard to pick out against stars (because
it is difficult to remove stars completely from narrow-band images). These two effects
"limit the low end of the distribution, and probably explain why the limits for M51"
and NGC 6946 are about twice that for the similar galaxy M83—since the former two
galaxies are at almost twice M83’s distance.
The number of SNRs in a galaxy should be proportional to the star formation rate
"(SFR), since about 75% of the SNe observed in external galaxies arise from the core-"
collapse explosion of massive stars whose main sequence lifetimes are short (Li et al.
"2011a), and since the ages of stellar populations that produce Type I SNe are also"
typically less than a Gyr (Maoz et al. 2010). The SFRs of the galaxies shown in
"Fig. 17 vary. According to Jarrett et al. (2013), the SFRs for M83, NGC6946, and"
"M51 are all similar: estimates range from 0.9-3.2 M� yr
−1, 1.4-3.2 M� yr"
"−1, and"
"1.3-3.5 M� yr
−1, respectively, depending on the wavelength band used to estimate"
the SFR.
"On the other hand, there have been four historical SNe in M51, whereas M83 and"
"NGC 6946 have hosted six and ten, respectively, suggesting that the SFRs in the"
"latter two galaxies are somewhat higher than in M51. For M33,12 the SFR is between"
"0.2-0.5 M� yr
−1. No SN has been observed historically in M33. Therefore, if all the"
"samples had equal luminosity sensitivity, we might expect there to be roughly equal"
"numbers of SNRs in M83, NGC6946, and M51, and far fewer in M33. In point of"
"fact, however, there are 300 SNRs (and candidates) in M83, 225 in NGC 6946, 179"
"in M51, and 217 in M33. The relatively large number of SNRs in M33 is clearly due"
"12 For M33, the SFR is variously estimated by Williams et al. (2018) to be 0.17±0.06 M� yr−1from a
multi-wavelength analysis to 0.25+0.10−0.07 M� yr"
"−1 using FUV and 24µ imaging to 0.33±0.10 M� yr−1
using SED fitting, whereas Verley et al. (2009) suggest 0.45 ± 0.10 M� yr−1 from a multi-wavelength
analysis."
26 Winkler et al.
to its proximity; SNRs exhibit a large range of luminosities at any diameter; and
"the various SNR samples are mainly flux-, not luminosity-limited. M51 is the most"
"distant galaxy in the sample (8.58 Mpc), compared to M83 at 4.6 Mpc (Saha et al."
2006) and NGC 6946 at 7.8 Mpc (Murphy et al. 2018; Anand et al. 2018). As a result
one would expect M51 to have somewhat fewer SNRs in a flux-limited sample.
The biggest difference in the samples is in the number of small-diameter SNRs. M51
"and NGC 6946 both have about 10 SNRs with diameters of 10 pc or less, whereas M83"
"has almost 100, and M33 has none. With a couple of exceptions, all of the small-"
diameter SNRs in these galaxies were identified on the basis of elevated [S II]:Hα
"ratios, not from properties that one would expect from a young, ejecta-dominated"
"SNR like Cas A. Also, the [S II]:Hα technique cannot find young Balmer-dominated"
SNRs that arise from SNIa. Therefore the most likely reason for this difference is
that the small-diameter SNRs that we do detect are ones expanding into locally
dense regions of the ISM. M83 is known to have very substantial diffuse soft X-ray
"emission, indicative of a hot, high pressure ISM throughout its spiral arms, which"
may account for the larger number of small diameter SNRs.
5. SUMMARY
We have used a combination of ground-based and space-based imagery to construct
"the first catalog of SNRs for M51, based on elevated [S II]:Hα line ratios compared"
to H II regions in the same images. Our list of candidates totals 179 objects. We
obtained GMOS spectra of 66 of the candidates (along with a number of H II regions);
"60 of the SNR candidates have measured [S II]:Hα ratios that exceed 0.4, the standard"
"value for declaring an emission nebula to be a SNR. Moreover, 51 of the candidates"
"show intrinsic [O I]λ6300, another line associated with radiative shocks, including one"
object with a [S II]:Hα ratio slightly below the 0.4 limit. This suggests not only that
"a high percentage of our SNR candidates (61 of 66) are actually SNRs, but also that"
the vast majority of other SNR candidates in our catalog are also likely to be bona
fide SNRs.
The SNRs/candidates in the sample are mostly distributed along the very prominent
spiral arms of M51. Nearly a third (55 of 179) of the SNRs/candidates are coincident
"with X-ray sources identified with Chandra (Kuntz et al. 2016), and most of these X-"
ray sources have the soft spectra normally seen in SNRs. A search at the positions of
other soft X-ray sources turned up another handful of possibly interesting candidates.
Only 16 of the SNRs/candidates are associated with with VLA radio sources cataloged
"by Maddox et al. (2007), and a search at the positions of additional objects they"
identified as likely SNRs shows interesting optical emission from two of those. The
median diameter of the SNRs in the sample is 24 pc; none of the SNRs for which we
have spectra shows evidence of the type of peculiar abundances or line broadening
expected from a young SNR in the free expansion phase such as Cas A in our Galaxy;
most are likely in the Sedov (or possibly radiative phase) of their evolution.
SNRs in M51 27
We have detected nebular emission from none of the four historical SNe that have
occurred in M51. But we do detect fading continuum from SN2011dh in HST images
taken ten months after that event.
The most surprising feature of the spectra of the SNRs in M51 is the behavior of
the [N II] lines relative to Hα. We see very high [N II]:Hα line ratios in many of
"them which, from an observational perspective, explains why the imaging [S II]:Hα"
line ratios for the SNR candidates were lower than typically seen in other galaxies.
"(That is, the Hα filters used passed significant [N II] emission as well, lowering the"
"observed ratio.) Additionally, the dispersion in [N II]:Hα between objects of similar"
size or similar galactocentric distance is very large. While both of these effects have
"been seen in other galaxies, they are more extreme (and hence more obvious) in M51"
and seem to be pointing toward something more fundamental.
The cause for such high ratios is hard to explain astrophysically. The highest
"[N II]:Hα ratios tend to appear in smaller diameter SNRs, or alternatively in objects"
"at relatively small galactocentric radius, but the large dispersion in values seems to"
indicate that neither of these parameters is a dominant effect. As far as the abun-
"dance of N is concerned, the [N II]:Hα ratios in M51 are higher on average than in"
"galaxies like M83, where the overall metallicity is significantly higher. Existing shock"
models with elevated abundances do not reproduce the observed [N II]:Hα ratios we
"see in M51 SNRs; furthermore, the [N II]:Hα ratios in M51 H II regions are not un-"
"usual and are nearly constant with galactocentric radius, as expected from the overall"
"metallicity. Hence, abundance variations do not provide an obvious explanation. Fur-"
ther spectroscopic studies and modeling of the SNRs in M51 are clearly warranted to
understand this conundrum.

"aThis object corresponds with ULX-1 reported by Urquhart et al. (2018); the object is
distinctly elongated and is likely a jet-like structure. The listed diameter corresponds to
the long dimension of the observed nebula."
"bThis object corresponds with source 5 in Terashima & Wilson (2004) and is likely also
source ULX-2 reported by Brightman et al. (2020); the listed coordinate in the latter
reference is off, but inspection of Chandra data shows the strong X-ray source near this
position actually aligns with W21-011."
