ABSTRACT
"The Large Survey Project (LSP) ""MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey"" (MALS) is a blind H i 21-cm and OH 18-cm absorption line
survey in the L- and UHF-bands, with the primary goal to better determine the occurrence of atomic and molecular gas in the circum-
galactic and inter-galactic medium, and its redshift evolution. Here we present the first results using the UHF-band, obtained towards
the strongly lensed radio source PKS 1830−211, detecting absorption produced by the lensing galaxy. With merely 90 mins of data
acquired on-source for science verification and processed using the Automated Radio Telescope Imaging Pipeline (ARTIP), we detect
in absorption the known H i 21-cm and OH 18-cm main lines at z = 0.89 at an unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio (4000 in the
continuum, in each 6 km s−1 wide channel). For the first time we report the detection at z = 0.89 of OH satellite lines, so far not
detected at z > 0.25. We decompose the OH lines into a thermal and a stimulated contribution, where the 1612 and 1720 MHz lines
are conjugate. The total OH 1720 MHz emission line luminosity is 6100 L�. This is the most luminous known 1720 MHz maser line.
It is also among the highest luminosities for the OH-main lines megamasers. The absorption components of the different images of the
background source sample different light paths in the lensing galaxy, and their weights in the total absorption spectrum are expected
to vary in time, on daily and monthly time scales. We compare our normalized spectra with those obtained more than 20 yrs ago, and
find no variation, in spite of the high signal-to-noise ratios. We interpret the absorption spectra with the help of a lens galaxy model,
derived from an N-body hydro-dynamical simulation, with a morphology similar to its optical HST image. The resulting absorption
lines depend mainly on the background continuum, and the radial distribution of the gas surface density, for each atomic /molecular
species. We show that it is possible to reproduce the observations assuming a realistic spiral galaxy disk, without invoking any central
gas outflows. There are, however, distinct and faint high-velocity features in the ALMA millimeter absorption spectra, that most likely
originate from high-velocity clouds or tidal features. These clouds may contribute to broaden the H i and OH spectra."

1. Introduction
"PKS 1830−211 is a highly reddened radio quasar at z=2.51 (Lid-
man et al. 1999), and also the brightest known radio lens in the
sky. It was identified as a gravitational lens on the basis of its
peculiar radio spectrum and morphology (Pramesh Rao & Sub-
rahmanyan 1988; Jauncey et al. 1991). Its morphology (see the
Appendix) reveals two compact radio components, called North-
East (NE) and South-West (SW), separated by one arcsecond
and surrounded by a low surface-brightness Einstein ring, mean-
ing that the background radio-source and the lens center are well
aligned along the line of sight. The two compact components
have a relatively flat spectrum, with a spectral index ∼ −0.7
consistent with synchrotron emission, while the ring spectrum
is steeper, such that at low frequency (< 1.7 GHz) the ring is
contributing more significantly to the total flux density. Since,
in projection the line of sight of PKS 1830−211 is very close
to the Galactic plane (galactic latitude = −5.71◦), and confused
with stars, for a long time it was difficult to optically identify the
lensing galaxy (Courbin et al. 1998). The redshift z = 0.89 of
the lensing galaxy was discovered through molecular absorption
(Wiklind & Combes 1996), and it was determined that most of
this absorption comes from the SW image, ∼ 3 kpc from the cen-
ter (Frye et al. 1997). There is also a much weaker molecular ab-
sorption at V=−150 km s−1 towards the NE image, in the oppo-
site direction at 5 kpc from the center of the nearly face-on lens-
ing galaxy (Wiklind & Combes 1998; Koopmans & de Bruyn
2005). Throughout this paper, the velocity scale is defined with
respect to z = 0.88582 (heliocentric reference frame), which cor-
responds to the main molecular (e.g., CO, HCO+, and HCN) ab-
sorption components detected at mm wavelengths (Wiklind &
Combes 1998)."
"The apparent size of the lensed images of the quasar at mm
wavelengths is a fraction of a milliarcsecond (Jin et al. 2003;
Guirado et al. 1999), implying that the molecular absorption
could be originating from a single molecular cloud of a few pc
in size. However, due to the thickness of the gaseous plane along
the line of sight, the pencil beam from the quasar core travels
several hundreds of pc in the galaxy, and encounters many clouds
along the line of sight, covering a large velocity gradient. This
broadens the absorption spectrum because the gas actually in-
volved in the absorption traces the velocity gradient over ∼ 1 kpc
in the disk. H i 21-cm and OH 18-cm main absorption lines have
also been detected at z = 0.89 (Chengalur et al. 1999; Koopmans
& de Bruyn 2005)."
"It is worth noting that PKS 1830−211 also traces an H i 21-
cm absorber at z = 0.19 (Lovell et al. 1996; Allison et al. 2017),
albeit with a smaller velocity width. The 90% of the total 21-cm
optical depth (∆V90) of the low redshift absorber is contained
within 86 km s−1 (Gupta et al. 2021)."
"The absorber at z = 0.89 is particularly rich in molecules
and also in dust. A strong absorption at rest-frame 10µm reveals
amorphous or crystalline silicates (Aller et al. 2012). More than
sixty molecular species associated with this absorber have been
detected towards the SW component, where the inferred H2 col-
umn density is ∼ 2×1022 cm−2 (Muller et al. 2011, 2014; Tercero
et al. 2020). In contrast, only 19 species, including atomic hydro-
gen and carbon, have been detected towards the NE component
(at 5 kpc from the center), where the molecular gas has a lower
column density by an order of magnitude and is more diffuse. On
the contrary, at 18-21 cm wavelengths, it is the NE component
which has the stronger absorption signal (Chengalur et al. 1999;
Koopmans & de Bruyn 2005). The absorption spectrum peaks
at V = −150 km s−1, and is relatively weaker at ∼ 0 km s−1."
"This suggests that, towards the center of the lensing galaxy (SW
at 3 kpc), the gas phase is mostly molecular and the H i is de-
pleted. Compared to the mm-absorptions, the broader linewidths
of ∼ 280 km s−1 and ∼ 150 km s−1 (FWHM) for H i and OH cm-
absorption, respectively, at z = 0.89 are explained by the larger
thickness of the H i or OH plane, and to some extent by the more
extended background radio continuum at lower frequencies."
"Such a strong lens system should be useful to determine
the Hubble constant, through the cosmography method or time-
delay between the images. However, it is then necessary to pre-
cisely determine the mass distribution of the lens, which has
been difficult, because of extinction and confusion with Milky
Way stars (Courbin et al. 2002; Winn et al. 2002). Even the deter-
mination of the center of the lensing galaxy is problematic, and
two models have been developed, with a bright peak at the center
of the lens being a nearby star (Courbin et al. 2002) or the bulge
of the lensing galaxy (Winn et al. 2002). The detection of several
absorption components at different velocities, towards the differ-
ent images helps to determine the geometry of the lens, which
is a nearly face-on spiral galaxy (Wiklind & Combes 1998). Re-
cently, the detection of a third lensed image of PKS 1830−211
with ALMA by Muller et al. (2020) has brought more constraints
leading to the refinement of the lens model."
"Due to its very strong radio continuum and absorption lines,
PKS 1830−211 is also one of the favorite targets for science veri-
fication at various radio telescopes. Very recently it was observed
as part of the preparation for the MeerKAT Absorption Line
Survey (MALS) to demonstrate the spectral line capabilities of
MeerKAT. MALS has begun MeerKAT science verification and
proper survey observations using the L- and UHF-bands cov-
ering 900-1670 MHz and 580-1015 MHz, respectively (Gupta
et al. 2017). Owing to the excellent sensitivity of MeerKAT
(Jonas & MeerKAT Team 2016; Camilo et al. 2018; Mauch
et al. 2020), the L-band spectrum of PKS 1830−211 presented
in Gupta et al. (2021) provided a robust characterization of H i
21-cm (from z = 0.19) and OH 18-cm main absorption lines
from z = 0.89. Here, we present the first MeerKAT UHF-band
spectrum that simultaneously covers both H i and all four OH
18-cm lines for the z = 0.89 system. We report for the first time
the detection of the OH satellite lines."
"This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the
details of the observations and data analysis with ARTIP. The
results in terms of optical depths and column densities are quan-
tified in Section 3, where we discuss the origin of the various
absorption components in comparison with the dense molecu-
lar gas absorptions, and present a lens-galaxy model. Section 4
summarises our conclusions. To compute distances, we adopt
a flat ΛCDM cosmology, with Ωm=0.29, ΩΛ=0.71, and the
Hubble constant H0 = 70 km s−1Mpc−1. At the distance of the
PKS 1830−211 absorber, an arcsecond corresponds to 7.8 kpc,
in physical units."
2. Observations and data analysis
"The field centered at PKS 1830−211 was observed on July
13, 2020 using the MeerKAT-64 array and 32K mode of the
SKA Reconfigurable Application Board (SKARAB) correla-
tor. For these UHF-band science verification observations, the
total observable bandwidth of 544 MHz was split into 32768
frequency channels. This corresponds to a frequency resolu-
tion of 16.602 kHz, or 6.1 km s−1 at the center of the band i.e.,
815.9917 MHz. The correlator dump time was 8 seconds and the
data were acquired for all 4 polarization products, labelled as
XX, XY, YX and YY. Of the 64 antennas, 56 participated in these"
"Article number, page 2 of 13"
F. Combes et al.: PKS 1830−211: OH and H i at z = 0.89 and the first MeerKAT UHF spectrum
"observations. The baseline lengths in the dataset are in the range:
29 - 7300 m. We also observed PKS 1934-638 and 3C286 for
flux density and bandpass calibrations. Since PKS 1830−211 is a
bonafide gain calibrator for the VLA in the C- and D- array con-
figurations, there was no need to separately observe a complex
gain calibrator. The total on-source time on PKS 1830−211 and
duration of the observations are 90 and 155 mins, respectively.
The full dataset in measurement set format is about 3.1 TB."
"Here we are interested only in the Stokes-I properties of the
target, therefore for processing we generated a measurement set
consisting of only XX and YY polarization products. We also
dropped the extreme 1024 frequency channels at both edges of
the band. The resulting data set consisting of 30720 channels,
was processed on the VROOM cluster at IUCAA using the lat-
est version of the Automated Radio Telescope Imaging Pipeline
ARTIP based on CASA 5.6.2. The details of ARTIP and data
processing steps are provided in Gupta et al. (2021). In short, an
initial RFI mask was applied to the data to mask the strongest
radio frequency interference (RFI) in the band. Up to this stage,
only ∼10.0% of the bandwidth gets flagged. After this step, the
data were further flagged and calibrated using the ARTIP-CAL
package. The spectral-line processing of calibrated visibilities
was done using the ARTIP-CUBE package. The final continuum-
subtracted spectrum of PKS 1830−211 is shown in Fig. 1. The
gray-shaded regions in the figure mark the above-mentioned ini-
tial RFI mask. For the ARTIP-CUBE processing, the frequency
band was partitioned into 15 spectral windows (SPW) with an
overlap of 256 frequency channels. The unique frequency ranges
covered by these measurement sets are marked by dashed verti-
cal lines in Fig. 1. For easier referencing, we refer to these as
SPW-0 to -14."
"Recall that prior to any flagging and calibrations the 935 -
960 MHz range was flagged to mask persistent strong RFI. How-
ever, the spectral line processing revealed some additional RFI.
Specifically, we find the following frequency ranges to be per-
sistently affected by RFI: 759.1 - 759.2, 798.6 - 798.9, 925.1
- 925.3, 965.5 - 965.6, 1028.8 - 1030.9, 1040.3 - 1041.8 and
1062.9 - 1065.0 MHz (see hatched regions in Fig. 1). We also
find a few frequency ranges to be affected by sporadic RFI.
These are at 735.275, 765.28, 896.6, 899.294 - 899.404 and
928.0 - 935.0 MHz, and often accompanied by positive / neg-
ative spikes in the spectra. The spike at ∼839 MHz is caused
by the known H i 21-cm absorption line in the spectrum of the
bandpass calibrator (3C286; Wolfe et al. 2008). Nevertheless, as
shown in Fig. 1 the UHF spectrum is spectacularly clean, and
we detect the known H i 21-cm and OH 18-cm main lines at
z = 0.89. Due to the excellent sensitivity, the MeerKAT spec-
trum has also led to the detection of OH satellite lines (further
details in Section 3)."
"For continuum imaging through the ARTIP-CONT package,
a more stringent RFI mask to completely exclude band edges
and RFI-afflicted regions was applied to the calibrated visi-
bilities (see horizontal dotted lines in Fig. 1). The data were
then averaged in frequency over 32 channels (∼0.531 MHz)
and regridded along the frequency axis into 16 distinct spec-
tral windows. We created a widefield broad band 6k×6k con-
tinuum image with a pixel size of 3′′, spanning ∼ 5◦ using
tclean in CASA. The w-projection algorithm was used
as the gridding algorithm in combination with Multi-scale
Multi-term Multi-frequency synthesis (MTMFS) for de-
convolution, with nterms = 2 and four pixel scales to model the
extended emission (cf. Rau & Cornwell 2011; Bhatnagar et al.
2013; Jagannathan et al. 2017). Two rounds of phase-only self-
calibration were carried out along with a final round of ampli-"
"tude and phase self-calibration. Imaging masks were appropri-
ately adjusted using PyBDSF between major cycles during imag-
ing and self-calibration (Mohan & Rafferty 2015)."
"The final continuum image of PKS 1830−211 constructed
using robust=0 weighting has a synthesized beam of 17.4′′ ×
13.1′′ with a position angle = +69.0◦. The rms noise in the con-
tinuum image is 80 µJy/beam close to the bright radio source
at the center and 30 µJy/beam (dynamic range ∼380000) away
from it. The total continuum flux density of the quasar is 11.40
± 0.01 Jy at the reference frequency of 832 MHz. The quoted un-
certainty on the flux density corresponds to errors from the single
Gaussian component fitted to the continuum image. Note that the
flux density accuracy at these low frequencies is expected to be
about ∼5%. The flux density at 832 MHz is within 1.3% of the
flux density of 11.25 Jy measured at 1270 MHz by Gupta et al.
(2021) from the MeerKAT L-band data acquired on December
19, 2019. However, note that in general the quasar is known to
be variable at radio wavelengths1. The in-band integrated spec-
tral index is α = 0.004 ±0.001."
3. Results
3.1. OH absorption
"The OH main lines with rest frequencies of 1665 and 1667 MHz
are clearly seen in the first MeerKAT UHF-band spectrum (580-
1015 MHz) presented here (see Fig. 1). We zoom in on these
in the top two panels of Fig. 2. These lines were also detected
in the overlapping L-band (900-1670 MHz) spectrum obtained
with MeerKAT on December 19, 2019 (Gupta et al. 2021).
The absorption obtained from the first UHF spectrum presented
here is in good agreement with the L-band profile (see Sec-
tion 3.3 for details on variability). In our L-band observations,
the 1720 MHz line redshifted to 912 MHz was also covered but
only tentatively detected due to low-SNR and hence not claimed.
The redshifted 1612 MHz line was outside the L-band. With the
present UHF-spectrum, we have clearly detected the 1612 MHz
line (redshifted to 855 MHz). Combining the L- and the UHF-
band spectra with appropriate rms weights, we now also detect
the 1720 MHz line at a greater significance. Recall that the red-
shifted satellite line frequencies are unaffected by RFI (see Sec-
tion 2). The profiles of the two satellite lines are presented in the
bottom two panels of the figure."
"This is the first time the OH satellite lines have been detected
towards PKS 1830−211. This is also the highest redshift so far
at which the OH satellite lines have been detected. The detection
of all four OH 18-cm lines from the same spectrum allows us
to investigate the nature of the absorbing gas without worrying
about the line variability. Further, due to the proximity of the 18-
cm lines in the frequency space the structure of the background
radio continuum illuminating the absorbing gas can be assumed
to be the same."
"The integrated optical depths of the main i.e., 1665 and
1667 MHz lines are 0.729± 0.012 and 1.301± 0.013 km s−1,
respectively. 90% of the total optical depth (∆V90) of the
1667 MHz line is contained within 265 km s−1. For an optically
thin cloud, the integrated OH optical depth of the 1667 MHz line
is related to the OH column density N(OH) through"

solid line in panel (c) represents the absorption profile predicted under LTE due to M1, M2 and M3. The difference between the red and black solid
lines represent the maser contribution due to pumping, and is conjugate with the 1720 MHz line in (d): at V=-170 km s−1, the 1720 MHz line is in
emission and 1612 MHz in absorption, while at V=-80 km s−1, the 1720 MHz is in absorption, and the 1612 MHz in emission. In all the panels, the
total fit and the residuals, arbitrarily offset for clarity, are plotted as solid lines in red and magenta, respectively."
"tical depths of the main lines are remarkably consistent with the
LTE ratio. To explore this further, we model the two main lines
using multiple Gaussian components. Assuming that these lines
originate from the same gas, we tie the centers and widths of the
corresponding components. The overall profiles are reasonably
modeled by a three-component fit (reduced χ2 ∼ 1.1), which is
summarized in Table 1. The individual components marked as
M1, M2 and M3, and the resultant fit along with the residuals are
plotted in Fig. 2 (see panels (a) and (b)). Unsurprisingly, the total
absorption in components M2 and M3 which account for ∼98%
of the total optical depth is consistent with the LTE ratio. The
component M1 is weak and it is difficult to probe its excitation
character. Note that the excitation temperature of the 1.6 GHz"
"OH transitions could be quite different from TCMB, especially in
the case of far-infrared and/or collisional pumping (see below),
and our assumption is conservative, although supported by the
LTE ratios of the main lines."
"If the OH ground state levels are indeed thermalized, the gas
producing 1667 MHz absorption will have 9 times weaker opac-
ity at the 1612 MHz line velocities. The absorption profile for
the 1612 MHz line based on M1 to M3 is represented by solid
(black) lines in Fig. 2 (panel (c)). Clearly, the gas that produces
absorption in the main lines can only account for 61% of the
absorption in the satellite line. The remaining excess absorption
can be modelled using two components S1 and S2 given in Ta-
ble 1. It appears that the satellite lines have a large contribution"

"due to pumping that leads to non-thermal and possibly even in-
verted level populations. Comparing the two satellite lines, it is
clear also that the non-thermal part of the 1612 MHz line has a
deficiency of absorption near -80 km s−1, due to emission (see
bottom of Fig. 2)."
"Under certain excitation conditions, in particular pumping
from far-infrared radiation around 119µm, the OH levels of the
ground state (i.e. 2Π3/2) can be inverted. In particular the upper
level of the 1720 MHz transition can be highly populated (as the
1612 MHz transition’s lower level), triggering maser emission.
Then the satellite OH lines can exhibit ""conjugate"" behaviour
i.e., as mentioned above the gas exhibiting absorption in one line
produces emission in the other. This peculiar feature of the OH
levels due to lambda-doubling and hyperfine structure is a pre-
cious tool for probing fundamental physical constants (Darling
2003; Chengalur & Kanekar 2003; Kanekar et al. 2018). De-
spite the limited SNR, the 1720 MHz profile presented in the
bottom panel of Fig. 2 shows both emission and absorption fea-
tures suggesting such a behavior. When the two satellite lines are
perfectly conjugate, the sum of their optical depths is zero. The
solid red line in the bottom panel of Fig. 2 corresponds to the
sum of (i) absorption due to M1, M2 and M3 under LTE, and (ii)
absorption due to S 1 and S 2 assuming perfect conjugate behav-
ior. This simple model provides a reasonable representation of
the observed 1720 MHz profile."
"Note that the redshifted 1720 MHz line frequency is covered
in both the L- and UHF-bands of MeerKAT. Indeed, the spectral
features seen in panel (d) of Fig. 2 are also present in our L-band
dataset (Gupta et al. 2021). The 1720 MHz profile presented here
is already the weighted average of the spectra from the L-band
data described in Gupta et al. (2021) and the present UHF-band
data. Further investigation into the nature of the satellite lines
and the perfection of the conjugate behavior will require a more
sensitive spectrum."
"However, already the 1720 MHz line profile suggests that the
conjugate behavior flips across at approximately -100 km s−1,
i.e., at velocities <-100 km s−1 it shows emission and at higher
velocities absorption. Such flipping has been observed in both
galactic and extragalactic systems (see e.g., cases of Centaurus
A and NGC 253; van Langevelde et al. 1995; Frayer et al. 1998).
The flipping crucially depends on whether the OH molecules are
pumped by the rotational intra-ladder transition at 119 µm, in
which case the 1720 MHz line shows emission and 1612 MHz"

in which case the opposite happens (see Elitzur 1976, espe-
cially Fig. 1). Since, as explained in Frayer et al. (1998), the
intra-ladder transition becomes optically thick much sooner
(N(OH)/∆V ≈ 1014 cm−2 km−1 s) than the cross-ladder transi-
tion (N(OH)/∆V ≈ 1015 cm−2 km−1 s), the observed behavior for
PKS 1830−211 implies that the gas exhibiting conjugate behav-
ior at velocities > −100 km s−1 has higher OH column density
than at < −100 km s−1. Notably, we do not see any significant
masing features in 1720 MHz line at velocities > −50 km s−1 i.e.,
closer to the center of the lensing galaxy where denser gas trac-
ers such as CO(5-4) or HCO+(2-1) lines towards the SW image
have been detected (Muller et al. 2014)."
"Finally, the emission component at −170 km s−1, which is
barely detected at 3σ in the 1720 MHz line, has a total line
flux density of 0.037±0.011 Jy km s−1. At z = 0.89, this corre-
sponds to an enormous line luminosity of ∼6100 L�, which is
∼20 times more luminous than the previously brightest known
1720 MHz maser associated with PKS 1413+135 at z = 0.247
(Kanekar et al. 2004; Darling 2004). In the latter source, the
OH-main lines are detected in absorption, but not at the same ve-
locity as the satellite lines, therefore originating from a different
gas component. It is interesting to note that the OH-main lines
absorption was not detected at the same time either. Kanekar
et al. (2004) observed the satellite lines in June 2003 with the
WSRT (Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope), and the main
lines in October 2001 with the GMRT (Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope). Darling (2004) observed all four lines in December
2003 with the NRAO Green Bank telescope, but did not detect
the main lines, indicating a strong variability. We note that the
for PKS 1830−211, the 1720 MHz line luminosity is among the
highest luminosities of all OH-main line megamasers (Darling
& Giovanelli 2002)."

sian components, and dashed lines mark the velocity range over which

"earlier reported 21-cm absorption profiles, which are presented
in Figs. 4 of Section 3.3, a two-component Gaussian decomposi-
tion provided a reasonable fit. However, the high signal-to-noise
ratio of the MeerKAT spectrum requires at least five Gaussian
components (A1 to A5; reduced χ2 ∼1.3) as presented in Table 2
and Fig. 3. The remaining structure in the residuals is at the level
of τ ≤ 0.0014. It does not necessarily represent discrete physi-
cal structures. Therefore, we do not attempt to improve the fit by
adding more components."
"Further, since the Gaussian components obtained above do
not necessarily represent individual physical structures, we can
also utilize the velocity components previously used to model
the OH lines. But this exercise requires more components be-
cause there is an additional spectral feature present in the blue
wing of H i 21-cm absorption (see vertical dashed lines in Fig. 3).
A rather remarkable result which can be obtained without any
component-wise comparison is that the average [OH/HI] column
density ratio ∼ 8 × 10−7 is slightly higher than the typical ra-
tio (∼ 10−7) observed in the Galaxy (Li et al. 2018), and also
in extra-galactic absorbers (Kanekar & Chengalur 2002; Gupta
et al. 2018a). For PKS 1830−211 this may be primarily due to
the fact that the absorption at ∼0 km s−1 i.e., towards the SW
component originates from gas which is primarily molecular. In
Section 3.3 we will provide evidence indicating that all these
values are in perfect agreement with previous results, obtained
more than 20 years ago (Chengalur et al. 1999; Koopmans & de
Bruyn 2005)."
3.3. Time variability
"The continuum flux from the background blazar at z = 2.507 is
significantly varying in time, by factors up to 10 in gamma-rays
and 2 at radio wavelengths (e.g., Lovell et al. 1998; Martí-Vidal"
"et al. 2013). These variations are seen in all three lensed compo-
nents i.e. NE, SW, and ring with time-delays. In X-rays, Oshima
et al. (2001) show that the NE/SW flux ratio varies by factors
as high as 7, invoking possible micro-lensing effects. While the
NE and SW components are images of the blazar core, the ring
is mainly due to the jet and a bright knot in the jet (e.g., Jin
et al. 2003), and there is an observed jet precession period of
one year (Nair et al. 2005). The delay between the two com-
pact (NE and SW) radio components has been measured to be
27 days (e.g., Lovell et al. 1998; Wiklind & Combes 2001; Bar-
nacka et al. 2011). Barnacka et al. (2015) have observed several
gamma-ray flares with Fermi-LAT and derived gamma-ray time
delays of 23±0.5 days and 19.7±1.2 days, which might be con-
sistent with the radio time delay; however this has been debated
(see a reanalysis by Abdo et al. 2015). With VLBA observations
at 4 GHz, during a period of 44 days Garrett et al. (1997) found
highly variable sub-milliarcsecond radio structures in the cores
of both lensed images. It is therefore expected that the variations
of the different continuum components will be reflected in the
shape of the H i and OH absorption lines through time variabil-
ity."
"We have compared all available H i and OH spectra from
1996 with the present MeerKAT ones. In Fig. 4, we show the
comparison between all H i spectra. It is striking to see that they
are all compatible, especially the last ones with high signal-to-
noise ratio. No time variation is visible in the line, while the
continuum varied by 40%. The MeerKAT spectrum has a 5-6
times higher signal-to-noise ratio than the old WSRT data by
Koopmans & de Bruyn (2005). The slight differences can there-
fore be completely attributed to the higher noise in the latter. The
SNR in the WSRT spectrum is 35 at the peak of the absorption,
in channels of 7.9 km s−1. The absorption peaks at 5% of the
continuum, and the SNR on the continuum is 700. The average
ASKAP spectrum has an SNR∼1000 for the continuum, and 50
for the line in channels of 7.3 km s−1, and this is the limiting
factor in the comparison with our MeerKAT spectrum. There is
a slight difference around V=-60 km s−1and V=-150km s−1, of
max amplitude of 1.5×10−3 normalised to the continuum in one
channel, and a smaller difference in the two neighboring chan-
nels. But after averaging this leads to a difference significant
only at the 1.7σ level. Similarly, the OH spectra also show no
variation. The comparison between the MeerKAT OH-main line
spectra from December 19, 2019 (Gupta et al. 2021) and July 13,
2020 (this paper) sets a limit of ∆τ3σ < 0.0008."
"This lack of variation at cm-wavelength contrasts with the
variations detected in the mm-wave absorption spectra (Muller
& Guélin 2008; Muller et al. 2014). We can interpret the above-
mentioned constancy at cm-wavelengths with several arguments:
first, given the wider extent of the continuum emission at cm-
wavelengths, especially in the Einstein ring, the absorbing re-
gions are much larger, whereas the continuum at mm-wavelength
consists mainly of two point sources; second, the absorbing
medium in the H i component is more diffuse and less frag-
mented in the dense clouds (Srianand et al. 2013; Gupta et al.
2018b), such that the motion of possible plasmons (knots) in the
background jet will not produce large variations in the absorp-
tion signal. Another factor is the height of the gas plane, which
is likely much smaller in the dense molecular phase than in the
atomic phase. The H i plane in spiral galaxies is quite thick, up
to 1 kpc or more in the flaring outer parts (Burton 1976; Olling
1996). This means that the region illuminated by a point source
will range up to ∼ 1 kpc, crossing the inclined plane, as discussed
in Sec. 3.4. Therefore, the H i absorption spectrum gets blurred
over a size of 0.1′′, the beam size of some cm-continuum emis-"

Fig. A.1). If the gas surface filling factor is relatively high, all
sub-clumps over these regions are averaged out, washing out
any spatial variation of the order of 0.2 mas. In addition, due
to opacity effects, the cm and mm continuum radiation does not
originate from the same volumes: the mm observations probe
deeper inside the jet, and hence probably more active regions of
the background source."
3.4. Kinematic model of the spectra
"Nair et al. (1993) proposed a detailed model for the lensing
galaxy: they suggest it to be a spiral galaxy centered 0.3′′NE
of the SW image, of mass 1011 M� (rotational velocity ∼
260 km s−1), of low eccentricity i.e., nearly face-on, and with
a position angle ∼ 12◦. The discovery of molecular absorption
confirmed that it should be gas rich, and the velocity differ-"
"Fig. 5. Galaxy model adopted from an N-body simulation snapshot:
Left: the gas surface density, projected on the sky with an inclina-
tion of 26◦ and PA=15◦, and Right: the corresponding gas isoveloc-
ity curves, separated by 24.3 km/s, and ranging from -109.4 km s−1to
+109.4 km s−1. The locations of NE image (A), SW image (B) and 3rd
central image (C), close to the lensing-galaxy center, are indicated, to-
gether with the schematic contours of the Einstein ring, conspicuous at
cm wavelength."
"ence between NE and SW images (150 km s−1) constrained its
geometry (Wiklind & Combes 1998). Koopmans & de Bruyn
(2005) made a kinematic model, taking into account the red-
shift of the source (Lidman et al. 1999) and more information
about the lens image from Courbin et al. (2002) and Winn et al.
(2002). They concluded that the lens is inclined by i=17-32◦ on
the sky, with a PA between −15 and 34◦. The model also depends
on the velocity width of each absorbing component. Strikingly,
the absorption in front of the SW image is rather broad, even
relatively in the molecular gas. This could originate from non-
circular motions since this region of the lensing galaxy is closer
to the center (much closer than the NE image, where the line
width is smaller). Even if the background core of the blazar is a
point source in the mm regime, the region involved in the lensing
galaxy has an extension of h× tan(i), where h is the thickness of
the plane, and i the inclination of the galaxy. The broadening of
the line can therefore be caused by the velocity gradient in this
zone."
"One of the main uncertainties in the models of Koopmans &
de Bruyn (2005) is the position of the center of the lens. Now
that a third image, which was postulated by Nair et al. (1993)
in the cm-wave radio images, has been detected with ALMA by
Muller et al. (2020), the position of the lens is a fixed parameter
(very close to the third image position). Thus, it appears that the
bright spot towards the center is indeed a star and not the bulge
of the lens galaxy, as proposed by Courbin et al. (2002). Koop-
mans & de Bruyn (2005) found six best fit models, as a function
of six positions of the lens center. Now we know that only one
of these is close to reality, the one where their coordinates of the
lens center with respect to the NE image (or the distance AC in
Fig. 5) are (0.5′′W, 0.45′′S). Their result was then an inclination
of i=32◦ for the lens plane and PA=-15◦. In the following we
fix i=26◦ and PA=15◦ to better fit the HST morphology of the
lensing galaxy. The difference of inclination may explain why
Koopmans & de Bruyn (2005) selected a velocity dispersion of
39 km s−1for the H i spectrum, while we need 45 km s−1(see be-
low)."

"spiral galaxy, with quite a small bulge. Therefore it is a rela-
tively late-type galaxy. To model the lens, we select a snapshot
from an N-body simulation, following the development of a bar
and spiral arms, in a late-type object, described with stellar, gas
and dark matter components, appropriately treating star forma-
tion and feedback. We chose the snapshot to have a morphology
very similar to the HST image. The initial galaxy is a gSb model,
described in Combes (2008) and Chilingarian et al. (2010). We
project the model on the sky with an inclination of 26◦ and a PA
of 15◦, which are compatible with the above determinations. The
resultant gas surface density and the velocity field are plotted in
Fig. 5."
"The 5 GHz image obtained using MERLIN (Multi-Element
Radio Linked Interferometer Network) is among the best cm-
wavelength continuum image of the radio source (Patnaik et al.
1993). Although the redshifted H i and OH line frequencies (750-
900 MHz) are much lower, we used this high-resolution map
with a synthesized beam of 0.1 arcsec as the base radio contin-
uum model. Fortunately, the spectral index is not very steep be-
tween 400 MHz and 5 GHz (see multiple measurements between
4.8 GHz and 408 MHz with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array i.e., ATCA and the Parkes telescope, in the NASA/IPAC
Extragalactic Database i.e., NED and Section 2), at least for the
main images, although it could be steeper for the Einstein ring.
We will also compare the absorption spectra obtained at low fre-
quencies with those in the millimeter domain, where the extent
of continuum emission is very different due to the weaker Ein-
stein ring component. The three compact images of the back-
ground quasar are also detected with ALMA with a beam of
0.056 arcsec (Muller et al. 2020). The adopted continuum maps
for our cm- and mm-wave models are presented in the Appendix
(Fig. A.1)."
3.4.2. Computations of absorption maps and spectra
"To reproduce the observations with the above continuum models,
we built data cubes by projecting the models on the sky, with the
fixed inclination and position angles, multiplying at each spatial
pixel the gas surface density with the background continuum,
and thereby computing the line-of-sight velocity distribution.
We select the same spatial pixel sizes as the continuum maps
i.e., 0.028 arcsec for the cm-wave, and 0.014 arcsec for the mm
one (see Fig. A.1). The adopted spectral channels are of width
6.25 km s−1, for both."
"The main parameters to vary are related to the radial distri-
bution of the various atomic and molecular species considered
in the absorption maps and the spectra. The H i distribution is
well known to be depleted at the center of spiral galaxies. There
are some extreme examples, such as NGC 628, IC 342, M83,
M101 or NGC 7331, with a central H2/H i surface density ratio
of ∼100 as can be seen in the THINGS H i (Walter et al. 2008)
and the Heracles CO surveys (Leroy et al. 2009). Some of these
radial distributions are computed in Casasola et al. (2017). We
therefore selected an H i radial distribution depleted at the cen-
ter, such that it gives more absorption weight to the NE(A) image
with respect to the SW(B) image. Indeed, the distance of A from
the center of the lensing galaxy is 5.3 kpc, while B is only at
2.4 kpc from the center (see also Sec. 1). The contribution to the
absorption spectrum from B is towards the V=0 km s−1 compo-
nent while A is contributing to the V=−150 km s−1 component.
The third image C and the average of the Einstein ring at cm-
wavelengths have a continuum contribution of the order of 1%
of the flux density of A or B. Recall that the flux densities of A
and B are comparable."
"For the H i component, we selected a power-law radial dis-
tribution, as f = (r/r0)γ, with a normalizing scale r0=3.89 kpc,
equal to the Einstein ring radius. The gas surface density of the
galaxy model was multiplied by this factor f, keeping the un-
derlying bar/spiral structure as shown in Fig. 5. Different radial
distributions will lead to different shapes of the total absorption
spectrum and in particular different ratios between the two main
velocity components. The best fit was obtained with γ = 2.5,
which is very similar to the distributions selected by Koopmans
& de Bruyn (2005)."
"The velocity widths of H i components are due to two factors:
first the intrinsic gas dispersion, and second the averages of all
gas rotational velocities in the plane of the lens, seen along the
line of sight towards the continuum emission. The strongest con-
tinuum sources are the images of the background quasar core,
and their angular sizes are quite small (∼mas), in fact smaller
than the synthesized beam sizes. However, the line of sight to-
wards these core images traverses the inclined lens galaxy plane
(i = 26◦), which has a thickness h. Consequently, regions along
h× tan(i)∼ 0.5× h are illuminated on the plane, with the corre-
sponding velocity gradient. The width of the spectrum can there-
fore include velocity gradients over 0.1 arcsec, which is the res-
olution of the MERLIN continuum map. Hence, there is no need
to deconvolve the continuum map for the model. Once the ve-
locity gradients are taken into account, the simulated H i com-
ponents are still too narrow, and it is necessary to add a velocity
dispersion of σv = 45 km s−1. This might be due to extra-planar
H i gas, frequently observed in nearby spiral galaxies in a few-
kpc thick layer, with lagging rotational velocity, and equivalent
dispersion up to 30 km s−1 (Marasco et al. 2019)."
"We also performed a similar computation for the OH 18-cm
main lines, in particular the stronger 1667 MHz line, but with a
more centrally-concentrated radial distribution, using a power-
law index γ = 0.7. Although the OH does not suffer from the
H i depletion towards the center (indeed, there is nothing like the
phase change from H i to H2 at high density), the OH radical
is still distributed in a thick plane like the HI, a plane which is
flaring with radius, and hence increases the velocity coverage
of the absorption. This motivates the choice of σv = 45 km s−1
for OH as well and suggests that the OH might also be sharing
the extra-planar H i layer. The resulting 2D maps and the spectra
are shown in Figs. 6 and 8. The 2D maps indicate in particular
the relative contributions of the various continuum regions in the
absorption spectra."
"Most of the absorption is coming from the lines of sight to-
wards the core of the background source. To test the influence
of the Einstein ring, whose flux could be relatively higher at low
frequency, we have artificially boosted its continuum emission
by factors 3-10 with respect to the core images, but there was
no significant impact on the main line components. The various
contributions of the different continuum components to the total
absorption spectrum are presented in Appendix (B.1). The ring
is contributing a broad component. Although the ring contribu-
tion, even at low frequency, should be lower than 10%, it can
broaden the H i and OH spectra, and be responsible in part for
their wide wings. Another contribution to the wings may be the
high velocity clouds, which will be discussed in Sec. 3.5."
3.5. Distribution of the gas absorbing the mm continuum
"As mentioned earlier, the continuum emission at millimeter
wavelengths is much more compact than at cm, with all emis-
sion arising from the compact NE and SW images and little con-
tribution from the ring. It is therefore interesting to compare the"

"absorption spectra between the cm and mm domain, as this can
give us constraints on the distribution of gas in the disk. For
comparison, we take spectra of several species observed with
ALMA, namely HCO+, H2O, CH+, and ArH+ (see below and
Muller et al. 2014; Müller et al. 2015; Muller et al. 2017)."
"The widths of the various velocity components are much nar-
rower, and this could be due both to the smaller sizes of the core
images, and the smaller thickness of the dense molecular gas
plane. We therefore computed the model with twice more spatial
resolution in linear size i.e., four times in area, using the ALMA
continuum map, which fortunately also has a factor of two better
spatial resolution (see Fig A.1 in Appendix A). To reproduce the
observations, the intrinsic dispersion of the gas (6 km s−1) in the
N-body hydro simulation is sufficient, and an added convolution
is not necessary. We attempt to reproduce absorption from HCO+
which represents a generically mildly optically-thick species, the
H2O molecule which is a highly optically thick one, and ArH+
which should be a tracer of the H i but with a different contin-
uum illumination than at cm-wavelengths. The ArH+ absorption
appears optically thin, but there is another species, CH+, tracing
a gas with intermediate molecular fraction, which is highly op-
tically thick. The ALMA spectra, combined to a beam encom-
passing all the continuum emission, are represented in Fig. 9.
Both HCO+ and H2O have a highly concentrated radial distribu-
tion. We therefore selected the exponential profile, with a factor
f=exp(-γ r/r0), with the same r0=3.89 kpc, as before. For the
HCO+ and H2O distribution, the best fit was obtained with an
exponential law, with γ=2.5. The main difference in their pro-
files is due to their different optical thickness. In addition, for
H2O, it was necessary to deplete the central gas in front of the
third image C, to avoid an excessively broad absorption. Indeed,
C is close to the galaxy centre, and the velocity gradient at this
location reached the maximum of 220 km s−1 in projection. The
resulting 2D maps and the spectra are shown in Figs. 7 and 8."
"For the CH+ distribution, the best fit was obtained with an
exponential of γ=1.7, and for ArH+, γ=0.1. The latter is more
extended, with a distribution more similar to the atomic one. In
addition, the velocity components are broader, and we selected
a convolution width σv= 15 km s−1. The latter is three times less
than the H i dispersion, but still higher than that of the molecular
gas."
"The profiles of Fig. 9 reveal small extra features with veloc-
ities lower than −200 km s−1, or higher than 100 km s−1. These
velocities do not exist in our galaxy model, and should come ei-
ther from high-velocity clouds in the halo of the galaxy, or extra
tidal arms coming from a possible galaxy interaction. The line of"

the HCO+ line, very similar to the H2O case, both with a highly concen-
trated distribution and Right: for the ArH+ line, with a more extended
distribution (see text). The axes are labelled in arcsec. We note a big
difference in the NE component."
"sight of PKS 1830−211 falls at low latitude towards the Galac-
tic center (l,b=12.2◦,-5.7◦), and the region is too crowded to see
tidal tails or a possible companion. It is possible that the broad
H i components include these high-velocity clouds, and are the
cause of the high velocity dispersion required by the model."
"In summary, there is a wide range of central concentrations
for the various species, between HCO+ the most concentrated
and H i the most extended tracer. Furthermore there is a large
range of optical thickness and of gas layer height, implying a
large range of velocity width, that can explain the various mor-
phologies and intensities of spectral features."
4. Conclusions
"The MALS LSP project on the MeerKAT array has carried out
its first science verification observations in the UHF-band, cover-
ing the 580 to 1015 MHz frequency range. The brightest known
radio lens, PKS 1830−211 , has been observed and detected with
high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR∼ 4000 in channels of 6 km s−1).
While the H i 21-cm and OH main lines at z = 0.89 were al-
ready known, due to the excellent sensitivity of MeerKAT we
have also been successful in detecting the OH 18-cm satellite
lines. We find that while the strength of the OH main lines is
consistent with the LTE ratio, the satellite lines show conjugate
behavior indicative of radiative pumping due to far-infrared ra-
diation. The OH emission component in the 1720 MHz line, al-
though at only 3σ, has the total line luminosity of 6100 L�, i.e.,
∼20 times more luminous than the previously brightest known
1720 MHz maser, associated with PKS 1413+135 at z = 0.247
(Kanekar et al. 2004; Darling 2004). A detailed radiative model
will be investigated further in the future, when the corresponding
lines are re-observed with even higher SNRs."
"Contrary to the absorption features detected in several
molecules at mm wavelengths, peaking at V = 0 km s−1 (i.e. the
SW image), the main absorbing component at cm-wavelengths
is at a velocity of -150 km s−1 with respect to z = 0.88582, cor-
responding to the NE image. We compared our spectrum with
those previously obtained with the WSRT (SNR∼ 700 with re-
spect to the continuum and 35 at the peak of the line in Koop-
mans & de Bruyn 2005). The spectra reveal no variation, within
an SNR of 35 relative to the depth of the absorption. No variation
was seen also with respect to the ASKAP spectrum of Allison
et al. (2017) with SNR∼1000 with respect to the continuum and
50 at the peak of the line."

"We have built a realistic lens galaxy model, from an N-body
hydro simulation of an Sb-type galaxy, developing a bar and spi-
ral arms. The galaxy is projected to obtain a similar morphology
as the HST image. Combining with the cm and mm continuum
images of the background quasar obtained with best spatial res-
olution, we have computed data cubes to simulate the observed
absorption features. The H i and OH absorption spectra are well
reproduced with the main velocity field of the galaxy model. An
intrinsic velocity dispersion of σv=45 km s−1 has to be added
to account for the broad widths, which can be explained by the
presence of an extra-planar H i and OH gas, in addition to a thick
and flaring plane. For the HCO+ and H2O absorption lines, only
the dispersion of 6 km s−1 yielded by the simulated dense molec-
ular gas is sufficient to account for the observed profiles. The
molecular gas component is much more centrally concentrated,
while the H i-component is depleted in the galaxy center. There
is no need for any outflow component coming from the galaxy
plane. There exist however some distinct and faint extra features,
which can be interpreted as high-velocity clouds. To account for
the ArH+ absorption lines, observed with ALMA, a higher ve-
locity dispersion (σv=15 km s−1) and a more extended distribu-
tion, similar to the atomic component, has to be selected.

respectively, which are plotted in Fig.A.1. The resulting absorp-
