"ABSTRACT
We present the results of a weekly monitoring of the new black hole candidate X-ray binary
MAXI J1631-472 carried out with the MeerKAT radio interferometer, the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory, and the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) instrument, during its 2018-
2019 outburst. The source exhibits a number of X-ray states, in particular both high- and
low-luminosity hard states bracketed by extended soft states. Radio flaring is observed shortly
after a transition from hard/intermediate states to the soft state. This is broadly in agreement
with existing empirical models, but its extended duration hints at multiple unresolved flares
and/or jet-ISM interactions. In the hard state radio:X-ray plane, the source is revealed to be
‘radio quiet’ at high luminosities, but to rejoin the ‘standard’ track at lower luminosities, an
increasingly commonly-observed pattern of behaviour."

1 INTRODUCTION
"X-ray binaries are stellar systems which comprise a normal star
(the donor), usually still undergoing nuclear fusion, and a remnant
of an evolved star, the compact object, which is either a neutron
star or a black hole. In these systems X-ray emission is powered
by the accretion of matter from the donor to the compact object.
Depending on the spectral type of the donor, X-ray binaries are gen-
erally divided up into high mass X-ray binaries (O/B spectral type;
𝑀donor > 10M�) and low mass X-ray binaries (spectral type later
than A; 𝑀donor 6 1M�). In low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), the
compact object, either a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH),
accretes matter from the donor through an accretion disc via Roche
Lobe overflow. BH LMXBs are transient in nature, since they spend
a majority of the time in quiescence and occasionally go into out-
burst where the X-ray flux is seen to increase by several orders
of magnitude (Remillard &McClintock 2006). These outbursts can
last fromweeks to years (Belloni &Motta 2016). The varying X-ray
emission has an associated radio emission, and these two quantities"

2003; Fender 2001; Gallo et al. 2004; Fender & Belloni 2012)."
"During outbursts, transient BHLMXBusually sample different
states, which are defined by their X-ray spectral and timing prop-
erties, and which are connected with the properties of the radio jet
(Belloni 2010). At the outset of the outburst, when the X-ray flux is
low (𝐿𝑋 ∼ 1033.5 erg. s−1), the system typically lies in the hard state
and the emission is associated with inverse Compton up-scattering
of seed photons in a coronal region close to the accretion disc (Bel-
loni &Motta 2016). The associated radio emission is typically weak
(𝐿𝑅 < 1028 erg. s−1) with a flat spectral index. As the system goes
further into an outburst, the flux rises. At a certain X-ray luminosity
level - which varies in a large range from source to source and from
outburst to outburst for a single source (Tetarenko et al. 2016) - the
system transitions to an intermediate state and then enters the soft
state. In the intermediate state, optically thin relativistic radio jets
can be observed. As the system enters the soft spectral state, the
X-ray emission is thermal, which has been attributed to an optically
thick geometrically thin accretion disc, while the radio emission
decreases as the jet is quenched (Corbel et al. 2001; Coriat et al.
2011). These spectral state changes typically trace out a distinct"

"path in the hardness-intensity diagram (Yu et al. 2004, 2007; Yu &
Yan 2009; Belloni et al. 2011; Fender & Belloni 2012), which is
associated with a transition from a compact jet to an episodic jet
(Fender et al. 2004)."
"MAXI J1631-472 was first detected as a bright X-ray source
by Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image/Gas Slit Camera (MAXI/GSC;
Matsuoka et al. 2009) on 21 December 2018, and was initially
mistaken for the X-ray pulsar AX MAXI J1631-4752 (Kobayashi
et al. 2018). Further observations with the BAT instrument on-board
the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift; Gehrels et al. 2004)
and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR; Harrison
et al. 2010) revealed that the position of MAXI J1631-472, with
a separation of 8.4′, is not consistent with that of AX MAXI
J1631-4752. MAXI J1631-472 was therefore classified as a new
X-ray transient (Miyasaka et al. 2018). The NuSTAR spectrum
(energy band 3− 79 keV) was fit with a blackbody disc temperature
of 1.12 ± 0.01 keV and a power-law index of 2.39 ± 0.02. The
spectral fitting revealed an iron K-alpha emission line with an
equivalent width of 90 eV, indicating evidence of a reflection
component in the spectrum (Miyasaka et al. 2018). The spectral
properties suggested that MAXI J1631-472 is a binary system with
an accreting black hole detected by NuSTAR in the soft state. A
radio counterpart was detected at the position consistent with that
from the X-ray observations (Russell et al. 2019)."
"Since 12 January 2019 (MJD 58495), MAXI J1631-472 has
been monitored with MeerKAT as part of the ThunderKAT Large
Survey Project (Fender et al. 2017). In this manuscript we re-
port on the results of the monitoring of MAXI J1631-472 with
the MeerKAT interferometer, complemented with X-ray data from
Swift and MAXI. We show the evolution of the radio and X-ray
emission throughout its outburst and provide a physical interpreta-
tion of the dataset. We also compare the behaviour observed with
other known outbursting BH systems.
The paper is structured as follows: in section 2we describe the obser-
vations and details of the data reduction. In section 3 we present the
results of the two wavebands and highlight some of the interesting
behaviour. In section 4 we summarise our conclusions."
2 OBSERVATIONS
2.1 MeerKAT
"The MeerKAT monitoring of MAXI J1631-472 was performed
weekly, with the observations carried out at a central frequency of
1.28 GHz and bandwidth of 856 MHz. These observations were
taken as part of the ThunderKAT Large Survey Programme on
MeerKAT (Fender et al. 2016). Each observation consists of a 15
minute scan of the target, and a two-minute scan of the phase cal-
ibrator, in this case J1726-5529. The primary calibrator used was
J1939-6342, which was observed at the start of each observation for
5 minutes.We used casa (McMullin et al. 2007) to perform the data
reduction. We performed flagging of radio frequency interference
(RFI), where we removed the first and last 150 channels (channel
width ∼ 209 kHz) of the band. The auto-flagging algorithms, rflag
and tfcrop, were used for subsequent flagging. We then performed
calibration, where the flux density on the primary calibrator was set
using the known model. The phase-only and antenna-based delay
corrections on the primary calibrator were then solved for, then the
bandpass corrections for the primary were then applied. We solved
for the complex gains on the primary and secondary, then proceeded"

"Flux densities for MAXI J1631-472 were extracted from the
images using PyBDSF (Mohan & Rafferty 2015); these are pre-
sented in Table 1. We were able to extract an in-band spectral index
(𝛼, with the flux density 𝑆a scaling with frequency a as 𝑆a ∝ a𝛼)
at the four brightest epochs using a fit to eight uniformly-spaced
channels across the 856 MHz bandpass. To determine the spectral
index, we performed a least-squares fit using the scipy and curve-
fit module and function, respectively, in python to calculate the
slope and its associated error bar. The results from these fits are
presented in Table 2 and indicate that the source was optically thin
during the times of strongest radio flux density."

"2 − 4 keV energy band. The daily-averaged count rates at the two
energy bands were extracted from the MAXI/GSC website 1"
2.3 Swift
"Our target was also monitored by the X-ray Telescope (XRT; Bur-
rows et al. 2005) on-board Swift on a weekly basis throughout its
outburst. The Swift observations were taken (quasi-)simultaneously
with theMeerKAT observing runs, as a part of a long-termmonitor-
ing of BH transients associated to the ThunderKAT Large Survey
Project (Fender et al. 2016). Therefore, we were able to measure
weekly the simultaneous radio and X-ray emission from the tar-
get. We use the X-ray data obtained from the XRT instrument on
board the Swift Observatory to extract spectra in the 0.6–10 keV
energy band through the Swift XRT product generator online reduc-
tion pipeline (Evans et al. 2007, 2009). We fitted each spectrum in
XSPEC (Arnaud 1996) with an absorbed power law, or a combina-
tion of a powerlaw + a disk-blackbody component, both modified
by interstellar absorption. The addition of a Gaussian emission line
centered at ≈6.4 keV was sometimes required by the fit. We initially
left the Galactic neutral hydrogen absorption column parameter,
𝑁𝐻 , free to vary and fixed the value to the average 𝑁𝐻 the fits
returned, and then tied the 𝑁𝐻 across spectra, assuming that the
same 𝑁𝐻 value applies to all of them. We find that 𝑁𝐻 = (3.36
± 0.02)×1022 cm−2, see HI4PI Collaboration et al. 2016), which is
slightly higher than the 𝑁𝐻 measured in the direction of the source
(i.e., 𝑁𝐻 ≈ 2.9×1022 cm−2; Miyasaka et al. 2018) We finally mea-
sured the unabsorbed X-ray fluxes in the 1–10 keV energy band,
which we used in Figs. 1 and 3.
The Burst Alert Telescope on-board Swift (Swift/BAT) was also
used to monitor MAXI J1631-472 in the 15 – 50 keV energy range
throughout its outburst. The daily-averaged lightcurve was obtained
from the the Swift website2 and is shown in Fig. 1."
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Evolution of the radio and X-ray emission
"In Fig. 1 we show the simultaneous X-ray (MAXI and Swift/BAT at
2 − 20 keV and 15 − 50 keV, respectively) and radio light curves
throughout the outburst (top three panels), and the evolution of
the hardness ratio (HR, bottom panel), which is defined as the
ratio of the flux in the 2 − 20 keV to 2 − 4 keV MAXI energy
bands. As seen in the figure, MAXI J1631-472 underwent various
state transitions throughout our monitoring campaign. The radio
monitoring commenced around the time of the peak of the X-ray
outburst (MJD 58495), with a flux density of ∼4.7 mJy. The system
at this stage was in the soft state, as seen in the hardness ratio (HR
∼ 1.5). During the X-ray decline there was a change in state from
the soft to hard at MJD 58508 (HR∼2), with a slight increase in
radio flux by ∼2 mJy from the previous week’s measurement. This
change in state was also reported by van den Eĳnden et al. (2019).
Fiocchi et al. (2020) use INTEGRAL/IBIS observations during this
period (∼MJD 58507−MJD 58514) to perform spectral analysis,
where they demonstrate that during the transition to the hard state
the system was dominated by a hard Comptonised component
with an electron temperature of 𝑘𝑇 ∼ 29 keV. As the outburst
continued, MAXI J1631-472 transitioned to the intermediate state"

"where both the soft and hard bands displayed high flux levels
(∼MJD 58515−MJD 58522; HR∼1.8). During this transition the
radio flux density was back to its stable level of ∼ 4 − 5 mJy.
Xu et al. (2020) performed spectral analysis from NuSTAR
observations during a similar period (∼MJD 58500−MJD 58515),
where they demonstrated that MAXI J1631-472 transitioned from
a disc-dominant state (∼MJD 58500) to a power-law-dominant
state (∼MJD 58515)."
"The system then re-entered the soft state as seen in a sharp
decline in the hardness ratio to HR∼1.2, accompanied by a radio
flare which peaked at nearly 50 mJy (between MJD 58560 and
MJD 58582). MAXI J1631-472 stayed in the soft state throughout
the duration of the radio flare and even after the flare had declined,
with the radio flux density gradually decreasing to a flux level lower
than before the flare (63 mJy; MJD 58614). The system switched
back to the hard state (MJD 58642), seen in the sharp increase in
hardness ratio (HR∼2.2), with the radio and X-ray flux emission
continuing to gradually decline as the source went into quiescence."

3.2 Hardness intensity diagram
"The hardness intensity diagram (HID) for MAXI J1631-472 during
the 2018/19 outburst is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 (a) shows the HID
for the full duration of the outburst, with the colour bar representing
the time evolution. As seen in Fig. 2 (b), MAXI J1631-472 shows
a rapid rise in photon flux as it changes from quiescence to peak
flux in roughly 25 days while the spectral state changes from hard
(HR∼9) to soft (HR∼1.2) during this period. The decline of the
X-ray photon flux occurs while the system is in the soft state, during
which the radio flare is seen to occur (colour-bar in Fig. 2 (c))).
As the X-ray photon flux continues to decline, it reaches a point
(2 − 20 keV flux of ∼0.1 ph/s/cm2) when the spectral state changes
to intermediate and decays to the hard state. Fig. 2 (a) shows the
HID with the colour coding indicating the different spectral states."
"The HID track of MAXI J1631-472 follows a diagonal transi-
tion during the rise of the outburst when the spectral state changes
from hard to soft and is similar to those seen in systems such as GRO
J1655–40 and XTE J1550–564 (e.g. Russell et al. 2010; Uttley &
Klein-Wolt 2015). Some systems follow a canonical ’q’-shaped
HID pattern where the rise in X-ray flux from quiescence to peak
happens in the hard state and the system changes to intermediate
and then to soft at roughly constant peak flux. The differences in
the shapes of the HIDs have been suggested to be due to inclination
angle differences, with the ’q’-shaped HIDs occurring in low incli-
nation systems (𝑖 6 60◦ Muñoz-Darias et al. 2013). This suggests
that the orbit of MAXI J1631-472 is possibly highly inclined."
3.3 Radio flaring
"The strongest radio emission from MAXI J1631-472 occurred
shortly after the transition from the intermediate to the soft X-
ray state. This is broadly in agreement with the unified picture put
forward in Fender et al. (2004). The three weeks or more of bright
radio emission hints at multiple flaring events, since flares from
X-ray binaries tend to evolve on shorter timescales (e.g. Fender &
Bright 2019), and these shorter timescale radio flares may them-
selves be the superposition of multiple events which can only be
discriminated at mm/IR frequencies (e.g. Tetarenko et al. 2017) or
with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI; e.g. Miller-Jones
et al. 2019). There may also be a contribution from physically sepa-
rated ejecta which are fading only slowly due to jet-ISM interactions"
"leading to in situ particle acceleration (see for example Bright et al.
2020). Such emission can persist for many months, fading slowly,
which is the most likely explanation for the persistent low level ra-
dio emission throughout the soft state. This component, originating
in ejecta completely separated from the core may potentially con-
tribute to the radio flux measured from the source after its return to
the hard state (see further discussion in section 3.4)."
"Assuming that the radio flare peak was due to a transition from
optically thick to thin emission as the ejecta expanded, we may
use the single-frequency estimates of the physical parameters from
Fender & Bright (2019) (their equations 28 – 31). For a distance
of 5 kpc, at a peak flux density of 40 mJy at 1.4 GHz, we find a
corresponding physical radius at peak of 𝑅 = 3 × 1013cm, corre-
sponding to a minimum internal energy of 𝐸 = 4 × 1038 erg s−1,
a magnetic field of 𝐵 =∼ 0.2 G and a resulting brightness temper-
ature of 𝑇𝐵 = 5 × 1010 K. The dependence on distance 𝑑 of these
estimates are different for each quantity: 𝑅 ∝ 𝑑16/17, 𝐸 ∝ 𝑑40/17,
𝐵 ∝ 𝑑−4/17 and 𝑇𝐵 ∝ 𝑑2/17 (Fender & Bright 2019). These es-
timates are reasonable in the context of other X-ray binaries and
rather typical of a low-mass X-ray binary (and notably consider-
ably less powerful than the most luminous jet sources such as GRS
1915+105 or Cygnus X-3; see Fender & Bright 2019). However,
the spectral index measurements (Table 2) indicate that the source
may well have been optically thin throughout the phase of brightest
radio emission. In addition, as noted above, this is unlikely to have
been a single event. Therefore the energy estimates remain highly
uncertain."
3.4 Radio/X-ray correlation
"BH LMXBs in the hard state are known to show a correlation
between theX-ray and radio luminosities. The ‘standard’ correlation
between the radio and X-ray emission in the black hole hard state
takes a non-linear form 𝐿radio ∝ 𝐿0.5−0.7X-ray (Corbel et al. 2000; Gallo
et al. 2003, 2014; Espinasse & Fender 2018). A second population
of BH LMXBs exists, the co-called ‘radio-faint’ systems, which
have a smaller ratio of radio to X-ray luminosity and may have a
steeper relationship between the radio and X-ray emission of the
form 𝐿radio ∝ 𝐿1.4X-ray (Coriat et al. 2011; Cao et al. 2014). Several
suggestions have beenmade to explain the physical origin of the two
tracks which include variations in the magnetic field strength of the
jet (Casella & Pe’er 2009), differences in the distribution of matter"

"in the inner accretion disc (Meyer-Hofmeister & Meyer 2014) and
differences in the inclination angles of the binary systems (Motta
et al. 2018). Gallo et al. (2018), however, suggest, from a statistical
viewpoint, that the two populations are indistinct. The BH LMXB
H1743-322 has been shown to be ‘radio quiet’ at high luminosities,
but to return to the ‘standard’ track at an X-ray luminosity between
1034–1035 erg s−1 (Coriat et al. 2011). Motta et al. (2018) have
argued that this is probably a general property of all ‘radio quiet’
sources, i.e. there is only a single radio:X-ray correlation at low
X-ray luminosities."
"Fig. 3 shows the radio/X-ray correlation plot which includes
measurements of known BH LMXBs using the compiled measure-
ments in Bahramian et al. (2018) and hard state measurements of
MAXI J1631-472 presented in this work at 5 kpc. The 1.28 GHz
radio measurements from MeerKAT were converted to 5 GHz as-
suming a flat spectral index for comparison with measurements
presented in Bahramian et al. (2018). Note that we do not cur-
rently have any reliable distance estimates for the source, so we
consider distances of 2, 5 and 8 kpc. For the entire range of dis-
tances, it appears that the earlier hard state measurements trace out
the ‘radio-quiet’ region while the three measurements taken later
during the decline of the X-ray flux seem to be more consistent
‘radio-loud’ track. MAXI J1631-472 therefore becomes another"
"source for which the switch from high-luminosity ‘radio quiet’ to
lower-luminosity ‘standard track’ evolution is observed, similar to
systems such as H1743-322 (Coriat et al. 2011), Swift J1753.5-
0127 (Plotkin et al. 2017), XTE J1752-223 (Ratti et al. 2012) and
XTE J1659-152 (Ratti et al. 2012). As noted above (section 3.3) we
cannot rule out some contribution from fading ejecta, launched at
the earlier hard-to-soft state transition, to the radio emission in the
hard state. Examining Figure 1 in detail we can see that there was a
small rise in the radio emission of approximately 12% between two
consecutive observations around the time of the transition back to
the intermediate state (around MJD 58630), which likely indicates
the re-activation of the compact hard state jet. In the case of MAXI
J1820+070 this re-activated core jet dominates the fading emission
from the jet (Bright et al. 2020), and the slight re-brightening noted
above suggests this is also the case for MAXI J1631-472. We note
that regardless of the physical origin, the observational phenomenon
of sources returning to the ‘standard track’ at moderately low lu-
minosities is now well established. We cannot conclusively rule out
this being due to fading ejecta in every case, but it seems unlikely."

4 CONCLUSION
"We have presented radio and X-ray observations of the newly-
discovered BH LMXB candidate, MAXI J1631-472, during its
2018-2019 outburst. The radio datawere taken at a central frequency
of 1.28 GHz with the MeerKAT interferometer as part of the Thun-
derKATLarge Survey Project.We used publicly available data from
Swift and MAXI to analyse its X-ray behaviour, where we find that
MAXI J1631-472 undergoes various state transitions throughout the
outburst. We have investigated the quasi-simultaneous MeerKAT
and Swift observations to explore the radio/X-ray correlation. A
prolonged period of radio flaring begins at the transition to the
second-observed soft state, and probably originates in multiple
flare-ejection events and possibly additional jet-ISM interactions.
A comparison of the contemporaneous hard-state X-ray and radio
measurements of MAXI J1631-472 with those from other BH sys-
tems reveals an evolution from the ’radio quiet’ to ‘radio loud’ tracks
as the X-ray luminosity decreases."
