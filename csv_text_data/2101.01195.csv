"ABSTRACT
With the advent of deep optical-to-near-infrared extragalactic imaging on the degree scale, samples of high-redshift sources
are being selected that contain both bright star-forming (SF) galaxies and faint active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this study we
investigate the transition between SF and AGN-dominated systems at 𝑧 ' 4 in the rest-frame UV. We find a rapid transition
to AGN-dominated sources bright-ward of 𝑀UV ' −23.2. The effect is observed in the rest-frame UV morphology and size-
luminosity relation, where extended clumpy systems become point-source dominated, and also in the available spectra for the
sample. These results allow us to derive the rest-frame UV luminosity function for the SF and AGN-dominated sub-samples.
We find the SF-dominated LF is best fit with a double-power law, with a lensed Schechter function being unable to explain the
existence of extremely luminous SF galaxies at𝑀UV ' −23.5. If we identify AGN-dominated sources according to a point-source
morphology criterion we recover the relatively flat faint-end slope of the AGN LF determined in previous studies. If we instead
separate the LF according to the current spectroscopic AGN fraction, we find a steeper faint-end slope of 𝛼 = −1.83 ± 0.11.
Using a simple model to predict the rest-frame AGN LF from the 𝑧 = 4 galaxy LF we find that the increasing impact of host
galaxy light on the measured morphology of faint AGN can explain our observations."

1 INTRODUCTION
"How supermassive black holes and their host galaxies co-evolve over
cosmic time poses many fundamental questions within Astrophysics.
The detection of luminous quasars at very high redshift (e.g. Fan
et al. 2003; Willott et al. 2010a; Mortlock et al. 2011; Bañados
et al. 2016, 2018; Yang et al. 2020) demonstrates that active black
holes are present less than a Gyr after the Big Bang. Within the
same epoch, the star-forming (SF) galaxy population is known to be
building-up rapidly from measurements of the evolving rest-frame
UV luminosity function (LF; e.g. Bouwens et al. 2015; Finkelstein
et al. 2015; Bowler et al. 2020; Ono et al. 2018). Until recently,
the populations of quasars and SF galaxies at redshifts 𝑧 = 4 − 8
have typically been treated as separate, due primarily to the disparate
luminosity space occupied by the current samples. This is despite the
majority of galaxies and quasars at very high-redshifts being selected
based on the same spectral feature in optical/NIR survey data; the
Lyman-continuum and/or the Lyman-𝛼 break. The strong Lyman-
break in the spectral energy distribution (SED), which is redshifted
into the optical filters at 𝑧 & 3 and near-IR at 𝑧 & 7, has allowed large
samples of UV-bright galaxies and AGN1 to be selected efficiently.
In the last decade, the advent of intermediate surveys that probe
areas up to a few hundred square degrees on the sky has led to the"

1 In this work we use the more inclusive term AGN rather than quasar
throughout."
"first samples that bridge both faint AGN as well as bright galaxies,
filling in a previously unachievable parameter space in volume and
luminosity (Matute et al. 2013;Kashikawa et al. 2015;Matsuoka et al.
2018b; Stevans et al. 2018; Ono et al. 2018; Adams et al. 2020). The
properties of these intermediate luminosity sources are important
for several reasons. Firstly, the existence of very UV bright, highly
star-forming galaxies can challenge models of feedback and dust
obscuration via the inferred steepness of the bright-end of the Lyman-
break galaxy (LBG) UV LF (e.g. Bower et al. 2012; Gonzalez-Perez
et al. 2013; Bowler et al. 2014; Dayal et al. 2014; Clay et al. 2015).
Furthermore, the uncertainty in the number of the brightest galaxies
in combination with ‘contamination’ of these samples with faint-
AGN or interloper populations can confuse the interpretation of the
shape and evolution of the galaxy LF (e.g. Bowler et al. 2012; Bian
et al. 2013). Secondly, the determination of the faint-end slope of
the AGN LF is crucial for understanding if these sources played any
significant role in reionizing the Universe at 𝑧 & 7 (e.g. as advocated
by Giallongo et al. 2015, 2019, see discussion in Parsa et al. 2018).
Thirdly, samples of sources in which the AGN and stellar component
both contribute measurably to the observed light give an insight into
how and when black holes become intricately linked to their host
galaxy (e.g. via measurements of the black-hole to bulge/stellar mass
relation at very high-redshift; Willott et al. 2010b; Venemans et al.
2017)."
"While the rest-frameUV 𝑧 ' 4AGNLFwas first measured several
decades ago (e.g. Warren et al. 1994; Richards et al. 2006; Masters"

"et al. 2012; Ikeda et al. 2012), recent surveys have been able to select
larger samples over a wider luminosity range, thus providing greater
precision. In particular, there have been several successful campaigns
to identify fainter sources at 𝑧 ≥ 4 with surveys such as the Subaru
High-𝑧 Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs: Mat-
suoka et al. 2018a), the Infrared Medium Survey (IMS: Kim et al.
2019) and the Hyper-SuprimeCam Stragetic Survey Program (HSC-
SSP; Akiyama et al. 2018). These studies have been able to constrain
the faint-end2 of the AGN LF for the first time at 𝑧 & 4, however
there remain large discrepancies in the derived faint-end slope which
ranges from 𝛼 ' −1.3 (Matsuoka et al. 2018b; Akiyama et al. 2018)
to as steep as 𝛼 ' −2 (McGreer et al. 2018; Giallongo et al. 2019;
Shin et al. 2020). A key challenge in the robust determination of the
number density of the lowest luminosity AGN is that faint-ward of
a certain absolute UV magnitude (𝑀UV ' −23; Stevans et al. 2018;
Ono et al. 2018; Adams et al. 2020), LBGs become overwhelmingly
more numerous. In response, AGN selection methodologies have
typically included a condition that the source must be unresolved in
imaging data, as expected for a source dominated by the central AGN.
Despite this, the very faintest sources targeted by these studies have
shown spectra that are typical of Lyman-break galaxies (e.g. Mat-
suoka et al. 2018b; Kashikawa et al. 2015). Furthermore, as studies
probe fainter AGN in the rest-frame UV, it is unclear how the light
from star-formation might impact the morphology (e.g. Gavignaud
et al. 2006) and hence cause current selection procedures based on
compactness to become incomplete. Thus a more detailed analysis
of the properties of faint-AGN and bright galaxies is required.
In Adams et al. (2020) we selected a sample of LBGs and AGN"
"at 𝑧 ' 4 from the COSMOS and XMM-LSS deep extragalactic
fields using a photometric redshift analysis based on the ground-
based optical to NIR photometry. The advantages of this sample over
previous studies are i) we do not impose any condition on source
size or morphology and hence we are complete to both point-sources
and extended galaxies, ii) we exploit the NIR data which results
in a very clean selection of 𝑧 ' 4 sources and iii) we have used
two of the most widely studied deep fields where there is wealth
of deep multi-wavelength data and spectroscopy available. Here we
utilise this sample to investigate the properties of objects within
the ‘transition’ regime between bright-AGN and the typical galaxy
population at this redshift. We do this by looking at the morphology
and size of the sources using both the available ground-based and
wide-area Hubble Space Telescope (HST) mosaics in COSMOS. In
addition we have compiled publicly available spectra for the sample
and use this to further classify sources. The structure of the paper is
as follows. In Section 2 we describe the variety of datasets we use,
and in Section 3 we describe the size measurements and the results
from the available archival spectra of the sample. In Section 4 we
derive the AGN fraction from our data and estimate the separated SF
and AGN-dominated LFs. We discuss our results in 5 and present a
simple empirical model of the AGN LF which we use to interpret
our results in Section 6. We end with conclusions in 7. Throughout
this work we present magnitudes in the AB system (Oke 1974; Oke
& Gunn 1983). The standard concordance cosmology is assumed,
with 𝐻0 = 70 km s−1Mpc−1, Ωm = 0.3 and ΩΛ = 0.7. At 𝑧 ="
"2 The AGN LF is typically parameterised as a double-power law (DPL) of
the form 𝜙 ∝ 𝜙∗ /( (𝐿/𝐿∗)𝛼 + (𝐿/𝐿∗)𝛽) . This functional form includes
four free parameters, a bright and faint-end slope (𝛽 and 𝛼), a charac-
teristic luminosity (𝐿∗) and normalisation 𝜙∗. For fitting the rest-frame
UV LF of LBGs a Schechter function is commonly assumed of the form
𝜙 ∝ 𝜙∗ (𝐿/𝐿∗)𝛼 𝑒−𝐿/𝐿"

. For the Schechter function the bright-end slope is"
replaced by an exponential decline bright-ward of 𝐿∗.
"[3.5, 4.0, 4.5] this cosmology implies that one arcsec corresponds to
physical distances of [7.3, 7.0, 6.6] kpc."
2 SAMPLE SELECTION AND DATA
"The sample of 𝑧 ' 4 galaxies and AGN we utilize in this work
was selected in the COSMOS and XMM-LSS deep extragalactic
fields. The selection was based on a photometric redshift fitting of
the optical to NIR bands (u-band to 𝐾𝑠) from the available ground-
based data. In this paper we further include HST ACS imaging and
spectroscopic observations available in the public domain."
2.1 The sample
"The full sample of 𝑧 ' 4 sources from Adams et al. (2020) consisted
of 20064 (38722) sources in theCOSMOS (XMM-LSS) fields bright-
ward of the 50 percent completeness limit of 𝑀UV ' −20. To be
included in the sample the object must have a best-fitting photometric
redshift in the range 3.5 < 𝑧 < 4.5with either a galaxy or AGN SED.
Stars were removed using a relative 𝜒2 cut, such that the galaxy or
AGN template must have a better fit than the stellar model. In this
work we refined this sample using the most up-to-date photometry
in the fields. We matched the original catalogue with a new 𝐼-band
selected catalogue (created in an identical fashion) that included
the deeper HSC DR2 data, and the UltraVISTA DR4 imaging. The
matching process revealed a small number of artefacts that were
removed in the newer HSC release. We also required the objects to
satisfy the selection criterion described above when run on the new
deeper photometry, and be brighter than 15𝜎 in the ground-based 𝐼-
band to ensure a robustmorphology analysis. As a result of these steps
we were left with a sample of 15126 (25592) sources in COSMOS
(XMM-LSS). For the morphology analysis we required the sources
to be covered by the HST/ACS mosaic in the COSMOS field. The
sub-sample covered by this mosaic contained 13848 sources."
2.2 Imaging data
"Within the COSMOS field we used the HST/Advanced Camera for
Surveys (ACS) mosaic in the F814W filter (hereafter 𝐼814: Koeke-
moer et al. 2007; Scoville et al. 2007; Massey et al. 2010). We
obtained 10 × 10 arcsec2 cut-outs3 from this mosaic for each source
in our COSMOS sample where the ACS data existed (correspond-
ing to 96 percent of the sample). The ACS data has a pixel scale
of 0.03 arcsec/pix, and a typical point-source full-width-at-half-
maximum (FWHM) of less than 0.1 arcsec. The COSMOS field is
uniformly covered to single orbit depth, leading to a 5𝜎 depth of 27.0
(0.6 arcsecond diameter aperture). Both the COSMOS and XMM-
LSS fields contain a wealth of data in the optical and NIR bands. In
this study we measure the rest-frame UV size from the HSC 𝐼 and
CFHT 𝑖-bands. This allowed us to identify any potential systemat-
ics in the size measurement from using data of different depth and
seeing. The HSC 𝐼-band is available across both fields, with varying
depth, while the CFHT 𝑖-band is uniform in depth but is available
for only a 1 deg2 subsection of each field (Bowler et al. 2020). The
images have a pixel scale of 0.15 and 0.2 in COSMOS and XMM-
LSS respectively. The seeing in these bands was approximately 0.65
arcsec."

of ALPINE and VUDS in COSMOS and VANDELS in XMM-LSS. The
spectroscopic redshifts at brighter magnitudes are typically from magnitude
limited surveys (e.g. SDSS, zCOSMOS; see Table A1)."
2.3 Publicly available spectroscopy
"We endeavoured to extract the publicly available spectroscopy for
the sample. In both fields we initially matched to the compilation of
spectroscopic redshifts created by the HSC team4, which we supple-
mented with additional catalogues from the VANDELS (Pentericci
et al. 2018; McLure et al. 2018) in XMM-LSS, and the ALMALarge
Program to INvestigate (ALPINE; Fèvre et al. 2019) and the Boutsia
et al. (2018) sample of 𝑧 ' 4 AGN in COSMOS. In Fig. 1 we show
the spectroscopically confirmed sources in comparison to the full
sample as a function of absolute UV magnitude. In total we found a
total of 63 and 236 high-redshift sources with secure spectroscopic
flags in COSMOS and XMM-LSS respectively (76 and 270 with all
flags)5. As part of this process we identified and removed 4 (12)"
"4 https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/doc/index.php/dr1_
specz/ Note that in this compilation, when a source had multiple redshifts
from different surveys these were averaged. This can result in a stated redshift
at 𝑧 < 3 when the source is securely at 𝑧 > 3. We corrected for this on a
case-by-case basis. In addition we removed redshifts from 3D-HST as these
are not purely spectroscopic, particularly at higher redshifts where there are
few spectral features in the rest-frame optical.
5 Secure flags were typically 3 or 4, including flags that may have been
modified for the presence of AGN (e.g. a flag of 14 in VVDS denotes a secure
AGN)"
"low-redshift interlopers in COSMOS (XMM-LSS). In COSMOS,
100 percent of the sources in our sample at 𝑀UV < −23.5 are con-
firmed spectroscopically, partially due to the campaign of Boutsia
et al. (2018). In XMM, we find a lower percentage of 42 percent
in the same magnitude range. At the bright-end of our sample the
spectroscopic redshifts come primarily from magnitude limited sur-
veys including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; Eisenstein et al.
2011; Richards et al. 2002), zCOSMOS (Lilly et al. 2007), VIMOS
VLT Deep Survey (VVDS; Le Fèvre et al. 2015) and Primus (Coil
et al. 2011). At the faint-end of our survey the redshifts were obtained
as specific follow-up for high-redshift galaxies. The ALPINE sample
includes sources from the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS; Le
Fèvre et al. 2015) and Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph
(DEIMOS; Hasinger et al. 2018) follow-up of high-redshift sources
that are spread over theCOSMOSfield. TheVANDELS survey on the
other hand, was limited to a smaller region of the field that overlaps
with theHST CosmicAssemblyNIRDeep Extragalactic Legacy Sur-
vey (CANDELS; Grogin et al. 2011; Koekemoer et al. 2011) where
extremely deep spectroscopic integrations were performed. Thus the
VANDELS sources extend to fainter magnitudes than in ALPINE.
At the faint-end of the survey . 2 percent of our sample have been
confirmed as part of these deep spectroscopic surveys. While we
cross-matched our sample to all available spectroscopic redshifts,
we were only able to obtain a subset of reduced spectra depending
on the survey. We extracted all of the publicly available spectra from
SDSS, zCOSMOS, VVDS and VANDELS for further analysis."
3 RESULTS
"Armed with our sample of 𝑧 ' 4 sources in the COSMOS and
XMM-LSS fields, we proceeded to measure their sizes and spectro-
scopic properties. As we are primarily concerned with the objects in
the ‘transition’ regime where AGN and LBGs have similar number
densities, this analysis focuses on the results at 𝑀UV . −22. At
these bright magnitudes we have a larger proportion of spectroscopic
follow-up frommagnitude limited surveys and we are able to identify
the source morphology at high S/N in the high-resolution HST data
(e.g. even if the source fragments into several clumps the components
are detected individually at > 5𝜎)."
3.1 Visual morphology
"We first visually inspected the 𝑧 ' 4 sources that had high-resolution
imaging from the COSMOS HST/ACS 𝐼814 mosaic. In Fig. 2 we
show postage-stamp images of the brightest 30 sources in our sample.
The brightest eight sources have been spectroscopically confirmed as
quasars (see Table A1) and as expected, these sources appear com-
pact. As we go fainter in this sub-sample there is a dramatic change
in the visual morphology, with the appearance of extended, clumpy,
sources. For example objects ID793151, ID746876 and ID168777 are
clearly resolved, with multiple-components that extend > 0.5 arcsec
(> 3.5 kpc) from the centroid. This is as expected from the galaxy
size-luminosity relation and extensive studies of similarly luminous
sources at 𝑧 ' 3 (e.g. Law et al. 2012; Lotz et al. 2006) and 𝑧 > 5
(e.g. Jiang et al. 2013; Bowler et al. 2017). In the sources that are
confirmed as AGN from their spectra, there is some evidence for
weak extended emission (e.g. ID702265), which could be arising
from the host galaxy. Furthermore, one of the sources (ID153468)
that is a confirmed quasar from the available rest-frame UV spectrum
in Boutsia et al. (2018), appears to be compact but resolved (which is
also confirmed by quantitative measure of the size, see Section 4.1)."

number is shown in the bottom left and the 𝑀UV is shown in the upper right. Sources that have been spectroscopically confirmed are labelled with an astericks
in the bottom right corner. Note that all of the spectroscopically confirmed sources in this figure show strong quasar features in the spectra."
"This demonstrates that the host galaxy light is contributing signifi-
cantly to the rest-frame UV light from this source. We estimated the
contribution from the host galaxy by simultaneously fitting a PSF
and Sérsic profile (fixed to 𝑛 = 1.0; Law et al. 2012) to the image
using GALFIT. The best-fit from this crude estimate was an equal
contribution from the AGN and SF in this object. For the other visual
point-sources in the data, we found that a PSF alone was adequate
to fit the imaging. If we assume that the extended sources are SF-
dominated, whilst the point-sources are AGN dominated (which is
likely given the high rate of AGN spectra found for these sources),
then we see a rapid transition in the individual galaxy morphology
that indicates a transition from AGN to SF dominated systems at
𝑀UV ' −23. A transition at this magnitude is in good agreement
with that predicted by the simultaneous AGN and LBG LF fitting
of Adams et al. (2020) and we compare our results directly to this
study in our analysis of the AGN fraction in Section 4.1."
3.2 Size-luminosity relation
"Due to the clumpy nature of the sources in the HST 𝐼814 data, the
sizes of these sources can be substantially biased depending on the
chosen measurement technique. When running Source Extractor
(SE; Bertin & Arnouts 1996) on these images for example, we found
that the majority of the SF-dominated sources were de-blended into
several component. This results in a severe underestimate of the
individual sizes of the brightest galaxies in the sample. To get around
this issue we proceeded to make high signal-to-noise stacks of the
data over a range in 𝑀UV."
3.2.1 Stacking procedure
"We created stacks in both the high-resolution HST imaging and the
ground-based HSC and CFHT 𝑖-band data. In both cases masks were
formed from the SEGMENTATION images created with SE. For"
"MNRAS 000, 1–15 (2020)"
SF to AGN transition at z ' 4 5
"the ground-based data we masked all sources that were not associ-
ated with the central source. In the HST/ACS data we recombined
de-blended components by retaining all objects that were within
a radius of 0.8 arcsec from the central coordinate defined by the
ground-based centroid. Due to their close proximity, and the ex-
tended emission connecting clumps in many cases, we are confident
these components are at the same redshift (see Fig. 2 and discussion
in Bowler et al. 2017). If the separate components were galaxies at
lower redshifts, we would expect these interloper sources to effect
the ground-based optical to NIR photometry and thus be removed as
interlopers by our SED fitting process. With our recombined source
we then determined the new centroid of the detected pixels in this
extended object as the barycentre or first order moment (as used in
SE). With these masked and centred images we proceeded to stack
the images using both an average and median stack for comparison.
The size measurement we used was the half-light radius from SE.
In the following plots we present the results derived from the me-
dian stack using the barycentre centroid, however we comment on
any different results found using the other methods. We obtained er-
rors on our stacked size measurements using bootstrap resampling.
At the bright-end where there are very few sources in each bin this
essentially measures the spread of the individual sizes in that bin."
3.2.2 Results
"In Fig. 3 we show the observed sizes of the stack galaxy images,
uncorrected for the PSF, as a function of 𝑀UV for the ground-based
and HST data. At the faint-end of our sample we find that the galaxy
stacks are resolved even in the ground-based data, with measured
half-light radii in the range 𝑟1/2 ' 0.55–0.6 arcsec as compared to
𝑟1/2 ' 0.4–0.45 arcsec for the PSF. As we move to brighter galaxy
stacks there is a gentle increase in size until𝑀UV ' −22.5, where we
see a drop to smaller sizes that are consistent with being unresolved.
The results from the HSC 𝐼-band and the CFHT 𝑖-band are consistent
within the errors for both fields. In COSMOS, where we also have the
higher resolution imaging HST 𝐼814 data, the drop in size observed
in the ground-based and HST data occurs at a consistent 𝑀UV. The
wider area covered by XMM-LSS can also explain the shallower
decline in size bright-ward of 𝑀UV = −23 as compared to the COS-
MOS result, because this larger volume will result in rarer bright
galaxies being detected. Indeed, we identify a spectroscopically con-
firmed galaxy at 𝑀UV = −23.6 (see Section 3.3). In both COSMOS
and XMM-LSS, the brightest sources all appeared as point-source in
the ground-based data, however we found that in some cases the mea-
sured 𝑟1/2 was larger than expected due to blending with foreground
galaxies.
In order to measure the size-luminosity relation we corrected for"
"the effect of the PSF by subtracting in quadrature the 𝑟1/2 measured
for stars in the imaging. This is an approximate correction for the
PSF, however we use it for comparison with previous studies. The
size-luminosity relation was measured from theHST/ACS data only,
as these data provide the most robust size measurements due to
the smaller effect of the PSF (which has 𝑟1/2 = 0.0725 arcsec).
We then converted the 𝑟1/2 into a physical distance by assuming a
redshift of 𝑧 = 4.0. The resulting size-luminosity relation derived
from the HST/ACS data is shown in Fig. 4. As expected from this
effective rescaling of the observed sizes shown in Fig. 3, we see a
clear drop in size at 𝑀UV < −22.5. To determine the size-luminosity
relation from the sample we therefore fit to the points faint-ward of
this magnitude, assuming the standard parameterisation of 𝑟1/2 ∝ 𝐿𝛽
(e.g. Shen et al. 2003). We find a best fitting slope of 𝛽 = 0.16 ±
0.03, with a normalisation given by 𝑅0 = 1.45 ± 0.02 at 𝑀UV ="

"−21.0. If we use the SE single-component centroid (e.g. prior to
recombining de-blended components), we derive an identical slope,
but a lower normalisation of 𝑅0 = 1.36±0.02. We find no difference
in resultswhen using an average stack instead of themedian presented
here. Our derived size-luminosity relation is consistent with that
determined by Huang et al. (2013), who found 𝛽 = 0.22 ± 0.06,
and Curtis-Lake et al. 2016 who found 𝛽 = 0.06 ± 0.11. We find an
offset compared to the relation derived in Curtis-Lake et al. (2016),
which we attribute to the different measurement of size used by that
study.
By extrapolating our fitted size-luminosity relation to brighter"
"magnitudes, it is evident that there is a dramatic drop in the observed
sizes of 𝑧 ' 4 sources. We attribute this drop to the increasing contri-
bution of point-sources bright-ward of 𝑀UV = −22.5, in agreement
with the visual morphologies shown in Fig. 2. The transition occurs
over almost one magnitude, being complete around 𝑀UV = −23.25

extended sources up to 𝑀UV ' −24."
3.3 Rest-frame UV spectroscopy
"To inform further our classification of sources as SF or AGN-
dominated in the ‘transition’ region observed in the size-luminosity
relation, we retrieved the publicly available spectra available for the
sample. While the brightest sources in our sample are confirmed
from magnitude limited surveys (e.g. SDSS, zCOSMOS), there is
a dearth of spectra in the range −23.5 < 𝑀UV < −22.5, as is vis-
ible in Fig. 1 and shown in Table A1. Nevertheless, we compiled
the publicly available spectra and present the results for all sources
brighter than 𝑀UV = −22 in Fig. 5. We smoothed the spectra with
a box-car filter of width 1000 km/s in the rest-frame, to highlight
the spectral features above the noise. The brightest seven sources
show broad emission lines of NV _1240Å, SiIV __1393, 1402 and
CIV__1548, 1550Å in addition to strong Lyman-𝛼 emission, all of
which are clear signatures of unobscured AGN spectra. In addition
to the typical AGN spectra, we identify source that show the ap-
pearance of SF-dominated light in the rest-frame UV. Faint-ward of
𝑀UV = −24we see amajority of sources that show the appearance of
SF-dominated light, with narrow Lyman-𝛼 emission and absorption
lines. Of particular interest is ID1448401 which is the most luminous
source (𝑀UV = −23.6) in this sub-sample to show a SF-dominated
spectrum.We discuss the implications for the discovery of this object
for the LF in Section 4. Within the SF-dominated objects, we see a
large variation in the observed spectra, with some showing strong
Lyman-𝛼 and others showing a continuum break and no appreciable
Lyman-𝛼 emission.
The sources shown in Fig. 5 are particularly bright which makes"
"it relatively straightforward to see the presence of SF or AGN-type
features in the spectra. Even with this limited spectroscopic sub-
sample, it is evident that there is a transition in the rest-frame UV
spectra of 𝑧 ' 4 sources between −24.0 < 𝑀UV < −22.0. Fainter"
"than 𝑀UV = −22.4 we find only one other spectrum that shows clear
evidence of AGN signatures, both through a visual inspection of the
smoothed data and through an analysis of the spectral flags provided
by each survey. The spectrumof this faintAGN is shown in Fig 6. This
source was observed as part of the VANDELS survey of the XMM-
LSS field and has 𝑧spec = 3.9407 and 𝑀UV = −21.0. It lies outside
the region ofHST data fromCANDELS, however it appears extended
in the ground-based HSC I-band data, with a PSF uncorrected 𝑟1/2 =
0.77 arcsec. In the spectrum there are again strong emission lines
of high-ionization species including CIV and HeII. In comparison
to the brighter AGN shown in Fig. 5 however, ID520330 shows
stronger and considerably narrower emission lines. We measured
the FWHM of the CIV doublet in all of the spectra shown, both
directly from the smoothed data and through fitting a simple model
of two Gaussians at the doublet wavelengths (constrained to have the
same normalisation and standard-deviation). Bothmethods produced
consistent results within the errors. The result of this analysis was
that the brighter AGN in our sample show CIV 𝐹𝑊𝐻𝑀 ' 2000–
6000 km/s, as found for the general population of SDSS quasars
for example (e.g. Vanden Berk et al. 2001). In contrast, the faint
source ID520330 shows a significantly narrower width of 𝐹𝑊𝐻𝑀 =
1200 ± 100 km/s. Similarly, this faint source has the highest rest-
frame equivalent width of CIV amongst the AGN spectra, showing
𝐸𝑊0 ' 150 ± 30Å. This is to be compared with 𝐸𝑊0 ' 20–90Å for
the brighter sources. Emission lines of this width and strength are
characteristic of obscured Type II AGN (e.g. Alexandroff et al. 2013),
where only the narrow line region is observed. The fact that we see
Type II signatures in the faintest source in the rest-frame UV is also
to be expected, as the bright continuum from the AGN is obscured
in this case. Thus for this source we are observing predominantly the
host galaxy continuum, with the addition of AGN emission lines."
4 SEPARATING THE UV LF OF AGN AND LBGS
"As expected, the brightest sources in our 𝑧 ' 4 sample appear to
be AGN-dominated in the rest-frame UV, showing a point-source
morphology in the HST/ACS imaging and strong quasar features in
the rest-frame UV spectra. Faint-ward of 𝑀UV ' −22.5 however,
the sources become extended, with spectra that are dominated by
the light from young stars. In the ‘transition’ regime between these
AGN and SF-dominated objects, we find evidence for a mixture
of these two classes in our sample. In this Section we use these
observations to infer the rest-frame UV LF of the two components,
with the assumption that the majority of the sources in our sample
can be separated into either an AGN or SF-dominated category. The
existence of a slightly extended source that shows the rest-frame
UV spectrum of an AGN (see Section 3.1) demonstrates that this
assumption will break down depending on how AGN are distributed
in the underlying galaxy population. We discuss this issue further in
Section 6."
4.1 AGN fraction
"To separate AGN and galaxies in our sample we define an AGN frac-
tion ( 𝑓AGN) as a function of absolute UVmagnitude.We first define a
quantitative measure of AGN-dominated sources from the 𝐼814-band
high-resolution images by assigning objects with a 𝑟1/2 < 0.1 arcsec
as AGN. In addition, we determined a comparison 𝑓AGN from the
visual morphology of the brightest sources. Despite this being more
subjective than a size cut we found very close agreement between
these two measures. As a final check we also used GALFIT to fit"

"the stacked images in each 𝑀UV bin. We used a two component
model consisting of a point-source and a Sérsic profile (with a fixed
index of 𝑛 = 1). Reassuringly the AGN fraction of each stack, as
defined by the ratio of the flux in the point-source compared to the
total flux, agreed very well with the size cut. Hence we are confident"
"that the derived AGN fraction from the source morphology does not
depend significantly on the method used to derive it. Faint-ward of
𝑀UV = −22, the smaller mean sizes of galaxies coupled with the
scatter in the galaxy size-luminosity relation makes it more chal-
lenging to separate compact galaxies from point-sources using a size
criterion. Hencewe do not present measurements of themorphology-
based 𝑓AGN for sources faintward of 𝑀UV = −22. We also defined
an AGN fraction from archival spectra for a sub-set of our sample.
Using the spectra presented in Fig. 5 we identified AGN-dominated
sources according to the presence of strong emission lines of CIV,
NV and HeII. Due to the small number of sources with spectra we
used wider bins than for our morphology measurement. We deter-
mined the centre of each bin by taking the average source luminosity
to negate any bias in the distribution of sources within that bin. Faint-
ward of −22.0 we find only one source which has AGN signatures
in the available spectroscopy sample. This source is identified as a
Type II AGN (ID520330) in which the rest-frame UV continuum
is dominated by the host-galaxy light and we therefore define this
source as SF-dominated (as discussed in Section 6.3)."

"morphological and spectroscopic measurements show a sharp drop
in the 𝑓AGN between −24 . 𝑀UV . −22.5, with around equal
occurrence of AGN and LBGs at around 𝑀UV ' −23.2. This is also
visually apparent in the stacked HST/ACS images (top of Fig. 7),
where at𝑀UV ' −23 the stack is clearly extended (althoughwith less
flux in the wings) while at𝑀UV ' −23.8 the image is consistent with
being a point-source. Comparing to previous estimates of the 𝑓AGN at
𝑧 ' 4 we find good agreement with the spectroscopy measurements
of Ono et al. (2018), who used predominantly archival redshifts with
spectroscopic flags to determine the AGN fraction. The advantage of
our method of AGN classification from the full spectrum is that we
are not sensitive to differences between AGN classifications between
spectroscopic surveys. We find a brighter transition magnitude than
that of Sobral et al. (2018), who found a drop in the fraction of AGN
at 𝑀UV = −21.5 at 𝑧 ' 2–3. This study was based on the follow-up
of strong Lyman-𝛼 emitters rather than LBGs, and hence it could
be expected that this pre-selection for strong line-emitters would
preferentially detect AGN at fainter magnitudes. We note however,
that in Sobral et al. (2018) the AGN fraction at 𝑀UV > −22.5 is
determined from sources predominantly from a detection of the NV
line with low S/N (. 3.0), their classification as AGN is somewhat
uncertain.
At −23 < 𝑀UV < −22 we see a slight difference in the de-"
"rived AGN fraction from our morphological and spectroscopic mea-
surements. From a morphology cut we measure 𝑓AGN = 0.06+0.03−0.02
at 𝑀UV = −22.5 while with spectroscopic data we find 𝑓AGN ="
"0.25+0.17−0.12. Although the errors are large, due predominantly to the
small number statistics for the spectroscopic sub-sample, a difference
between the 𝑓AGN between a strict morphological selection and spec-
troscopic identification could be expected in this magnitude range.
This is a consequence of the increasing importance of host galaxy
light at fainter UV magnitudes, and we present a toy model that can
explain these observations in Section 6. Alternatively the slight dif-
ference found could be due to bias in the spectroscopic measurement,
as arguably the strong emission lines fromAGN and the compactness
of the emission could make them easier to identify in spectroscopic
measurements. In the range −23 < 𝑀UV < −22 we find no differ-
ence between the sizes of the spectroscopically confirmed sources
and our full sample, suggesting that we are not biased to compact
sources. In this magnitude range we find 10 sources with archival
spectroscopy, four from the VANDELS survey and six from VVDS
(of which eight with secure flags are shown in Fig. 5). While VVDS
is a purely I-band magnitude limited survey, VANDELS selected
against compact sources over 50 percent of the survey area that was
covered byHST imaging (McLure et al. 2018), and hence VANDELS
should be biased against AGN. If we measure the 𝑓AGN in the VVDS
and VANDELS survey separately, we find 𝑓AGN = 0.25+0.25−0.15 for both
surveys when secure flags are used, indicating that there is no clear
bias within the limitations of small number statistics. Two of the
VVDS spectra were not included in our initial AGN fraction calcu-
lation as they have poor quality flags. If we assume these objects are
SF-dominated, under the assumption that AGN features are easier to
identify, then we obtain a lower 𝑓AGN = 0.20+0.15−0.10 in this magnitude
range. This value is still higher than that derived from our morphol-
ogy measurement, however larger spectroscopic samples are clearly
required to determine if there is a real discrepancy between the 𝑓AGN
found from a strict morphological cut in contrast to a classification
from spectroscopy.
In Fig. 7 we also present the predicted AGN fraction from the si-"
"multaneous fitting of the combined AGN and LBG LF presented
in Adams et al. (2020). Adams et al. (2020) assumed either a
Schechter function or DPL form for the LBG LF in addition to a
single power-law (PL) to model the faint-end of the AGN. Without
any further information about the nature of the sources, both models
produced a good fit for the observed UV LF over −26 < 𝑀UV < −20
(see left panel of Fig. 8). In comparison to our derived 𝑓AGN we see
that the Schechter function form of the LBG LF predicts a steeper
decline in the fraction of AGN at fainter magnitudes than a DPL
model, due to the exponential drop-off at the bright-end of this pa-
rameterisation. Note that the position of this drop depends on the
position of the ‘knee’ in the LF, which is strongly constrained by the
number density of sources 𝑀UV > −21. Both our measurements of
the AGN fraction deviate from this steeper Schechter prediction at
𝑀UV ∼ −24, as do the results of Ono et al. (2018), suggesting that
a DPL is the more appropriate function to describe the LBG LF at
𝑧 ' 4."
4.2 The Luminosity Function
"In the previous section we compared the observed 𝑓AGN to that ex-
pected from the fitting of the full AGN + LBG rest-frame UV LF. In
this section we instead use the 𝑓AGN derived in this study to separate
the LF results of Adams et al. (2020) into AGN and SF-dominated
subsamples. Because we could only classify a small fraction of the
full sample using the morphology and spectroscopy data (e.g. be-
cause high-resolution imaging was only available in COSMOS, and
the spectroscopy data only covers ∼ 1 percent of the sample), we
elected to apply the 𝑓AGN to the data points from Adams et al. (2020)"
"MNRAS 000, 1–15 (2020)"
SF to AGN transition at z ' 4 9
"as opposed to recalculating the LF from a significantly smaller sam-
ple. We determined the separate LFs by using the AGN fractions
derived from the morphology and spectroscopy results separately.
To interpolate the 𝑓AGN we fit a constrained model to our binned
AGN fraction points shown in Fig. 7. The model consisted of two
power-laws to approximate the overlap between the bright-end of
the galaxy LF and the faint-end of the AGN LF without over-fitting
the data. Due to the difference in the 𝑓AGN derived from using the
morphological and spectroscopic data, we find differences in the sep-
arate LFs for the AGN and SF dominated sources as shown in the
two right-hand plots in Fig. 8.
We present the results of fitting the separated AGN and SF-"
"dominated LFs with different parameterisations in Fig. 8. The best-fit
parameters are presented in Table 1 in comparison to the LF param-
eters derived from the simultaneous fit of Adams et al. (2020). The
AGN fractions derived from these fits in comparison to the results
of Adams et al. (2020) are presented in Appendix B. We fit our sep-
arated AGN-dominated UV LFs using a single power-law, as we do
not extend faint-ward of the apparent LF knee at 𝑀UV ∼ −26. For
the SF LF we fit using both a Schechter function or a DPL. If we
focus first on the SF-dominated results, we find that the separation
of sources using a morphology or spectroscopy criterion makes only
a marginal difference to the derived LF. This is evident in the fitting
results presented in Table 1, where the values are well within the 1𝜎
errors in the different scenarios. We also find good consistency with
the Schechter and DPL parameters from Adams et al. (2020), which
is to be expected as the LBG fit is predominantly constrained by the
data-points at 𝑀UV > −22. We checked that the impact of strong
gravitational lensing on a Schechter function fit could not reproduce
the number of bright sources by applying the methodology of Mason
et al. (2015); Barone-Nugent et al. (2015). The excess that results
from the lensing is shown in Fig. 8 and is too small to account for
the number density we find at 𝑀UV < −23.
In contrast to the SF-dominated LF, the faint-end of the AGN-"
"dominated LF depends more significantly on the assumed 𝑓AGN.
If we use a morphology criterion we find a shallow slope (𝛼 =
−1.19±0.05) due to the rapid drop in point-source dominated sources
faint-ward of 𝑀UV ' −23. In this case, we find close agreement with
the results of Akiyama et al. (2018), who derived a faint-end slope
of 𝛼 = −1.30 ± 0.05. This is to be expected given that Akiyama
et al. (2018) identified AGN based on a compactness criterion in
the ground-based HSC data. If instead we use our spectroscopic
criterion in determining 𝑓AGN we find a significantly steeper slope of
the faint-end of the AGNLF of 𝛼 = −1.85±0.05. In this case our data
points start to diverge from the Akiyama et al. (2018) points, due to
a higher proportion of AGN-dominated sources at faint magnitudes
in this parameterisation (see Fig. 7). Adams et al. (2020) found
𝛼 = −1.66+0.29−0.58 in the fit of a DPL (LBG component) with a PL
(AGN component). The large error on this value is a consequence of
the degeneracy between the bright-end slope of the LBG LF and the
AGN faint-end slope. Our measurement of the slope of the faint-end
of theAGNLF ismore constrained by the data-points at𝑀UV & −24,
which allows us to find a best-fit that is shallower, but still consistent
within 1.5𝜎, from the Adams et al. (2020) result."
5 DISCUSSION
"In this work we have investigated the transition in the properties
of 𝑧 ' 4 sources at 𝑀UV ' −23, where the number densities of
faint-AGN and bright-galaxies converge. From our imaging data we
observe a change in the source morphology, through a sharp drop"

"in the average size of sources in the size-luminosity relation that is
also seen in the individual source morphology. We also see a change
in the features present in the available rest-frame UV spectra for the
sample. The absolute UV magnitude at which this transition occurs
corresponds to the point of rapid decline in the bright-end of the
galaxy LF. Furthermore, the form of the increase in the AGN fraction
to brighter magnitudes depends on the shape of the galaxy LF bright-
ward of the knee in the function (𝑀UV ' −21; see Table 1). There
has been an ongoing discussion on the shape of the rest-frame UV at
high-redshifts.While theUVLF at 𝑧 & 4 has typically been fitted by a
Schechter function (e.g. McLure et al. 2013; Finkelstein et al. 2015;
Bouwens et al. 2015), recent results have demonstrated an excess
of highly luminous galaxies in relation to the Schechter function
predictions (Bowler et al. 2014; Ono et al. 2018; Bowler et al. 2020).
In our derived AGN fraction, and in the corresponding SF-dominated
LFs, we have found evidence for a shallower decline in the number
density of the brightest SF galaxies at 𝑧 ' 4. Most strikingly, the
discovery of an extremely bright source at 𝑀UV = −23.6 with no
evidence for AGN spectral features (ID1448401 in Fig. 5) supports a
𝑓AGN ' 0.8 (range within the errors of 0.38–0.95) at this magnitude,
which leads to a number density of sources well in excess of the
Schechter function prediction. This finding is potentially in conflict
with studies that have found support for a Schechter function form
at 𝑧 ' 3–4 (van der Burg et al. 2010; Hathi et al. 2010; Bian et al.
2013; Parsa et al. 2016), however it is only recently that the datasets
available at 𝑧 ' 4 have had sufficient volume to adequately constrain
the number density of the rarest galaxies/faint-AGN. If we fit our SF-
dominated LF with a DPL, the results are in good agreement with
the evolution in the DPL parameters derived in Bowler et al. (2015,
2020), who found a steady steepening of the bright-end from 𝑧 ' 9 to
𝑧 ' 5 consistent with the increasing impact of dust. If this steepening"

magnification bias on the Schechter function is shown as the blue shaded excess on this curve. In all three plots we show the AGN results from Akiyama et al.
(2018) as the grey filled circles."
"is due to dust obscuration in the most highly star-forming galaxies,
then the effects of this dust should be observable both in the colours of
bright LBGs and directly via reprocessed emission in the far-infrared.
Interestingly, the brightest spectroscopically confirmed LBG in our
sample (ID1448401) shows a very blue rest-frame UV continuum
(rest-frame UV slope 𝐹_ ∝ _𝛽 ; 𝛽 ' −2). From the observed colour-
magnitude relation at this redshift, this source would be expected to
show a redder slope with 𝛽 ' −1.4 (Lee et al. 2011; Bouwens et al.
2014). Rogers et al. (2014) demonstrated that at 𝑧 ' 5 there is an
increased scatter in the rest-frame UV slopes of LBGs to brighter
magnitudes, and thus it is plausible that this LBG is a rare example
of a highly star-forming galaxy (𝑆𝐹𝑅 ' 80M�/yr; Madau et al.
1998) with little dust attenuation at this redshift. Thus while overall
the increased production and attenuation of dust in the most highly
SF galaxies from 𝑧 ' 9–4 could cause a steepening of the bright-end
slope of the rest-frame UV LF, this does not preclude the existence
of galaxies with high-SFRs and a lack of dust obscuration within this
epoch."
5.1 The faint-end of the AGN UV LF
"There has been a renewed interest in recent years on the slope of the
faint-end of the rest-frame UV LF of AGN. This was motivated by
the claimed detection of high-redshift X-ray sources by Giallongo
et al. (2015), who used their data to suggest that UV-faint AGN
could contribute significantly to the process of reionization at 𝑧 >
6. Such an analysis relies on the integral of an extrapolated rest-
frame UV LF to determine the total number of ionizing photons
that can be produced by AGN at very high-redshifts. The subsequent
studies of Boutsia et al. (2018) and Giallongo et al. (2019) have
further claimed an excess in sources at the faint-end of the 𝑧 ' 4.
While several works have called these results into question (e.g. Parsa
et al. 2018; McGreer et al. 2018; Cowie et al. 2020) at 𝑧 > 4, the
determination of an accurate slope of the faint-end of the AGN LF
remains of interest. Our observations demonstrate that the derived
slope of the 𝑧 ' 4AGNLF depends strongly on the selectionmethod.
We can reproduce the flatter slope found in Akiyama et al. (2018)"
"by using a criterion on morphology to separate AGN-dominated
sources from the full 𝑧 ' 4 LF. If instead we use a spectroscopic
determination of 𝑓AGN to estimate the AGN LF, we derive a steeper
faint-end slope (𝛼 ∼ −1.8). The rest-frameUVspectroscopic features
of AGN are strong and broad emission lines (e.g. Fig. 5), while LBGs
are expected to show absorption features or potentially weak nebular
emission lines (Stark et al. 2014; Shapley et al. 2003; Steidel et al.
2016). Thus we expect any classification of a source as an AGN
based on the rest-frame UV spectrum to be sensitive to not only
the brightest AGN-dominated objects, but also objects in which the
light from SF is significant. Instead, AGN selections that include a
point-like morphology selection will exclude objects where the host
galaxy UV light causes the source to be rejected as too extended.
Given the wide range in imaging depths and compactness criterion
used in different AGN selections, it is challenging to understand
the incompleteness of previous studies due to this effect. It is clear
however, fromour study and otherworks (e.g.Matsuoka et al. 2018b),
that faint-ward of𝑀UV ' −24 it is necessary to account for bothAGN
and SF-dominated sources."
5.2 Evolution of the AGN to SF transition into the EoR
"Both the AGN and LBG rest-frame UV LFs are known to evolve
rapidly at 𝑧 & 4. In Bowler et al. (2020) we found evidence for
a flattening of the bright-end slope with increasing redshift in the
range 𝑧 = 5–10, with a corresponding evolution in 𝑀∗ according to
Δ𝑀∗/Δ𝑧 ' −0.5. This was interpreted as a result of decreased dust
obscuration and mass quenching within the Epoch of Reionization
(EoR). Such a change in shape would be imprinted onto themeasured
AGN fraction at these redshifts, with a predicted fainter transition
magnitude and extended tail of highly luminous SF galaxies. This
prediction is consistent with the tentative detection of weak AGN
features in the rest-frame UV spectra of moderately bright LBGs
at 𝑧 & 6 (Laporte et al. 2017; Tilvi et al. 2016), as we predict a
higher 𝑓AGN to fainter magnitudes within this epoch. These detec-
tions however, are at odds with the expected number density of faint
AGNs at 𝑧 ' 6, which have been shown to undergo an accelerated"
"MNRAS 000, 1–15 (2020)"
SF to AGN transition at z ' 4 11
"decline at 𝑧 > 5 (McGreer et al. 2013; Jiang et al. 2016). From
the extrapolated number densities of high-redshift AGN, we do not
expect that current LBG samples at 𝑧 ≥ 7 will contain any AGN-
dominated sources, as AGN are only expected to be more numerous
than LBGs at 𝑀UV ≤ −24 (see discussion in Bowler et al. 2014).
This is consistent with the lack of point-sources found at 𝑧 ' 6–7,
where it has been possible to gain high-resolution imaging of the
brightest sources with HST (Jiang et al. 2013; Bowler et al. 2017).
These somewhat conflicting results could be a result of weaker AGN
residing within high-redshift LBGs, or misclassification of emission
lines as AGN signatures. Taking the results of this study coupled
with what is known about the evolving UV LFs to higher redshifts,
we predict that AGN ‘contamination’ of rest-frame UV selection
samples faint-ward of 𝑀UV ' −23 will be minimal at 𝑧 ≥ 7."
6 A SIMPLE MODEL OF THE AGN UV LF
"We created a toy model of the predicted rest-frame UV LF of AGN
to aid in the interpretation of our observations. The model takes
the observed UV LF of LBGs and uses this, via simple empirical
relations, to estimate the luminosity and number density of UV-
bright AGN at the same epoch."
6.1 Method
"For each galaxy of a given absolute UV magnitude, we first estimate
the stellar mass according to the relation found by Duncan et al.
(2014):"
log10 (𝑀★) = (9.02 ± 0.02) (𝑀UV + 19.5) − (0.45 ± 0.02). (1)
"The slope and normalisation of this relation is consistent between
different studies (e.g. Salmon et al. 2015; Song et al. 2016; see figure
5 of Tacchella et al. 2018). This relation has been derived in the
past to determine the stellar mass functions at high-redshift from the
rest-frame UV LF, where the effect of scatter is essential in order to
reproduce the observedmass and LFs (Stark et al. 2013; Duncan et al.
2014). We therefore include a scatter of 0.4 dex in the relationship
above, which is consistent with that required in Duncan et al. (2014)
and is at the upper end of the measured intrinsic scatter in the 𝑆𝐹𝑅–
𝑀★ relation (Curtis-Lake et al. 2020; Salmon et al. 2015). From the
stellar mass we then estimate the black holemass using the𝑚BH−𝑀★
relation of the form:"
log10 (𝑚BH) = 𝐺BH [log10 (𝑀★) + 11.0] + 𝐼BH (2)
"Here𝐺BH = 𝑑log10 (𝑚BH)/𝑑𝑀★ gives the gradient of the relation
and 𝐼BH the intercept (defined at a mass of log10 (𝑀★/M�) = 11.0).
The form or even existence of such a relationship at high-redshift
is uncertain. We therefore consider two plausible scenarios based
on previous results from both luminous quasars at high-redshift and
low-redshift galaxies. The simplest scenario is one in which the
black-hole mass is a constant fraction of the stellar mass at a given
redshift. In this case (denoted model A hereafter) we set 𝐺BH = 1.0
and 𝐼BH = 9.0 + log10 (1 + 𝑧) to give 𝑚BH/𝑀★ = 0.05 at 𝑧 = 4,
as found in observations of high-redshift quasars (e.g. Venemans
et al. 2017; Targett et al. 2012). The 1 + 𝑧 term follows observations
and theoretical arguments for an increased 𝑚BH to bulge-mass ratio
at high-redshifts (e.g. Venemans et al. 2015; Croton 2006; Wyithe
& Loeb 2003). Such high ratios of 𝑚BH/𝑀★ may not be represen-
tative of the AGN population at this redshift (e.g due to selection"
"effects), hence we treat this scenario as an extreme case. An alterna-
tive scenario is one in which black holes in more massive galaxies are
over-developed, whereas those in less massive sources are a smaller
fraction of the stellarmass. Such a scenario has beenmeasured at low-
redshift by Reines &Volonteri (2015). In this case (denoted as model
B hereafter) we set 𝐺BH = 1.4 and 𝐼BH = 8.95 + log10 (1 + 𝑧). Scat-
ter is also significant in the 𝑚BH-𝑀★ relation (e.g.see Hirschmann
et al. 2010; Volonteri & Reines 2016), and we therefore include an
intrinsic scatter of 0.3 dex. The result of these steps is a relationship
between the 𝑀UV of a LBG and the estimated 𝑚BH. The 𝑚BH can
then be converted into an estimated bolometric luminosity using an
assumption on the Eddington ratio. We assume a log-normal distri-
bution of mean _ = 0.6 and 𝜎 = 0.3 dex as found by Willott et al.
2010b (see also Kelly & Shen 2013). Finally we convert the bolo-
metric luminosity into a UV luminosity by assuming a bolometric
correction (taken to be 4.4; Runnoe et al. 2012;Mortlock et al. 2011).
From a single 𝑀UV from SF we thus obtain a spread in the predicted
total absolute UV magnitude due to the addition of an unobscured
black hole (𝑀UV,BH).
Following these steps resulted in a simulated AGN LF with a"
"relative flat shape at the bright-end. This is in contrast with the knee
in the function around 𝑀★ ∼ −26 found in observations. This effect
arises in ourmodel from the creation of infeasiblymassive black holes
and galaxies, due to the application of scatter in the relations between
𝑀UV, 𝑀★ and 𝑚BH. While the form of the bright-end of the AGN
LF does not impact the results of this work, we nevertheless impose
a crude cut in the stellar and black-hole masses to remove these
unrealistic sources. We take a limiting stellar mass of log10 (𝑀★) =
10.8 from the characteristic mass of high-redshift galaxies (e.g. Ilbert
et al. 2013; McLeod et al. 2020), and impose an upper limit on the
black-hole mass of log10 (𝑚BH) = 9.5 to approximate the drop in
the (uncertain) black-hole mass functions at 𝑧 ' 4 (e.g. Shankar
et al. 2009; Kelly & Merloni 2012). If a model galaxy/black hole
exceeds these mass limits due to scatter, we allocate a lower mass
at random according to the relations described above. The result of
this simple process is a knee in the AGN LF in good agreement
with the observations. We calculate the results of this analysis for
both the Schechter and DPL form presented in Adams et al. (2020),
where they fitted to only points at 𝑀UV > −22.0 to ensure that
the results were not influenced by AGN-dominated sources. The
resulting AGN LF depends only weakly on the assumed shape of
the LBG LF because the majority of the simulated AGN are hosted
in galaxies with 𝑀𝑈𝑉 > −22.0 where there is good agreement
between the Schechter and DPL fits. In contrast, the ratio of AGN
to SF-dominated sources at 𝑀UV ∼ −23 does rely on the LBG LF
shape, as it depends on how steeply the LBG LF drops-off at the
bright-end (see Section 5).
To obtain a predicted AGN LF that matches the number density"
"of quasars known at 𝑧 ' 4 we include two factors to modulate
the number of LBGs that host an AGN. The first is the obscured
fraction, which describes how many ‘on’ AGN are not bright in
the rest-frame UV continuum (e.g. are obscured Type II AGN). We
fixed 𝑓obsc. = 0.6 (Ueda et al. 2014; Vito et al. 2018). The second
modulating factor is the fraction of galaxies that host an active black
hole, which is a proxy for the duty cycle of AGN activity. The 𝑓active
was determined in our model as the factor required to bring the
predicted AGN LF in agreement with the observed AGN LF in the
range −27 < 𝑀UV < −24. We find 𝑓active = 0.0007 for model A
and 𝑓active = 0.003 for model B. Note that 𝑓active is not directly
comparable to the duty cycle of AGN activity, as it is the fraction of
AGN that appear bright in the rest-frame UV rather than the fraction
of active black holes."

6.2 Results
"We present the results of this analysis in comparison with the ob-
served LBG and AGN rest-frame UV LF in Fig. 9. Despite the
simplicity of the model, it does a reasonable job at reproducing the
shape of the observed 𝑧 ' 4 AGN LF at luminosities bright-ward of
𝑀UV ' −23.5. A striking feature of the predicted LFs shown in Fig. 9
is the dominant role of scatter which is well known to be important
from observations of the brightest quasars (e.g. Venemans et al. 2017;
Willott et al. 2013; Targett et al. 2012). Furthermore, both models
predict a similarly steep faint-end slope consistent with that found by
other empirical predictions (e.g. Veale et al. 2014; Ren et al. 2020;
Delvecchio et al. 2020). For sources around 𝑀UV ' −23, our two
models give different predictions for the importance of scatter in the
observed galaxies. This has consequences for the expected morphol-
ogy and spectroscopic properties of sources around this magnitude.
TheAGNLFs fromour toymodel do not show the flattening observed
in the results of Akiyama et al. (2018) faint-ward of 𝑀UV ' −24.
Akiyama et al. (2018) used a moment based measure to select com-
pact sources in ground-based HSC data, while our model does not
make any assumption about the size or morphology of each model
galaxy/AGN. If we impose the condition that the AGN luminosity
must be a certain multiple of the stellar light (e.g. 𝐿BH/𝐿SF & 10)
then we are able to reproduce the flattening found in the data, but
only in the case where the black-hole mass is an increasing fraction
of the stellar mass (model B). The magnitude of the cut is motivated
by previous studies comparing the host galaxy and AGN emission in
the rest-frame UV and optical for sources selected as quasars (typi-
cally Δ𝑀 = 2–3mag; Jahnke et al. 2004; Schramm et al. 2008; Goto
et al. 2009; Mechtley et al. 2016; Lawther et al. 2018) When fitting
the Akiyama et al. (2018) points with the ratio as a free parameter,
we found a best-fit ratio of 𝐿BH/𝐿SF = 12.5 ± 0.5 for model B. The
drop in the AGN LF in this case is due to the host galaxy rest-frame
UV light becoming significant at 𝑀UV > −23. Such a cut is incom-
plete to fainter AGN (relative to their host galaxy UV emission) and
therefore results in an artificial flattening in the observed AGN LF as
shown in Fig. 9. If instead black holes populate host galaxies as in our
model A, where the effect of scatter in shaping the observed AGN
LF at fainter magnitudes is dominant, then such a flattening is not
predicted with this relative luminosity cut. The effect can also be seen
in Fig. 10 where we compare the observed 𝑓AGN to that predicted
from our model. These results demonstrate that the morphological
and spectroscopic properties of sources around 𝑀UV ' −23 gives
important information about how active black holes are distributed
within host galaxies. If the rest-frame UV is always dominated by
light from the AGN, then selections based on a point-sources condi-
tion will be complete (model A). Such a selection will not be feasible
to fainter magnitudes however, due to LBGs themselves becoming
more compact. If instead the host galaxy light can become important
at fainter magnitudes, as in our model B, then we see a distinct in-
completeness in point-source selections for AGN at 𝑀UV > −23. In
this case it becomes essential to define the relative ‘AGN-strength’
that is being included with a given selection methodology, to fully
understand what population is being measured."
6.3 Obscured Type-II AGN
"So far in this work we have considered only unobscured Type I AGN,
which we expect to contribute significantly to the rest-frame UV
continuum luminosity of the source. In the orientation-based unified
model of AGNwe also expect obscured Type II-like AGN, where the
presence of an AGN is only observable in the UV via narrow emis-"

"sion lines. In our model of the AGN LF as derived from the LBG
LF, we can predict the number density of these obscured sources.
Interestingly, our preferred model (model B), which can better ex-
plain our observations of the 𝑓AGN and the observed flattening of
the faint-end slope found by Akiyama et al. (2018), also predicts an
increased contribution of obscured AGN at 𝑀UV > −22. This is a
natural consequence of our assumed active and obscured fractions of
galaxies in the model. In model B we expect to see an increased con-
tribution from obscured AGN at fainter magnitudes, with the number
densities of ‘obscured’ and ‘unobscured’ sources becoming compa-
rable (within a factor of < 5) at 𝑀UV & −21. While there are many
assumptions and uncertainties in this prediction, we note that faint-
ward of𝑀UV = −22we detect one source with clear AGN signatures
in the compilation of spectra for our sample. This source, ID520330,
appears to be an obscured Type II source (Fig. 6) at 𝑀UV = −21.
From this one object we estimate the number density of obscured
AGN at this magnitude is around 𝜙 = 7 ± 7 × 10−6 /mag/Mpc3,
which despite the huge uncertainties is within a factor of ten from
our model prediction (model B: Fig. 9). These arguments demon-
strate that there is still considerable uncertainty in the faint-end of
the 𝑧 ' 4 AGN UV LF depending on how AGN are defined and on
the selection procedure. Given the large samples of 𝑧 ' 4 sources
available to-date from deep optical/NIR surveys (e.g. Adams et al.
2020; Ono et al. 2018; Bouwens et al. 2015), the next steps to over-
come this challenge do not require substantial increases in sample
size. Rather, in this work we have demonstrated that with a combi-
nation of magnitude limited spectroscopic follow-up, coupled with
high-resolution imaging, it will be possible to probe the connection
between faint-AGN and their galaxy hosts."
7 CONCLUSIONS
"We present the size, morphology and spectroscopic properties of
a sample of 3.5 < 𝑧 < 4.5 galaxies and AGN selected based on a"
"photometric redshift fitting analysis inAdams et al. (2020). The broad
magnitude range probed by the parent sample (−26 . 𝑀UV . −20)
allows us to uniquely probe the transition between SF- and AGN-
dominated sources. We use both ground-based and HST imaging
data to identify the changes in morphology and size, and archival
spectra to detect signatures of AGN in the rest-frame UV spectrum.
The key conclusions of this study are as follows."
"• We find the expected galaxy size-luminosity relation up to an
absolute UV magnitude of 𝑀UV = −22.5, beyond which we observe
a steep downturn due to the increasing presence of objects with
a point-source morphology. The effect is seen in both the high-
resolution HST 𝐼814 imaging and the ground-based data. We find
that brightest galaxies in the sample have a highly irregular structure
as expected from previous works."
"• The existence of archival spectra for a sub-set of our sample
allows us to identify SF and AGN dominated sources from the rest-
frame UV spectral signatures. At the bright-end of our sample we
see clear AGN signatures in the available spectra, while deep spec-
troscopy from targeted high-redshift surveys show the expected fea-
tures of LBGs. We identify a very bright source 𝑀UV = −23.6
(𝑆𝐹𝑅 ' 80M�/yr) that shows no evidence for an AGN contribution
to the rest-frame UV light."
"• We combine themorphology/size and spectroscopy information
to estimate the AGN fraction as a function of 𝑀UV. We find a steep
transition at𝑀UV ' −23.2where the number of bright galaxies drops
while AGN-dominated sources become ubiquitous. We find a slight
tension in the 𝑓AGN derived independently from our morphology and
spectroscopy data at 𝑀UV ' −22.5, with the spectroscopy results
finding a higher fraction by a factor of ∼ 5."
"• We use this AGN fraction to estimate the separated AGN and
SF-dominated rest-frame UV LFs at 𝑧 ' 4. We find the bright-end
of the SF-dominated LF to be described by a DPL with a bright-end
slope of 𝛽 = −5.15 ± 0.10. Our LBG UV LF is consistent with that
expected from the observed steepening in 𝛽 from 𝑧 ' 9–5 found
by Bowler et al. (2020), which can be explained by an increased
effect of dust attenuation in the most highly star-forming galaxies."
"• We find that the slope of the faint-end of the AGN LF depends
on how we determine the AGN fraction. If we impose a point-source
morphology criterion, as in several recent studies of faint AGN, then
we find a shallow slope with 𝛼 = −1.19 ± 0.05. Conversely, if we
derive the AGN number density using the spectroscopic results we
find a steeper slope of 𝛼 = −1.83 ± 0.11."
"• A simple model of the AGN LF, derived using empirical re-
lations applied to the LBG UV LF at 𝑧 = 4, can provide a good
description of the transition from AGN to SF-dominated sources.
By applying a criterion on the relative emission from the AGN and
host galaxy (𝐿BH/𝐿SF > 15), we are able to reproduce the observed
flattening of the 𝑧 = 4 AGN LF at 𝑀UV < −22 found by Akiyama
et al. (2018). This flattening is only predicted in the case that the
light from SF becomes significant in comparison to the AGN in less
massive galaxies."
"Our results demonstrate that while the increasingly large samples
of 𝑧 ' 4 sources have resulted in low statistical errors on the rest-
frame UV LF of AGN, there remain considerable systemic uncer-
tainties on the faint-end of this function. In particular, the commonly
imposed point-source criterion in the selection of AGN samples at
these redshifts can result in incomplete samples of active sources at
𝑀UV > −24 due to the impact of the host galaxy. The degree of
this incompleteness depends on how active black holes populate the
underlying galaxy distribution and how these active sources appear
in the rest-frame UV light accessible in optical datasets. Upcom-"

"APPENDIX A: SPECTROSCOPICALLY CONFIRMED
SOURCES"
"In Table A1 we present the brightest sources in our parent sam-
ple that have been spectroscopically confirmed. In addition to the
published spectroscopic redshift, for some of these sources we were
able to obtain reduced spectra which we present in Fig. 5. As dis-
cussed further in Adams et al. (2020) we overlap with the majority of
the Boutsia et al. (2018) sample. As part of our analysis we identified
a discrepancy between the absolute magnitudes presented by Bout-
sia et al. (2018), which can be up to 1mag fainter than the 𝑀UV we
calculated from our best-fitting SED model. In Boutsia et al. (2018)
the 𝑀UV is estimated by applying a 𝐾-correction to the 𝑟−band
data, which typically hosts the Lyman-break from 𝑧 = 3.9–4.7. Our
analysis demonstrates that this method can underestimate the 𝑀UV.
In addition to this discrepancy, we find we cannot reproduce the
higher number density of AGN derived by Boutsia et al. (2018)
(𝜙 = 1.6 × 10−6 at 𝑀UV = −23.5). This is puzzling given that the
majority of the Boutsia et al. (2018) sources are reselected in this
work."
APPENDIX B: AGN FRACTION FROM OUR FITTING
"In Fig. B1 we show the resulting AGN fractions derived from our
fitting procedure to the separated AGN and SF UV LFs. We compare
these to the results from Adams et al. (2020) who did not separate
the two populations. In comparison to Adams et al. (2020) we find
that the DPL and Schechter parameterisations of the SF-dominated
sources are consistent within 1𝜎. The observed differences in the
𝑓AGN are instead found to be due to more significant changes in
the derived parameters for the power-law fit to the AGN-dominated
sub-sample. When a Schechter function form is assumed for the
SF-dominated sources, the fit to the AGN-dominated objects has a
shallower slope than inAdams et al. (2020), leading to a brighter point
of transition. Conversely, when a DPL function form is assumed for
the SF-dominated sources, the power-law fit to the AGN-dominated
objects shows a higher normalisation and hence the transition point
(where 𝑓AGN ' 0.5) moves faint-wards."

column 3 we present the total HSC 𝐼 -band apparent magnitude followed by the best-fitting photometric redshift with a Galaxy and QSO template in columns 4
and 5. In brackets after the photometric redshift is the 𝜒2 of the fit. The final two columns denote the absolute UV magnitude followed by a note indicating the
origin of the spectroscopic measurement. KB18 corresponds to Boutsia et al. (2018), zCOS to zCOSMOS, PR to Primus, VAN to VANDELS. We denote with
an asterick the objects for which we were able to obtain the rest-frame UV spectrum, presented in Section 3.3."

"Figure B1. The results of our fitting to the separated AGN and SF-dominated
sources. The solid (dashed) lines show the 𝑓AGN derived when assuming a
DPL (Schechter) function for the SF component. In both cases a power-law
is assumed for the AGN component. The black lines show the results from a
simultaneous fit of both types of sources by Adams et al. (2020). The blue
(orange) lines show the results from this work, where we have separated
SF and AGN-dominated sources according to the morphology (spectra). We
reproduce our observed 𝑓AGN points as in Fig. 7."
