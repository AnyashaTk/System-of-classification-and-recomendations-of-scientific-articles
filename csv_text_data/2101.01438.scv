Abstract
The TeV γ-ray halo around the Geminga pulsar is an important indicator of cosmic-ray (CR)
propagation in the local zone of the Galaxy as it reveals the spatial distribution of the electrons
and positrons escaping from the pulsar. Considering the intricate magnetic field in the interstellar
"medium (ISM), it is proposed that superdiffusion model could be more realistic to describe the CR"
"propagation than the commonly used normal diffusion model. In this work, we test the superdiffu-"
sion model in the ISM around the Geminga pulsar by fitting to the surface brightness profile of the
Geminga halo measured by HAWC. Our results show that the chi-square statistic monotonously
"increases as α decreases from 2 to 1, where α is the characteristic index of superdiffusion describ-"
ing the degree of fractality of the ISM and α = 2 corresponds to the normal diffusion model. We
"find that model with α < 1.32 (or < 1.4, depending on the data used in fit) is disfavored at 95%"
confidence level. Superdiffusion model with α close to 2 can well explain the morphology of the
"Geminga halo, while it predicts much higher positron flux on the Earth than the normal diffusion"
model. This has important implication for the interpretation of the CR positron excess.

I. INTRODUCTION"
"Several middle-aged pulsars, such as the Geminga pulsar, are reported to be surrounded"
by TeV γ-ray halos with scales larger than 20 pc [1]. These γ-ray halos are generated
by free electrons and positrons1 diffusing out from the corresponding pulsar wind nebulae
"(PWNe), rather than being interpreted by γ-ray PWNe [2]. According to the evolution"
"model of PWN, the original PWNe of the middle-aged pulsars were broken long time ago"
[3]. These pulsars are currently traveling in the interstellar medium2 (ISM) and driving
bow-shock PWNe with scales . 1 pc. This is consistent with the observations of the X-ray
PWN of the Geminga pulsar [5–7]. The TeV γ-ray halos are generated mainly through the
"inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of the homogeneous cosmic microwave background, so the"
morphologies of the halos unambiguously indicate the electron propagation in the ISM.
Cosmic-ray (CR) propagation in the ISM is usually modeled by the diffusion process
considering the turbulent nature of the ISM [8]. The diffusion approximation is based on
the assumption that the inhomogeneity of the chaotic magnetic field has small-scale character
"and is negligible in terms of the scale of interest. However, multi-scale inhomogeneities could"
exist in the ISM. The ISM is more likely to be a fractal type and the normal diffusion can
"be generalized to superdiffusion [9–12], where the CR propagation is simulated by Lévy"
flights instead of the Brownian motion. This model has been applied in the Galactic-scale
"propagation of CRs to explain features of the CR energy spectra [9, 13]. In this work, we"
test the superdiffusion model in a local region of the Galaxy by explaining the morphology
of the Geminga halo. As the diffusion packets are different for the normal diffusion and
"superdiffusion models, the γ-ray morphologies predicted by them could also be distinct."
"This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the superdiffusion model"
and the solution of the propagation equation. Then we briefly introduce the information of
Geminga in Section III. We fit the γ-ray surface brightness profile (SBP) of the Geminga
halo measured by HAWC with different propagation models and discuss the fitting results in
Section IV. In Section V we discuss the impact on the interpretation of the positron excess
"according to the results of Section IV. Finally, we conclude in Section VI."
"1 Electrons will denote both electrons and positrons hereafter.
2 The pulsars could also be inside their old host SNRs if the SNRs are large enough [4]."
II. THE SUPERDIFFUSION MODEL
"After escaping from the source, CRs are continuously scattered by the chaotic magnetic"
"field in the ISM. If the chaotic magnetic field is uniformly distributed, the particle trans-"
"portation can be simulated by the Brownian motion [8]. However, the realistic magnetic"
"field in the ISM may consist of turbulent and relatively regular components, where very long"
"jumps for CRs are permitted. Lévy flight, which is characterized by the occasionally very"
"long steps, should be the more proper description in this case [9–12]. For one-dimensional"
"Lévy flight, the probability density function (PDF) of the individual step length x has the"
"heavy-tailed form of P (x) ∝ |x|−1−α for x→∞, where 0 < α < 2. Obviously, the variance"
"of the step length is infinite, which is different from that of the Brownian motion. The"
widening of the diffusion packet with time is also faster for Lévy flight (∝ t1/α) than the
"normal diffusion case (∝ t1/2), so this scenario is named after superdiffusion or accelerated"
diffusion [11].
"As the PDF of Lévy flight can be described by the fractional Laplacian equation, the"
propagation equation of CR electrons should be
"∂N(E, r, t)"
"∂t
= −D(E,α)(−∆)−"
"α
2N(E, r, t) +"
"∂[b(E)N(E, r, t)]"
"∂E
+Q(E, r, t) , (1)"
"where N is the differential number density of electrons, D is the diffusion coefficient, and"
Q is the source function for which we will present the details in Section III. The index α
represents the degree of fractality of the ISM and for α = 2 the equation degenerates to the
"normal diffusion case. The radiative energy-loss rate b(E) = b0E
2 induced by synchrotron"
radiation and ICS must be considered for high-energy electrons. The magnetic field strength
"is assumed to be 3 µG to obtain the synchrotron term. For the ICS process, we adopt the"
seed photon field in Ref. [1] and the parameterization given by Ref. [14] to calculate the
"energy-loss rate, where the Klein-Nishina correction is accurately considered."
We solve Eq. (1) with the Green function method. The Green function takes the form of

"From Eq. (7), we can get the electron number density at arbitrary distance from a pulsar."
"To calculate the γ-ray SBP around the pulsar, we integrate the electron number density along"
the line-of-sight from the Earth to the vicinity of the pulsar and get the electron surface
density at an arbitrary angular distance θ from the pulsar:
F (θ) =
"∫ +∞

"N(lθ)dlθ , (8)"
"where lθ is the length in that line-of-sight, and N(lθ) is the electron number density at a"
"distance of
√
d2 + l2θ − 2dlθ cos θ from the pulsar, where d is the distance between the pulsar"
"and the Earth. With F (θ) and the standard calculation of ICS [16], we can finally obtain"
the γ-ray SBP around the pulsar.
III. THE SOURCE GEMINGA
The Geminga halo is so far the best-studied TeV halo. The γ-ray SBP is precisely
measured by HAWC [1] and is an ideal object to investigate the propagation of CR electrons.
"In the normal diffusion scenario, the derived diffusion coefficient around the Geminga pulsar"
is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the average value in the Galaxy indicated
by the boron-to-carbon ratio [17]. The origin of the slow diffusion has been discussed in
"recent works [4, 18, 19]."
The parameters of the Geminga pulsar can be obtained from the ATNF catalog [20]. The
age of the pulsar is ts = 342 kyr and the current spin-down luminosity is L = 3.25×1034 erg
s−1. The latest version of the catalog gives the pulsar distance as d = 190 pc and provides
"the reference Ref. [21], where the distance is derived with the optical measurement of the"
"trigonometric parallax. However, the distance given by Ref. [21] is 157 pc rather than 190"
pc. Here we adopt d = 250 pc which is determined by the latest parallax measurement [22].
Electrons are accelerated to very high energy inside the Geminga PWN. As the scale of
"the Geminga PWN is significantly smaller than the TeV halo, it is reasonable to assume"
it to be a point source. The time dependency of the electron injection is assumed to be
"proportional to the spin-down luminosity of the pulsar as ∝ (1 + t/tsd)−2, where tsd is the"
spin-down time scale of pulsar. We set a typical value of tsd = 10 kyr. As the cooling time
"of 100 TeV electrons is about 10 kyr, the parent electrons of the present TeV γ-ray halo are"
generated in the very recent age of Geminga. So the value of tsd impacts little on the time
profile as t/tsd � 1. The injection energy spectrum can be described by a power-law within
the energy range of interest as ∝ E−p. We adopt p = 2.24 which is measured by the HAWC
"work [1]. Thus, the source term can be written as"
"Q(E, r, t) ="
"
Q0(E/E100)"
"−p δ(r− rs) [(ts + tsd)/(t+ tsd)]2 , t > 0"
"0 , t < 0
, (9)"
where rs is the position of the pulsar and we set the birth time of the pulsar to be the zero
point of time. The constant Q0 is the current-time normalization at the energy of E100 = 100
IV. FITTING TO THE HAWC DATA
We test the superdiffusion propagation in the regime of 1 ≤ α ≤ 2 by fitting to the
"γ-ray SBP of HAWC [1]. For each α, we seek the best-fit model by minimizing the chi-"
square statistic χ2 between the model and the data points. The NLopt3 package and the
optimization algorithm BOBYQA [23] are adopted for the fitting procedures. The free
parameters are the anomalous diffusion coefficient D and the constant factor of the source
term Q0. Since HAWC provides the SBP in a single energy bin of 8-40 TeV which is not
"very broad, we assume an energy-independent D in the calculations."
"HAWC measures the SBP within 10◦ around the Geminga pulsar. However, we do not"
use all the SBP data in the fitting procedures as the data at large angular distances could be
"affected by other potential γ-ray sources. As indicated by Fig. 1, the differences of particle"
distribution between the propagation models are still significant at large distances from the
"source. If we include the data at large angular distances, the χ2 test may be disturbed by"
"the inhomogeneous γ-ray background. We use the data within θmax = 4
◦ (≈ 17 pc) around"
"the pulsar as a benchmark and test the case of θmax = 6
◦ (≈ 26 pc) for comparison."
The fitting results are presented in Fig. 2 and the best-fit parameters are listed in Table
I. Superdiffusion models with α . 1.5 yield too steep inner profiles of the γ-ray halo as
"can been seen in Fig. 2. Due to the nature of Lévy flight, the superdiffusion models predict"
steeper profiles close to the source and flatter profiles far from the source in comparison with
the normal diffusion case. If the inner fluxes are forced to fit the data for the superdiffusion

depiction among the diffusion scenarios in terms of the current measurement.
We then provide a quantitative constraint on α by assuming it as a variable parameter
"and deriving its one-dimensional distribution. According to the Bayesian inference, we have"
"P (α) ∝ L(α) ∝ exp[−χ2(α)/2], where P (α) is the posterior PDF and L(α) is the likelihood"
function. The relative probability densities can be derived at the knots where χ2(α) are

V. IMPACT ON THE POSITRON EXCESS
The Geminga pulsar was considered as one of the most competitive candidate sources of
"the CR positron excess [25–27]. However, if the slow diffusion measured by HAWC pervades"
"the ISM between Geminga and the solar system, Geminga can hardly contribute to the"
positron flux at the Earth as the positrons do not have enough time to reach the Earth
[1]. This problem is alleviated if the slow diffusion only happens in the nearby ISM of the
FIG. 4. Left: Positron spectra on the Earth contributed by Geminga with both the normal diffusion
"model and superdiffusion models. The parameters are adopted from Tabel I, which are derived"
from the HAWC measurement of the Geminga halo. The AMS-02 positron spectrum is also shown
for comparison [34]. Right: Positron fluxes from Geminga at 300 GeV as functions of the pulsar
"age, corresponding to the models in the left panel."
"Geminga pulsar [28–31]. On the other hand, it is possible that the diffusion coefficient on"
"the Galactic disk is generally much smaller than the average value in the Galaxy [32, 33]."
The discussion in the last paragraph is based on the normal diffusion model. The results
in Section IV indicate that superdiffusion model with α > 1.4 is permitted in terms of the
"current measurement. As can be seen in Fig. 1, superdiffusion models yield much higher"
fluxes in large distance from the source than the normal diffusion due to the heavy-tailed
distribution. We assume a one-zone superdiffusion scenario to calculate the positron flux
"from Geminga. The left panel of Fig. 4 shows the positron spectra in the cases of α = 2.0,"
"α = 1.8, and α = 1.6 adopting the parameters in Table I. The diffusion coefficient is"
"extrapolated from the value in the HAWC energy range with the relation of D ∝ E1/3, which"
"is predicted by the Kolmogorov’s theory. As expected, Geminga can contribute significant"
"positron flux in comparison with the AMS-02 data [34] in the superdiffusion models, without"
"the assumption of two-zone propagation mentioned above. More intuitively, we show the"
positron fluxes from Geminga at 300 GeV as functions of the pulsar age in the right panel
of Fig. 4. Positrons come much faster to the Earth in the superdiffusion models with power-
"law-like time dependencies, rather than the steep time dependency of ∼ exp[−r2/(4Dt)] for"
the normal diffusion model. The flux cutoff above 106 yr is due to the radiative cooling of
300 GeV positrons.
"Note we still adopt p = 2.24 in the above calculations, which are derived with the TeV"
"observation of HAWC. As the AMS-02 positron spectrum is in the GeV range, it is more"
reasonable to use the Fermi-LAT observation of Geminga to constrain the injection spectrum
"and diffusion coefficient in the same energy range [35]. However, the constraint from Fermi-"
LAT is model-dependent and the analysis is beyond the scope of this work.
VI. CONCLUSION
"In this work, we test the superdiffusion model in the ISM around the Geminga pulsar"
by fitting to the SBP measured by HAWC. This model depicts the particle propagation in
"a fractal medium with Lévy flight, which could be more realistic to simulate the intricate"
magnetic field environment compared with the normal diffusion. The Lévy flight superdif-
fusion is described by the fractional Laplacian in the propagation equation with the order of
"α/2, where α ∈ (0, 2). Through the χ2 test, we find that the normal diffusion (α = 2) still"
give the best accommodation to the HAWC data. The reduced χ2 monotonously increases
"with the decrease of α and α < 1.32 (or α < 1.4, depending on the data used in fit) is"
"disfavored at 95% CL. Intuitively, models with small α give poor fits to the γ-ray fluxes"
"close to the pulsar. With more TeV halos being accurately measured in the coming future,"
particle propagation in the local zones of the Galaxy can be further constrained.
Superdiffusion model with α > 1.4 is still permitted in terms of the current measurement
of the Geminga halo. Models with α close to 2 can give comparable fitting results to that
"of the normal diffusion model, however, they predict distinct positron spectra on the Earth."
"Due to the nature of the heavy-tailed distribution of the superdiffusion model, part of the"
positrons come much faster to the Earth and the positron flux from Geminga is much higher
"than that predicted by the normal diffusion model. Different from the conclusion in Ref. [1],"
Geminga could have significant contribution to the observed high-energy positron spectrum
in the superdiffusion scenario even if the small diffusion coefficient measured around the
Geminga pulsar is applied in the whole region between Geminga and the Earth.
The test may also provide information for the origin of the inefficient particle propagation
"in TeV halos. For example, it is proposed that the slow-diffusion zone around the Geminga"
"pulsar may be interpreted by its crushed relic PWN [30, 31]. Considering the filamentary"
"structures in the relic PWN due to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities [36], this scenario may"
"be described by the superdiffusion model with α significantly smaller than 2, which can"
"then be tested by the method of this work. However, quantitative relations between the"
superdiffusion model and specific physical scenarios need to be established in the future.
