"ABSTRACT
The symmetry axes of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are randomly distributed in space but highly"
"inclined sources are heavily obscured and are not seen as quasars with broad emission lines. The
obscuring torus geometry determines the average viewing angle, and if the torus geometry changes with
the redshift, this average viewing angle will also change. Thus the ratio between the isotropic luminosity
and observed luminosity may change systematically with redshift. Therefore, if we use quasars to
measure the luminosity distance by evaluating the isotropic absolute luminosity and measuring the
observed flux, we can have a redshift-dependent bias which can propagate to cosmological parameters.
We propose a toy model for testing the effect of viewing angle uncertainty on measurement of the
luminosity distance. The model is based on analytical description of the obscuring torus applied
to one-parameter observational data. It illustrates the possible change of the torus covering factor
between the two chosen redshift ranges. We have estimated the possible error on specific cosmological
parameters (H0, Ωm) for the flat ΛCDM cosmology if a method is calibrated at low redshift and
applied to the higher redshift. The errors on cosmological parameters due to potential dependence
of viewing angle on redshift are found to be potentially significant, and the effect will have to be
accommodated in the future in all quasar-based cosmological methods. A careful systematic study of
AGN mean viewing angle across redshift is necessary, with the use of appropriate samples and models
which uniquely determine the inclination of each source."

1. INTRODUCTION
"Quantifying the accelerated expansion of the Universe
is one of the key issues of the cosmology (for a recent
reviews, see e.g. Matarrese et al. 2011; Rubin & Hayden
2016; Czerny et al. 2018). Various probes are used to
this purpose, like observations of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB; Planck Collaboration et al. 2018),
Supernovae Ia (SN Ia; Riess et al. 1998, Perlmutter et al.
1999), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO; Bassett &
Hlozek 2010), gravitational lensing (Wong et al. 2020a),
or gamma-ray bursts (Schaefer 2003). Quasars, or more
generally, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) also joined"

"the class of sources with cosmological applications,
and several specific methods to use these objects were
proposed: continuum time delays (Collier et al. 1999;
Cackett et al. 2007), emission line time delays (Watson
et al. 2011; Haas et al. 2011; Czerny et al. 2013), broad-
band spectral shape (nonlinear dependence between the
UV and X-ray flux ,(Risaliti & Lusso 2015; Lusso et al.
2019)), virial broadening estimator studies (Franca et al.
2014; Marziani & Sulentic 2014; Marziani et al. 2020),
statistical properties of the quasar distribution reflecting
the large scale structure (e.g. de Carvalho et al. 2020),
and quasar strong lensing (Wong et al. 2020b).
Several recent measurements based on different"
"methods imply the tension between the Hubble constant
H0 determination based on early Universe and the value
coming from the relatively local measurements (see
e.g. Riess 2019; Verde et al. 2019, for recent reviews)."

"However, high accuracy of measurements is necessary,
and the control of the systematic errors is critical,
since the systematic error of 0.2 mag in the luminosity
distance is enough to eliminate the H0 tension.
The use of quasars for cosmology has important"
"advantages. Quasars are numerous, and they nicely
cover the broad range of redshifts, starting from
relatively nearby AGN to redshifts of order of 7
(Mortlock et al. 2011, Bañados et al. 2018). They also do
not show strong extinction effects, since bright quasars
efficiently clear the line of sight through the host galaxy,
and in addition the color selection allows to remove the
highly reddened minority from the sample. They also
do not seem to show evolutionary effects related to the
metallicity since even high redshift quasars are metal-
rich, with solar or even super-solar abundance.
Quasar-based constraints of the cosmological"
"parameters were already very successful. Combining
the quasar method based on the broad-band spectral
shape with several other cosmological probes (Lusso
et al. 2019) showed that there is a 4σ tension with
the standard ΛCDM cosmology. Quasar-based results
will flourish in the next years, with more AGN being
a subject of systematic reverberation monitoring (Du
et al. 2015; Grier et al. 2017; Du et al. 2018; Grier et al.
2019; Homayouni et al. 2020; Cackett et al. 2020), and
with the future surveys approaching, like LSST (Ivezić
et al. 2019).
Since the number of sources is growing, the"
"cosmological constraints will be determined with smaller
and smaller statistical errors. However, the systematic
errors inherent in the methods will not disappear with
the rise of the statistical samples. In the case of AGN,
one of such potentially important issues is the effect of
the viewing angle of an active nucleus. AGN are not
point-like sources, they show significant dependence of
their appearance on the inclination angle of an observer
with respect to the symmetry axis which underlies the
AGN classification (see e.g. Antonucci 1993; Urry &
Padovani 1995; Netzer 2015, for a review). This by
itself does not pose a problem as long as, statistically,
there is no trend in the average viewing angle with the
redshift. However, if such a trend is likely to exist, it can
be expected to affect the conclusions about the redshift
dependence of the Universe expansion rate. The aim of
the present paper is to check if such trends are likely,
and if so, whether they may lead to biased estimation
of cosmological parameters. A hint that it may happen
is provided by Gu (2013) who has found the redshift
evolution in the covering factor of the torus. We use
this data in our experiment."
"The paper is organised as follows. In section 2, we
discuss the method, where we outline our approach to
the effect of viewing angle on measurement of the disk
luminosity, followed by geometry description, analytical
description of the disk/torus system, selection of the
observational data, and predicted effect on cosmological
parameters are given in section 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4,
respectively. In sections 3 & 4, we present the discussion
in the context of quasar cosmology."
2. METHOD
"AGN is believed to have a supermassive black hole
at the center which accretes the matter from the
surrounding. In vigorously accreting systems this
matter forms cold Keplerian accretion disks. Close to
the disk, the broad line region forms. This central part
of an AGN is usually surrounded by a dusty/molecular
torus. Thus the viewing angle plays an important role
in how the AGN appears, and consequently, in how
it is classified. The disk is flat, so the observed disk
flux decreases with an increase of the viewing angle.
In addition, the observer looking at very high viewing
angle (measured from the symmetry axis) will not be
able to see the direct disk emission, and instead will
register only a processed emission from the molecular
torus (plus, eventually, a scattered emission). At
intermediate viewing angles both the disk anisotropy
and the partial obscuration are important. Therefore,
the observed radiation from any AGN mostly depends
on two important parameters e.g. viewing angle (i) and
the optical depth (τ) along the line of sight. Here we
consider our study as a toy model illustrating potential
dangers of negligence of all viewing angle issues in
quasar cosmology."
2.1. Description of the Geometry
"The AGN geometry to be considered in this work
is similar to what is given by Elitzur (2008), and
shown in Figure 1, where torus is considered to have a
smooth density distribution of dust in angular direction.
The inclination angle measured from symmetry axis is
denoted as i.
We assume that the radiation produced in the disk is"
"modified by the torus before it reaches the observer, and
the effect depends on the viewing angle. Let’s assume
that the τ is the optical depth of molecular torus and it
is defined as,"
"τ = Ae−(β/σ)
2"
"where ’A’ is the normalization constant, β (=π/2-i) is
the angle measured from the equatorial plane, and σ
is the characteristic width of the torus. We thus use"
Viewing angle effects in quasar application to cosmology 3
"Figure 1. Cartoons for a dusty torus with half opening
angle σ and with decreasing density away from the equatorial
plane. The viewing angle is defined as i measured from the
symmetry axis."
"just the projection of the torus onto the sky plane of
the central source and neglect possible variations in the
radial distribution of the dusty material. Therefore,
constants A and σ are the only two free parameters
of the torus model itself. The third parameter is the
viewing angle."
2.2. Disk/torus system
"Here we consider a toy model which allows us to
see how the change in the covering factor measured
by Gu (2013) can relate to the torus parameters and
the viewing angle, and further, how it can affect the
measured luminosity in case of high redshift AGN (2.0
≤ z ≤ 2.4) if we fix the geometry by analyzing the low
redshift sample (0.7 ≤ z ≤ 1.1). We do not aim here
at actual measurement of the observational trend, as
this will have to be done in the future with better torus
model and a large sample of objects over a redshift range
with broad band spectra which will allow to measure
uniquely the model parameters, including the viewing
angle, from the data.
The disk luminosity seen by the observer is anisotropic"
"since the AGN standard accretion disk is geometrically
thin so the disk flux is proportional to the cosine of the
viewing angle (i), i.e. the intrinsic disk flux Ldisk seen
by observer in the absence of the dusty torus is:"
"Ldisk(i) = 2L
aver
disk cos i, (2)"
"where Laverdisk is the intrinsic average disk luminosity.
When the observer is looking along the symmetry axis,
where i = 0, the observed disk luminosity, Ldisk, would
be 2Laverdisk (see e.g. Frank et al. 2002, for a reference).
This anisotropy effect has been neglected in Elitzur
(2008) as well as in Gu (2013) analysis. In principle,"
"additional factor related to the limb-brightening could
have been also included here but for the sake of
simplicity we neglect it in the current approach.
Finally, the disk intrinsic anisotropic emision is"
"modified in a viewing-angle dependent way when the
light is passing through the dusty torus which gives us
the final expression for the observed disk flux:"
"Ldisk(i) = 2L
aver
disk cos i e"
"−τ , (3)"
"where τ is the optical depth of dusty torus. The IR
radiation produced in the molecular torus comes from
the nuclear emission which is intercepted by the torus.
In order to calculate it from the model, assuming that
the intrinsic disk emission and torus parameters are
known, we perform an integral over all viewing angles:"
"LIR = 2L
aver
disk"
"∫ π/2
0"
"sinβ ∗ cosβ ∗ (1− e−Ae
−β2/σ2"
) ∗ dβ.
"(4)
Here we use the angle β measured from the equatorial
plane.
We further assume that the emission of the torus in"
"the IR band is isotropic. This is an oversimplification in
comparison with the approach of Elitzur (2008) based
on radiative transfer, but we do not aim to study the
spectral features in the IR band. This assumption of
isotropy is relatively correct if the torus is optically
thin and/or we observe the emission at relatively longer
wavelengths. Here we concentrate on a simple approach
to overall radiation budget.
Thus we define the covering factor (CF) of the AGN as"
the ratio of observed IR to the intrinsic disk luminosity:
"CF = LIR/L
aver
disk = LIR/Ldisk ∗ Ldisk/L"
"aver
disk . (5)"
"On the other hand, if we assume that the IR emission
is isotropic but the disk emission is highly anisotropic,
then what we measure directly from the data is instead
the ratio:"
"LIR/Ldisk =
LIR/L"
"aver
disk"
"Ldisk/L
aver
disk"
"The numerator in the above equation is estimated
through the numerical integration from equation (4).
The denominator is the re-written form of equation (3),"
"Ldisk/L
aver
disk = 2 cos i ∗ e"
"−τ , (7)"
"after substituting the value i = π/2 - β, the equation
(7) transforms to,"
"Ldisk/L
aver
disk = 2 sinβ ∗ e"
"−A∗e−(β/σ)
2"
4 Prince et al.
"Although the viewing angle has such an importance
for the appearance of AGN, we rarely measure it for
individual sources. A range of viewing angles would lead
to a scatter in the ratio of Ldisk/Laverdisk . This scatter is
around some mean value, unknown a priori and it needs
to be determined observationally. This value is sensitive
to the properties of the torus.
In reverberation mapping we use only type 1 AGN,"
"with emission lines well visible. The torus shields
the BLR from the observer for high inclinations for
which the torus becomes optically thick. The range
of the viewing angles shielding the nucleus depends on
the dust spatial distribution, i.e. dust properties. In
addition, the transition from unshielded to shielded case
is continuous for most torus models. Here we assume
that the line of sight with the value τ = 1 separates the
type 1 and type 2 AGN. We mark the corresponding
value of the angle β as β0, and we use Equation 1 to
estimate its value knowing the torus parameters. Our
torus model gives"
"β0 = σ
√
ln(A) (9)"
"and hence sinβ0 = sin(σ
√
ln(A))."
"Thus type 1 sources are those with the viewing angle
between β = 0 to β = β0, and statistically the mean
(effective) viewing angle is given by sinβeff = 1/2(1+
sinβ0) which, by substituting the value of β0, reduces
to 1/2(1+ sin(σ"
"√
ln(A)))."
"Therefore, if we consider a sample of randomly
oriented type 1 sources, we can substitute β with βeff
in Equation 8, and use Equation 6 to get the average
value for the normalized disk luminosity,"
"LIR/Ldisk =
LIR/L"
"aver
disk"
"(1 + sin(σ
√
ln(A))) ∗ e−A∗e−(β0/2σ)"
"(10)
Values of A and σ are model parameters, σ can vary
between 0 to 90 degree, but A must be larger than 1
since otherwise we would have no type 2 sources and the
definition of β0 in Equation 9 would not apply. If the
ratio of LIR/Ldisk is measured observationally we can
constrain the geometry of the torus, and in particular
the average viewing angle and intrinsic extinction."
2.3. Observational data
"Gu (2013) has studied the sample of quasars from
DR9Q (Pâris, I. et al. 2012) and DR7Q (Schneider et al.
2010) catalog by combining the photometric data from
SDSS with the data from other observatories, including
WISE (Wright et al. 2010), UKIDSS (Lawrence et al.
2007), and GALEX (Martin et al. 2005).
The distribution of quasars sample in DR9Q and"
DR7Q peaks in two different redshift range. The
mean redshift CF
"0.8 0.478 ± 0.01
2.2 0.871 ± 0.03"
"Table 1. Summary of the parameters from Gu (2013) used
in the present paper."
"distribution with redshift can be seen in Pâris, I. et al.
(2012) and Schneider et al. (2010), where large number
of sources in DR9Q found in redshift range 2.0-2.4 with
median 2.2 and in DR7Q the source distribution with
redshift shows two peaks, one at 0.8 and another at
1.6. Now to consider the significantly different redshift
range for low and high redshift sources Gu (2013)
focused on the peak 0.8 and selected the sources within
the redshift range 0.7-1.1. The multi-wavelength data
collected from other telescopes like WISE, GALEX,
UKIDSS along with SDSS are used to constrain the
sample size and finally the multi-wavelength SED was
produced. The SED were used to estimate the IR and
bolometric luminosity for all the sources and further,
their ratio is defined as covering factor (CF) by Gu
(2013). The distribution of sources for low and high
redshift with CF are shown in Figure 5 of Gu (2013), and
their corresponding median values differ significantly,
suggesting a clear evolution with redshift. They have
done the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic (KS) test to
confirm the difference between low and high redshift CF
distribution. Both sub-samples show a wide distribution
of the values but there is an overall strong shift in the
reported values towards higher dust covering at large
redshift despite no clear effect in distributions of black
hole mass and Eddington ratio.
It can always be argued that the difference seen in the"
"torus geometry at two different redshift ranges possibly
results from the biases present in the sample selection.
But it can only be verified in future by having more
observed sources over a larger redshift range, with more
precise observations.
For the use in the present paper we concentrate only"
"on the median values of the IR to bolometric luminosity
(CF), which is 0.478 for the low redshift subsample and
0.871 for the high redshift subsample. In their paper,
they report directly the ratio of the IR to the bolometric
luminosity, and they consider that as a measurement
of the covering factor (CF) assuming a spherically
symmetric (isotropic) emission of the central source
and the even simpler torus model without stratification
along the β angle. In our approach, their measurement
actually corresponds to the ratio defined by Equation 10.
The change of this factor between the low and the"
high redshift sub-sample implies the systematic change
Viewing angle effects in quasar application to cosmology 5
"of the effective viewing angle in quasars with redshift.
If this effect is ignored in the studies using quasars for
cosmology this will lead to clear systematic apparent
drift in cosmological parameters. In the next section,
we will describe how the negligence of this information
affects the results. We summarize the parameters
adopted from Gu (2013) in Table 1.
Since Gu (2013) provides a single value for"
"each source, we cannot uniquely derive our two
torus parameters and the viewing angle from their
measurements. The assumption that we concentrate on
the mean viewing angle relates the viewing angle to the
torus parameters, but still two parameters remain to
be determined from a single measurement. Therefore,
we cannot expect to determine the actual trend with
the redshift, ready for cosmological applications, but
nevertheless we obtain a very interesting illustration of
what may happen if the issue is neglected."
2.4. Application to Cosmology
"We first provide simplified analytical estimates how
the lack of knowledge of the viewing angle of a quasar
leads to incorrect determination of the Hubble constant
from the reverberation mapping of a single quasar. Next
we use the data from Table 1 to show how large errors for
the estimate of the cosmological parameters can result
if the systematic change in the torus parameter between
the lower redshift and higher redshift sub-samples is
ignored."
"2.4.1. Simple example of viewing angle role
applicable at very low redshift"
"In standard cosmological approach to use quasar
reverberation measurements, we neglect the issue of
the viewing angles since we do not measure them
routinely for the reverberation measured sources. We
then measure the time delay for a given source, τd,
and we measure the observed monochromatic flux, for
example at 5100 , Fobs. We use the theoretical formula,
neglecting the issue of the viewing angle, to define the
observed monochromatic luminosity,"
"logL44,5100 = −2.61 + 2log(τd), (11)"
"where the constant was calculated assuming the dust
temperature Tdust = 1000 K, and effective viewing
angle, ieff = 39.2◦ in Equations (2), (3), and (4) of
Czerny & Hryniewicz (2011). Here the time delay
τd of the Hβ line with respect to the continuum at
5100 Å , is measured in days, and the monochromatic
luminosity at 5100 Å in units of 1044 erg s−1 cm−2.
Thus, the measurement of the time delay gives us the
absolute luminosity of the source. Knowing the absolute"
"luminosity one can estimate the source luminosity
distance by following the relation,"
"D2L =
L5100"
"4πF5100
, (12)"
"where F5100 is the observed flux measured at 5100
Å, easily available for the studies quasar. Derived
DL can be compared to the cosmological model
through the prescription for the cosmological distance
DL(z,H0,ΩΛ,Ωm) if we know the redshift, z (also
easily measured for the quasar from the position of the
emission line). Thus, measuring τd, z and F5100, we
can do cosmology. In particular, if the redshift is much
smaller than 1, we can use a linear part of the Hubble
flow determine the Hubble constant:"
"H0 = const

"The problem appears if the viewing angle is not
consistent with the adopted value ieff = 39.2◦ adopted
by Czerny & Hryniewicz (2011). So one can ask the
question, what happens if we use a single object to
obtain H0 but the source is seen at an angle i different
from ieff ?
Now we neglect the effect of the viewing angle in time"
"delay geometrical setup (see Equation 3 of Czerny &
Hryniewicz 2011) since this effect is highly dependent
on the BLR 3-D geometry. In that case the time delay
measurement give us the true viewing-angle independent
absolute luminosity (and the product of the black
hole mass and accretion rate), where the constant was
adjusted to the viewing angle 39.2◦. However, the
measured flux, F5100 would still depend on the actual
viewing angle, so the luminosity distance would contain

would actually be

"This means we will be making an error by a factor

"1/2 in H0 if this factor is ignored, and
that is mostly the case since we did not measure the
viewing angle to the source. This is the problem in any
quasar reverberation mapping, either based on emission
line delay, or continuum time delay (see Equation 15
of Cackett et al. 2007). In addition, in this simplified
approach we also neglected the effect of the extinction
due to the dusty torus.
Through this article, we tried to shed some light on the"
"issue of possible systematic errors due to disk emission
anisotropy and the dust properties, which might affect
the quasar application to cosmology."
6 Prince et al.
"2.4.2. Error estimate based on the data of Gu
(2013)"
"Now we use the full model as described in Section 2.2,
we include the disk anisotropy as well as the extinction
caused by the torus, and we do not limit ourselves to
very low redshift, so the approach is not analytical till
the very end, as in Section 2.4.1. However, our approach
still remains relatively simple.
We now assume that all the parameters for the"
"low redshift (0.7 ≤ z ≤ 1.1) subsample are properly
adjusted to the correct cosmological model, and we
study the errors which would be made if the cosmological
parameters are estimated from the large redshift (2.0
≤ z ≤ 2.4) subsample but the change in the torus
properties visible in the data of Gu (2013) is neglected.
When we constrain the cosmology using the high"
"redshift quasar sample, we measure the luminosity
distance and we should use the geometry appropriate
for the high redshift sources. Considering all the
appropriate effect, the observed flux can be defined as"
"F5100 ∝

(15)"
"where τ is the optical depth measured along the line of
sight and τd is the time delay. The above equation is
similar to the equation defined by Cackett et al. (2007)

viewing angle at high redshift (cosieff (high-z)). If the
effective viewing angle appropriate for low redshift bin
is used, then the luminosity distance at high redshift bin

et al. 2018) and the effective viewing angle, ieff , is set
at 39.2◦. In addition, optical depth is assumed to be
constant for the purpose of this particular plot and the
viewing angle is chosen within the allowed range.

the correct luminosity distance. Using the correct
luminosity distance in the equation (20) we estimated
the incorrect luminosity distance at higher redshift cause
by the geometry mismatch. And again we have used the
equation (22) to estimate the Hincorrect0 for the incorrect
luminosity distance at fixed value of other cosmological
parameters.

"in order to see the error caused by inappropriate
assumption about the torus geometry for high redshift
sample.
To perform this exercise, we need the observational"
"constraints for the mean viewing angles and optical
depths at low and high redshift samples."
3. RESULTS
"3.1. Constraints for the torus evolution with
redshift and the corresponding change of
the viewing from the Minfeng Gu’s sample"
"In section 2, we have discussed our simple torus model
which we use to estimate the CF analytically. The
equation (10) is the final equation which gives the CF
for different values of ’A’ and σ. By comparing our
analytical value of CF to the observational values from
Gu (2013), we formulate constraints for the two torus
parameters. Since, at a given redshift, we measure only
one parameter (see Table 1) while the model has two
parameters, the results are not unique.
The disk luminosity significantly depends both on the"
"optical depth along the equatorial plane (’A’), and on
the width or the opening (σ) of the torus. Thus, with
a single constraint from the data at a given redshift, we
obtain a relation between the two model parameters,
separately for each redshift. In Figure 3, we have
considered the entire possible range of σ between 0◦ (at
the equatorial plane) to 90◦ (at the symmetry axis). The
red curve shows the range of σ for low redshift sources
(Table 1 for CF = 0.478; Gu 2013) and green curve
covers the σ for high redshift sources (Table 1, CF =
0.871). For the low redshift sources the maximum σ
allowed is 45◦, shown as an upper dotted blue horizontal
line in Figure 3. This upper-limit comes from the fact
that the average viewing angle for type 1 sources is"
"∼40◦ (Czerny & Hryniewicz 2011), which allows the
maximum σ to go close to 50◦. Hence to be on safe
side, we have constrained our analysis to σ equals to
45◦ as an upper limit. The lower dotted blue horizontal
line is constrained by the minimum allowed value of σ
for high redshift sources in our sample. More details
about constraining the τequatorial are discussed in the
section 3.2. The two lines never cross which means
that we do not see any possibility to have the same
torus mean parameters for low and high redshift sources.
However, we have the region where the σ is common for
both low and high redshift sources, that means that on
average we can have similar opening angle of dusty torus
in SDSS DR9Q and DR7Q catalog(Gu 2013), i.e. at
redshifts ∼ 0.8 and ∼ 2.2. However, even in this case the
mean effective viewing angle is not identical, since it also
depends on the extinction which is set by the parameter
A equal to τequatorial. We illustrate it in Figure 4. We
choose to keep the maximum value of τequatorial ∼ 100,
which has also been suggested by Nenkova et al. (2008)
for a single cloud in their clumpy torus model. Of
course, also the observational appearance of the source
is strongly affected since the ratio of the IR emission
to the optical/UV emission also steeply rises with the
torus optical depth (see Figure 5). The CF increases
very sharply below A = 10, and after that the rise slows
down and CF finally almost saturates for higher value
of ’A’. The parameter ’A’ can have large range of values
starting from 1 (constrained by equation (10)) to any-
other higher value. We have discussed the possibility of
constraining the upper limit of ’A’ in the section 3.2."
3.2. Available parameter space
"To constrain the upper limit of ’A’, we consider the
case of Compton thick type AGN. The maximum value
of the torus optical depth is not easy to measure, Burlon
et al. (2011) gives the constraint for the column density,
NH > 1025 cm−2. Now to calculate the optical depth
along the equatorial plane (A or τequatorial), we assume
NH = 5×1025 cm−2, and hence τequatorial ∼ σT *NH ,
gives τequatorial ∼ 33, where σT is the Thompson
scattering cross section.
We adopt this value as the upper limit, and therefore"
"Figure 3 shows the plot for τequatorial and σ for low
(z ∼ 0.8) and high (z ∼ 2.2) redshift sources, where A is
constrained between 1–33 and σ between 25◦ – 45◦ and
38◦ – 85◦ for low and high redshift sources, respectively."

Viewing angle effects in quasar application to cosmology 9
"luminosity distance, and X & Y-axis represent the half
opening angle at lower and higher redshifts respectively.
At the higher redshift, if the half opening angle of the
torus is less than 45◦ (i.e. σ < 45◦), we underestimate
the luminosity distance. However, if σ > 45◦, we
overestimate the luminosity distance. The error on
luminosity distance for maximum possible σ would be
∼40 % but this would happen only if the true torus
opening angle at high redshift is as high as 80◦. If the
used parameter space is too broad, and in reality the
torus at high redshift has the opening angle about 40◦,
then the maximum possible error is smaller, below 20
%. This error is just an approximation and it can be
modified in the future by considering more appropriate
model of torus geometry and measuring the viewing
angle of the individual objects, which will constrain
much better the parameter space."
"3.4. Potential error for Cosmological
parameters"
"Since the luminosity distance is used to measure the
Hubble constant in local universe and to determine
other parameters of the cosmological model, we see
that potential negligence of the systematic trend in the
viewing angle of the torus may lead to considerable
bias in determining these parameters from quasar
reverberation studies. To see how large are potential
errors in quasar-based method we translate the error in
determination of the luminosity distance to an error in
cosmological parameters. With two-redshift approach
based on the data from Gu (2013) and our model we
can only provide a simple illustration.
First we assume that standard ΛCDMmodel describes"
"correctly the expansion of the Universe and that we
know the values of the parameters ΩΛ and Ωm, but we
aimed at determination of the Hubble constant. Using
Equation 22 we thus determine the error in H0 resulting
from the incorrect representation of the quasar geometry
at high redshift of 2.2. The result is shown in Figure 7.
The contour plot has a similar shape to the error in
luminosity distance but relative errors are much smaller.
The errors in a whole parameter space are up to 18
%, but even if the opening angle of the torus at high
redshift is actually of order of 40◦, the error could reach
16 %. Since the error can be both positive and negative,
with luck we can have no error. However, if the aim
of the quasar-based method is to meet the limits of 1
%, achieved with SN Ia (Riess et al. 2020), then the
issue of the viewing angle trend in AGN cannot be
ignored. From our plot we can estimate that in order to
have 1 % accuracy in H0 we would need to determine
(statistically) the values of σ with 0.5◦ accuracy."

"Next we assume that we know the Hubble constant,
but we wish to use quasars to estimate the other
cosmological parameters, for example Ωm, assuming
that the Universe is flat. Using now Equation 23 we
derive the contour error map for the Ωm (see Figure 8).
We see that both negative and positive errors are
expected, and if the broad parameter range used for
the plot is allowed the error is huge. If the realistic
values of σhigh−z are rather close to 40◦, the error is
smaller, but achieving an error of order of 1%, required
for precision cosmology, will clearly require taking the
systematic errors connected with the viewing angle into
account.
We do not claim here that the systematic errors in"
"the published papers are actually as large as illustrated
in Figures 6 – 8 since we use here only one-parameter
data input and 2-parameter models so some ranges of
the parameter space are unlikely. However, we expect
that the plots well argue that the effect is important
and requires further studies to validate cosmological
applications. In principle, we could use exactly the
approach of Gu (2013) and interpret directly the
measured ratio as the viewing angle, thus assuming
that the torus can be modeled as a solid body, without
extinction or disk anisotropy included. In that case, we
would obtain a unique result from their measurements:
the viewing angle in the lower redshift sources would
be 40.5◦, and at high redshift sample 55.6◦. Under
those strong assumptions, the corresponding error in the
luminosity distance would then be 16%."
4. DISCUSSIONS
"The structure of AGNs can be divided in two parts.
The central part (BH + disk + BLR) of bright AGN
is dominated by the optical and UV emission from the
flat optically thick disk. At larger distance the central
parts are partially surrounded by the dusty torus, which"
10 Prince et al.
"emits mostly the reprocessed emission in the infrared
band. The dusty torus can be optically thin or optically
thick. The emission from the central part of the AGN is
anisotropic because the flat disk emission is anisotropic,
and the optically thick dusty torus further modifies the
radiation in an angle-dependent way. Therefore, the
observed bolometric luminosity of the AGNs depends
on the viewing angle. The issue is well known, Netzer
(1987) discussed how the central radiation source in
AGN was responsible for the anisotropic emission, but
it was not taken into account in the context of quasar
applications to cosmology.
In this paper we used the observational data from"
"Gu (2013) and a very simple torus model to evaluate
implications of this effect when quasars are used for
cosmology. Our toy model of torus is continuous, with
optical depth dependent on the angular distance from
the equatorial plane, we assumed that the disk emission
(also dependent on the viewing angle) is filtered by
such a torus, and we obtained constraints for the torus
structure at two values of redshift corresponding to the
mean properties of the sample from Gu (2013). Later
we assumed that the cosmological method is calibrated
at lower redshift and we checked what happens if the
change of geometry is ignored when the study of high
redshift sample is done. We specifically had in mind the
reverberation method when the absolute luminosity of
a quasar is determined either from the time delay of the
BLR lines with respect to the continuum, or from the
relative delays of two continuum bands. Such time delay
depends mostly on the actual size of the source, and only
weakly on the source inclination while the observed flux
does depend on inclination and obscuration.
Considering the effect of viewing angle and the"
"torus optical depth, we have estimated the bolometric
luminosities and the luminosity distance for high
redshift AGNs, applying either correct geometry, or
applying the geometry appropriate for the low redshift
quasar sample. We then calculated the error that one
would make on measurement of luminosity distance if
one does not consider the effect of the change in the
viewing angle and torus optical depth (Figure 6). The
result shows that the errors are quite significant and they
can not be ignored. Since the luminosity distance can
be used to do the cosmology, the error on cosmological
model can also be estimated. The errors on H0 and Ωm
are shown in Figure 7 & 8.
For a single source, as could be seen from Figure 7, the"
"4% error in H0 is equivalent to the difference in the σ by
∼ 2◦. We know that σ is directly related to the viewing
angle i and hence the change in i would be order of 2◦.
As it has been seen in many studies (Riess et al. 2020)"
"that the 1% error in H0 is significant enough to formally
claim the tension in H0. And hence from a single object
to claim the error of 1% in H0 we need the accuracy
of 0.5◦ in effective viewing angle. The viewing angle
estimated in a single source with such an accuracy would
be rather unrealistic but for cosmological applications
we need only to know the trend in the statistical sense.
Thus, if in a single source we can have an estimate of
the viewing angle with 10◦ accuracy, we would need
400 sources in a redshift bin to have statistically the
requested accuracy."
4.1. The accretion disk model
"In the current paper we used the simplest possible
representation of the accretion disk (see Equation 2)
without using explicitly the disk spectral shape. The
important fact we needed was the strict proportionality
of the observed flux to cos i, which is correct for the
standard Shakura-Sunyaev disk model (Shakura &
Sunyaev 1973). This simple model applies quite well
to bright quasars, in the optical and near-UV range.
As an illustration, in Figure 9 we show such a model
fitted to the recent quasar composite spectrum based
on XSHOOTER data (Selsing et al. 2016). The model
represents well the optical data, although at the longest
wavelengths traces of the host galaxy contribution start
to be seen. However, at far-UV and in the X-ray band,
the standard model does not apply, and the soft and
hard X-ray emission come from the innermost part of
the disk, from the warm and hot corona. In the IR, the
torus emission and the contribution from the host galaxy
dominate the broad band spectrum (for observational
discussion of broad band quasar spectra see Richards
et al. 2006). Modelling this broad band emission is
usually done using some parametric models, usually
aimed at specific energy band. Modelling IR emission
requires a model of the dusty torus, modelling the X-
ray spectra requires a model of the corona/coronas
and the model of the effects of reprocessing. For just
the broad-band spectrum, the convenient model with
two coronas was proposed by Kubota & Done (2018).
The theoretical modelling of the innermost part of the
disk is complex (see e.g. Czerny & Naddaf 2018 for
a recent review), particularly if the important role of
the magnetic field is postulated. At very high accretion
rates additionally the advection has to be included
(Abramowicz et al. 1988). At much lower Eddington
rates than typically seen in quasars an inner hot flow
replaces the cold disk (e.g. Ichimaru 1977; Narayan &
Yi 1994; Melia & Falcke 2001). These processes do not
affect the optical emission considerably. However, if the
broad-band spectrum is used, then some representation"

"Figure 9. The composite spectrum from Selsing et al.
(2016) (black line) compared to the standard Shakura
& Sunyaev (1973) accretion disk model (red line) for
parameters: black hole mass 6× 108M�, and the Eddington
ratio L/LEdd = 0.3."
of these processes is required.
4.2. Advanced torus models
"There are various methods to estimate viewing angles
of quasars. First of all, more advanced torus models
combined with the good SED data can be used for that
purpose. In past, various models have been proposed
in the context of dusty torus based on the X-ray
observations. The model MYtorus (Murphy & Yaqoob
2009) and BNtorus (Brightman & Nandra 2011) have
been used extensively for the spectroscopic studies of
the obscured AGNs. However, they have very limited
number of parameters to describe the physical scenarios
of torus. In MYtorus model the covering factor is fixed
to 50%. In BNtorus model the opening angle of the torus
is considered as a free parameter but the column density
along the line of sight is assumed to be equal to the torus
column density (which is the case for Compton thick
AGN). The torus model used in our study is more like
BNtorus model where the opening angle varies from 0◦"
"– 90◦ (along the equatorial plane – symmetric axis) and
the column density we have chosen is more like Compton
thick AGN (NH ∼ 1025 cm−2). The recent dusty torus
model (borus02) is proposed by Baloković et al. (2018)
where they assumed the toroidal geometry similar to
the BNtorus model but the new model is more flexible
in terms of available parameters space, it allows for a
different line of sight column density of the torus than
the total torus column density. Also the covering factor
is a free parameters and it varies with torus opening
angle (CF = cos θtorus) measured from the symmetry
axis. They also assumed the smooth-density torus"
"scenario which reasonably represents the physical reality
of torus. Along with the smooth density torus there
are studies which shows the possibility of clumpy torus
also. A recent study by Buchner et al. (2019) discussed
the clumpy torus model based on the X-ray studies.
The clumpiness in the torus has been observationally
confirmed through the X-ray eclipse events as reported
by Risaliti et al. (2002) & Markowitz et al. (2014). The
XCLUMPY model of Buchner et al. (2019) explains
such events.
A number of other interesting studies were also"
"done addressing the aspect of the quasar radiation
anisotropy. Venanzi et al. (2020) has studied the
impact of anisotropic radiation from central AGN on the
emergence of dusty winds. Their simulation shows that
the anisotropic radiation from central source changes the
outflow opening angle by making the wider cone with
respect to isotropic radiation. Our model also assumed
the anisotropic AGN radiation where more radiation is
expected along the symmetric axis than towards the
dusty torus. Yamada et al. (2020) in their studies
included not only the effect of the torus but also the
dusty polar outflows in their study of anisotropy. The
effect of orientation of individual AGN on the dispersion
on their luminosity and line width was included by
Negrete et al. (2018) in their study based on the virial
broadening estimator, where they also included the limb
darkening effect of the disk emission, neglected in our
approach. However, if even a small fraction of the
central flux is back-scattered towards the disk, the limb
darkening change to limb brightening effect (see e.g.
Zycki & Czerny 1994, and the references therein), and
any enhancement of the dissipation profile within the
disk close to the surface will also give the same effect
(see e.g. Różańska et al. 2015; Petrucci et al. 2020).
Recent study by Bisogni et al. (2019) shows that the"
"low EW[O III] sources are face-on view and have more
flatter IR/optical SED compared to the high EW[O III]
sources, which have edge-on view with respect to the
observer. They also claim that their finding suggest the
torus to be clumpy.
Although the clumpy torus model is the best we have
currently, a more advanced torus model which can
measure the torus parameters and the viewing angle
independently, is needed in the future."

quasar-based claims of tension in"
cosmology

corrections to quasar-based cosmological methods using
the time delay measurements. However, the issue of the"

line), and our points (in red) representing the quasars for a
standard model but with the viewing angle included (model
with δ = 0.25, and cosi0 = 0.55). Corresponding values of
the mean viewing angle are marked on the plot."
"potential problem also applies to the most developed
quasar method proposed by Risaliti & Lusso (2015).
They have tested the ΛCDM cosmological model by
using the nonlinear relation between the UV and X-ray
luminosities of quasars. In the recent paper by Risaliti
& Lusso (2019), they have considered the quasars in the
redshift range from 0.5 upto 5.5 and plotted the Hubble
diagram. Their results shows that the value of Hubble
parameter H0 matches with Suzuki et al. (2012) at lower
redshift (0-1.4). However, at higher redshift it deviates
from the ΛCDM model at statistical significance of
4σ (Risaliti & Lusso 2019). Considering the effect of
viewing angle in their equation (2) (Risaliti & Lusso
2015), we derive the luminosity distance dependence
on viewing angle, i.e. DL ∼ (cosi)0.75 for γ ∼ 0.6,
even steeper than DL ∼ (cosi)0.5 characteristic for
reverberation-based methods.
Assuming that the extinction is unimportant, we"
"illustrate how the viewing angle can mimic the departure
from the standard (ΛCDM) model. We assume that,
statistically, the effective viewing angle i of AGN may
vary as cosi = cosi0(1 + z)β . We plot the distance
modulus for the standard ΛCDM model in Figure 10.
We also plot the best fit to the quasar data provided by
Risaliti & Lusso (2019) in the form of a cosmographic
approach, taking their values of the best fit parameters.
We should note here that the use of this expansion is
questioned by Banerjee et al. (2020), but it represents
the observational results from Figure 2 of Risaliti &
Lusso (2019). If we fix the slope β = 0.3, our
points roughly reproduce the observed departure. The"
"requested change of the viewing angle (values provided
in the plot) is considerable, but plausible. If the
extinction plays a role like in our torus model (see
Section 2.2), the requested change of the viewing angle
might be even lower.
Our example does not imply that only the standard"
"ΛCDM is correct and the tension must be attributed
to the viewing angle issues. The tension can be real,
particularly if the claim is based on other probes than
quasars. The need for a revision of the standard model
is now proposed in numerous papers (Wong et al. 2020a,
Riess et al. 2019, Lusso et al. 2019) and there are already
some studies that have discussed e.g. the possibility
of Rh = ct universe instead of the ΛCDM model to
explain the Hubble tension based on Quasar data (Melia
2019, López-Corredoira et al. 2016). It is also possible
that the claim of the departure from the standard
model in Risaliti & Lusso (2019) is not justified; Melia
(2019) pointed out that the justification for introducing
more free parameters (1 for standard ΛCDM and 2
for more general expansion) have to be done properly,
and some aspects of the analysis itself were questioned
by Yang et al. (2019). However, in this paper, we
only concentrate on demonstrating that if quasars are
used for cosmology, and the method involves the use of
the quasar observed flux in the optical/UV band, the
viewing angle issue needs to be addressed.
Thus the future quasar-based studies aimed to do the"
"precision cosmology should carefully address the issue
of the potential statistical evolution of the mean torus
properties with the redshift. In their paper Khadka
& Ratra (2020) considered a combination of different
cosmological probes and concluded that the observed
disagreement with ΛCDM model at redshifts from 2 to
5 is most likely caused by problems with QSO data.
That seems like an important warning."
5. SUMMARY
"Our work is based on the results from Gu (2013) which
show the redshift evolution of CF between two samples
of quasars at two values of redshift: ∼ 0.8 and ∼ 2.2.
The higher covering factor at higher redshift suggests
that the structure and density distribution of dusty
torus could be different than at the low redshift quasars.
This change would affect statistically the viewing angles
of the sources and their observed luminosity. This
work is a pilot study to show how the viewing angle
can play an important role in measuring the luminosity
distance and further the cosmological parameters. We
have developed an analytical method to estimate the CF
by considering the viewing angle and smooth density
distribution of dusty torus. Using our method we have"
Viewing angle effects in quasar application to cosmology 13
"estimated the possible error on the luminosity distance
that we could make if we do not include the viewing
angle. Our results in Figure 6 show the error on
luminosity distance might go up to 40 % for high CF
sources (with high torus opening angle). This effect
should be verified by measuring the large sample of
quasars, with much better modelling of dusty torus
reprocessing and much better data coverage. Our study
shows that to have 1% error in H0 one need to have a
statistical accuracy of 0.5◦ in effective viewing angle in
the quasar sample, and for that one will need nearly 400
sources in a single redshift bin."
