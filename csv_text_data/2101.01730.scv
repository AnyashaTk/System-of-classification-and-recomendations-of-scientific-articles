ABSTRACT
"We present optical follow-up observations for candidate clusters in the Clusters Hiding in Plain
Sight (CHiPS ) survey, which is designed to find new galaxy clusters with extreme central galaxies
that were misidentified as bright isolated sources in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey catalog. We identify 11
cluster candidates around X-ray, radio, and mid-IR bright sources, including six well-known clusters,
two false associations of foreground and background clusters, and three new candidates which are
observed further with Chandra. Of the three new candidates, we confirm two newly discovered galaxy
clusters: CHIPS1356-3421 and CHIPS1911+4455. Both clusters are luminous enough to be detected
in the ROSAT All Sky-Survey data if not because of their bright central cores. CHIPS1911+4455 is
similar in many ways to the Phoenix cluster, but with a highly-disturbed X-ray morphology on large
scales. We find the occurrence rate for clusters that would appear to be X-ray bright point sources in
the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (and any surveys with similar angular resolution) to be 2± 1%, and the
occurrence rate of clusters with runaway cooling in their cores to be <1%, consistent with predictions
of Chaotic Cold Accretion. With the number of new groups and clusters predicted to be found with
eROSITA, the population of clusters that appear to be point sources (due to a central QSO or a dense
cool core) could be around 2000. Finally, this survey demonstrates that the Phoenix cluster is likely
the strongest cool core at z < 0.7 – anything more extreme would have been found in this survey."

1. INTRODUCTION
"Clusters of galaxies are the largest and most mas-
sive gravitationally bound objects in the universe, with
masses of roughly 1014 − 1015M� (Voit 2005) and ex-
tended on scales of several Mpc. On this scale, the den-
sity field remains in the linear regime of density perturba-
tion (Henry & Arnaud 1991). This means that the num-
ber density of clusters can be predicted based on first
principles (see Tinker et al. (2008) for the most recent
calibration of halo mass function). This number density
depends strongly on several cosmological parameters, in-
cluding Ωm (the density of total matter compare) and σ8
(the amount of fluctuation in matter density) (Vikhlinin
et al. 2009b). This forms the basis of cluster cosmology."
"Since the end of the Planck Satellite’s mission (Planck
Collaboration et al. 2018), we are now living in the era
of precision cosmology where cosmological parameters of
the universe are routinely measured with percent-level
uncertainty. To improve the precision of cluster cosmol-
ogy, various groups have been trying to increase the num-
ber of known galaxy clusters, by searching for overden-
sities of red galaxies in optical or near-infrared (Glad-"

2019), extended extragalactic emission in X-ray (Ebeling
et al. 2000, 2001; Böhringer et al. 2004), or via Sunyaev-
Zel’dovich (SZ) effect (Sunyaev & Zeldovich 1972; Bleem
et al. 2015, 2019; Planck Collaboration et al. 2016; Hilton
et al. 2020) in millimeter/sub-millimeter surveys. Each
technique has its own unique benefits and challenges.
With the invention of wide field optical telescopes, per-
forming optical surveys to find overdensities of galaxies
is relatively cheap, although optical surveys are strongly
affected by projection effects. For SZ surveys, we are ca-
pable of detecting galaxy clusters up to relatively high
redshift since the SZ signature is redshift independent.
On the other hand, the SZ signature depends strongly
on mass, restricting current-generation surveys to only
the most massive clusters (Carlstrom et al. 2002; Motl
et al. 2005). Lastly, X-ray surveys have been one of
the most popular techniques to discover galaxy clusters
since the launch of the ROSAT X-ray satellite (e.g., the
REFLEX survey (Böhringer et al. 2004)). Even though
X-ray surveys can only produce flux-limited samples of
galaxy clusters, cosmologists can take that into account
in their selection function when they estimate cosmolog-
ical parameters (Allen et al. 2008; Vikhlinin et al. 2009b;
Mantz et al. 2015). However, with the continuous im-
provement in optical cluster finders, many of these SZ
and X-ray cluster catalogs are now confirmed by the op-
tical data, such as the recent works with SZ (Bleem et al.
2020) and X-ray catalogs (Klein et al. 2019)."
"With the recent SZ discovery of the Phoenix clus-
ter (Williamson et al. 2011; McDonald et al. 2012, 2015),
the most X-ray luminous galaxy cluster known, at z ="
2 Somboonpanyakul et al.
"0.6, we have started to question our understanding of
the X-ray-survey selection function. The Phoenix clus-
ter was detected in several previous X-ray surveys, but
was misidentified as a bright point source based on its
extremely bright active galactic nucleus (AGN) and cool
core in the center of the cluster. With most X-ray surveys
identifying objects as either a point-like or an extended
source, a galaxy cluster with a bright point source in the
center could be misidentified as simply a point source.
The next logical step is to ask how many of these galaxy
clusters we have missed in the previous surveys, and how
this translates to a correction for the selection function."
"Another benefit of finding galaxy clusters hosting
bright X-ray point sources is to study the cooling flow
problem, which is the apparent disagreement between
the X-ray luminosity (cooling rate) of a cluster and the
observed star formation rate, the latter which is typi-
cally suppressed by a factor of ∼ 100. The best candi-
date for explaining the inconsistency is AGN feedback
from the central galaxy (Bower et al. 2006; Croton et al.
2006; Bower et al. 2008). There are two main modes of
AGN feedback: the kinetic mode, driven mostly by jets,
and the radiative mode, driven by the accretion of the
AGN (Fabian 2012; McNamara & Nulsen 2012; Harri-
son 2017; Gaspari et al. 2020). With very few known
galaxy clusters with extremely bright quasars, such as
H1821+643 (Russell et al. 2010), 3C 186 (Siemiginowska
et al. 2005, 2010), 3C 254 (Crawford & Fabian 2003;
Yang et al. 2018), IRAS09104+4109 (O’Sullivan et al.
2012), and the Phoenix cluster (McDonald et al. 2012),
a larger number of such objects are required to fully un-
derstand the role of radiative-mode feedback in the evo-
lution and formation of galaxy clusters. For example,
the Chaotic Cold Accretion (CCA) model predicts a tight
co-evolution between the central supermassive black hole
(SMBH) and the host cluster halo (via the cooling rate
or Lx; Gaspari et al. 2019), with flickering quasar-like
peaks reached only a few percent of times (Gaspari et al.
2017)."
"In an attempt to find more galaxy clusters hosting
bright central point sources, we started the Clusters Hid-
ing in Plain Sight (CHiPS ) survey. The details and the
first discovery from the survey is published in Somboon-
panyakul et al. (2018). In this paper, we focus on a new
optical cluster finding algorithm, developed specifically
for the CHiPS survey, to look for cluster candidates af-
ter optically imaging all of the X-ray point sources with
bright radio and mid-IR from the first part of the project.
These candidates may have been misidentified in previ-
ous all-sky surveys due to their central galaxies’ bright-
ness. After performing the cluster finding algorithm, we
present a list of newly-discovered galaxy cluster candi-
dates along with their expected redshift and richness."
"The overview of the CHiPS survey, the optical data
used in the follow-up campaign, and its methodology are
described in Section 2. In Section 3, we present details of
the data reduction and analysis for recently-obtained op-
tical data from the Magellan telescope. Our cluster find-
ing algorithm is described in Section 4 while the X-ray
data reduction is presented in Section 5. We discuss the
results and the implications of these findings in Section 6
and 7. Lastly, we summarize the paper in Section 8. We
assume H0 = 70 km s"

All errors are 1σ unless noted otherwise."
2. THE CHIPS SURVEY
"The CHiPS survey is designed to identify new cen-
trally concentrated galaxy clusters and clusters host-
ing extreme central galaxies (starbursts and/or AGNs)
within the redshift range 0.1–0.7. The first part of the
survey consists of identifying candidates by combining
several all-sky survey catalogs to look for bright objects
at multiple wavelengths. The second part of the survey,
which is the focus of this paper, addresses mainly our
optical follow-up program to determine the best cluster
candidates by searching for an overdensity of galaxies at
a given redshift centered on the location of the X-ray
sources. The last part, which is also included in this pa-
per, is to obtain Chandra data for these candidates in
order to confirm the existence of these new clusters and
characterize their properties, such as the gas tempera-
ture, the total mass, and the gas fraction."
2.1. Target Selection
"Our CHiPS target selection is described in detailed in
our previous publication (Somboonpanyakul et al. 2018);
here we outline the main steps."
"To select systems similar to the Phoenix cluster, we re-
quire sources to be bright in X-ray, mid-IR and radio, rel-
ative to near-IR. The normalization to near-IR is to pre-
vent very nearby (e.g., galactic) low-luminosity sources
from overwhelming the sample. Starting with X-ray
point source catalogs from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey
Bright Source Catalog and Faint Source Catalog (RASS-
BSC and RASS-FSC; Voges et al. 1999), we cross-
correlate with radio from NVSS (Condon et al. 1998) or
SUMSS (Mauch et al. 2003), mid-IR with WISE (Wright
et al. 2010), and near-IR with 2MASS (Skrutskie et al.
2006). This combination leads to two types of astro-
physical sources: radio-loud type II QSOs and galaxy
clusters with an active core (a starburst and/or AGN-
hosting BCG). This approach is similar to two other sur-
veys from Green et al. (2017) and Donahue et al. (2020).
The main difference is that Donahue et al. (2020) fo-
cus on previously-known optically-selected BCGs from
the GMBCG catalog (Hao et al. 2010) and Green et al.
(2017) started with spectroscopically confirmed AGN in
the ROSAT catalog. We begin our search with a com-
plete ROSAT point source catalog and combine with all
archival data from near-IR, mid-IR to radio."
"In addition, we apply color cuts in order to select only
the most extreme objects in X-ray, mid-IR, and radio,
as demonstrated in Fig. 1. The cuts are chosen to cap-
ture the expected range of color for a Phoenix-like ob-
ject at an unknown redshift between 0.1 and 0.7. The
NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)6 was used
to reject foreground (z < 0.1) and background (z > 0.7)
objects. Candidates with z < 0.1 are close enough to
be detected with past instruments even with a bright
central point source. Most of these clusters were first
detected by eye in various optical catalogs, including the
well-known Abell and Zwicky catalogs (Abell et al. 1989;
Zwicky et al. 1961), meaning that we do not expect any
misclassifications. On the other hand, clusters at z > 0.7
are exceedingly rare in the ROSAT data – not because
of a bias in their selection, but because they are simply"

"too faint. We also remove objects which have galactic
latitude less than ±15◦ because foreground stars and ex-
tinction from the Milky Way will obscure any clusters.
After the removal, we are left with 470 objects to perform
the optical follow-up, which is presented in the upcoming
section. We note that by requiring mid-IR and radio de-
tection, we emphasize the detection of Phoenix-like clus-
ters, at the expense of removing from the sample some
BCGs with central AGN that are not radio-loud or mid-
IR-bright, such as unobscured, radio-quiet AGN. This
means that the CHiPS survey will only place a lower
limit of the fraction of clusters missed by the previous
X-ray surveys."
"Further information about our target selection and
the first galaxy cluster discovered from this survey, the
galaxy cluster surrounding PKS1353-341, are presented
in Somboonpanyakul et al. (2018). In the next section,
we describe the data used for our optical follow-up of
these 470 candidates."
2.2. Optical Follow-up Observations
"The optical follow-up program is separated into two
parts based on the declination of the targets. Most ob-
jects with positive declination are followed up with the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) because of its nearly
complete coverage in the Northern Sky. Whereas, ob-
jects with negative declination are observed with ei-
ther the first data release of the Panoramic Survey
Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS1;
Chambers et al. 2016) with sky coverage of declina-
tion greater than −30◦ or additional pointed observa-
tions using the Parallel Imager for Southern Cosmolog-
ical Observations (PISCO; Stalder et al. 2014) on the
6.5m Magellan Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory,
Chile. Specifically, 256 out of our 470 candidates were
observed with SDSS, 64 candidates were observed with
Pan-STARRS1, and the remaining 150 candidates were
individually observed with PISCO on the Magellan tele-
scope. We note that data from the Dark Energy Sur-
vey (DES; Dark Energy Survey Collaboration et al. 2016)
was unavailable at the onset of the project. Fig. 2 shows
the position of all target candidates in the sky, separated
by the telescope used for the follow-up."
2.2.1. Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
"The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is a multi-
spectral imaging and spectroscopic redshift survey using
a 2.5-m optical telescope at Apache Point Observatory in
New Mexico (Gunn et al. 2006). We utilized Data release
14 (DR14), released in 2017, which is the second data re-
lease for SDSS-IV (Abolfathi et al. 2018). We retrieved
the photometric data in u, g, r, i, and z bands by query-
ing objects within a radius of 5 arcmin from the X-ray
position, using the function fGetNearestObjEq with
the Casjob server7. In Section 4, we apply a more strin-
gent cut during the cluster finding algorithm. We ob-
tained the SDSS model magnitude (modelMag) which,
as explained in the SDSS support documentation8, gives
the most unbiased estimates of galaxy colors. To convert
SDSS magnitude to flux units, we use the SDSS asinh"
"7 https://skyserver.sdss.org/CasJobs/
8 https://www.sdss.org/dr12/algorithms/magnitudes/"
"magnitude formula8, which is also described in (Lupton
et al. 1999)."
"For star/galaxy classification, “type” parameters,
provided by SDSS, were used to select only galaxies
(type = 3). The classification is based on the difference
between cmodel and PSF magnitude. Specifically, an ob-
ject is classified as extended when MagPSF−Magcmodel >
0.145. In addition, we downloaded photometric redshifts
(zsdss) for photometric redshift estimate verification in
Section 4."
"2.2.2. Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response
System (Pan-STARRS)"
"Pan-STARRS is a system for wide-field astronomical
imaging in the optical g, r, i, z, and y bands, located at
Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii. The survey used a 1.8-m
telescope, with an imaging resolution of 0.25′′/pixel from
its 1.4 Gigapixel camera. Pan-STARRS1 (PS1), the basis
for Data release 1 (DR1), covers three quarters of the sky
(3π survey) north of a declination of −30◦."
"Star/galaxy separation of PS1 is similar to that of
SDSS. Specifically, the difference between model and
PSF magnitude is measured to identify extended objects.
However, instead of applying a simple straight line as a
cut (e.g., MagPSF − MagKron > 0.05 where MagKron is
Kron magnitudes as the representation for model mag-
nitude), an exponential model is used to fit the bright
part of Fig. 3 and then extrapolated to fainter objects,
similar to Chambers et al. (2016). Further details about
this technique can be found in Farrow et al. (2014). As
shown in Fig. 3, the star-galaxy separation is not a hor-
izontal cut, but an exponential curve which takes into
account our inability to distinguish between stars and
galaxies at the fainter end. We require the cut to be
satisfied for both r and i bands. Even though this star-
galaxy-separation criterion could identify more objects
as galaxies, this should not create a large bias for our
cluster-finding algorithm. We chose Kron magnitudes
as the Pan-STARRS magnitudes for our algorithm since
they capture more light from the extended parts of galax-
ies, compared to PSF magnitudes."
2.2.3. Magellan Telescope with PISCO
"Without a more robust all-sky survey in the southern
sky similar to SDSS and Pan-STARRS in the north, we
perform 150 individual follow-up observations for targets
in the southern sky with the 6.5-m Magellan telescope.
PISCO, a multi-band photometer, is used to speed up our
observations because of our large number of candidates.
With the ability to produce g, r, i, and z band images
simultaneously, our effective efficiency in observing these
candidates increases by a factor of ∼3 (including optical
losses; Stalder et al. 2014). All candidates were acquired
with PISCO during 9 nights splitting over 3 observing
runs between 2017 January to 2017 December. We ob-
served most objects with 5-minute total exposure with
two 2.5-minute exposures for dithering. To analyze the
PISCO data, we have created a data processing pipeline.
Further details regarding data reduction and star/galaxy
separation for the CHiPS survey are presented in the
next section."

"To confirm the existence of a galaxy cluster, we re-
quire the detection of extended X-ray emission, indicat-"
"ing an extremely hot intracluster medium (ICM), reflect-
ing the deep potential well of the cluster. The Chandra
X-ray Observatory is best suited for the task, given that
our targets may have bright central point sources. With
an angular resolution of 0.5′′, Chandra has the capabil-
ity to distinguish X-ray point sources (e.g., AGN) from
the extended emission of the ICM. We observed a to-
tal of 5 additional candidates from the CHiPS survey,
apart from the initial sample of 4 candidates for the pi-
lot study (Somboonpanyakul et al. 2018). More details
about the reduction process for the X-ray data can be
found in Section 5."
"3. PISCO OBSERVATIONS AND DATA
PROCESSING"
"In this section, we describe the data reduction pro-
cess for the PISCO data. Since we obtain raw images
from the PISCO instrument on the Magellan telescope,
we developed a complete reduction pipeline to convert
these images to photometric catalogs for all galaxies in
the field, which are then used as an input for our cluster
finding algorithm. In contrast, SDSS and Pan-STARRS
are wide-field surveys with available photometric cata-
logs and, as such, do not require any further data pro-
cessing."
3.1. PISCO Image Reduction
"PISCO is a photometer that produces g, r, i, and z
band images simultaneously (Stalder et al. 2014). The
camera is composed of four 3k×4k charge-coupled de-
vices (CCDs), one for each of the four focal planes, with
an un-binned scale of 0.109′′ per pixel, resulting in a
5′ × 9′ field of view. Each CCD is read out with two
amplifiers."
"For each image, the data reduction process consists of
several steps, as follows. First, the median of all bias
frames for each night is subtracted from both the me-
dian of all flat frames and the science frames. We do
not attempt to quantify and remove the dark current, as
it is negligible in these devices. The ratio between the
two subtracted frames (flat and science) is the flat-fielded
image. The two flat-fielded images (one from each ampli-
fier) of a CCD are stitched together to create a complete"

"image for each band (g, r, i, and z) and each exposure.
L.A. Cosmic is run on each image for robust cosmic rays
detection and removal (van Dokkum 2001). Astromet-
ric calibration is carried out via Astrometry.net9, which
is used to find the absolute pointing, plate scale, orien-
tation, and additional distortions in each image (Lang
et al. 2010)."
"Multiple exposures need to be coadded to create a
final, stacked image in each band. First, an initial
source detection is run on all science images using
SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996). Objects which
are corrupted or truncated are removed from the lists by
requiring the FLAGS parameter to be less than 5. Next,
SCAMP (Bertin et al. 2002) is run over all of the im-
ages simultaneously to improve the astrometric solutions,
previously obtained from Astrometry.net. The reference
catalog we used for the astrometry is linked to the Two
Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) catalog (Skrutskie et al.
2006). The individual images of each band are then re-
sampled and coadded via SWarp (Bertin 2006). An ex-
ample of the final processed image is shown in Fig. 4."
"Fig. 4.— Three-color (g, r, i) image of the Phoenix cluster from
PISCO. The image shows several red galaxies centrally located in
the field, which is the signature of a galaxy cluster. The extremely
bright point source in the center is a reason why the Phoenix cluster
had been missed from previous X-ray surveys."
3.2. Seeing Estimation and PSF Models
"Even though each image already has an estimated see-
ing from the on-site seeing monitor, a more precise value
is required for source extraction. We achieve this by fit-
ting the Point Spread Function (PSF) models to every
object in the field and picking the most common PSF to
represent the seeing of that particular field. Specifically,
we create 45×45-pixel small sub-image (“vignettes”) for
each detected object by using SExtractor. These small
vignettes are fit using the 2D-Moffat model, available
in the Astropy model packages (Astropy Collaboration"
9 http://astrometry.net
"et al. 2018). The Moffat model is a probability distribu-
tion that more accurately represents PSFs with broader
wings than a simple Gaussian. We quote seeing measure-
ments as the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the
best-fit model. Fig. 5 shows the seeing distribution for
objected observed with the PISCO camera. The median
seeing in g, r, i, and z bands are 1.′′28, 1.′′15, 1.′′14,
and 1.′′03 respectively, meaning that the PSF tends to
be broader for bluer bands, as expected. For one 2-night
run on PISCO, the r-band data had a slightly worse (20%
larger) PSF due to alignment issues within the instru-
ment. Given that this enlarged PSF is still smaller than
that of the SDSS or Pan-STARRS data, we do not ex-
pect this to limit our analysis. The seeing distributions
are not symmetric, but highly skewed toward higher see-
ing, representing a variation in the weather at the time
of observation."

values of the seeing in g, r, i, z bands are 1.′′28, 1.′′15, 1.′′14, 1.′′03
respectively."
"Apart from an accurate seeing estimate, the PSF
model is also required for SExtractor to measure
MAG PSF. We use PSFEx to extract the PSF models
from FITS images (Bertin 2011), setting all parameters
to default. To get a good model for the PSF, we need
to only select well-behaved point sources (stars) as our
model. We achieve this by selecting sources which are
not at the edges of the CCD, not elongated, and have an
effective flux radius within 2σ of the mean for all sources
in the field."
3.3. Source Extraction
"To measure an accurate color for each object, we
extracted photometry via the dual-image mode of
SExtractor, which uses the same pixel location for
all photometric bands. The seeing estimates and the"

3.4. Star-Galaxy Seperation
"One of the most important steps for the reduction
pipeline is to separate sources into stars and galaxies.
While CLASS STAR10 is often used for this purpose,
upon our close investigation we found non-negligible con-
tamination in both the star and galaxy samples. In-
stead, we use the SPREAD MODEL parameter (from
SExtractor) which indicates whether the source is bet-
ter fit by the PSF model or a more extended model (Mohr
et al. 2012). By design, SPREAD MODEL is close to
zero for point sources and positive for extended sources.
This estimator has been used in several surveys, e.g., the
Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) (Desai et al. 2012) and
the Dynamical Analysis of Nearby Cluster (DANCe) sur-
vey (Bouy et al. 2013). In particular, we separate stars
and galaxies by the following criteria:"
galaxies : SPREAD MODEL I > 0.005
& MAG i < 17.5
"stars : SPREAD MODEL I < 0.004,"
"where MAG i is the magnitude of the object in i band.
This criteria is adapted from Sevilla-Noarbe et al. (2018),
providing a better separation between stars and galax-
ies, compared to CLASS STAR, because we take into
account the PSF variation in the calculation. The ex-
act values of the thresholds are not extremely impor-
tant since we will later estimate the photometric redshfits
(zphot) for each object, as shown in Section 4.1. If an ob-
ject is wrongly identified as a galaxy, we will not obtain
a good fit for zphot and the object will be removed from
the cluster finding algorithm. More details and differ-
ent tests to quantify the performance of this star-galaxy
statistic can be found in Sevilla-Noarbe et al. (2018)."
3.5. Photometric Calibration
"To calibrate the color and the magnitudes of stars and
galaxies, we use Stellar Locus Regression (SLR; High
et al. 2009). SLR adjusts the instrumental colors of
stars and galaxies and simultaneously solves for all un-
known zero-points by matching them to a universal stel-
lar color-color locus and the known 2MASS catalog. The
calibration takes into account difference in instrumental"
10 https : //sextractor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ClassStar.html
"response, atmospheric transparency, and galactic extinc-
tion. SLR has been used to calibrate photometry for var-
ious surveys including SPT follow-up (High et al. 2010)
and the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS; Bleem et al.
2015). The specific implementation of the algorithm that
we utilize here is described in Kelly et al. (2014)."
"For each frame, we use the stellar sources identified
in Section 3.4 as the starting point. We then perform
the stellar locus regression, which simultaneously cali-
brates all optical colors onto the SDSS system. The ab-
solute flux scaling (or zeropoint) is then constrained via
the optical-infrared colors from SLR, combined with the
2MASS point source catalog (Skrutskie et al. 2006)."
3.6. Photometric Verification
"We perform a comparison test to check the accuracy of
the photometric calibration. The test is carried out by
comparing between the colors (g− r, r− i, and i− z) we
obtained from the PISCO pipeline and the SDSS colors.
To enable this verification, we observed three fields in our
SDSS target list with PISCO, reducing the data using
the same PISCO pipeline that we have described above.
Galaxies found in the SDSS catalog are matched with
objects in our observed PISCO frames based on their
celestial coordinates. The objects are plotted in Fig. 6,
showing the offsets between the color from PISCO and
SDSS. The scatter (σ) of the PISCO colors compared
to the SDSS colors is around 0.08–0.14 mag for brighter
objects (16 < iPISCO < 20), which is as accurate as the
calibration between SDSS and Pan-STARRS (Chambers
et al. 2016)."
4. CLUSTER FINDING ALGORITHM
"In this section, we describe the new cluster finding
algorithm. Because of the nature of our survey, which
looks for cluster candidates surrounding X-ray/IR/radio
sources, we already have the central location of the
cluster, which we assume to be the location of the X-
ray/IR/radio source. This means that unlike some op-
tical cluster finding surveys, we do not use a friend-of-
friend algorithm (Huchra & Geller 1982) to search for the
center of the cluster. Instead, we look for an overdensity
of galaxies with similar redshifts at the location of the
X-ray source."
"Specifically, we search for a peak in the redshift his-
togram of all the galaxies within the observed fields.
Members of a galaxy cluster will have similar redshifts,
meaning that finding the peak in the redshift histogram
will differentiate between cluster members and field
galaxies. The peak location corresponds to the redshift
of the galaxy cluster."
"The algorithm is divided into three parts: photomet-
ric redshift measurement, aperture selection and back-
ground subtraction, and richness correction for high-
redshift clusters."
4.1. Photometric Redshift
"The first step of the algorithm is to estimate photo-
metric redshifts of all galaxies in the field. Mid-IR data
is included in this step to improve constraints. The sec-
tions below describes data acquisition for Mid-IR bands
from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (Wright
et al. 2010, WISE ), and the software used for photomet-
ric redshift estimates."

ones (20 < iPISCO < 24). The orange lines are the gaussian best-
fit model with its mean and its standard deviation in the legend.
This demonstrate that for bright objects, the scatter of the PISCO
calibration from the SDSS is about 0.10-0.14 mag."
4.1.1. Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)
"WISE is an IR satellite with four IR filters, including
W1 (3.6 µm), W2 (4.3 µm), W3 (12 µm), and W4 (22
µm). We select galaxies in the AllWISE Source Catalog,
using IRSA’s Simple Cone Search (SCS)11, and match
them with their optical counterparts from SDSS, Pan-
STARRS, or PISCO within a radius of 3”. However be-
cause the FWHM for W1 and W2 is rather large (∼6”,
compared to ∼1” for optical data12), we cannot separate
different optical galaxies from the WISE sources, espe-
cially at the center of the cluster where large number of
objects are presented in a small region. Thus, we only
use the WISE measurement from both W1 and W2 as
upper limits to help constrain the photometric redshifts."
4.1.2. Photometric Redshift Estimate
"11 https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/vo scs.html
12 http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allsky/expsup/"
sec4 4c.html
"Each galaxy’s photometric redshift (zphot) is deter-
mined by fitting the photometry in optical and Mid-
IR bands to the template spectral energy distribution
(SEDs) using the Bayesian Photometric Redshifts (BPZ)
code (Beńıtez 2000; Coe et al. 2006). The BPZ code
uses Bayesian inference and priors to estimate photomet-
ric redshifts using multi-wavelength broad-band data.
We used the default templates, consisting of one early-
type, two late-type and one irregular-type templates
from Coleman et al. (1980) and two starburst templates
from Kinney et al. (1996). We also added WISE filters
for W1 and W2 band. Since there is no response filter
for the PISCO optical bands, we convert the photometry
from PISCO to SDSS bands and use SDSS response fil-
ters instead. Specifically, we convert the photometry to
the SDSS system by fitting a linear function of the form:
(g− r)SDSS = A+B(g− r)PISCO, and likewise for r− i
and i − z colors. This amounts to removing the offset
shown in Fig. 6. We apply these corrections to all of the
PISCO bands to shift them to the SDSS system. We do
not expect the difference in the response filter to have a
large impact on the final redshift since PISCO filters are
designed to be as similar to the SDSS filters as possible."
4.1.3. Redshift Verification
"To verify our photometric redshifts, we compare 612
redshifts from the BPZ algorithm to those publicly avail-
able from SDSS3 (Abolfathi et al. 2018). In Fig. 7, we
show the comparison of BPZ redshifts to those from
SDSS3, measuring σz/(1 + z) ∼ 0.05. The median off-
set between BPZ and SDSS3 redshifts is ∼ 0.03, which
is also less than our typical per-galaxy photometric red-
shift uncertainty. Utilizing 6 previously-known clusters
that were identified in our sample (see Section 6.1), we
also find a scatter between our cluster redshifts and the
published values of σz/(1+z) ∼0.012. Given this overall
agreement, we proceed with BPZ redshifts for the full
sample."
4.2. Aperture Selection and Redshift Histogram
"In terms of aperture selection, we choose a simple top
hat model with a radius of one arcminute. This allows
us to do a more simple correction for the richness value,
as discussed in Section 4.3. Next, we create a histogram
representing the redshift distribution of all the galax-
ies in the selected aperture. Since the peak value in-
cludes the background level of field galaxies, we estimate
the background distribution by making a redshift his-
togram of field galaxies in all images of each instrument
(SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and PISCO). There are ∼22, 000
background galaxies for PAN-STARRS and PISCO, and
∼ 27, 000 galaxies for SDSS. We normalized the back-
ground histogram for each observation by scaling the to-
tal number of objects in the background histogram to be
the same as the histogram of interest and subtract from
it."
"Fig. 8 shows the limiting magnitude for each observa-
tion, which demonstrates that the depth of each survey
is quite uniform. The detailed calculation for the limit-
ing magnitude is presented in Section 4.3. For PISCO,
we made sure that every observation has the same ex-
posure time of 5 minutes. This uniformity allows us to
construct the background for each instrument without
large variations in limiting magnitude."

"The top panel of Fig. 9 shows both the redshift dis-
tribution of all the galaxies (in blue) and the normal-
ized distribution of background galaxies (in orange). The
background-subtracted histogram is then used to search
for a redshift peak, as shown in the bottom panel of
Fig. 9. Since the redshifts estimated from the BPZ code
have some uncertainty, we fit a fixed-width Gaussian to
the peak and the two neighboring bins to get an estimate
for the richness (the amplitude of the Gaussian) and the
final redshift (the location of the Gaussian)."
4.3. Richness Correction
"Because observations were made from different opti-
cal telescopes and galaxy clusters are located at different
redshifts, a correction to the measured richness is neces-
sary to have a uniform proxy for cluster mass across all
fields and all redshifts. The two effects we have taken
into account include the luminosity function of galaxies
and the evolving angular size of galaxy clusters on the
sky. We check both effects and find that the luminosity
function correction is larger than the angular diameter
correction by a factor of ∼50–1000, depending on the
redshift, so we only consider the luminosity correction."
"Extremely bright objects tend to be rare, compared
to fainter objects, implying that cluster candidates at
higher redshift will have fewer observable members since
the majority of them will be too faint to detect with our
current instruments. This correction is used to remedy
the galaxy counts to account for galaxies that are be-
low detection limits. The luminosity function (L(M))
we used comes from Wen & Han (2015) which combines
the Schechter function (φs(M)) (Schechter 1976) and the"
composite luminosity function of the BCGs (φg(M)):
L(M) =φs(M) + φg(M)

−0.4(M−M∗)(α+1)"
exp [−10−0.4(M−M∗)]

φ0√
2πσ"
(M −M0)2
"where α is the faint-end slope, M∗ and M0 are the char-
acteristic absolute magnitudes, φ∗ and φ0 are the nor-
malization factors. Another effect related to the lu-
minosity function comes from variability in the depth
of the survey in different field/telescopes. Specifically,
SDSS is deeper (fainter limiting magnitude) than Pan-
STARRS. Whereas, PISCO has a large variation within
itself, which comes from the variation in the weather con-
ditions when we observed these objects. We estimate
the limiting magnitude for each observation by fitting
two gaussians to the brightness distribution and using
the location of the fainter peak to represent the limit-
ing magnitude. The purpose of the double gaussian fit
is to capture the skewness in the brightness distribution,
which varies from field to field."
"Fig. 10 illustrates the richness correction at different
redshifts and limiting magnitude (Mlim). The correction
is strongest when we consider high redshift objects with
bright limiting magnitudes. The richness is calculated
using"
Richness = Nobs
"∫mdeep
−∞ L(M)dM∫mlim
−∞ L(M)dM"
"where Nobs is the number of galaxies found from the
survey, mdeep is the limiting magnitude of our deepest
field (z = 0.1 at a limiting magnitude of 23), and mlim is
the magnitude limit of each field. The typical correction
is on the order from 1 to 5."
4.4. Flux-Limited Nature of Previous Surveys
"The CHiPS survey is designed to look for misiden-
tified galaxy clusters in surveys based on data from
the ROSAT telescope. One such survey, the ROSAT-
ESO Flux-Limited X-ray (REFLEX) Galaxy Cluster
Survey (Böhringer et al. 2004), contains 447 galaxy clus-
ters above an X-ray flux of ∼3×1037 erg s−1 Mpc−2 (0.1-
2.4 keV) which are all spectroscopically confirmed. The
left panel of Fig. 11 shows all 447 clusters in the RE-
FLEX sample on an X-ray luminosity (Lx) vs redshift
plot, with the blue line showing the constant flux limit
of the REFLEX sample. It is assumed that this sur-
vey has found all of the galaxy clusters with luminosities
above this limit."
"However, some of the X-ray bright point sources de-
tected by ROSAT are believed to be misidentified mas-
sive clusters with extreme central galaxies. One of our
goals is to find clusters exceeding the REFLEX flux limit
but that are classified as point sources. Since obtaining
new optical data is more straightforward to obtain com-
pared to X-ray, we convert this REFLEX flux limit to
an optical richness limit which can then be used for our
richness cut, as described in Section 6."
"In order to convert this X-ray flux limit to a rich-
ness limit, the optical richness of this sample is required."

"section, we estimate the richness of all 82 REFLEX clus-
ters. Since both the richness and X-ray luminosity are
correlated with the total mass of the clusters, we fit a
straight line to the log-log plot, as shown in the middle
panel of Fig. 11, to find the relation between the flux limit
and the richness limit. For the small number of clusters
here, and not accounting for selection effects, we measure
an intrinsic scatter between richness and X-ray luminos-
ity σlnλ|M = 0.33 ± 0.07, compared to σlnλ|M ∼ 0.46
from a sample of SDSS redMapper clusters (Murata et al.
2018). The last panel of Fig. 11 shows the X-ray flux limit
projected onto the richness-redshift plot, via the relation-
ship between richness and X-ray luminosity. Assuming
that all clusters follow the same richness–luminosity re-
lation, those systems that lie above this line should have"
10 Somboonpanyakul et al.
"been discovered by the REFLEX survey. In reality, there
is significant scatter in the richness–luminosity relation,
and those clusters that scatter high in richness at low
X-ray luminosity would have been rightfully missed (for
example, CHIPS2155-3727)."
5. X-RAY DATA REDUCTION
"In addition to the optical survey, we performed X-ray
follow-up of 9 promising candidates with Chandra. Three
of them are shown in this work. Four candidates were fol-
lowed up in Chandra Cycle 16 based on an earlier version
of our selection (Somboonpanyakul et al. 2018), which
yielded the re-observation of a lesser-known cluster, two
systems that turned out to be isolated point sources,
and CHIPS1356-3421. In Cycle 20, we followed up an
additional 5 candidates, which yielded the detection of
CHIPS1911+4455. Both of these follow-up campaigns
were based on preliminary catalogs and, thus, had an in-
flated false-positive rate. In this section, we describe the
X-ray data reduction process to estimate the total mass
and luminosity of these clusters. A more detailed anal-
ysis with these data is described in (Somboonpanyakul
et al. 2018)."
"All CHiPS candidates were observed with Chandra
ACIS-I for 30-40 ks each. The data was analyzed with
CIAO (Fruscione et al. 2006) version 4.11 and CALDB
version 4.8.5, provided by Chandra X-ray Center (CXC).
The event data was re-calibrated with VFAINT mode,
and point sources, which are not in the center, were ex-
cluded with the wavdetect function. The image was pro-
duced by applying csmooth, which adaptively smoothed
an image with maximal smoothing scale of 15 pixels and
signal-to-noise ratio between 2.5 and 3.5."
"High angular resolution X-ray images can be used to
estimate different properties of the cluster, including the
mass and total luminosity. We choose M500, the to-
tal mass within R500, the radius within which the av-
erage enclosed density is 500 times the critical density
(ρc = 3H"
"2
0/8πG), to represent the total cluster mass."
"We use scaling relations from (Vikhlinin et al. 2009a) it-
eratively to estimate R500, which is then used to measure
Tx, Mg, and M500. Specifically to estimate M500, we use
the scaling relation with Yx = Mg × Tx"

"Yx
3× 1014M�"
")0.57±0.03
E(z)−2/5."
"Yx is chosen as a mass proxy because of its low scat-
ter and insensitivity to the dynamical state of the clus-
ter (Kravtsov et al. 2006; Marrone et al. 2009). More
details about the method to estimate M500 can be found
in Andersson et al. (2011)."
"In addition to mass, we measure the total X-ray lumi-
nosity of each cluster. We first extract an X-ray spec-
trum of all emission within R500, centered on the X-ray
peak, and then we fit this spectrum using a combina-
tion of collisionally-ionized plasma (APEC) and Galactic
absorption (PHABS). This allows us to estimate the unab-
sorbed X-ray flux, which we then convert to a rest-frame
luminosity given the known redshift."
6. RESULTS
"From Fig. 12, we identify 11 cluster candidates by se-
lecting all objects above the solid blue line, which is the
richness limit derived in Section 4.4. The objects be-
low this line are not necessary all isolated AGNs. They
may belong to less massive clusters that fall below our
selection threshold – here we only consider very massive
clusters that should have been included in surveys such
as REFLEX (Böhringer et al. 2004) and MACS (Ebeling
et al. 2001), but were missed due to the presence of an
atypical central galaxy."
"Using the NASA Extragalactic Database13 catalog, we
search for known clusters within a 3′ radius of the 11 can-
didates and report, when available, the redshift of known
clusters. In Table 2, we present all 11 candidates with
their celestial coordinates, richness, measured redshifts,
instruments used to detect, and known clusters associ-
ated with each system."
6.1. Known Clusters Rediscovered
"We find 6 of 11 cluster candidates to be well-known
clusters via the NED catalog. In general, these clus-
ters can be divided into two classes: starburst-hosting
clusters, such as Abell 1835 (SFR∼ 100 − 180 M� yr−1;
McNamara et al. 2006) and Zwicky 3146 (SFR ∼
70 M� yr"
"−1; Edge et al. 1994), or AGN-hosting clus-
ters, such as Abell 2667 (Rizza et al. 1998) and IRAS
09104+4109 (Crawford & Vanderriest 1996). Another
notable example is the Phoenix cluster (McDonald et al.
2012), which has both a starburst-hosting galaxy and a
central AGN."
"The list of “rediscovered” clusters include some of the
most interesting and well-known galaxy clusters in the
nearby Universe. It is an interesting question to ask
whether they would have been misidentified by ROSAT
as isolated point sources had Abell and Zwicky not per-
formed their optical surveys first. At higher redshift
and lower mass, where future surveys like eROSITA will
probe, this issue will likely be exacerbated, requiring
multi-wavelength surveys combining X-ray and, for ex-
ample, optical or SZ, to fully identify the rich variety of
galaxy clusters."
6.2. False Associations
"There are two galaxy overdensities that we identify
in the background of known clusters (CHIPS0012-1628,
CHIPS0237-2630). In both of these cases, the foreground
cluster (Abell 11, Abell 368) harbors a BCG that is mid-
IR and radio bright, but falls below the richness threshold
defined above. At the same time, in both cases, the back-
ground overdensity corresponds to a much richer cluster
that does not harbor an X-ray/IR/radio source at its
center. Thus, in these cases, the “extreme BCG” is in
the foreground, while the massive, “missed” cluster is in
the background. While these systems are interesting in
their own right, for a number of reasons, they do not
satisfy the selection requirements of this survey."
6.3. New Cluster Candidates
"The removal of previously-known clusters and false as-
sociations leaves us with a sample of three cluster candi-
dates, all of which are rich enough that they should have"

shows optical images of all three candidates, including
CHIPS1356-3421, CHIPS1911+4455, and CHIPS2155-

of red galaxies at the location of the X-ray point source,
which is at the center of each field. The three candidates
look similar to the Phoenix cluster in that their BCG
colors are different from other red member galaxies, im-
plying an active central galaxy."
"We followed up all three candidates with new Chan-
dra observations over the past two years to search for
extended ICM emission, which would confirm the pres-
ence of a massive cluster. Even though optical detection
of an overdensity of red galaxies alone can often be used
to claim discovery of new galaxy clusters, lower-richness
candidates can be the result of line of sight alignment
from sheets and filaments of galaxies, which can coin-
cidentally increase the numbers of red galaxies on the
plane of the sky."
"Fig. 14 shows adaptively-smoothed Chandra X-ray im-
ages of all three candidates. The rightmost panel of the"
"figure shows that CHIPS2155-3727 has no (or extremely
faint) extended X-ray emission, implying that the over-
density of red galaxies we saw in the optical image in
Fig. 13 is likely a projection effect. The other two pan-
els show extended emissions around bright point sources
in the cores. In Table 3, we provide a summary of the
X-ray properties (R500, M500, and Lx) for the three clus-
ter candidates, derived from the X-ray images. The first
two objects are confirmed massive galaxy clusters, with
total cluster masses greater than 3× 1014M�. With our
current dataset, we can only provide upper limits for the
mass and total luminosity of a cluster for CHIPS2155-
3727. In the follow subsections, we discuss each of these
three systems in further detail."
6.3.1. CHIPS1356-3421
"The galaxy cluster surrounding PKS1353-341, also
known as CHIPS1356-3421, was the first newly discov-
ered and confirmed galaxy cluster from the CHiPS sur-
vey with Chandra X-ray observations (Somboonpanyakul
et al. 2018). It was missed from other X-ray surveys be-
cause of an extremely bright AGN in the central galaxy."

star formation rate (SFR), based on archival UV data, in
the central galaxy of CHIPS1356-3421, which is roughly
a few percent of the cooling rate – typical of a well-
regulated cool core cluster. Given this low star formation
rate, we expect that the mid-IR flux is dominated by the
central AGN and not by a starburst. More details about
this object can be found in our previously published pa-
per (Somboonpanyakul et al. 2018)."

far, harboring a very blue galaxy in the center that is
surrounded by many red satellite galaxies, similar to the

which is as cool as in the Phoenix cluster. However, de-
spite having a blue massive central galaxy and a strong
cool core, the system shows a highly-disturbed morphol-
ogy on both large (>100 kpc) and small scales (∼ 20
kpc). Possible scenarios for such a morphology include a
recent major merger or a powerful AGN outburst (e.g.,
Calzadilla et al. (2019)). This finding is in opposition
to most other known cool core clusters, which are typi-
cally highly-relaxed. Additional data will be obtained for
this object, including high resolution optical images from
the Hubble Space Telescope and optical spectra from
the Nordic Optical Telescope to look for strong emission
lines, a signature of ongoing star formation. A complete
analysis of this system is being published in a compan-
ion paper, which will include a complete X-ray analysis
of the cluster, optical spectroscopy of the central galaxy,
and high-resolution Hubble imaging of the cluster core."
6.3.3. CHIPS2155-3727
"Even though the optical image of CHIPS2155-3727
clearly shows an overdensity of red galaxies at the lo-
cation of the X-ray source, as shown in Fig. 13, the
Chandra observation of CHIPS2155-3727 shows no ex-
tended emission around the X-ray point source. The
non-detection of extended emission in Fig. 14 could imply
that the overdensity of galaxies is either a projection of a
sheet/filament along the line of sight or a smaller galaxy
group below our detection threshold. Spectroscopic data
is required to determine whether this is simply a pro-
jection effect. Based on the X-ray image, the estimated
upper limit for the mass of the cluster, if it exists, is less
than 1× 1014M�."
7. DISCUSSION
7.1. Updating Flux-Limited Surveys
"We estimate the rest-frame 0.1-2.4 keV X-ray lumi-
nosity, the same as the REFLEX survey, of the new
clusters within an aperture of 1 Mpc. Fig. 15 shows
the X-ray luminosity of newly discovered galaxy clus-
ters and their redshift with respect to clusters from the
REFLEX (Böhringer et al. 2004), eBCS (Ebeling et al.
2000), and MACS (Ebeling et al. 2001) catalogs. These
three cluster catalogs were created by first selecting X-
ray bright objects from the ROSAT-All Sky Survey and
then confirming via an overdensity of galaxies at a com-
mon spectroscopic redshift. The solid lines represent the
flux limit of the MACS and REFLEX surveys at 1 and
3× 10−12 erg s−1 cm−2, respectively. The fact that clus-
ters from these three catalogs follow closely the afore-
mentioned flux limits highlights the clean selection of
X-ray surveys, which are biased towards high-mass sys-
tems at high-z, but in a mostly predictable way. How-"

CHIPS1911+4455 appears to be a recent merger. The image of CHIPS2155-3727 only shows a bright point source without any extended
emission, meaning that it is unlikely to be a massive cluster."
"ever, the figure shows that the two CHiPS clusters should
have been found by these previous X-ray cluster catalogs,
which are all based on the ROSAT data, but were not
because of their highly-concentrated X-ray profiles and
non-standard BCG colors. This is, similarly, why the
Phoenix cluster was not discovered until recently even
though it is the most X-ray luminous cluster known (Mc-
Donald et al. 2012)."
"7.2. Rarity of Clusters Hosting Extreme Central
Galaxies"
"One of the main goals of the CHiPS survey is to find
more galaxy clusters with extreme central galaxies (star-
bursts and/or AGNs) by looking for clusters around X-
ray bright point sources which are also bright in the
mid-IR and radio. Given that we have only discovered
two new Phoenix-like systems, only one of which has
an exceptionally-high star formation rate, we can con-
clude that such rapidly-cooling systems are extremely
rare. From this work, we find that the total number
of galaxy clusters with extreme central galaxies to be
around 10 objects above the ROSAT detection limit."
"To estimate how rare such a system is, we approxi-
mate the total population of galaxy clusters found by
the ROSAT satellite by combining the REFLEX, eBCS,"
"and MACS samples. Given the total number of clus-
ters detected with the ROSAT data to be about 460 in
total (0.1<z<0.7), the occurrence rate of extreme (star-
bursts and/or rapidly-accreting AGN) central galaxies is
2 ± 1%. We separate the clusters into two redshift bins
to see whether there is any difference. The rate is 2±1%
for nearby objects (z = 0.1−0.3) while the rate becomes
5±2% for higher redshift objects (z = 0.3−0.7). At this
stage, we do not see any significant difference between
the two redshift bins. A deeper and higher resolution
X-ray all-sky survey is required to improve our estimate
of the occurrence rate of extreme sources in the center of
clusters."
"This survey shows that the occurrence rate of clus-
ters hosting extreme central galaxies – defined as systems
with either rapidly accreting supermassive black holes or
ongoing, massive starburst – is extremely low, of order a
few percent. This is consistent with the pink/flicker noise
temporal statistics observed in the CCA model and re-
lated high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations (Gas-
pari et al. 2017, 2019), which predict a 2 dex increase
in the SMBH accretion rate ∼ 1% of the time. Such a
rarity of quasar-like blast events is in agreement with
the tight, gentle self-regulation driven via CCA (aris-
ing from the hot halo condensation), which preserves the"

consistent with the observed scatter in the SFR at fixed
cooling rate (Molendi et al. 2016; McDonald et al. 2018),
showing 10× higher SFR in less than 10% of clusters."
7.2.1. Uniqueness of the Phoenix Cluster
"The Phoenix cluster is one of the most unique clus-
ters found recently (McDonald et al. 2012, 2019). The
central galaxy of the cluster hosts an extremely X-ray
luminous AGN with bright radio jets. High resolution
optical/X-ray images also reveal a massive cooling flow
extended up to hundreds of kpc, which is accompanied by
a starburst-hosting BCG. The estimated star formation
rate of its BCG is tremendous at 798± 42 M� yr−1 (Mc-
Donald et al. 2013), which is the highest of all known
clusters. It seems that the AGN feedback, which has
been thought to be responsible for stopping the cooling
of new stars in central galaxies (Fabian 2012; McNamara
& Nulsen 2012), is not effective in the Phoenix cluster,
leading to an extremely high star formation rate in the
BCG and the presence of a cooling flow. Nonetheless
with only one such system, we cannot fully understand
where this system fits in our overall understanding of the
cooling/feedback cycle. The CHiPS survey was designed
in part to find more of these systems."
"In this work, we find, at most, one potential analog to
the Phoenix cluster: CHIPS1911+4455. This system has
a luminous blue galaxy in the center of the cluster, sim-
ilar to the Phoenix cluster, suggesting the presence of a
massive starburst. We will present a detailed analysis of
this system, based on ground-based optical spectroscopy
and high resolution Hubble imaging, in a companion pa-
per. Further, based on in-hand Chandra data, we find"
"evidence that the core may be cooling just as rapidly
as in the Phoenix cluster (Somboonpanyakul et al. in
prep). Considering this, the total number of Phoenix-
like clusters are, at most, two (the Phoenix cluster and
CHIPS1911+4455) out of ∼ 460 systems in a complete
X-ray flux-limited sample from the ROSAT-All Sky Sur-
vey. This means that the rate of occurrences for such
rapidly-cooling systems is less than one percent of the
massive cluster population. One explanation for such a
rare event is that an intense short-lived cooling of the
intracluster medium or a short-lived brightening of the
central AGN are a part of the AGN feedback cycle and
flickering CCA (Gaspari et al. 2011; Prasad et al. 2019).
We can roughly estimate how short this burst of cool-
ing would have been if we find only two such systems
at 0.1 < z < 0.7. Assuming all clusters go through the
evolutionary phases in the same manner, within the past
∼ 5 Gyr, the rapidly-cooling phase for clusters lasts, on
average, for ∼22 Myr. Since most signatures of star for-
mation last for roughly 20 Myr (Kennicutt 1998), this
implies that almost the full cluster population could go
through a short-lived phase of rapid cooling, and we
would only expect to observe it (and the subsequent
young stellar populations) in a few percent of clusters."
7.3. Planck Cluster Candidates
"Two of the three clusters, CHIPS1356-3421 and
CHIPS1911+4455, have corresponding Planck cluster
candidates at SNR = 5.76 and 4.64, respectively (Planck
Collaboration et al. 2016). Specifically, the Planck
source at the location of CHIPS1356-3421 is among the
1653 SZ detections in the Planck catalog, but it is
not a member of the 1203 confirmed detections. Som-
boonpanyakul et al. (2018) shows that it is in fact a
massive cool core cluster at that location. Meanwhile,
CHIPS1911+4455 has a weaker signal with SNR=4.64
but has an additional counterpart in an external dataset,
specifically a significant galaxy overdensity in the WISE
data. These two examples show that we could potentially
further utilize the Planck catalog of unconfirmed SZ
sources to help confirm the existence of these hidden clus-
ters with lower richness than what we are able to achieve
currently with the CHiPS survey. Even though Planck’s
threshold for cluster detection is higher than what we
found with the CHiPS survey, the Planck catalog also
includes many low-significance candidates. Works simi-
lar to the CHiPS survey will have the potential to help
confirm the existence of galaxy clusters in this lower-
significance regime since it is highly unlikely that the
two completely different techniques will find a cluster
candidate at the same location."
7.4. Missing known clusters in the survey
"Based on (McDonald et al. 2018), there are 9 known
clusters at z < 1 that host a massive star-forming
galaxy (SFR > 60 M� yr"
"−1) in the center. The
CHiPS survey rediscovered four of them, including
Abell 1835, Zwicky 3146, IRAS 09104+4109, and the
Phoenix cluster. The other five are the Perseus cluster,
H1821+643, MACS1931.8–2634, RXJ1532.9+3021, and
RXJ1504.1–0248. In this section, we explain why these
five clusters are not detected in the survey."

It is not in our survey because its redshift (z = 0.0179)"

"falls outside of our interested range of 0.1 < z < 0.7. We
exclude z < 0.1 because there are countless optical sur-
veys looking for massive clusters at that redshift range."
"The galaxy cluster surrounding H1821+643 is the only
low-redshift (z = 0.299) galaxy cluster which contains a
highly luminous, unobscured quasar in the center (Rus-
sell et al. 2010). However, the quasar H1821+643 is a
radio-quiet quasar (Blundell & Rawlings 2001). It is
not included in the CHiPS survey because our catalog
requires objects to be relatively bright in radio at 1.4
GHz. Furthermore, the CHiPS survey is also normal-
ized by the optical images to remove the dependence on
redshift; however this also means that we penalize ob-
jects which have an extremely bright optical counterpart.
These choices were made to reduce the number of candi-
dates to a manageable size for optical follow-up, but will
naturally exclude some interesting systems. Thus, we
are unable to comment on the occurrence rate of clusters
hosting extremely optically-bright or radio-quiet quasars
at their center."
"MACS1931.8–2634 is another example of a cluster
with a powerful AGN outburst amid a major merger
event (Ehlert et al. 2011). However, its X-ray location
from RASS-BSC and its radio location from NVSS are
36” apart, which is three times larger than our aver-
age distance when matching between the two surveys.
1.4 GHz radio observations from the Very Large Array
(VLA) shows a brighter Narrow Angle tail (NAT) ra-
dio galaxy 45” to the south of the BCG (Ehlert et al."
"2011). This radio source could be a power jet from a
nearby galaxy that is falling into the BCG. With the
45-arcsecond angular resolution of the NVSS catalog, we
conclude that the radio location of MACS1931.8–2634 in
NVSS is a blended point between the BCG and the radio
galaxy."
"The last two clusters, RXJ1504.1–0248 and
RXJ1532.9+3021, have relative large star forma-
tion rates at 85 ± 9 M� yr−1 and 98 ± 19 M� yr−1,
respectively. However, they are not within our mid-IR
color-cut for our selection which focuses our selections
to the Phoenix cluster. In fact, both of them are very
close to our selection cutoff from Section 2. This helps
to clarify the baseline type of cluster that we expect to
find, specifically clusters with SFR > 100 M� yr"
"−1 in
the BCG."
"Both 3C 186 and 3C 254 are also not found in the
CHiPS survey. This is to be expected since the redshfits
for both of them are 1.01 and 0.74, respectively, which
is more than our redshift cut at 0.7, as mentioned in
Section 2.1."
7.5. eROSITA
"With the recent launch of the extended ROentgen Sur-
vey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) (Pre-
dehl et al. 2018) mission in July 2019, an X-ray instru-
ment performing the first imaging all-sky survey in the
energy range up to 10 keV, thousands of new galaxy clus-
ters and AGNs will be discovered."
The CHiPS survey helps to predict the potential bi-
16 Somboonpanyakul et al.
"ases in the eROSITA survey, if selection is made based
solely on the presence of extended X-ray emission. Some
massive groups and clusters with extreme BCGs will ap-
pear point-like in the X-ray, similar to what we found
with the ROSAT all-sky survey and the CHiPS sur-
vey. Specifically, the types of system that will be missed
include systems where the point source dominates the
extended emission (e.g., QSO-central clusters) and sys-
tems whose cool core appears point-like (e.g., distant,
strongly-cooling systems). With the predicted 105 clus-
ters found with eROSITA (Pillepich et al. 2012), two
percent of clusters with extreme central galaxies, as de-
scribed in Section 7.2, is equal to ∼ 2000 clusters that
eROSITA will miss if the survey only characterizes ex-
tended X-ray emissions as cluster candidates. Pillepich
et al. (2012) also estimated that with eROSITA clus-
ter counts and cosmology priors from the Planck mis-
sion, the uncertainty of Ωm will be less than two percent.
Thus, it is crucial to take into account these missing clus-
ters, which appear point-like."
"One proposed solution for eROSITA is to allow new
X-ray detections be classified as both a point source and
an extended source if there is any faint extended emis-
sion surrounding a point source. This could potentially
help identify even more clusters with extreme central
properties. Additionally, the upcoming Vera C. Rubin
Observatory, a wide-field telescope with 8.4-meter pri-
mary mirror, is expected to be operated by 2021 (Ivezić
et al. 2019). The telescope will provide an enormous
amount of optical data suitable for following up new
cluster candidates. An important note for the optical
follow-up is the need to allow the presence of non-typical
(i.e., blue) BCGs, which is a current problem in many
BCG-identifying codes."
8. SUMMARY
"In this work, we present a complete optical description
of the Clusters Hiding in Plain Sight (CHiPS ) survey, a
new galaxy cluster survey using both archival (SDSS and
Pan-STARRS) and newly acquired data from the Mag-
ellan telescope to find new clusters that harbor extreme
central galaxies. Our findings are summarized below:"
"• By looking at the photometric redshifts of galax-
ies around X-ray, radio and mid-IR-bright point
sources, we have identified 11 cluster candidates.
Of these, we rediscovered 6 well-known galaxy clus-
ters with both starburst-hosting and QSO-hosting
central galaxies. Two of these candidates were false
associations of foreground and background clusters,
while the remaining three are previously unknown."
"• With additional follow-up data from the Chandra
X-ray telescope for the three new candidates, we
confirmed two newly discovered galaxy clusters.
We do not detect extended X-ray emission around
the other cluster candidate, finding an upper limit
on the total mass of ∼1014 M�. Details for the first
one, CHIPS1356-3421, or the cluster surrounding
PKS1353-341, is already published in our pilot pa-
per (Somboonpanyakul et al. 2018)."
"• We estimate the total mass and the total lumi-
nosity of the other new cluster, CHIPS1911+4455."
"The total mass (M500), using the Yx −M500 rela-
tion, is 6.0 ± 1.0 × 1014 M�. Whereas, the X-ray
luminosity (0.1–2.4 keV) for this cluster is 1.9 ×
1045 erg s−1. This implies that CHIPS1911+4455
is massive enough to be found by previous X-ray
clusters surveys, such as the REFLEX and MACS
surveys."
"• We find a massive blue central galaxy in
CHIPS1911+4455, pointing to an extreme central
galaxy similar to the Phoenix cluster. With the
Chandra data, we find the core entropy at ∼10 kpc
to be as low as in Phoenix, but has a morphol-
ogy unlike Phoenix and any known strong cool-core
cluster. More details about CHIPS1911+4455 will
be published in a companion paper."
"• With the CHiPS survey, we find the occurrence
rate of clusters that appear as X-ray point sources
with bright mid-IR and radio flux to be 2±1%, and
the occurrence rate of clusters with rapidly cooling
cores similar to the Phoenix cluster to be less than
1%. Such rarity is consistent with the flicker-noise
statistics expected during the CCA cycles and with
its driven average gentle self-regulation."
"• One of the primary goals of this survey was to de-
termine if the Phoenix cluster is unique. It looks
like it is: there is no clusters at z < 0.7 that have a
more massive central starburst within factor of ∼3
in magnitude. If there was, we would have found
it in this survey."
"In general, the discovery of these CHiPS clusters em-
phasize a need for X-ray point source/cluster finding al-
gorithms to allow the possibility of finding both point-
like and extended objects at the same time. By limiting
the algorithm to only pick out X-ray bright point source,
many cluster hosting extreme objects (starbursts/AGNs)
were missed in the past. These type of objects are critical
in our quest to understand the relation between cooling-
flow and feedback from the central BCGs. Lastly, by
only finding one new galaxy cluster with a massive star-
burst galaxy in the center (CHIPS1911+4455), we con-
clude that the Phoenix cluster is in fact a rare occurrence
(less than one percent of all the cluster population). This
finding will be important in helping us understand the
mechanism of forming a Phoenix-like cluster in the fu-
ture."
