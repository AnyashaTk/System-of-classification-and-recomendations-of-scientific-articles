"Abstract. Launching a starshade to rendezvous with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope would provide the first
opportunity to directly image the habitable zones of nearby sunlike stars in the coming decade. A report on the science
and feasibility of such a mission was recently submitted to NASA as a probe study concept.1 The driving objective of
the concept is to determine whether Earth-like exoplanets exist in the habitable zones of the nearest sunlike stars and
have biosignature gases in their atmospheres. With the sensitivity provided by this telescope, it is possible to measure
the brightness of zodiacal dust disks around the nearest sunlike stars and establish how their population compares to
our own. In addition, known gas-giant exoplanets can be targeted to measure their atmospheric metallicity and thereby
determine if the correlation with planet mass follows the trend observed in the Solar System and hinted at by exoplanet
transit spectroscopy data. In this paper we provide the details of the calculations used to estimate the sensitivity of
Roman with a starshade and describe the publicly available Python-based source code used to make these calculations.
Given the fixed capability of Roman and the constrained observing windows inherent for the starshade, we calculate
the sensitivity of the combined observatory to detect these three types of targets and we present an overall observing
strategy that enables us to achieve these objectives."

1 Introduction
"Space-based direct imaging is the next frontier of discovery for exoplanet science, moving beyond
detection of Earth-like planets toward full characterization of their atmospheres, potentially iden-
tifying signs of life. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (hereafter referred to as Roman) is
scheduled to launch in late 2025. While its Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) will reach planet-star
flux ratios only achievable in space, with the capability to directly image gas giant planets around
nearby stars, it does not have the sensitivity to detect Earth-like planets. With the launch of a com-
panion starshade – a free-flying 26-m external occulter – such a goal can be reached within the
next decade."
"The Starshade Rendevous Probe (SRP) mission concept was presented in a recent report1 as-
sessing the possibility to fly an external starshade. Using the CGI, the starshade significantly
enhances the exoplanet observing capabilities of Roman by providing 1) improved contrast and a
reduced inner working angle (IWA), enabling sensitivity to Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable
zone, 2) an unlimited outer working angle, enabling a wider view of the planetary system around
each target, and 3) higher throughput (the coronagraph masks are not needed with a starshade),
enabling the sensitivity needed to spectrally characterize an Earth-like exoplanet."
"In this paper we provide the technical basis for the SRP study report1 along with the simulations
used to estimate sensitivity of the observatory. While many such assessments have been done in
the past,2–5 this study started by defining the science objectives of the mission with detailed knowl-
edge of Roman constraints, CGI expected performance, and the significant advances of NASA’s
S5 Starshade technology development program.a While detailed simulations of Starshade missions
exist,5–7 we found that the SRP has a relatively small number of targets, which imposes different
demands. The need to understand how to balance the different objectives of the mission, within
significant mission constraints, and how to prioritize targets led us to produce a simulations pack-
age focused on the SRP. This software is publicly available for reproduction of the results below
and for comparison with similar simulations.b"
"The paper is structured as follows. We briefly review the science objectives presented in the
SRP report (§2) followed by and outline of the top-level mission constraints, based on its partnering
with the Roman (§3). We then describe the model used to quantify the starshade performance
– both the observatory characteristics and the expected astrophysical scene §4. Based on this
observing plan, we next calculate the expected integration times required to achieve a given signal-
to-noise, given Roman’s nominal optical design (§5). We use the observing model to calculate the
sensitivity of the observatory toward individual targets (§5) and then provide an overall observing
strategy, including choices on the number of stars, the number of visits per star, and when to
switch from imaging to spectroscopy (§6). Last, in §7, we calculate the expected performance of
the mission, with a specific list of target stars, summarizing in §8."
2 Science Objectives
"The Starshade Rendezvous Probe Mission Study Report1 developed both the scientific motiva-
tion and technical feasibility for such a mission. Further detail on the science case can be found"

"
there; here we focus not on motivating the science goals, but rather on whether these goals can be
achieved."
"In summary, the science objectives of the mission are three-fold:"
"• Objective 1: Habitability and Biosignature Gases & The Nearest Solar System Analogs.
a) Determine whether Earth-like exoplanets exist in the habitable zones around the nearest
sunlike stars and whether have they have signatures of oxygen and water vapor in their
atmospheres. b) Detect and characterize planets orbiting the nearest sunlike stars."
"• Objective 2: Brightness of Zodiacal Dust Disks. Establish if the zodiacal cloud of our
inner Solar System is representative of the population of our nearest neighbor stars."
"• Objective 3: Gas-Giant Atmospheric Metallicity. Determine the atmospheric metallicity
of known cool giant planets to examine trends with planetary mass and orbital semi-major
axis, and to determine if these trends are consistent with our Solar System."
"The first objective – finding Earth-like planets – is paramount. As such, maintaining the sensitivity
to discover and potentially characterize Earth-like exoplanet candidates around these stars drives
the observatory requirements. Meeting these challenging requirements means the observatory will
also be capable of discovering and characterizing a wide range of planet types, from those like the
giant planets in our Solar System, to the sub-Neptune planets commonly discovered by Kepler,8"
"and down to Earth-mass planets.
The difficulty of imaging Earth-like planets necessitates a “deep dive” approach; that is, a de-"
"tailed investigation of a relatively small sample of our nearest-neighbor sunlike stars – only the
closest sunlike stars where starshade observations have both high imaging sensitivity for exoplanet
discovery and high spectral sensitivity to characterize their atmospheric composition, while also
allowing multiple visits to constrain the orbits of any habitable zone planets found (see1 for a more
detailed discussion). Planetary systems almost certainly exist around several of these stars.9 If an
Earth-like planet candidate is discovered around at least one of these stars, it will be spectroscop-
ically observed to hunt for water vapor and oxygen. Three steps are needed to accomplish this
goal: 1) initial detection via direct imaging, 2) habitable zone determination, by multi-epoch orbit
tracing, and 3) atmosphere characterization, with spectroscopy of the most compelling candidate
planets – particularly those in the habitable zone. Each of these steps places unique requirements
on the mission parameters, as described in this paper."
"The requirement to detect Earth-like exoplanets also enables the ability to detect exozodiacal
dust disks and spectral features of gas giants. The distribution of exozodiacal dust brightness, at
the level relevant for Earth-like exoplanet detection, is largely unconstrained. Recent bounds on
the warm dust disk brightness of many sunlike stars of interest to the SRP are provided by LBTI,10"
"but the sensitivity is still more than an order of magnitude in excess of what is needed. Objective
2 will provide the key information necessary to assess the sensitivity to directly image habitable
zone exoplanets."
"Objective 3 will test whether the correlation between atmospheric gas metallicity and planet
mass (as well as semi-major axis) observed in our Solar System, and hinted at in a few transit
spectroscopy measurements of exoplanets,11 is a universal trend. Identifying this correlation with
the SRP would provide evidence of common processes of planetary system formation."

3 Mission Constraints
"The Starshade Rendezvous Probe is an enhancement of the Roman mission. As such, many of the
starshade mission’s parameters are fixed by Roman’s established telescope, instruments, and oper-
ational timeline. The key constraints imposed on a starshade mission are summarized in Table 1. c"
"In particular, Roman’s Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) will be used for imaging and spectroscopy.
The bandpass and spectral resolution for this instrument are designed for a similar science case
(exoplanet imaging/spectroscopy) and, as such, are a good match to our science goals."
"The field of regard is limited by both the telescope and the starshade. Roman cannot point
within 54◦ of the Sun or light will scatter into the telescope assembly. Solar angles greater than
83◦ are excluded by the starshade; beyond this limit the starshade can no longer be viewed close
to face on without being illuminated by sunlight. Although this last point is not technically an
imposed constraint, it is an important one imposed by the Starshade architecture and limits the
target observing windows."
"The imaging end-to-end efficiency, discussed in more detail in §5, is the result of losses from
the telescope aperture, optical path, with coronagraph masks excluded, and all the way down to the
quantum efficiency of the detector. The Starshade observations depend on the CGI camera with
little modifications, so we take this as an imposed constraint. The field of view of the CGI detector
is limited to 4.5′′ (radial). This parameter is important for detecting any planets orbiting outside
the habitable zone of the target of interest."
"Lastly, note that while Roman’s lifetime requirement is 5 years, we assume the starshade launch
will occur 3 years into the mission, giving an overlap of 2 years. Extending beyond that duration
is ultimately limited by the lifetime of the CGI camera and the overall Roman system."
"cNote that all of the parameters in Table 1 are up-to-date at the time of this study. A full list of current Roman
coronagraph characteristics can be found at:

observed with the SRP system. Red boxes are parameters entirely determined by nature, green
boxes are parameters controlled by observatory design, and black boxes are a combination of both.

and end-to-end efficiency."
4 Observing Model
"This section covers the observing model used to calculate the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of an ex-
oplanet directly imaged with a telescope-starshade system. The overall observing model is shown
as a flowchart in Figure 1. This model consists of both astrophysical inputs, shown in the red
boxes, (§4.1) and instrument parameters, shown in the green boxes, (§4.2), which are combined to
estimate the SNR (§4.3)."
"The exoplanet direct imaging observing geometry of the telescope-starshade system is shown
in Figure 2. The starshade blocks the starlight up to an inner working angle (IWA), above which
exoplanets can be observed. A planet at radius Rpl is observed with illumination phase angle β.
For habitable zone exoplanets, defined by the inner and outer habitable zone (IHZ, OHZ) radii
where water can exist in its liquid phase. The telescope-starshade system has a region of allowed
Sun angles over which it can operate with the lower limit defined by the exclusion angle from the
baffle of the telescope and the outer limit defined by reflection and scattering of sunlight off the
starshade into the telescope baffle."

and the outer radius of the starshade. Observations of planets in this region is excluded. The hab-
itable zone of the star is defined by the inner habitable zone (IHZ) radius and outer habitable zone
(OHZ) radius, defined by the distance to the star where the stellar irradiance allows for water in liq-
uid state. A planet at radius Rpl has illumination phase angle β defined as the star-planet-telescope
angle. The telescope-starshade system has a region of Sun angles at which it can observe. The
lower limit is set by the solar exclusion angle of the telescope baffle while the upper limit is set
by reflection of the Sun off the starshade’s surface on the telescope. These solar exclusion angles
result in important observational constraints."
4.1 Astrophysical Model
"The signal is produced by the star’s flux density being reflected off the surface of the planet. The
astrophysical sources of background light are the exozodiacal dust disk as well as our own Solar
system’s zodiacal dust. For this subsection, we focus solely on the astrophysical model with the
parameters provided in §5.1.1."
4.1.1 Star Flux Density
"We use a simple black body model for the star. The model inputs are the bolometric luminosity
L?, blackbody temperature T?, stellar mass M?, and distance from Earth d?. The star’s spectral
radiance is given by Planck’s law"
"B?(λ, T?) =
2hc2"
"exp(hc/λkT?)− 1
. (1)"

"F? =
L?"
σSBT 4?
"∫ λmax
λmin"
"dλ B(λ, T?) (2)"
"where σSB is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The first fractional term in the equation is the to-
tal wavelength-integrated flux. The second fractional term is the normalization by the Stefan-
Boltzmann law, which is the integral of Equation 1 over all wavelengths."
"The input data for the stars used in this study was obtained from ExoCat-v1d, which is a com-
pilation of stars within 30 pc. The target selection is discussed in §5."
4.1.2 Planet Flux Density
"For bodies that are not self-luminous, the flux density depends entirely on the light reflected from
its surface by the host star with flux density F?. The fraction of light reflected depends on the
ratio of the projected disc area of the planet with radius rpl and square distance from the star Rpl.
The dependence of the reflected light on the phase angle β (i.e. the planet-star-observer angle) is
assumed to be Lambertian"
"ΦL(β) =
sin β + (π − β) cos β"
"π
. (3)"
"This assumption of isotropic scattering is approximately correct for cloudy gas giants,12, 13 but
not for rocky planets that have enhanced forward scattering. Our assumed geometric albedo for
Earth-like planets (0.2) only matches the Earth’s reflectivity for scattering angles β <∼ 90◦; for
more grazing angles, it is an underestimate.14, 15 The function ΦL(β) is normalized to unity at
maximum illumination (β = 0), takes the value of 1/π at maximum elongation (β = π/2), and
vanishes smoothly as the planet eclipses the star (β → π). The normalization of the reflected
light at maximum illumination, taking into account the (rpl/Rpl)2 dependence and ΦL(β), is the
geometric albedo AG.16 Altogether, the flux of a planet is given by"

"The model above applies to the entire range of planet types considered in this study (Earth,
Super-Earths, Subneptunes, Neptunes, and Jovian planets) with different parameters. The param-
eters used for this study are provided in Section 5."
4.1.3 Dust
"The main sources of natural backgrounds are the sunlight scattered by zodiacal dust within our
own Solar System and the starlight scattered by exozodiacal dust surrounding the exoplanet. Our
model for the Solar System’s (SS) zodiacal dust is from,17 which considers variations with both
wavelength and direction; the ecliptic latitude and longitude of each target star is taken into ac-
count. The exozodiacal dust brightness for a 1-zodi disk is set to 22 mag/arcsec2.18 This is some-
what higher than the nominal brightness of the SS zodiacal dust itself (23 mag/arcsec2) because
the exozodiacal dust is twice as thick (we only look through half of the SS zodiacal dust’s thick-
ness) and because we view it at more forward-scattering angles.4 While some of our target stars do
have measured levels of exozodiacal dust, most are non-detections. Analysis of these upper limits
suggests a median dust thickness a factor of 4.5 higher than the Solar System.10 We adopt this
enhanced level as our fiducial amount of exozodiacal dust. The exozodi model is scaled based on
the ratio of stellar flux to solar flux and corrected for orbital location relative to Earth-equivalent
insolation distance (EEID) given by 1 AU×(L?/L�)1/2."
"The flux density of SS zodiacal and exozodiacal dust backgrounds are proportional to the solid
angle subtended by the point spread function (PSF) core (∆ΩPSF ), which is inversely proportional"

by"
")
∆ΩPSF . (5)"
4.2 Observatory Model
"The observatory is a combination of the Roman telescope, including the CGI instrument, and
starshade occulter."
4.2.1 Telescope
"The sensitivity of the telescope can be summarized in a single value Fsens, which is the flux that
would produce a single photon count on average for a given integration time Tint. This is given by"
Fsens =
"[
A�∆λTint"
"]−1
, (6)"
"where A is the geometric aperture of the telescope, based solely on its diameter, and � is the end-
to-end efficiency, which fully accounts for the fraction of photons entering the geometric aperture
that produce photon counts in the detector. The product �A is the effective area of the telescope.
The bandwidth is given by ∆λ and λc is central wavelength, h is Planck’s constant h, and c is the
speed of light. The detector noise produces a photon-equivalent background count rate given by
Ndet. The model described in the rest of this section relies heavily on the models used for CGI.19, 20"
"Roman is a 2.4-m diameter optical telescope, corresponding to a collecting area ofA = 4.5 m2.
The diameter spatial full-width at half maximum (FWHM) resolution is θPSF = 0.065′′ at 750
nm. The pixel scale for the CGI instrument is 0.0218′′. The solid angle subtended by the PSF is
approximated as ∆ΩPSF ' πθ2PSF, which gives ∆ΩPSF ' 3.1× 10"
"−13 sr at 750 nm.
The Starshade imaging bandpass filter (615-800 nm) is tuned to be sensitive to water vapor"
"and oxygen absorption lines at 720 nm and 760 nm, respectively. The imaging field of view of
4.5′′ (imaging) enables observations well beyond the habitable zones of the nearest sunlike stars,
providing the potential for discovery of giant outer planets."
"The focal plane detector is an electron-multiplying CCD (EMCCD). The detector noise is ∼10
counts/hour, including noise equivalent dark current (dominant term), clock induced charge, and
read noise (negligible contribution). While the EMCCD detector has the advantage of no read
noise, it is significantly degraded by cosmic ray hits; 5 years of degradation is included, reducing
the detector quantum efficiency (QE) to 28.5% c."
"The end-to-end efficiency (�), which includes the optical throughput of the telescope and the
detector quantum efficiency (dQE), is 3.5% for imaging and 3.4% for spectroscopy. A complete
budget for the factors going into these throughput calculations is provided in Table 2. The Roman
pupil has a central obscuration that results in a reduction of the raw collecting area by 18%. The
light collected at the aperture goes through multiple reflections in various elements of the telescope
optics to deliver it to the CGI with a further reduction of 19%. Prior to reaching the CGI, a dichroic
beam splitter divides the signal into the CGI and a guidance camera with 90% efficiency. Within
the CGI, there are multiple optical elements prior to delivering the light to the detector with an
efficiency of 60%. The detector effective quantum efficiency (QE) is a combination of effects
including QE, cosmic rays, and other detector effects, of 28.5%. We use the end-of-life value since"

"the starshade would operate in the last couple of years of the Roman telescope. The PSF has 34%
of its total light in the core due to the diffraction from the struts and central obscuration region of
the Roman aperture. The top-level instrument characteristics are summarized in Table 1."
"While the model in the previous subsection provides an adequate description for the wide-
band imaging mode, the spectrograph requires some additional details. The currently planned
implementation is a slit-prism spectrograph, which blocks all but a narrow region with a slit of
width D and disperses the light orthogonal to the slit’s long axis. The key parameter for the design
is the slit width D which must be wide enough to accommodate for telescope jitter and motion
of the planet during a long period of observation while not being so wide that it allows for a
significant amount of zodiacal and exozodiacal dust brightness background photons to disperse
into the pixels of interest for the exoplanet. The prism-detector configuration is described by the
spectral resolution parameter R = λ/∆λ, which can, in general, be wavelength dependent. Note
that the spectrograph slit limits observations to one planet at a time, but still allows for simultaneous
measurement of the background along the slit."
4.2.2 Starshade
"The starshade performance can be summarized by three key parameters – the inner working angle
(IWA), the instrument contrast (CSS), and the solar exclusion angles (see Table 3)."
"The starshade IWA is the angle subtended by the telescope boresight and the outer radius of
the starshade. The starshade design considered here has ∼100% optical throughput at the IWA.21
Although it is, in principle, possible to observe targets at angles below the IWA, the throughput is
reduced and the PSF is distorted. For practical purposes, we assume exoplanets are only observable
at angles above the IWA. The size of the starshade and the distance between the starshade and
telescope are determined primarily by the desired inner working angle, the longest wavelength in
the observing band, the diameter of the shadow at the telescope, and the required suppression level.
The optical bandwidth, constraints on feature sizes, and factors such as the ratio of the petal length
to the overall diameter, and the number of petals, are examples of other factors that also impact"
Table 3. Assumed Mission Parameters
Parameter Assumed Performance
"Time allocation1 136 days
Inner working angle (IWA) 100 mas
Instrument contrast 4× 10−11
Delta-V for retargeting 1,100 m/s"
"the size and separation of the starshade, see 22–25). The IWA is chosen to observe the habitable
zones of nearby sunlike stars. An IWA of 100 mas corresponds to a separation of 1 AU at 10 pc,
enabling observations of Earth-like planets for solar-type stars within ∼10 pc."
"The starshade instrument contrast (CSS) is defined as the fraction of starlight leaked per res-
olution element at the IWA. The resulting background flux is FSS = CSSF?. This results in a
background contribution in the habitable zone with CSS specified so as to keep it below the ex-
pected zodi and exozodi backgrounds, enabling the sensitivity to detect Earth-like exoplanets. The
current best estimate for the contrast is CSS = 4× 10−11 (see 1 for details)."
"In addition to scattered starlight, solar glint and diffracted speckle patterns from the target result
in an additional localized, predictable backgrounds that can be calibrated. While solar glint can be
a limiting factor, recent progress in petal edge design indicates that it can be suppressed outside
the IWA to negligible levels. We therefore do not include a treatment of solar glint in this study;
for a more detailed treatment see 26. The starshade speckle pattern and its ability to remove it
during analysis are not included in this study. It is expected that they become an important source
of backgrounds These effects will be accounted for in more detail with more recent tools such as
the SISTER simulations package and upcoming Starshade data challenges."
"The starshade can accommodate a relatively wide bandpass (26%), compatible with the band-
pass of the CGI (Table 1). The relation between starshade design and bandpass is discussed in 23."
"One important observing constraint is that, with a starshade, the telescope pointing is limited
to at most 83◦ from the Sun. Beyond this solar exclusion angle, the starshade reflects a significant
amount of sunlight into the telescope."
4.3 Signal-to-Noise Ratio Model
"The signal to noise ratio SNR is approximated as a function of the number of photon counts
from the planet of interest npl and the sum total contribution of background photon counts nbkg
according to"
"SNR =
npl√"
"npl + nbkg
(7)"
"The conversion of the planet flux Fpl to photon counts npl is given by the observatory’s single
photon flux sensitivity Fsens (Equation 6) according to npl = Fpl/Fsens."
"The background photon counts, nbkg, have two main contributions, the external background
fluxes (leaked starlight, zodiacal and exozodiacal light) and the detector noise counts Ndet. The"
"external background fluxes are converted to background photon counts via the relation to the ob-
servatory’s single photon flux sensitivity to give"
"nbkg =
Fez + Fz + FSS"
"Fsens
+Ndet (8)"
"The modifications to the SNR estimate for spectroscopy are listed as follows. The bandwidth
now corresponds to each sub-band of the spectrometer, which is given by ∆λ = λ/R. With a
characteristic value of R ∼ 50, the bandwidth is at the central wavelength of 750 nm is 15 nm
instead of 185 nm. This reduces the single photon flux sensitivity Fsens by roughly an order of
magnitude compared to imaging mode."
"The leaked starlight as well as the zodiacal and exozodiacal emission can be dispersed into the
planet spectrum. If θslit is the angular width of the slit, the effective increase in the background
photon counts nbkg is a factor of θslit/θPSF"
"nbkg =
θslit
θPSF"
"Fez + Fz + FSS
Fsens"
+Ndet (9)
"under the assumption that θslit ≥ θPSF . A slit width of 120 mas is assumed for the Starshade slit
prism spectrometer. The reason the slit has to be wider than the PSF core of 65 mas is to accom-
modate the a priori unknown motion of an Earth-like exoplanet over the data lag of several days
nominal spectral integration time period of 25 days. We are assuming that during a spectroscopic
observation the slit position can be adjusted over a period of several days given data telemetry,
analysis, and commanding latencies."
"The estimates made here assume that the leaking starlight, stray light from the starshade, and
exozodi light have been approximated using smooth distributions. The treatment of deviations
from these assumptions requires more sophisticated imaging simulation tools (such as SISTER)
and exploring a wider range of second order corrections to be considered. These will be treated in
future mission concept studies."
5 Target Sensitivity
"The analysis presented in this section estimates the performance of the observatory on a per-target
basis and has not assumed any constraints on retargeting time or total mission duration, which are
covered in the next section. This serves as an initial bound on how many targets the observatory is
sensitive to and sets a clear goal for the more complicated problem of visit strategy and retargeting
maneuvers. We divide the discussion between three types of targets, corresponding to the three
objectives described in §2: 1) potential Earth-like planets orbiting bright nearby stars (§5.1), 2)
known exoplanets from radial velocity measurements at wide angular separation from their host
star (§5.2), and 3) dust disks that may surround any of the target stars (§5.3)."
5.1 Sensitivity to Earth-like Planets
5.1.1 Parameters
The parameters that define the Star’s flux density (Equation 2) and mass are taken from ExoCat.27

"along with the Lambertian (isotropic) scattering phase function in Equation 3. The range of planet
radii considered is bounded above at rpl ≤ 1.4 r⊕, based on evidence that suggests that planets
with radius below are predominantly rocky.28 The lower bound on terrestrial planet radii depends
on the planet’s ability to retain an appreciable atmosphere, which, in turn depends on their stellar
illumination. This results in a dependence on the planet’s semi-major axis Rpl, modified by the
stellar luminosity to give rpl/r⊕ ≥ 0.8(Rpl/AU)1/2(L?/L�)−1/4.29 These maximum and minimum
radii serve as the defining limits for Earth-like planets in the simulation results presented here. The
adopted ranges of planetary parameters for habitable zone planets (defined here) and gas giant
planets (§5.3 below) are summarized in Table 4."
"The orbital location of Earth-like planets is defined as the habitable zone (HZ) – the region
around a star where a rocky planet with a thin atmosphere may have liquid water on its surface.
The location of the habitable zone depends both on the stellar luminosity and on assumptions for
the planet’s cloud properties. We adopt a conservative estimate for the habitable zone orbital radii
Rpl from 0.95 to 1.67 AU for a Solar-luminosity star.29, 30 These orbital radii scale by the square
root of the stellar luminosity, to keep the same insolation range as the Solar System."
"Planet sizes and semi-major axes are drawn randomly from these defined ranges for Earth-like
planets, based on the distribution defined by SAG-1332 and modified by HabEx to include the
dependence of the orbital semi-major axis on the lower limit of planet radii. This is determined by
drawing from the distribution defined by"

"where the orbital period P defines the orbital radius Rpl by way of the stellar mass M? using
Kepler’s third law. For Earth-like exoplanets, the orbits are assumed to be circular, consistent with
most previous studies, e.g. 5. The estimates made on target sensitivity take into account target
availability windows (§5) determined by solar exclusions angles along with the Keplerian motion
of the planet and the associated changes in planet brightness."
"For the exozodiacal dust environment, we assume a constant fiducial value of 4.5 zodi based
on median dust thickness a factor derived from LBTI limits and measurements.10 Two targets
of interest, epsilon Eridani and Vega, have measurements of warm dust disk brightness of 300
zodi and 33 zodi, respectively. These values are well in excess of 10 zodi, which significantly
increases the integration time for detection of Earth-like planets and the risk of contamination
from planet-induced disk structure.33, 34 As such, these targets have been removed from the list that
was presented in the Starshade Rendezvous Probe study report.1"
5.1.2 Treatment of Binaries
"Nearby optical companions to potential target stars can create light leakage comparable to the
starshade instrument contrast depending on their relative brightness and separation. Diffracted
flux at an angle Θ away from a companion star can be approximated as F/F0 ' 4/(πx3), where
x ≡ πΘ/λD. (This formula is just the large-angle approximation for an Airy diffraction pattern;
the error in this approximation is <1% beyond the third Airy ring.) Figure 3 shows the angular
separation and difference in magnitude for nearby binary stars (those with V < 5 mag and distance
< 8.5 pc). Diffraction from the secondary star creates additional background flux near the primary
(shown for 10−11, 10−10, and 10−9 contrast levels). Stars with excessive levels of background
(relative to the starshade contrast floor of 4× 10−11) are dropped from the target list (open circles
in Figure 3). We note that mu Hercules was in the target list used for the Starshade Rendezvous
Probe study report1 but is removed from this updated list due to contamination from its nearby
optical companion. Some wide binaries still remain as viable targets (e.g. Procyon, with a 10-
magnitude-fainter white dwarf companion at 4.3′′ separation), shown as filled circles. While these
companions are typically at 100’s of AU separation, Procyon B orbits at only 15 AU (with periapse
of 9 AU); this relatively close orbit could impact the formation and evolution of habitable zone
planets."
"Note that the background contamination considered here is idealized as solely due to diffrac-
tion. Optical aberrations will contribute additional scattering. For the Roman telescope, 35 esti-
mate that these aberrations could increase the effective contrast limit by∼1–2 orders of magnitude,
such that borderline systems (Procyon and Sirius) would have their imaging performance signif-
icantly degraded. Very wide/faint binaries (Fomalhaut, eps Ind, bet CVn) still have insignificant
contribution, even with the telescope aberrations included."
5.1.3 Background Contributions
"Each target has several sources of background noise that limits the sensitivity to Earth-like exo-
planets. It is illustrative to show the relative contributions from each source as this determines
which targets are viable for habitable exoplanet observations. In Figure 4 we show the contribu-
tions of photon counts, assuming 1 day of integration time in imaging mode under the following
assumptions. We assume an Earth-like exoplanet at EEID in quadrature phase. The exozodiacal
dust disk brightness has a fiducial value of 4.5 zodi. The leaked starlight assumes an instrument"

comparable to our instrumental performance) along the dashed line. Binaries with high levels of
binary contamination (i.e. those to the left of the line) are shown as open circles, while those that
are still viable targets are filled circles."
"contrast CSS = 4 × 10−11 everywhere, which is conservative since the leaked starlight generally
decreases away from the IWA. The Solar System zodi background is shown as bars indicating the
range of values it can take depending on when the observation is made. Finally, the detector noise
contribution is shown as a dashed line. The targets are ordered by the brightness of the Earth-
like exoplanet. For most targets, the exozodiacal dust disk brightness dominates the background
followed by the Solar System’s zodiacal dust disk brightness. The leaked starlight at the inner
working angle can be stronger in cases where the star is very bright. Note, however, that for these
stars the habitable zone will be pushed out to radii typically much higher than the IWA, where
the leaked starlight drops. The detector noise counts lie below the contribution of Solar System’s
zodiacal dust."
"The target selection is based on search completeness, discussed in more detail the next subsec-
tion, which depends on the target availability windows, the field of view available around the star,
and the range of parameters sampled for terrestrial exoplanets. While the photon counts estimated
in Figure 4 do not capture all these details, they do provide a sense of which targets will provide
the highest sensitivity to Earth-like exoplanets."

flux densities can vary widely depending on radius, distance to the star, and illumination phase
angle, we provide estimates for a planet with Earth parameters at EEID in quadrature phase. In
most cases, the exozodiacal dust disk brightness, with a fiducial brightness of 4.5 zodi, dominates
the background photon contribution. The leaked starlight flux, assuming an instrument contrast
CSS = 4 × 10−11 is, in most cases, comparable to the Solar System zodiacal (SS Zodi) dust
brightness. The vertical bars of SS Zodi represent the variation depending on the time of year the
target is observed. The detector noise is not a major contributor to the error budget."
5.2 Observing Windows
"The target availability windows with the Starshade/Roman system is an important constraint on the
observatory’s ability to spectrally characterize and determine the orbits of Earth-like exoplanets.
The Starshade/Roman system can only observe stars between 54◦ and 83◦ from the Sun. For a
star in the ecliptic plane, this limited visibility results in two observing windows per year, each
∼30 days long. With increasing ecliptic latitudes the windows become significantly longer, until
they merge at 54◦ to produce a single yearly window lasting several months long, then decreasing
until it vanishes above 83◦. Stars very close to an ecliptic pole (e.g. chi Dra at 83.6◦ ecliptic
latitude) are never observable. The sky position and observing windows for all of our habitability
and biosignature targets are summarized in Figure 5, divided into the nearby-star planet search
(upper panel) and the known-exoplanet sample treated in §5.2 (lower panel). The sky position
and observing windows for all of our gas-giant atmospheric metallicity targets (treated in §5.3) are
shown in Figure 5."
"The limited observing windows for each target provide a primary constraint on our observing
strategy. During the 2-year lifetime of the mission, there will generally be 4 opportunities to ob-
serve each target. While spectral characterization can be performed with only a single visit with
favorable illumination phase, multiple epochs are needed to constrain the planet’s orbit, in par-
ticular its semi-major axis. The semi-major axis indicates the average amount of stellar radiation
received from the parent star and thereby determines whether the planet is in the habitable zone."
"Determining the semi-major axis with sufficient accuracy requires at least three astrometric
measurements of the planet’s position spread out over two years. An example of an orbit recon-
struction simulation is shown in Figure 7. Earth-like exoplanets in the HZ are generated with
randomly sampled Keplerian orbital parameters with the planet’s phase-varying brightness and as-
sociated astrometric precision, defined as the telescope resolution divided by imaging SNR. The
simulated observations are then reconstructed with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that
forward models the simulated data. An ensemble of these simulations for each of our target stars
demonstrates that Earth-like planets can typically be constrained to the habitable zone with >80%
confidence.36"
5.2.1 Search Completeness and Target Selection
"Our primary metric for evaluating the observatory performance for each star is target completeness
– the fraction of habitable zone planets that can be completely characterized. In order to determine
whether a planet is habitable, we need to be able to detect it, constrain its orbit to know that it
is indeed in the habitable zone, and take a spectral measurement to determine whether it has an
atmosphere with biosignature gases. We therefore estimate the following completeness values:"
"• 1) single-visit completeness, the fraction of habitable zone planets that can be effectively
imaged at any one time (defined as SNR>7 within a 1-day integration)e,"
"• 2) orbit determination completeness, the fraction of observed planets whose orbits are in the
habitable zone (assuming 4 observing epochs),"
"eNote that the SNR threshold was changed from 5 in the Probe Study Report1 to 7 in this study to reduce the
probability of false positives. This values is consistent with the detection threshold used in the HabEx study report."
"Fig 5 Top: Sky positions of the Habitability and Biosignature Gases targets in ecliptic coordinates.
An instantaneous observing region due to solar exclusion angles (54◦ and 83◦, respectively) is
shown as a light red shaded region centered on 0◦ ecliptic longitude. Bottom: Target star observing
windows as constrained by telescope and starshade solar exclusion angles. These windows result
from the instantaneous observing region in the panel above shifting in ecliptic longitude with a
yearly period. Each star typically has two∼30-day-long observing windows per year, while higher-
latitude stars have a single observing window per year that is longer in duration. For the sample of
nearby stars to be searched for Earth-like planets (upper panel), the black dots correspond to the
desired observation start times, to allow for sufficient time for a spectral characterization."
"• 3) spectral characterization completeness, fraction of imaged planets whose spectra can iden-
tify key atmospheric constituent (SNR>20 within a 25-day integration), and"
"• 4) target completeness, the fraction of observed planets that meet conditions 2 and 3 above."
"The single visit completeness serves as a first cut to identify targets where Earth-like exoplanets
have a high probability of being detected.37 It is important to note that if a planet is not detected in
a single visit, it does not mean it is absent since single visit completeness with a Starshade and CGI
is . 0.70 (Table 5). It is equally important to note that a single detection of a planet in a region
consistent with the habitable is not enough to conclude that it is indeed a habitable zone exoplanet.
Follow-up observations that constrain the planet’s orbits are necessary to determine that."
"Fig 6 Top: sky position of known exoplanets for the gas-giant atmospheric metallicity investi-
gation in ecliptic coordinates (§5.3). An instantaneous observing window due to solar exclusion
angles (54◦ and 83◦, respectively) is shown as a light blue shaded region centered on 0◦ ecliptic
longitude. Bottom: Target star observability windows as constrained by telescope and starshade
solar exclusion angles."
"The orbit determination completeness is the probability that the planet’s orbit can be con-
strained to be in the habitable zone. In a separate study,36 it was determined that 3 detections in 4
visits to the target was sufficient to constrain the orbit of a habitable zone exoplanet with >80%
confidence, depending on the orbital inclination and the phase of observation. The orbit determi-
nation completeness, in this study, is the probability that at least 3 detections occur with 4 visits.
The simulations in that study sample the orbit periods and observation windows assumed here and
performs a Markov Chain Monte Carlo fit of the observations to estimate the posterior distribution
of the planet’s semi-major axis. The number of visits is limited by the lengths and periodicity of
the target availability windows for most stars of interest (see Figure 5)."
"The spectral characterization completeness is the probability that a spectroscopic observation
of a target is successful in any one of 4 visits. The criteria of success (SNR>20) is based on a study
by 38, which found that this is was the minimum needed for detection of molecular oxygen and
water vapor lines in the CGI band. The 25-day integration time window is the typical maximum
for most targets, although some are available for significantly longer."
"Fig 7 Four visits of Tau Ceti, as planned with Starshade Rendezvous Probe (Figure 5), with three
detections are sufficient to constrain orbits to the habitable zone (shown in dashed green lines). The
left panel shows a simulation of an Earth-like planet with a circular orbit. True positions marked
in blue circles and astrometric estimates with error bars shown in red. The numbers indicate the
visit number for each observation. The inner working angle (IWA) is shown in gray. On the right,
sample orbits (gray lines) from a MCMC-reconstructed posterior distribution demonstrate that the
fit is well within the HZ, including uncertainties in the orbit eccentricity. The true orbit is shown
in orange."
"The target completeness requires all criteria above are met; it is the probability that the orbit
constraint requirements and a spectral observation is achieved for a nearby star. For each system,
we calculate the completeness with a Monte Carlo sampling of habitable zone orbits. We sample
random semi-major axes (using Equation 10), orbital inclinations (cosine distributed), and true
anomaly (uniformly distributed for a circular orbit). Circular orbits are assumed. Each randomly
selected planet is propagated along its Keplerian orbit, with the time of observation limited to 4
observing windows spaced over 2 years (see Figure 5 in §5.2). A list of 16 stars for finding Earth-
like planets are listed in Table 5 and summarized in Figure 8, which shows simulation results for
single visit, orbit determination, spectral characterization, and the overall target completeness for
each targets."
"Most of the habitable zone is visible for all the targets, with single-visit completeness ranging
from ∼0.5 to ∼0.7 (red bars in Figure 8). Most of the planets that are visible in their habitable
zone can also have their orbits traced over multiple epochs, resulting in orbit determination com-
pletenesses of >∼ 0.5 for most stars (blue in Figure 8). The ability of the observations to constrain
each planet’s orbit will be described in a companion paper.36"
"The predominant limiting factor is the spectral characterization completeness (green in Fig-
ure 8), which varies by orders of magnitude between stars. Only the brightest stars provide enough
photons to produce a high-quality reflected light spectrum within the integration time limits. For
the best targets, spectral characterization completeness can be as high as ∼0.8 but as the expected
planetary reflected light flux density decreases, 25 days is not sufficient to achieve a spectral"

"SNR>20. Although these fainter planets will not meet our primary science objective, the probabil-
ity of detection and orbit constraint is still very high, and lower-SNR spectra will still be sensitive
to some atmosphere types. This will be the subject of a future investigation."
"Of the total of 8 stars that have non-zero target completeness, tau Ceti has the largest (>∼ 0.5).
The remaining targets still have a significant completeness for detection and orbit determination
of Earth-like exoplanets. These stars are of interest for reconnaissance of planets in orbit and for
observing their exozodiacal dust disk brightness in preparation for more sensitive observatories in
the future."
"Note that tau Ceti has two already-discovered super-Earth planets that are widely separated
and bright enough to have their atmospheres characterized.39 Integration times to obtain spectra
are listed in Table 6 as a function of each planet’s illumination phase."
"Other than the observing window limitations on integration time, the analysis presented here
is on a per-target basis and has not assumed any constraints on retargeting time or total mission
duration. Nevertheless, there is a effective upper bound on number targets set by our require-
ments (orbit determination and spectral characterization). While the number of target stars could
be increased with a greater allocation of telescope time, the integration time needed to achieve
a successful spectral measurement is limited by the solar exclusion angles. The Roman Space
Telescope CGI with starshade is therefore more limited by sensitivity than it is by telescope time
allocation."
5.3 Sensitivity to Gas-Giant Planets
"Next we consider known gas-giant planets as targets for atmospheric characterization. The goal
here is to determine whether there is a correlation between atmospheric metallicity and fundamen-
tal planetary properties such as mass and semi-major axis (Figure 9). A strong correlation is found
in Solar System gas giants and there have been indications of such a correlation in exoplanet data,
although the uncertainties in the atmospheric metallicity of exoplanets are still high (Figure 9).
Measurements of the Methane absorption line serve as our primary proxy for the atmospheric
metallicity, allowing for direct comparison with the Solar System’s outer planets.40 Our quantita-
tive objective is to achieve a measurement in the correlation between planet mass and atmospheric
metallicity with at least 3−σ significance."
"To determine if such a correlation is present in a population of gas giant exoplanets orbiting
different stars, we need to establish how many are needed and with what level of uncertainty in
metallicity. There are currently 20 gas giant exoplanets with orbital angular separations accessible
to the Starshade Rendezvous Probe (from 0.′′13 to 3.′′2; Table 7). Since it is unrealistic to expect
all of them will be at an orbital phase favorable for spectral measurements, we looked at randomly
sampled subsets that might be available. We find that if a subset of 10 stars is available with a 30%
metallicity fraction uncertainty, then it is possible to discern a mass-metallicity correlation with
3-σ statistical significance (Figure 10). The 30% metallicity fractional uncertainty can be achieved
with spectral SNR>15 measurements in one or two bands from ∼600 to ∼800 nm.41, 42"
"The mission requirements based on the driving investigation (detecting Earth-like planets) en-
able measurement of known giant-planet metallicities. Integration times depend on the illumina-
tion phase angle during observation; while the orbital phase for radial-velocity-detected planets is
known, the orbital inclination is uncertain. Table 7 shows the integration times required to achieve
spectral SNR>15 for a range of illumination phase angles. A geometric albedo of 0.3 is assumed,"

radius. This albedo is a conservative choice, well below Jupiter’s actual value of 0.5,12, 43 but con-
sistent with models of Jupiter-mass planets located closer to the Sun.12, 41 Note that the expected
integration times have changed somewhat from what was reported in the Probe study report1 due
to changing the geometric albedo from 0.5 to 0.3 and the shift from the integral field spectrometer
to the slit prism spectrometer, which changed the current best estimate of the end-to-end efficiency
from 2.5% to 3.4%."
"Integration times are on the order of several days for the majority of targets at favorable illu-
mination angles. Ten spectra can be obtained with a total of 50 days of integration time allocated
among the most favorable targets. Note that by the time starshade begins operations this target list
is expected to have grown, providing even more flexibility in scheduling. The observing windows
for current targets are plotted in Figure 6 showing whether a target is available for observation at
any given time during operations. Roman-CGI observations, continued Doppler monitoring, and
Gaia astrometry will constrain the brightness and orbital parameters prior to starshade operations,
so these observations can be precisely planned for maximum planet visibility with no need for
revisits."

shows the uncertainty on the Pearson correlation significance corresponding to the single instance
represented by the thick black line."
5.4 Sensitivity to Exozodiacal Dust
"The dust surrounding Earth-like planets is small in mass but large in area, making it generally much
easier to observe that the planet itself. The integrated flux from Solar System’s zodiacal dust, for
example, is orders of magnitude brighter than the Earth. Imaging the dust disk distribution requires
an integration time of 1 day (on average) or up to 4 days (maximum) to obtain a flux sensitivity
of 0.1 zodi, enabling 5−σ detection of disks as faint as 0.5 zodi. While disks this faint have never
been observed (other than the Solar System, with 1 zodi), the median level inferred from a sample
of nearby stars is 4.5 zodis,10 suggesting that most, if not all, of the systems with habitable zone
dust will be detected. With a telescope imaging resolution of 0.′′065, the disks will be mapped at
spatial resolutions of ∼0.2–0.5 AU."
"With this sensitivity it may be possible to detect the influence of planets on the zodiacal dust
disk structure. 33 have shown that planets with &4 Earth masses can introduce significant features
on the dusk disk brightness distribution of moderately bright dusts disks (∼6–10 zodis). The
induced structure would be located in close proximity to the observed planet – with both following
the same orbital trajectory – removing any ambiguity in whether the disk structure is planet related."
6 Observing Strategy
"The science objectives are met with an observing program that balances detection and characteri-
zation of new exoplanets with the characterization of known giant planets. The observing strategy
is guided by the sensitivity toward individual targets (§5) and fundamental limits on the targets’
visibility."
6.1 Earth-Like Planets
"Having already identified the best targets for detection of Earth-like planets for SRP given its
constraints(§5.1), we now describe our strategy on how to schedule observations to optimize the
number of characterized planets. The 8 most promising stars will be given priority for at least one
visit. The revisit strategy for these targets depends on the information gathered during each visit."
"The decision tree used for observations is illustrated in Figure 11 and described in detail here.
The decision tree assumes that the imaging observation is complete with∼1 day of integration and
the data is expected to be available for analysis within a couple of days. In the time between the
observation and data retrieval the Roman telescope will be available for other observations while
the starshade remains in position. The starshade science team will have fast analysis tools in hand
to estimate the brightness of the exozodiacal dust disk and detect Earth-like exoplanet candidates.
Based on the findings, the starshade team can either decide to initiate the cruise into position for
observing the next target in the sequence or to initiate a long integration time observation for
spectral characterization."
"The first visit is a reconnaissance observation. The first check is whether the system has a
exozodiacal dust disk above or below 10 zodi. While some of our target stars have existing upper
limits on their exozodiacal dust disk brightness, based on precision nulling measurements of their
dust’s infrared emission, they are not sufficient to rule out deleterious levels of dust. Note that while
we have used a fiducial value of 4.5 zodi in §5 and §7, for the purposes of estimating background,
in reality the exozodiacal dust brightness will be vary from target to target and we assume it will
be unknown prior to the first observation. Here we are describing the tentative design reference
mission for Starshade Rendezvous Probe mission. If the disk is brighter than 10 zodi, the target is
removed from the habitability and biosignatures target list since it is not expected that an Earth-
like exoplanet could be spectrally characterized against such a bright background as well as an
increased risk of false-positive planet detections from planet-induced dust structures.34 If a target
is removed, the observation plan will be updated with the next best target, which may or may not
be visited at a later period depending on what is discovered for the target ensemble."
"If the analysis finds that the exozodiacal dust disk is≤10 zodi but no planet consistent with HZ
orbit is found, the target is kept on the list for a revisit as a planet could still appear in subsequent
observations. If a planet consistent with a HZ orbit is found, then the imaging data will provide
the brightness of the planet, which determines whether a spectral measurement with SNR > 20 is
achievable in the remainder of the observing time window, typically 25 days. If that is the case, a
spectral observation will be initiated."
"On the second visit to a target, if no planet consistent with an HZ orbit has been detected, then
the target is removed and the observation plan is updated with the next best target in the list. If the
planet is detected either for the first or second time, a decision is made based on the data to take
a spectroscopic measurement as described above. Spectroscopic measurements are only required"
"to be performed once, so if such a measurement was made in the first visit, then it will not be
repeated."
"On the third visit, if the planet consistent with a HZ orbit has only been detected once, no further
visits will be planned since at least 3 observations in 4 planned visits are required. However, there is
some flexibility in this decision since the third visit will be made in the second year of observations
and the science team will have additional information on the exozodiacal dust disk brightness and
population of planet candidates in the ensemble of targets already observed. In the event that there
are a small number of target systems left, then this system could have more visits planned. If there
are a large number of relevant target systems still available, this revisit priority may fall lower than
the priority of these other systems,recognizing revisit priority may evolve as knowledge is gained
about each system.Spectroscopic measurements can be triggered based on the criteria discussed
above."
"In the event that the planet has only been observed twice before and/or no spectroscopic mea-
surement has been made yet, a fourth visit will be needed to determining whether the planet’s orbit
is in the habitable zone. This will occur during the last ∼6 months of the mission so the prioriti-
zation of targets could be significantly affected by how many Earth-like exoplanet candidates have
been found and their potential for a spectral measurements with SNR≥20."
6.2 Known Gas-Giant Planets
"Unlike the habitability and biosignatures targets, it is expected that significantly more information
about the known gas giants will be available. Although we have not assumed prior information
on the targets obtained with the CGI in this study, it is possible that Roman-CGI will have already
observed these systems and directly imaged the planets before Starshade operations begin. This
will determine how bright they are and whether or not spectral measurements with SNR≥15 are
viable. The top-ranked targets with their estimated integration time will be integrated into the
observation plan."
6.3 Exozodiacal Dust
"No additional observations are required to observe the dusty debris that is prevalent in planetary
systems; it will be detected alongside any observed planets."
"For the aim of characterizing the influence of planets in the dust disk distribution, target stars
with bright exozodi (6—10 zodi) that show clumps with ≥10% excess brightness may be revisited
up to three more times. Identifying Earth-like planets takes priority, but in the event that exozodia-
cal dust is too bright in most stars and systems with the characteristics described above exist, these
observations will be executed. These observations will track the motion of dust disk clumps to test
whether their orbits are Keplerian, indicative of an associated planet. Provided a system within
this exozodi range with a ≥ 4M⊕ planet is found, this measurement will provide a means to probe
planetary systems in stars with high levels of exozodiacal dust in their habitable zones.33"
6.4 Scheduling
"The visit strategy needs to be dynamic since it will be modified with each observation of habitabil-
ity targets while at the same time ensuring that a subset of 10 known gas giants can be spectrally
characterized with retargets that optimize the fuel usage. Since there is a significant amount of un-
certainty associated with the distribution of exozodiacal dust disks and the frequency of occurrence"

"Fig 11 The decision tree for discovery of Earth-like planets adapts its observations as new informa-
tion is gathered. Depending on 1) the amount of exozodiacal dust, 2) the number of observations of
a planet candidate, and 3) whether long spectroscopic integration times are executed, a target may
either be revisited or removed from the target list. The 2-year timeline on the bottom of the figure
shows the windows available for observations (shown here with tau Ceti’s observing windows)."
"of Earth-like exoplanets, this requires a fairly sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation that demon-
strates that the decision tree is adaptable to the full range of possibilities. This will be the subject
of a future study."
"In the Starshade Probe Study report, the delta-v allocated to retargeting was 1100 m/s.1 An
additional 300 m/s of delta-v is allocated for stationkeeping. The allocation for large slews was
estimated to be sufficient for 36 retargeting maneuvers using a limiting scenario where 9 targets
were visited 4 times each (Figure 12). For retargeting within other starshade mission concepts see
5, 7. While our objective is to visit 10 habitability and biosignatures targets, some with multiple
revisits, and 10 known gas giants only once, the extreme scenario bounds the fuel usage because it
assumes the need to retarget in situations that are not necessarily the most fuel efficient. The gas
giants, for example, can be visited when they are close to the path needed for other targets resulting
in significantly smaller fuel burns."
"The main driver for delta-v is the need to visit targets 4 times in a period of 2 years. If the
mission duration could be made longer, the retargeting strategy could follow the natural right
ascension progression of observing windows as the Earth rotates around the Sun, which can result
in highly efficient fuel burns. With a two year window, there are cases where fairly aggressive
burns are required to catch targets of interest when their observing windows are available."
7 Expected Performance
"The expected scientific yield depends not only on the assumed mission parameters, but also on
exoplanet demographics. While the frequency of gas-giant planets is relatively well known, the
probability that each of our target stars will have a habitable-zone Earth-size planet (η⊕) is not well
constrained. NASA’s ExoPAG Study Analysis Group (SAG-13) performed a meta-analysis of sev-
eral published fits to Kepler survey results, producing a planet frequency formula as a function of
planet size and location.32 Combining this formula with our adopted habitable zone and Earth-like
planet radius definitions (Table 4), we calculate an Earth-like planet frequency of η⊕ = 0.24"
"+0.3
−0.1."
"Note that this definition of Earth-like planets and corresponding frequency matches for consistency
Ref. 29; for possible alternative calculations of planet occurrence rates, see e.g. Refs. 44, 45."
"The cumulative completeness for habitability and biosignatures targets is shown in Figure 13.
The expected number of Earth-like exoplanets is derived from multiplying the completeness by
the occurrence rate η⊕. For a nominal observing program targeting at least 10 nearby stars the
expected number of detected Earth-like exoplanets is 1.5+1.9−0.6. However, this is only for single
visit detection. The number with orbits constrained to the habitable zone is 1.2+1.5−0.5. Note that
the cumulative completeness for spectral measurements flattens after the 5th target. The expected
number of Earth-like exoplanets with spectral characterization is 0.65+0.82−0.27. The expected number
with both orbits constrained and a successful spectral measurement is 0.45+0.56−0.19. This number is
lower than the expectation of∼4 derived by Ref. 5 for the same telescope size and starshade launch
mass, primarily because Roman’s actual end-to-end efficiency is lower than previously assumed,
resulting in significantly longer integration times for high-quality spectra."
"It is important to note that Roman observations with a starshade will be sensitive to a wide vari-
ety of planets. Figure 14 shows the expected number of planets discovered by imaging (SNR>7),
some of which are bright enough to obtain follow-up spectra. This threshold SNR value is relaxed
compared to Earth-like planets because giant exoplanets tend to have more pronounced spectral
features. The planet properties and frequency of occurrence are the same as the Exo-S report46"
"Fig 12 An example of a retargeting strategy that bounds the fuel usage for the Starshade Ren-
dezvous Probe mission. We have allocated 36 target maneuvers to accomplish the objectives. In
this case, we have chosen a stressing case where the 36 retarget maneuvers are applied to 9 tar-
gets, each visited four times. While this is not representative of the mission, which would visit 10
habitable exoplanet targets with a subset of them requiring revisits in addition to the known gas
giants, the reason this is a stressing case is that visiting a target twice a year on different availability
windows requires more significant burns than having to visit a target only once a year or just once
during the mission as will be that case for the known gas giants and habitability targets with large
exozodiacal dust disk backgrounds. The top panel show the main spacecraft events and maneuvers
along with the cumulative ∆v estimates for each target as a function of time, labeled in year and
month of year at the top of the figure. The vertical magenta tick marks show the time at which
each target is visited. The bottom panel shows the targets chosen with their observing availability
windows shown as horizontal bars. Each bar has numerical labels representing the order of the
visits. The timing of translational retargeting slews (red lines) may take a couple days up to two
weeks depending on the angular separation between targets. The targets are arranged vertically in
order of right ascension with the observing windows for each target shown as horizontal colored
bars. The observation days are chosen to be at the beginning of the window, to allow time for
follow-up spectroscopy within the same window."

8 Conclusions
"We have presented the modeling, observing approach, and expected performance to meet the ob-
jectives of the Starshade Rendezvous Probe study.1 The Starshade Rendezvous Probe concept has
the capability to deliver first-of-a-kind exoplanet direct imaging and spectroscopy results in the
next decade. A deep-dive investigation will provide the first examination of planetary systems
around our nearest sunlike stars, including their habitable zones, giant exoplanets, and warm dust
disks, opening a new frontier."
"The Starshade Rendezvous Probe concept is capable of discovering Earth-size planets in the
habitable zones of nearby stars using the relatively moderate aperture Roman space telescope. By
initially characterizing the sensitivity to each individual target, we have found that while the SRP
has the sensitivity to detect Earth-like exoplanets and constrain their orbits to the habitable zone,
its primary limitation is the sensitivity to spectral measurements. The main means for improving
this is to increase the aperture of the telescope, as would be done with HabEx, since this has the
dual benefit of increasing the photon rate and better resolving the exozodiacal background. It is
worth noting there are large uncertainties in the occurrence rates of Earth-like exoplanets and the
distribution of zodiacal dust disk brightness, which could result in a increased discovery potential"

"Fig 14 Planet yield as a function of planet type and approximate temperature. The yield is ob-
tained based on the single-visit completeness assuming detection with SNR ≥ 7. All observations
assume a zodiacal dust disk brightness of 4.5 zodi. The bar chart assumes that the 16 targets for
the habitability and biosignature gases investigation are visited at least once. The number of plan-
ets scales with the number of targets visited according the the single-visit completeness curve in
Figure 13."
"of the SRP if nature behaves favorably. The SRP is the only observatory that would have the
capability to detect Earth-like exoplanets within the next decade."
"Observations of known planets with the SRP could determine whether the atmospheric metal-
licity and mass of known giant exoplanets follows the correlation observed in our own Solar Sys-
tem, testing whether there is a trend in planetary formation. Meeting these objectives will begin
to answer the driving questions of whether Earth is unique and how the Solar System compares
to the planetary systems orbiting our nearest sunlike stars. The SRP is well equipped to meet
this objective with an expected increase in the number of known gas giants with radial velocity
measurements as well as observations with CGI prior to the SRP operations."
"The SRP will obtain measurements of the exozodiacal dust of nearby sunlike stars with un-
precedented sensitivity. This information is key to the future of direct imaging observatories since
the dust brightness distribution is not known well enough to pin down the level of background
light expected for planet detection and characterization. The sensitivity of the SRP to dust disks
provides additional scientific opportunities to investigate the influence of planets on the dust disk
morphology provided such systems are found."
"The main challenge of observing with starshades – retargeting with constrained time windows
in a relatively short mission duration – has been addressed with a decision tree that can accom-
modate the large degree of uncertainty associated with searching for Earth-like exoplanets. The
observing plan adapts to new information as the targets are observed multiple times with predeter-
mined criteria for deciding whether to revisit targets or take spectral measurements. We have esti-
mated 36 retargeting maneuvers are necessary to meet the science objectives and we have bounded"
"the amount of delta-v needed with a stress case scenario. The driving use of fuel is the occurrence
of large angle retargeting maneuvers needed to observe some targets multiple times within the two-
year duration of the mission. Depending on the realization of Earth-like exoplanet occurrence and
exozodiacal dust, the SRP mission could have enough fuel for an extended mission to visit more
targets."
