"ABSTRACT
Small-scale density fluctuations can significantly affect reionization, but are typically modelled quite crudely. Unresolved
fluctuations in numerical simulations and analytical calculations are included using a gas clumping factor, typically assumed to
be independent of the local environment. In Paper I we presented an improved, local density-dependent model for the sub-grid
gas clumping. Here we extend this using an empirical stochastic model based on the results from high-resolution numerical
simulations which fully resolve all relevant fluctuations. Our model reproduces well both the mean density-clumping relation
and its scatter. We applied our stochastic model, along with the mean clumping one and the Paper I deterministic model, to
create a large-volume realisations of the clumping field, and used these in radiative transfer simulations of cosmic reionization.
Our results show that the simplistic mean clumping model delays reionization compared to local density-dependent models,
despite producing fewer recombinations overall. This is due to the very different spatial distribution of clumping, resulting in
much higher photoionization rates in the latter cases. The mean clumping model produces smaller H II regions throughout most
of reionization, but those percolate faster at late times. It also causes significant delay in the 21-cm fluctuations peak and yields
lower non-Gaussianity and many fewer bright pixels in the PDF distribution. The stochastic density-dependent model shows
relatively minor differences from the deterministic one, mostly concentrated around overlap, where it significantly suppresses
the 21-cm fluctuations, and at the bright tail of the 21-cm PDFs, where it produces noticeably more bright pixels."

1 INTRODUCTION
"The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is an important period in the his-
tory of the Universe, which encompasses the creation of the first stars
and galaxies that subsequently influenced the formation and evolu-
tion of latter-day structures. These luminous objects have produced
enough UV-radiation to both alter their host galaxy composition and
to propagate into the intergalactic medium (IGM), ultimately ioniz-
ing it for a second time (Furlanetto et al. 2006; Zaroubi 2012; Ferrara
& Pandolfi 2014).
The key goal of reionization simulations is to provide numerical"
"framework for constraining EoR observables, for example the detec-
tion of the 21cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen fluctuations
(Bowman & Rogers 2010; Paciga et al. 2013; Yatawatta et al. 2013;
Parsons et al. 2014; Jeliƒá et al. 2014; Jacobs et al. 2015; Dillon et al."

damping wings (Davies et al. 2018; Greig et al. 2019). Such simula-
tions require large volumes, of several hundreds cMpc size in order
to correctly derive the cosmic reionization history, to account for
abundance and clustering of expected sources and to sample vast
regions of the universe for detection of the redshifted 21cm hyper-
fine transition of neutral hydrogen (Mellema et al. 2006b; Iliev et al.
2014), as relevant for current and upcoming experiments (e.g. LO-
FAR1, SKA2). At the same time, EoR simulations need to include
fluctuations in the density distribution down to the Jeans mass of the
cold gas, which is in sub-kpc scale, so as to correctly model recombi-
nation effects and thus properly track the expansion of ionizing fronts
throughout reionization (Park et al. 2016). Unfortunately, because of"

"limited dynamic range, satisfying both of these requirements in a
single fully-numerical simulation is currently unachievable, and will
remain challenging in the future. Hence, in large-scale simulations,
the sources and sinks of ionizing radiation often act on scales much
smaller than the resolution level and need to be treated using sub-grid
prescriptions. Consequently, simulations may adopt incorrect values
for various relevant quantities (e.g. density, temperature, gas pres-
sure, etc.) smoothed on the (relatively coarse) grid scales and this
could influence the predicted observational signatures.
In this work, our focus is on how sub-grid density inhomogeneities"
"are considered within the volume elements of large-scale simula-
tions. Depending on how gas density fluctions vary in space and over
time (local degree of ""clumpiness""), the recombinations in the IGM
can significantly affect the progress and nature of the reionization
process. For every ionized atom that recombines with a free elec-
tron, an additional ionizing photon should be produced in order to
ionize it again and keep the IGM highly ionized. In this way po-
tentially a substantial portion of the sources photon budget could
be depleted. In simulations, the recombination rate R is discrete,

Ostriker 1997; Tegmark et al. 1996; Ciardi & Ferrara 1997; Madau
et al. 1999; Valageas & Silk 2004). If not correctly treated, this ap-
proach can underestimate the impact of sub-grid inhomogeneities on
absorption of radiation. In some cases this term is just completely
ignored, i.e.: C = 1 (Onken & Miralda-Escud√© 2004; Kohler et al.
2007), but the more common and simplistic approaches consist in
either a constant global term (Cen 2003; Zhang et al. 2007) or a
time evolving global term (Iliev et al. 2005; Mellema et al. 2006b;
Iliev et al. 2007; Pawlik et al. 2009), averaged on the entire box
volume, also referred as the biased homogeneous or globally aver-
aged clumping model. Recently we presented our first work (see Mao
et al. 2019, for reference), hereafter Paper I, where we investigated
the impact of a spatially varying, local density dependent sub-grid
clumping factor on reionization observables. In the present paper
we extend the discussion and propose a more realistic and accurate
treatment of the Clumping Factor Approach, that takes into account
also the scatter around the mean clumping-density relation observed
in high-resolution simulations.
We use a high-resolution N-body simulation of a small volume"
"of side length 9 cMpc, with spatial and mass resolution of approx-
imately 200 pc and 5000MÔøΩ , to statistically describe IGM density
fluctuations down to the Jeans mass in the cold, pre-reonization gas
and then to implement these sub-grid density fluctuations into two
large volume (714 cMpc and 349 cMpc os side length) reionization
simulations. By adapting the small-scale sub-grid to the resolution
of larger boxes we then model the correlation between density and
clumping factor, comparing three different models (details in ¬ß2.3),
in order to infer the clumping factor from the coarse density grid
of the large volume, see ¬ß2.4. Finally we perform a radiative trans-
fer simulation to study the effect of this sub-grid inhomogeneity
approach on observables of reionization."
"This paper is organized as follows. In ¬ß 2 we present the N-body
and radiative transfer (RT) simulation used, the numerical methods,
¬ß2.2 and our models in ¬ß2.3. In ¬ß2.4 we discuss the realisation of
the clumping factor for large volumes from sub-grid inhomogeneity
correlation. In ¬ß3 we analyse our RT simulation results and look into
how our models influence the basic features of EoR: the reionization
history in ¬ß3.1, the volume-averaged ionization fraction evolution,
the integrated Thompson optical depth and then the Bubble size
distribution in ¬ß3.3. To better understand the change in ionization
morphology we describe a side-by-side comparison of box slice shot
with zoom ¬ß3.2. In ¬ß3.4 we analyse the 21cm signal power spec-
tra and the brightness temperature distribution. Our conclusions are
summarized in ¬ß4."
2 METHODOLOGY
2.1 Numerical Simulations
"We use N-body simulations to follow the evolution of cosmic struc-
tures, performed with the CUBEP3M code (Harnois-D√©raps et al.
2013). The code uses particle-particle on short-range and particle-
mesh on long-range to calculate gravitational forces. We use set of
three N-body simulations, whose parameters are summarized in Ta-
ble 1.
Our clumping factor modeling is based on small, high resolution"
"volume box (6.3 ‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc= 9Mpc, 17283 particles, labelled SB in
Table 1). This has sufficient spatial and mass resolution to resolve
the smallest halos that can hold cold, neutral gas. Our main larger-
volume N-body simulation is referred to as LB-1 (500 ‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc=
714Mpc, 69123 ‚âà 330 billion particles). A smaller simulation, LB-
2, (244 ‚Ñé‚àí1Mpc= 349Mpc, 40003 = 64 billion particles)will be used
as comparison to analyse possible influence of box size and resolution
in the realisation of sub-grid clumping factor and prove the stability of
our method. For both of the large-volume simulations the minimum
halosmass resolved is 109 ùëÄÔøΩ , while halos with 108 ùëÄÔøΩ < ùëÄ‚Ñéùëéùëôùëú <
109 ùëÄÔøΩ are implemented using a sub-grid model (Ahn et al. 2014),
thereby all atomically-cooling halos (ACHs) with minimum mass
Mhalo & 5 √ó 108MÔøΩ are included. We are using updated N-body
simulations compared to Paper I, we illustrate this further in ¬ßA.
An on-the-fly spherical overdensity halo finder (Harnois-D√©raps"
"et al. 2013;Watson et al. 2013), with overdensity parameter Œî = 130,
creates an halo catalogues at given redshift, that is later used as
inputs for the radiative transfer simulation. The remaining particles
are categorized as part of the IGM. In this work we do not include
any effects from minihaloes Mhalo < 108MÔøΩ . Even though these
sources could have driven ionization in the early phase of EoR, their
effect on later stage is expected to be minor because of molecular
dissociation by UV background radiation from primordial luminous
sources, up to a point that their contribution is negligible compared
to heavier ACHs (Ahn et al. 2009). Initial conditions are generated
using the Zel‚Äôdovich approximation and the power spectrum of the
linear fluctuations is given by the CAMB code (Lewis et al. 2000). The
SB N-body simulation starts at redshift z = 300, while LB-1 and
LB-2 at ùëß = 150, which gives enough time to significantly reduced
non-linear decaying modes (Crocce et al. 2006), while at the same
time fluctuations are small enough to ensure linearity of density field
at the respective resolutions. The cosmological parameter are based
on WMAP 5 years data observation and consistent with final Planck
results, for a flat, ŒõCDM cosmology with the following parameters,
Œ©Œõ = 0.73, Œ©m = 0.27, Œ©b = 0.044, H0 = 70 km s‚àí1 cMpc‚àí1,
ùúé8 = 0.8, ns = 0.96 and the cosmic helium abundance [He = 0.074"

"(Komatsu et al. 2011). Our method is general and can be applied in

provide are based on the above values."
"We simulate the Epoch of Reionization using the C2-Ray code
(Mellema et al. 2006b), a photon-conserving radiative transfer (RT)
code based on short characteristic ray-tracing. The LB-1 and LB-2N-
body simulations provide the IGM density fields and halo catalogues
with masses, velocities, position and other variables, for a total of 76
snapshots, equally spaced in time (Œîùë° = 11.54Myr) in the redshfit
interval z ‚àà [6; 50]. For computational feasibility, the density grid
is coarsened for the radiative transfer simulation to 3003 (LB-1),
and 2503 (LB-2). The high-resolution N-body simulation (SB) data
input is initially interpolated onto a 12003 (SB) grid, which can
then be coarsened to the required resolution as discussed in the next
section. These grids correspond respectively to cell sizes of length
2.381 cMpc, 1.394 cMpc and 7.5 kpc. For brevity we will refer to
these grids as the sub-grid volumes for SB, and coarse volumes in
LB-1 and LB-2, noted „Äà.„Äâùëêùëüùë† . Just as in Paper I, the interpolation
of the particles onto a grid is performed with a Smoothed-Particle-
Hydrodynamic-like method (SPH-like), which then yields coarse-
grid density, velocity and clumping fields (see sect. 2.2 in Paper I for
details).

value for ùëì‚òÖ and ùëìùëíùë†ùëê are still uncertain, therefore these parameters
can be tuned in order to match the observational constrain that we
will discuss in ¬ß3. Here we adopt the partial suppression model
of (Dixon et al. 2015), whereby for LMACHs located in a neutral
cell the efficiency factor is set to ùëìùõæ = 8.2, while in an ionized cell
(above 10%) we set ùëìùõæ = 5 to account for feedback. For HMACHs
the efficiency factor has a constant value of ùëìùõæ = 5, equivalent to
e.g. Ni = 5000, ùëì‚òÖ = 0.05 and ùëìesc = 0.02."
2.2 Coarse-Grid Method
"Our clumping factor calculations are based on N-body data and ne-
glect any hydrodynamical effects on the clumping factor. Accounting
for the gas pressure provides additional smoothing at small scales and
therefore our clumping factor values should be considered as upper
limits. Moreover, we are interested in the reionization of the IGM
and therefore exclude the halos from our calculations. The contri-
bution of recombinations inside haloes is already taken into account
in Equation 1 through the photon escape fraction and should not be
counted again.
In order to represent the N-body particles into a regular grid, we"
"adopt the SPH-like smoothing technique described in ¬ß2.2 of Paper
I, we refer the readers to e.g. Shapiro et al. (1996) for more general
details on SPH smoothingmethods. In LB-1 andLB-2 simulationswe
use regular meshes directly produced by the SPH code at the required
resolution (the specific values used here are listed in Table 1). In the
SB simulation we adopt a more flexible approach, whereby we first
produce all quantities on a very fine mesh (here 12003), which is
later coarsened as required in order to approximately match the cell
sizes used in the LB simulations.
A window mesh function smooths the SB mesh-grid on a coarser-"
"grained mesh, with size defined by Equation 3. The method allows
the windows function to overlap. The percentage of overlap N% is
chosen in order to achieve the required resolution size of the LBs and
at the same time obtain a large enough set of coarsened SB data, since
Mesh3crs‚àígr gives the total number of data point then interpolated by
the clumping models (see Figure 1)."
"Meshcrs‚àígr =

"where ResLB is the coarse grained resolution of the large box and
BoxSizeSB the box size of the small box. We employ the SB cell-
wise quantities expressed with equations (4) and (7) to compute
the parametrization of the correlation models. Hereafter, we will
refer to them as the sub-coarse-grid or SB data, whereas in the
case of LBs we name them RT-mesh grid. In our case we have
Meshcrs‚àígr = 8 with percentage overlap N% = 53% for 714 cMpc

2.3 Modeling the Overdensity-Clumping Correlation
"In this work we consider several models for the parametrisation of
the correlation between the local coarse overdensity 1 + „Äàùõø„Äâcell and
the coarse clumping factor CIGM, cell."
I) Biased Homogeneous Subgrid Clumping (BHC)
"The simplest approach is to set a constant (redshift-dependent)
clumping factor ùê∂ (ùëß), for the entire simulation volume (e.g. Madau
et al. 1999;Mellema et al. 2006b; Iliev et al. 2007; Kohler et al. 2007;
Raiƒçeviƒá & Theuns 2011). In our case, we evaluate this globally av-
eraged clumping for every SB simulation snapshot at the appropriate
coarse resolution and then fit it with an exponential function of the
form:"
"CBHC (z) ‚â° CIGM, cell = C0 ec1 z+c2 z
2
+ 1 (8)"
"where C0, c1 and c2 are the fitting parameters. We refer to this
model as biased homogeneous clumping (Paper I) since that volume-
averaged value is then multiplied by the local cell density to obtain"
"the recombination rate, effectively biasing recombinations towards
high-density regions."
II) Inhomogeneous Subgrid Clumping (IC) Model
"This model, where the local gas clumping is set based on one-to-one,
deterministic relation with the cell density, was first presented in
Paper I. We include it here for comparison purposes. The relation of
the clumping with the overdensity in Equation 4 is fit by a quadratic
function:"
log10 (CIC (x | zi)) ‚â° y = ai x2 + bi x + ci (9)
"where x = log10 (1 + „Äàùõø„Äâcell) and y = log10 (CIGM, cell), the cellwise
quantity from SB simulation. For each snapshot ùëßùëñ we evaluate the
fitting parameters ai, bi and ci using the coarse-grid field we derived
in ¬ß2.2."
III) Stochastic Subgrid Clumping (SC) Model
"This model, first presented here, aims to account for the natural
stochasticity of the relation between local clumping and overdensity,
as observed in full numerical simulations. This stochasticity is due to
various environmental effects beyond the dependence of the clump-
ing on the local density, and results in a significant scatter around the
mean relation used in the IC model (Fig. 1).
We model this scatter from the simple one-to-one relation by"
"binning the SB coarse-grained clumping in several (here five) wide
bins of overdensity Œîùõøj. In each bin we fit the scatter using a log-
normal distribution."

simulation is inevitably narrower due to the smaller volume compared
to our target reionization volumes. For data beyond the SB limits, for
high and low densities, we fix the mean value to the one given by the
IC model, while standard deviation is fixed to the one obtained in the
closest density bin.
These distributions are then sampled randomly to create real-"
"isations of the clumping in large-volume simulations. A similar
approach, but in a different context, has been used previously
by Tomassetti et al. (2014) and Lupi et al. (2018), motivated by
observation of density distribution in giant molecular clouds."

Results are shown in Figure 2. In the figures we show the N-body
data upon which the model is based (black crosses), the volume-
averaged clumping factor BHC (black horizontal line), the one-to-
one quadratic fit IC (red solid line), the expectation value E[X]
and the standard deviation SD[X] of the log-normal distribution in
each density bin (blue error-bar points) with the relative bins limits
also shown (dashed vertical line). Finally, our SC model clumping
realisation (green area) based on the density field of LB-2 is shown
with contours corresponding to the 95% (outer), 68% (middle) and
38% (inner) confidence interval. Tables with parameters of the three
models used in this paper can be found online4.
The results illustrate the extend to which each subgrid clumping"
"model reproduces the trends in the direct N-body data throughout
the evolution. The BHC (mean-clumping) model roughly matches
the peak of the contours and its evolution over time. The IC
model (quadractic fit) captures well the general trend of the density-
clumping relation and tracks well the highest density of data points.
Finally, our new SC model realisation fully reproduces the data,
including the scatter around the mean relation. The contours trace
the majority of the simulation data quite closely, apart from a few
outliers. However, a few things should be noted here."

logarithm of the variable is normal distributed. Therefore our modification

"First, as noted in ¬ß 2.3, the large volumes generally sample much
wider range of environments than smaller ones used to produce the
model, thus inevitably the large-volume realisation should extrapo-
late to over-densities outside the range sampled by the direct N-body
data, for both larger and smaller over-densities. Second, again as dis-
cussed above, for statistical reasons we fixed the bin sizes so that they
contain same number of data points, which inevitably results in quite
uneven bin widths. These are very narrow near the peak density of
points and are quite wide for extreme values of the over-density. The
combination of these factors yields the ‚Äôflairing‚Äô of the realisaion
(green) points at both large and small values of the over-density, and
thus possible minor discrepancies with what we find in simulations.
However, only small fraction of the points are in these regions, as
demonstrated by the density of points, and therefore it is unlikely this
will affect the results in any significant way. Obviously, the IC model
is potentially affected in a similar way, since the quadratic fit is used
beyond the range of the original data points.
As a consistency check, we compare the redshift evolution of the"
"volume average of the clumping realizations based on the SC and IC
models vs. the actual global mean Cglob based on the simulated data
(Figure 3). The vertical line indicates the redshift at which the SB
simulation was stopped, thus data beyond that is extrapolated. The
relative errors of the mean values (bottom panels) are in agreement
within the 6 ‚àí 7% for LB-2 (right) and within 10% for LB-1 (left),
throughout the relevant redshift range 6 ‚â§ z ‚â§ 30. At the highest
redshifts (ùëß > 30) the errors appear larger, however over that redshift
range the density fluctuations are small and thus all clumping factors
converge to 1 and do not contribute to the recombination rate.
Hence, the local density inhomogeneity does not significantly affect
the global averages; however, we expect that the local clumping
factor plays a greater role in the recombination and ionization at
small scales (e.g. on the H II region size distribution, ionized bubble
volume evolution, etc.). The proposed models are roughly consistent
with results of previous papers Park et al. (2016), Iliev et al. (2007)
and once our the RT-simulation are performed we expect to obtain
similar confirmation from the work of Iliev et al. (2012)."
"3 CLUMPING MODEL EFFECT ON OBSERVATIONAL
SIGNATURE"
"The sub-grid clumping model employed affects the local IGM re-
combination rates, which is then reflected in the derived observable
signatures of reionization. In order to understand and try to quan-
tify the importance of this choice, we perform three RT simulations
where we fix the source production efficiencies of ionizing photons
and vary solely the clumping model. At each time step the precom-
puted N-body density fields are used to create a realisation of the
corresponding gridded clumping factor, as described in ¬ß2.3. These
clumping grids are then stored and provided as additional inputs to
full radiative transfer simulations with the C2-RAY code (Mellema
et al. 2006a). Specifically, the simulation used for this section is
LB-1.
The simulation redshifts span the range ùëß = 40 to 6, for a total of"
"125 snapshots. The corresponding aperture on the sky vary from 3.6
to 4.7 deg per side, and covers the redshifted 21-cm frequency range
from 26 to 45MHz. The resolution evolves from 43.5‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ to 56‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ in the

density-dependent clumping treatments (SC and IC) yield somewhat"

"faster evolution and an earlier end of reionization compared to the
BHC model. The former models diverge from BHC around ùëß 6 12,
and thereafter the mean reionization is accelerated with a maximum
difference at ùë•ùëñ = 70%, of Œîùëß ' 0.3 at ùëß ' 7.5, corresponding to
a time difference of approximately 36Myr. The end of reionization
is delayed by Œîùëß = 0.1, or 17 Myr. Here there is very little differ-
ence between the SC and IC models. Compared to the observational
constraints, all three models reionize somewhat early, however these
constraints are largely upper limits, and with significant uncertain-
ties. Moreover, our main interest is the relative effect of different
sub-grid clumping models, rather than a faithful reproduction of the
constraints.

"In Figure 6 (top left) we show the evolution of the mean of this
quantity over the full simulation volume (solid lines), as well as
averaged only over the over-dense (dashed lines) and under-dense
(dot-dashed lines) regions. Colours indicate the model used, as per
legend. We also show (bottom left) the relative percentage difference
compared to the BHC model. As could be expected, the number
of recombinations grows strongly over time, starting close to zero,
departing fromBHCmodel around ùëß ‚àº 12, and then all reaching‚àº 15
at late times, as more and more structures form over time. Although
all models end up at similar values by ùëß ‚àº 6, the BHC model lags
behind throughout the evolution. The IC and SC models yield very
similar values at all times. The over-/under-dense volumes yieldmuch
higher/lower number of recombinations, respectively, demonstrating
the wide variety of outcomes dependent on the local conditions.
Interestingly, the over-dense average for the BHC model results in
very similar recombinations to the full-volume averages of SC and
IC models, showing that at least on average the clumping in these
last models behaves the same way as the over-dense regions in BHC.
Overall, the SC model shows a few percent higher recombination
rate (‚àº 1 ‚àí 5%) compared to the IC model. This is most likely due"
"to the stochastic nature of the realization process, also related to the
broader scatter in Figure 3 (shaded areas).
In Figure 6 (right panels) we compare the (non-equilibrium) pho-"
"toionization rates Œìùëñ computed during the run by the C2-Ray code.
Just as above, all mean photoionization rates are essentially the same
until ùëß ‚àº 12, after which the BHC model one rises more slowly,
lagging behind the other two cases by about factor of 2.5 throughout
most of the evolution, eventially catching up by ùëß ‚àº 6. The average
rates in the overdense regions are higher than the mean (reflecting
the inside-out nature of reionization) by a similar amount, while the
mean photoionization rates in the under-dense regions lag behind by
larger factors, up to several hundred, before again rising steeply and
catching up with the mean by ùëß ‚àº 6. Interestingly, the mean rate
in BHC overdense regions is again very close to the whole volume
means of IC and SC models. The average values in the under-dense
regions remain the same for all models until much later, ùëß ‚àº 9.5, in-
dicating that the specific clumping model has little influence before
that redshift.
At first glance, it seems somewhat counter-intuitive that reion-"
"ization proceeds faster in the denity-dependent models IC and SC,
despite their notably higher recombination rates. The reason for this
is that in the former cases also the suppression of low-mass galaxies
(LMACHs) due to radiative feedback is weaker than in the BHC
case, as illustrated in Figure 7. In the BHC case essentially all such
galaxies are suppressed by ùëß ‚àº 8.5, while in the density-dependent
models the suppression is slowed down, allowing LMACHs to last
longer in high density regions. This is further clarified in Figure 8
where we show the number density distribution of ionized fraction of
cells at five different reionization stages, ùë•ùëñ = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9,
approximately corresponding to redshift between ùëß ' 12 ‚àí 6 (see
Table 2). The vertical line indicates the partial suppression thresh-
old for LMACHs. Early on (ùë•ùëñ = 0.1) the gas clumping has yet had
very litte effect, due to the still small ionized fraction and the short
time available for recombinations, thus all models yield very similar
results, with only BHC showing slightly fewer highly ionized cells.
As reionization progresses (ùë•ùëñ = 0.3), IC and SC models remain
very similar, while BHC is gaining more ionized cells, and at the
same time it is starting to show a lack of neutral regions. Starting
from roughly mid-point of reionization (ùë•ùëñ = 0.5), the dearth of neu-"

"tral cells becomes ever more prominent whereas the peak of highly
ionized cells stays roughly similar for all models. A faint difference
between SC and IC is visible at late times, where slightly more cells
remain neutral in SC."
3.2 Reionization morphology
"The globally-averaged quantities discussed above (Figure 4, 5 and
6) give an overall idea of the reionization history. Next step is"
"to understand how the sub-grid gas clumping model affects the
propagation of radiation and the local features of reionization.
In Figure 9 we show box slice of LB-2 and compare simulation
snapshots with similar globally averaged ionized fraction and the
three gas clumping models. From top to bottom row we have
ùë•ùëñ = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 (in Table 2 we list the corresponding redshift
at which this occurs and its consequent time delay compared to the
BHC model) and from left to right column we have the different
models BHC, IC and SC. Red/crimson regions indicate highly
ionized cells ùë•i > 0.9, in dark blue neutral regions ùë•i < 0.1, and in
green/aquamarine the transition phase ùë•i ‚âà 0.5. Within each image
we embed a zoom-in region, of 85 cMpc per side, to better appreciate
the morphological changes of a randomly selected under-dense
neutral clump, as ionized fronts expand (bluer blob, right column
plots)."
"Our simulations reproduce the general reionization features found
in previous simulations (e.g. Iliev et al. 2014; Hutter et al. 2021). In
high density regions LMACH are the first halos to form. In our sim-
ulations they make their first appearance at redshift ùëß = 21, and by
ùëß ‚àº 12 every volume element contains at least one ionizing source.
At first, a modest number of isolated sources, highly clustered on
small scale but homogeneously distributed on large scale, start to
ionize their surrounding gas, forming small regions of a few Mpc
size. The presence of sub-grid gas clumping slows down the propa-
gation of the I-fronts and yields somewhat smaller, more fragmented
H II regions. Throughout reionization, these HII bubbles grow and
eventually overlap, at which point the ionization process accelerates
and many of the smaller bubbles percolate to much larger connected
volumes.
The side-by-side comparison shows some notable differences be-"
"tween BHC and the two density-dependent models, with the latter
starting at a faster pace, with earlier local percolation, then slow-
ing down compared to the former case. Modest differences appear
between the three models in terms of large scale morphology, with
a higher degree of ioniziation around early sources in the density-
dependent models IC and SC (respectively central and right panel).
From around the mid-point of reionization (50% ionization by vol-
ume, second row of images) we can see neighbouring growing re-
gions connecting to each other and starting to highly ionize the link-
ing filament. At this point, accordingly to Figure 8, all cells in BHC
have surpassed the threshold limit ùë•i = 0.1 for the partial suppression
of low mass haloes. For IC (middle) and SC (right column) the de-
gree of ionization around sources is visibly more intense compared
to BHC, in fact we can distinguish highly ionized cells clustered
around the high density peak, whereas under-dense regions are kept
fairly neutral. This diversity is due to the higher recombination rate
in inhomogeneity dependent model, shown in Figure 6 (left), that
effectively reduces the number of photons able to escape the cells of
origin and spread into the neighbour grid elements. This is not the
case for BHC, to which clumping factor in high density regions is
underestimated and ionizing photons are free to percolate and been
absorbed elsewhere in the surrounding IGM, therefore interconnect-
ing filament cells between sources clearly appears extended and in a
more advanced neutral-ionized transition (blue/aquamarine).
Later on (ùë•i = 0.7, third row of images), ionized regions have"
"grown substantially and become strongly ionized. A first look sug-
gests similar structure patchiness on large scale, although from the
zoom-in we can observe that BHC has a wider and smoother tran-
sition between the ionized/neutral phases, whereas IC and SC show
a narrower front, allowing more cells that host under-density to stay
neutral. When the same transition region dwell across the three"

casionally one or few cells appearing slightly more ionized then their

The morphology differences are more evident at late times (ùë•i ="
"90%, bottom row of images), whereby HII bubbles connect together
to form one vast interconnected highly ionized region. At this stage
the vast ionized IGM in IC and SC show variations that follow the
higher recombinations due to density fluctuations, which is not the
case in BHC model and therefore the same regions appear uniformly
highly ionized, ùë• ‚âà 1. On the other hand there are no striking differ-
ence between IC and SC, except for small variations, of a few pixels
of size, on the ionized/neutral boundaries. We suspect that this is nu-
meric artefact due to the stochastic nature of SC.We are developing a
more complete clumping model, that we will present in future work,
to exclude this uncertainty."
3.3 Bubble Size Distribution
"One of the key characteristics of reionization, which directly af-
fects all observables is the normalized distribution of bubble sizes
ùëÖ ùëëùëÅ/ùëëùëÖ or volume sizes ùëâ2 ùëëùëÅ/ùëëùëâ of ionized regions (Furlanetto
et al. 2004). A number of complementary approaches to calculate
these distributions have been proposed (e.g. Friedrich et al. 2011; Lin
et al. 2016; Giri et al. 2018a). Here we employ the Mean-Free-Path
(MFP) method to calculate ùëÖ ùëëùëÅ/ùëëùëÖ, and the Friends-of-Friends
(FOF) algorithm (Iliev et al. 2006a) to obtain ùëâ2 ùëëùëÅ/ùëëùëâ bubble size
distributions (BSD). For both methods we employ the TOOLS21CM5
python package for EoR simulations analysis (Giri et al. 2020). In
both cases, we apply a threshold value of ùë•ùë°‚Ñé = 0.9, since we want
to highlight differences in distribution of highly ionized regions that
develop around sources.
Results are shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11, respectively we"
"see the typical traits of the percolation process, with volume ranges
that roughly corresponding to what is expected from large simu-
lated box (Iliev et al. 2014). We present our results at four different
reionization milestones, ùë•ùëñ = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, see Table 2 for cor-
responding redshifts. In the case ofMFP-BSD, we calculate themean
bubble size by ÔøΩÃÑÔøΩ ="

"ing vertical lines for each simulation. The sharp cut-off at small
scales 2.381 cMpc, for MFP-BSD, and 13.498 cMpc3 for FOF-BSD
correspond to the simulation cells size and volume respectively.
Early-on (xÃÑi = 0.3, top left panel, Figure 10), LB-2 hosts small"
"H II bubbles with radius smaller then 10 cMpc. For inhomogeneity-
dependent models IC and SC, distributions present many more
highly-ionized regions, indication of a faster radiation propagation
around sources. All three distributions peak at the size correspond-
ing to one cell. The same trend is confirmed by the topologically-
connected FOF volumes (Figure 11), which are however typically
larger than MFP, with volumes between 30 ‚àí 700 cMpc3 for BHC
and a wider distribution for IC and SC, from one cell up to a few
thousandMpc3.
Even though the number of bubbles increase as reionization"
"progress, at xÃÑi = 0.5 (top right), the MFP-BSD remain similar. How-
ever, the FOF-BSD shows a qualitative transition when the small H II
regions start to percolate into much larger, connected one. Their sizes
vary widely, with a broad flat distribution (plateau) at smaller scales
(V < 105 ‚àí 106 cMpc3). However, BHC and IC also show a bifur-
cated distribution, with a second peak at large scales, at 105 cMpc3
for BHC and 106 cMpc3 for IC, indicating that percolation process"
5 https://github.com/sambit-giri/tools21cm
"has started (Iliev et al. 2006b, 2014; Furlanetto & Oh 2016). Com-
pared to BHC, the IC distribution is shifted toward larger sizes, such
that the limit for the plateau and the percolation cluster are up to
one order of magnitude higher. A narrower separation between these
two volume range indicates that the merging of ionized region in
BHC has just started (Iliev et al. 2014; Furlanetto & Oh 2016; Giri
et al. 2018a), whereas in the case of IC this process is already on-
going. On the other hand, IC and SC distribution show similarity
at small scale but they differ for larger volumes. The former distri-
bution shows a constant and continuous range of scales from large
volumes V ‚àº 106 cMpc3 down to one cell, sign that ionized regions
are in principle less interconnected and therefore the presence of one
dominant super cluster has not yet occurred.
During the later stages of the reionization process (xÃÑi = 0.7, bottom"
"left) this bifurcation of the FOF-BSD continues and strenghtens, with
ever more small patches merging into the large one, while smaller
patches become fewer and on average ever smaller. At this stage
the three models present similar volume distributions, whereas their
MFP-BSD varies. BHC distribution starts to show a clear character-
istic size peak. Albeit of similar shape, the BHC size distribution is
clearly shifted to smaller scales, with the average bubble size smaller
by a few Mpc and the distribution peak at scale about a factor of 2
smaller (8 vs 15 Mpc).
Towards late reionization (xÃÑi = 0.9, bottom right), the volume"
"limit for isolated regions to grow before merging is further reduced
to V ‚àº 103 cMpc3, while the percolation cluster surpass volumes of
108 cMpc3 (i.e. close to the full simulation volume) in all the three
cases. In Figure 10, the sizes distribution in the BHC model has
surpassed the other two, with average radius of 54.84 cMpc. IC and
SC show again similar distribution but with an increasing, although
still minor, difference in the mean radius. Volume distribution in
Figure 11 present a similar situation, the only difference between IC
and SC consists in the value of the volume merging limit, with a
difference up to 1 cMpc3."

done by a top-hat kernel with the same width and the above Gaussian
kernel. SKA1-Low will not observe the coeval cube. Instead it will
observe a lightcone, in which the signal evolves along the line of
sight direction. We construct lightcones from our simulation results
using the method described in Giri et al. (2018a). This method is also
implemented in TOOLS21CM."
In Figure 12we show the smoothed lightcone for the three different

This type of data maps the 21-cm differential brightness evolution at

"Early on, the IGM remains mostly neutral, the average signal
largely follows Eq. 14 (ùõøTb > 30mK) and the fluctuations are driven
by the density distribution. The gas clumping also remains low and
therefore at low frequencies, aobs > 120MHz, there is no visible
difference between simulations. As radiation escapes the host halos,
it starts to form small isolated transparent regions around sources"

"and gradually suppresses the average signal. The H II regions are
still small and thus are smoothed over by the observation beam.
Figure 12 shows very similar evolution for the three simulations at
frequency higher then 130MHz (ùëß < 10), but with different intensity
of signal suppression. For example the appearances of the first trans-
parent regions, due to lack of neutral hydrogen, at aùëúùëèùë† ' 147MHz
and angular position 3.2‚ó¶ and 1.1‚ó¶ shows that ionization around
sources are more consistent for the simulation with inhomogene-
ity dependent clumping. This is the case even at higher frequency
aùëúùëèùë† > 180ùëÄùêªùëß (ùëß < 7), during the final phases of reionization the
morphology and size of the percolation cluster strongly depends on
the clumping model employed by the simulation. BHC model has
large regions of feeble emission ‚àº 3 mK that are extensively linked
together. The IC model shows the same morphology but with con-
siderably smaller and more isolated regions of signal. The SCmodel,
in the other hand, shows a conspicuous lack of signal and regions of
emission have only of a few Mpc size.
These differences between models are more clearly observed in"
"the statistics of the 21-cm differential brightness temperature fluc-
tuations. are significant variation in the statistics of the differential
brightness temperature - rms, PDFs, skewness and power spectra -
shown in Figure 13, Figure 14, and Figure 15. The low frequency
cut-off is chosen for range where differences between models be-
comes noticeable. The high density peaks get ionized early, and the
corresponding H II regions are smaller then the interferometer res-
olution, thus their effect on rms (Figure 13, top) is to diminish the
averaged ùõøTb without increasing fluctuations. At this stage the signal
mostly follows the underlying density field, apart from the peaks and
there is little difference between the models. The observed frequency
of the RMS dip indicates the timing at which HII regions become
larger then the interferometry smoothing scale and eventually start
to overlap locally. This is the case at frequency larger then 120MHz
(ùëß ‚âà 11). For the IC and SC models, the turnover occurs earlier"

temperature at ionized fractions ùë•i = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9, for the three
clumping models, as labelled."
"and with a steeper slope than the BHC model, indication that signal
fluctuations increase faster and stronger. Moreover the peak value of
the RMS fluctuations varies, in the case of IC and SC models the
amplitude is 14% higher, despite having a lower averaged brightness
temperature then the homogeneous case, indicating that the signal is
sensitiive to a more physical treatment of the clumping factor. This
is the consequence of a lower clumping factor values in under-dense
regions, consistent with the conclusion in subsection 3.1. The faster
propagation of I-fronts, in the vast low density regions, leads to a
earlier second peak in the RMS of the two former approaches. In
order of appearance at aobs = 165MHz (z = 7.56) for SC, 169 MHz
(z = 7.34) for IC and slightly later at 176 MHz (z = 7.06) for BHC,
respectively when the average neutral fraction is xÃÑn = 0.33, 0.28 and
0.25. The subsequent decline is the results of reionization reaching
its final stage, with almost complete ionization.
The averaged 21-cm fluctuations level at different scales is re-"
"flected in the power spectra (Figure 15), where we compare the
results for models BHC, IC and SC at epochs at which the mean
ionization fractions are ùë•i = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, as well as around
reionization completion ùë•i = 0.99. At first, the 21-cm signal fol-
lows the underlying density distribution of neutral hydrogen and the
power spectra are very similar and approximatively a power law in
all three cases. The flattening of the power spectra is an indication
of the expanding ionized region, shifting the signal toward larger
scales while suppressing small structures. Interestingly, this charac-
teristic appears at the same scale regardless of the clumping model"

"Figure 15. The effect of clumping factor on the 21-cm power spectra compared at volume ionization fraction ùë•i = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 and 0.99 for the models

"but modest difference in amplitude of signal. The BHC model yields
systematically lower power at all scales and at all redshifts except
close to overlap. The stochastic relation between local overdensity
and clumping factor does not have a large effect throughout most of
reionization, and is noticeable predominantly at small scales later on.
The most significant differences between IC and SC models emerges
at the end of reionization (ùë•i = 0.99), where the SC model has less
power on all scales, by factor of up to a few. In fact, at that time the
SC model has less power than even the BHC, except at the small
scales ùëò > 0.3Mpc‚àí1."
"The 21-cm signal fluctuations are strongly non-Gaussian (e.g.
Mellema et al. 2006b; Giri et al. 2019) and therefore are not fully
described by the power spectra. We therefore also present the 21-
cm differential brightness temperature distribution moments of first
(PDFs; Figure 14) and second order (skewness; Figure 13, lower
panel). For all the models and all times, 21-cm PDFs are bimodal in
nature, which is a clear signature of non-Gaussianity (e.g. Ichikawa
et al. 2010; Giri et al. 2018b). Even though all the models show
non-Gaussinity, there are significant variations between models. The
SC and IC models are much more non-Gaussian, with many more
pixels at both high low values. Particularly, they show a very strong
tail at high values. This is somewhat stronger for the SC model at
all redshifts, indicating that the clumping scatter yields more high
brightness temperature peaks, by factor of a few. The signal skew-
ness confirms these observations. It is going from negative to positive
symmetry at aobs ' 170MHz, when the volume ionized fraction is
close to ùë•i = 0.6 ‚àí 0.7 and the RMS fluctuations reach maximum.
Differences between models are noticeable only later, once the simu-
lation overpass the peak in fluctuations, at frequency larger then 180
MHz. At this point the skewness increases exponentially."
4 CONCLUSION
"Studies of the large scale reionization morphology and its imprint
on the observable signatures requires large simulated volumes of a
several hundred cMpc per side. Due to computational limitations
which limit the dynamic range, uniformly high resolution cannot be
achieved in such a volume. Therefore no general model of the local
recombinations on scale below the resolution of large numerical
simulation exists. Typically a constant value of clumping factor is
used, but recently we presented a more general model (Paper I),
that depends on the local density, and we demonstrated how an over-
simplistic treatment of the clumping factor can have a strong effect on
the simulated reionization timescale, topology and size distributions
of the ionized region.
In the current work we extend and improve this method by includ-"
"ing an empirical stochastic subgrid gas clumping (SC) model (see
¬ß2.3) based on the results from high-resolution N-body simulation,
where the full range of relevant fluctuations is fully resolved. Our
approach considers a novel parametrization of the correlation be-
tween local IGM overdensity and clumping factor, which take into
accounts the scatter due to e.g. tidal forces. We employ a high res-
olution N-body simulation SB, of spatial resolution 260 pc per side,
that resolve the Jeans length of the cold IGM and structure evolu-
tion on scale much smaller then the resolution of EoR simulations.
The density-binned scatter is then modelled with a log-normal dis-
tribution. Those distributions are then randomly sampled to create
a realization of the scatter. We then apply our method to the den-
sity fields of larger volumes LB-1 (714 cMpc per side) and LB-2
(349 Mpc) to infer its sub-grid clumping factor (see ¬ß2.4). Subse-
quently we post-process the large scale N-body snapshot with C2Ray
radiative transfer cosmic reionization simulation code, in order to
present the impact of various modeling approaches for gas clumping"
"MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì17 (2021)"

"on reionization observables (see ¬ß3).We then compare our stochastic
model SC with the inhomogeneous clumping model, IC, which is a
simple deterministic density-dependent fit, and a globally redshift
dependent averaged clumping factor BHC, whereby the subgrid gas
clumping is independent of the local density.
We find that density-dependent clumping models, IC and SC, ex-"
"hibit similar behaviour for globally averaged quantities, meanwhile
there is a tangible difference when compared to the volume-averaged
model BHC. For instance, the reionization history (Figure 4) is de-
layed by as much as Œîz ‚àº 0.3 at xi = 0.7 (z ‚àº 7.5) and the average
neutral fraction decrease swiftly for z < 10. The evolution of ionized
regions in IC and SC models is a bit faster due to the on average
lower gas clumping factor that decreases gas recombination in the
under-dense regions. Meanwhile, as structure formation advance, the
higher clumping factor C > 20 in high-density regions considerably
increase the recombination rate, such that recombination is twice
as effective as in the BHC model case for z < 12. We find that
the increase of rate in these regions, due to the different density-
dependent gas clumping approach, is responsible for the divergence
in the simulated observables. Despite the fact that the over-dense
medium constitute a minor fraction of the box volume, compared to
the vast under-dense IGM, it is responsible for the majority of recom-
binations. Our model and the IC method behave similarly, with only
5% of relative error to each other. This difference is mainly due to the
broad scatter at high density in the clumping-density correlation plot
(Figure 2). The clumping factor for IGM in the proximity of sources,
is extremely high C ‚àº 100 and the introduced stochasticy can extend
it to a factor of few hundreds more. Moreover, the simulated electron
scattering optical depth is very similar in IC and SC models and the
choice of the clumping model has little effect on the feedback of
sources.
The density-dependence of the subgrid gas clumping accelerates"
"the propagation of ionizing fronts in the low density IGM (Figure 12),
By z < 10 (aobs > 130MHz) the regions with low 21-cm signal
around the sources are more pronounced than in the BHC case. The
differences between the new stochastic approach and the IC model
are minor, mostly appearing at late times (ùëß < 7, aùëúùëèùë† > 175),
where the SC scenario presents considerably less residual neutral
gas then the other two models. These last region of neutral gas are
mostly in large voids and distant from any ionizing sources, therefore
our interpretation is that at lower redshift the empirical stochastic
model becomes predominant in under-dense IGM, accelerating the
propagation of ionizing radiation in these regions. Meanwhile, at
early stages of reionization the gas recombination in high density
region drives the reionization process, resulting in reduction of the
ionizing photons propagating into the neutral surroundings.
We compared the simulation-derived observables at the same"
"reionization milestones, xi = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9. Compared to
our previous work, the bubble-size distributions (based on both mean
free path and FOF methods) do not show large variation, as an indi-
cation that the SC model does not increase the recombination rate in
a way that significantly alters the morphology and sizes of the ion-
ized regions. The same conclusion can be deduced from statistics of
the 21-cm differential brightness temperature. As we demonstrated
in Paper I, the density-dependent model increase the amplitude and
shift the fluctuations peak position to lower frequency with a differ-
ence of approximately 20MHz compared to BHC model, and just a
few MHz of difference when compared to the SC model. Hence, the
peak occurs at stage of reionization that differ only of few percentage
xÃÑn ‚âà 0.3 for SC and IC models and 0.25 for BHC.
The PDFs of the redshifted 21-cm distributions show some notable"
differences between our models. While all distributions are non-
"Gaussian, the IC and SC yield significantly more non-Gaussianity,
with long tail of bright pixels, which is very different from the BHC
model. The bright tail is longer for the SC model compared to IC,
predicting many more and brighter pixels at all redshifts.
The power spectra of the 21-cm signal (see Figure 15) show that in"
"early phase of reionization, the BHC scenario yields a weaker signal,
when compared to density dependent models on all scales. IC and SC
differ somewhat at large scale k < 0.1 cMpc‚àí1 for ùë•)ùëñ = 0.3 ‚àí 0.5.
This largely disappears by xÃÑi = 0.7. Towards the final stages of
reionization (ùë•ùëñ = 99%) results for three models differ. The IC model
predicts the highest signal at all scales, higher by a feactor of a few
compared to SC. The BHC model signal is intermediate between
them for most except the smallest scales.
The results presented here are not intended as a detailed predic-"
"tion of the reionization observables, but rather a demonstration that
an over-simplistic treatment of the clumping factor can have strong
effect on the reionization morphology and thus on simulated observ-
ables. The widely-used BHC model, overestimates the rate at which
the ionized IGM recombines, and therefore have a strong influence
on the timescale of reionization, morphology of the ionized region
and the intensity of the expected 21-cm signal. We demonstrated that
density dependentmodel takes better account the cumulative effect of
the clumping factor on the gas recombination rate. On the other hand,
we have also shown that accounting for the scatter around the aver-
age, deterministic local density-clumping relation has only modest
effects on the reionization morphology and observables, predomi-
nantly towards the end of the reionization process. This indicates
that the deterministic IC model is usually sufficient except possibly
around and after overlap.
The gas clumping factors presented here should be considered as"
"an upper limit to the actual clumping since they are derived based
on high-resolution N-body simulations and thus do not capture the
photo-ionization feedback that would suppress small-scale density
fluctuations. Consequently it overestimates the recombination rate
throughout reionization. We leave a more realistic approach, that
follows the feedback effects, and the complex physics of the cold gas
(T < 104 K) in IGM, for future work."

APPENDIX A: COMPARISON BETWEEN OLD AND NEW
"In the N-body simulations used in our Paper I (Mao et al. 2019), we
employed the version 1 of the CUBEP3M code, the most recent version
of the code at the time. Meanwhile in this paper we employed the
updated version 2 of that code, that reduces the error of the near-
grid point interpolation by extending the particle-particle (PP) force
calculation for a particle out to arbitrary number of cells. With the
latest version, the user can therefore choose how far outside the
hosting cell the PP-force is active. A detailed discussion of this
update can be found in ¬ß7.3 of Harnois-D√©raps et al. (2013).
As an illustration of the effect of that change, in FigureA1,we show"
"the ICmodel of the correlation between coarse IGM over-density and
coarse clumping factor at z = 7.305 for the SB simulation. In red, the
interpolation obtained from N-body simulation run with first version
of the code, in blue, the updated code with PP-force that extend for 2
neighbour cells. In both cases, we kept the same cosmology, initial
condition and simulation parameters. In the lower panel of the figure,
we show the ratio between the two old and the new result. The result
of thismore precise gravity forces calculation is that the gas clumping
is somewhat boosted, while the curve retains the same shape, which
has no significant effect on our method and results."
