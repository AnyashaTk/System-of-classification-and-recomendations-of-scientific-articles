"Abstract. The payload of the Faint Intergalactic Redshifted Emission Balloon (FIREBall-2), the second generation of the
FIREBall instrument (PI: C. Martin, Caltech), has been calibrated and launched from the NASA Columbia Scientific Balloon
Facility (CSBF) in Fort Sumner, NM. FIREBall-2 was launched for the first time on the 22nd September 2018, and the payload
performed the very first multi-object acquisition from space using a multi-object slit spectrograph (MOS). This performance-
oriented paper presents the calibration and last ground adjustments of FIREBall-2, the in-flight performance assessed based on the
flight data, and the predicted instrument’s ultimate sensitivity. This analysis predicts that future flights of FIREBall-2 should be
able to detect the HI Lyα resonance line in galaxies at z ∼ 0.67, but will find it challenging to spatially resolve the circumgalactic
medium (CGM)."

1 INTRODUCTION
"The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a critical
role in the evolution of galaxy discs, as it hosts im-
portant mechanisms regulating their replenishment
through inflows and outflows.1 Directly mapping the
HI Lyman alpha (Lyα) emission from circumgalactic
gas at high redshifts (z > 2) is an insightful alterna-
tive to absorption spectroscopy, providing a new per-
spective with a complete 2-D or 3-D mapping of the
gas distribution.2–7 Its importance notwithstanding,
emission data are very scarce in the 10-billion-year
span from z ∼ 2 to the present because of the diffi-
culties inherent to vacuum UV observations."
"The FIREBall-2 instrument, jointly funded by
CNES and NASA, has been developed to help fill this
gap and pave the way for future orbital projects. It
has been optimized to provide a bi-dimensional (x, λ)
map of the extremely faint diffuse Lyα HI emission
in the CGM at z ∼ 0.7 and can to observe around 200
targets in a single night’s flight."
"FIREBall-2 is designed to have a wide field of
view (FOV) of 20.5x37 arcmin2, a sharp angular res-"
"olution of ∼ 6 arcsec FWHM and a resolving power
of ∼ 1500 for a diffuse object. Given these in-
strument design choices, FIREBall-2 has the capa-
bility to make direct measurements and set statisti-
cal constraints on the mass, distribution and velocity
of multi-phase gas in the CGM. FIREBall-2 targets
multi-object high-resolution spectra in order to simul-
taneously address the following science goals: mea-
suring the total energy budget of the CGM, studying
the gas distribution in galaxy halos as a function of
galaxy type, constraining inflow and outflow mech-
anisms, deriving budgets for the exchange of mass,
metals, and energy between galaxies and their sur-
roundings, as well as many other applications."
"The instrument is a balloon-borne one-meter tele-
scope coupled to a UV multi-object spectrograph
(MOS) designed to image the CGM in emission. Its
goal is to target the Lyα line redshifted in the strato-
spheric balloon flight’s spectral window near 200 nm
for the universe at z ∼ 0.7."
"The overall science requirements set ambitious
technical goals within a budget of a stratospheric pro-"
"gram in terms of detector, optics, and guidance. The
instrument design choices along with their technical
rationale are summarized in Table ??."
"In this paper, we describe the end-to-end
ground calibration and in-flight performance of the
FIREBall-2 instrument. In Section 2 we describe the
instrument design and summarize the last ground ad-
justements of FIREBall-2. The reduction pipeline of
the flight data is described in Section 3 and the in-
flight performance assessed based on the available
flight data is described in Section 4. As FIREBall-
2 has been funded for two other flights, we will ex-
plore in Section 5 the extrapolated instrument’s opti-
mal sensitivity based on flight and post-flight data."
2 Instrument overview and calibration
2.1 FIREBall-2 design summary
"The FIREBall-2 gondola has a height of ∼ 5 meters
hand a weight of ∼ 2.3 metric tons (including the
500-kg ballast).8 This payload is designed to reach
an altitude of 35 km attached to a stratospheric bal-
loon filled with 1.1 million cubic meters of helium.
Because the atmosphere absorbs most of the UV light
coming from the cosmos, the FIREBall spectrograph
has been optimized to operate in the narrow atmo-
spheric transmission window around 2000 Å where
there is a dip in the atmospheric UV absorption above
35 km.9 The nominal UV band-pass for this win-
dow (1990 - 2130 Å) transmits nearly half of the
incident UV light and the residual continuum atmo-
spheric background is comparable to or lower than
the extragalactic UV background. Within this atmo-
spheric window, there is a contaminating emission
band between 2044 - 2062 Å from NO-δ, which is
emitted at altitudes well above that of the balloon, but
the zodiacal contribution is negligible.10 The typical
atmospheric transmission is 50% when the balloon is
at float altitude and the pointing has an elevation of
50◦. In the subsequent modeling, we have assumed
a total sky background (extragalactic + atmospheric)
of 500 continuum units1."
"The optical design of FIREBall-2 relies on a low-
inertia 1.2-meter sidereostat mounted on a controlled
gimbal system that stabilizes the reflected beam in
the gondola’s frame and directs it to a fixed f/2.5
paraboloid that in turn focuses it at the entrance of"
"the f/2.5 instrument (see Figure 1). The object se-
lection is achieved with a series of pre-installed pre-
cision slit mask systems that also feed the guider cam-
era (see Figure 2). The detector is a Teledyne-e2v
electron multiplying CCD (EMCCD) anti-reflection-
coated and delta-doped by the Jet Propulsion Labora-
tory (JPL)11 and Caltech."
"The one-meter telescope shows very good per-
formance at a cost compatible with suborbital
programs achieved by using an innovative thin
mirror/hierarchical-kinematic support and telescope
pointing control.12 The telescope is mounted on a
low-mass gondola made of aluminum and carbon-
fiber. This gondola provides four-axis guidance (a
coarse azimuth control for the gondola to face the
field, fine elevation and cross-elevation to target the
exact center of the field despite gondola pendulum,
and field rotation) over a range of 40 - 70 degrees in
elevation. During the 2018 flight, in degraded condi-
tions (see Section 3.1), the pointing stability perfor-
mance on each axis was ∼ 0.5 arcsec."
"Inside the tank, The narrow field of view of
the parabola alone is extended to ∼ 800 arcmin2
by a Schwartzchild-type two-mirror field corrector
f/2.5 − f/2.5 (Figure 1). The corrector is designed
to introduce a field curvature that cancels the native
curvature of the Schmidt-based spectrograph to pro-
duce a flat focal surface at the detector. The slits
masks of the spectograph have been fabricated at the
same curvature and are mounted on a rotation stage.
The spectrograph itself consists of identical f/2.5
Schmidt collimator and camera mirrors, the aspheric
correction being provided by the 2400 g/mm reflec-
tion grating obtained by double replication of a de-
formable matrix using the Lemaitre method.13 Flat
folding mirrors are used to reduce the volume of the
vacuum tank in which all the optics and detector are
encased. The Invar spectrograph structure and the Ze-
rodur (TM) low-expansion glass make the instrument
robust against temperature changes. A layout of the
overall payload and the instrument are respectively
presented in Figure 1."
"In addition to the science objectives described
in the introduction, the flight of the FIREBall-2 in-
strument also validated many processes and state-of-
the-art hardware components (UV EMCCD,14 CNES"

it is rotated of about 180 degrees along the z axis compared to the left side in order to improve the visualization of the different
components. During flight this equipment is in a vacuum tank kept at ∼ 10−6 mB by cryopumping and cryosorbtion at ∼ 100K
which reduces heat losses in the detector cooling chain by minimizing ice trapping, and cools the detector near 170K. The whole
vacuum tank is placed on tip-tilt actuators in order to control the focus and centering during the flight."
"pointing system,15 cooling system, large UV aspheri-
cal grating13)."
2.2 Main ground alignment
"The FIREBall-2 instrument complexity and the in-
tricacy of its sub-components require a hierarchic
adjustment and calibration procedure. An especially
demanding specification is the absolute guidance to
1 arcsec (∼ 1/6 slit width) during the ∼ 2 hours of
observation per field. This goal is made still more
challenging by the slight mask-to-mask shape differ-
ences (see section 2.1) that require a mask-dependent
calibration."
"The optical fine adjustment procedure has been
split into two major blocks, each containing several
alignment procedures."
2.2.1 Internal Adjustments
"This section details the 5 steps required to align all
subsystems inside the tank (sequentially: masks in
the mask wheel → mask wheel in the guider system
→ guider system, spectrograph, FC, and detector on
their bench) and place them at their nominal position
in the medium bench mechanical reference (see Fig-
ure 1 right)."
"1. Relative positioning of masks to their nom-
inal location with metrology feedback and it-
erative shimming. The final measurements us-
ing a contactless STIL distance chromatic sen-
sor shows that all of the science masks are con-
focal within less than ±50 microns."
"2. Positioning of the mask wheel at a location
that ensures the right platescale with Faro Arm
feedback."
"3. Spectrograph and Focal corrector alignment
performed with Faro Arm feedback using a me-
chanical reference on the medium bench. From
now on the spectograph and focal corrector as-
sembly will be designated as the instrument
(Figure 1)."
"4. Centering and focus of the guider. The fidu-
cial on the guider mask is conjugated with the
guider camera (see Figure 2). Illuminated with
visible light, this fiducial is positioned at the
central pixel of the guider camera."
"5. Detector focusing with feedback from full-
field analysis of the resolution of the UV spec-
tra of a Zn emission line lamp produced by
a full-pupil diffuse illumination of the science
and calibration masks. To infer the position of
the focal plane, a tilted calibration mask that
crosses the focus in both directions has been
used initially and then refined directly on each
science field image. The final detector focus
has been optimized to balance the image qual-
ity in the four science fields, so that the residual
defocus is that generated by the scatter of the
mask positioning (∼ 25µm rms)."
2.2.2 Full instrument alignment
"This four-axis conjugation (two axis-centering oper-
ations and two tip-tilts) aims at aligning the instru-
ment (spectrograph + FC) with the well aligned (steps
2 and 3 below) paraboloid and siderostat. After the
instrument is aligned and centered on the paraboloid
axis, a final through focus is to be achieved in flight
to compensate for thermoelastic deformations. The
ground conjugation is achieved in four steps:"
"1. Centering the instrument (tank) on its plat-
form at the middle of its tip-tilt actuators, floor
translation ranges and nominal elevation shims
in order to have margin for the final alignment.
We place a mirror on the upper part of the fo-
cal corrector assembly (called FC mirror in the
next steps)."
"2. Aligning the parabola (centering and align-
ment respectively at ∼ 1 mm and ∼ 0.2 de-
gree precision) with the FC mirror by adding an"
"orthogonal laser centered in the parabola hole.
Center direct and reflected laser spots at the
instrument top ensures the parabola has been
roughly set with its axis close to that of the in-
strument."
"3. Finding the values of the sidereostat tip-tilt
encoder position where it is orthogonal to the
parabola axis (autocollimation). A movable
f/2.5 visible light upwards source is placed
near the parabola focal point and adjusted along
with the sidereostat orientation to minimize the
coma of the return image. A byproduct of this
operation is a good indication of the focal point
location."
"4. Final and accurate centering of the instru-
ment. The siderostat is set to autocollimation
position (cf 3) and the mask is illuminated with
visible light. The tip tilt ficus mechanism is ad-
justed to superimpose in the guider the direct
and returned images of the illuminated mask."
2.2.3 Guider mapping and alignment
"Such a balloon-borne multi-object spectrograph is at
the limit of complexity of what can be calibrated at
a launch base with extremely limited ground support
equipment (GSE). It requires very demanding plate-
scale verification (∼ 0.5%) and absolute X-Y in-flight
positioning (∼ 1′′) of the targets because their masks
must be cut before the launch. Indeed, a major chal-
lenge of the FIREBall-2 project was to develop a
100% self-consistent method that does not require any
GSE for all of the pre-flight adjustments and calibra-
tion of a space facility. To this end, an invaluable
asset of FIREBall-2 is its siderostat, which provides a
full-pupil autocollimation capability 2."
"The goal of the XY calibration is to calibrate the
science mask centering relative to the guider, and
determine on which exact pixels in the guider the
guide stars should be placed to ensure that each target
UV light is well centered into the 6-arcsecond slits
(∼ 80µm). This must be achieved at arcsecond pre-
cision, which prevents the use of a collimator much
smaller than the primary mirror because the residual
aberrations would bias the calibration."
"2This is made possible by a good enough atmospheric transmission at 200 nm up to distances of a few tens meters at ground
level."
"Fig 2 Left: Mask-Guider-System (MGS) description scheme. The guider mask is a reflecting mirror, just above the science
maks,with holes at the target locations to let the light enter the spectrograph. The guiding specification is 1 arcsec rms per axis for
X and Y, but the hanging ground test on a bench simulating the complete flight chain have achieved a few tenth of arc-seconds.15"
"The 3rd guidance axis is provided by a rotating stage moving the complete payload guided to 1 arcmin so that its contribution to the
image is small. Right: Each mask unit, consisting of a guider mask attached to a science mask, is mounted on a rotating carousel
and confocal within ±50µm. Dotted lines represent light from guide stars which are reflected, the solid lines are target galaxies,
which pass through the slit mask."
"To this end, the full-pupil autocollimation (see
Figure 3) mode has been used extensively in this cal-
ibration in order to avoid sub-pupil effects on im-
age quality. The siderostat encoders are first cali-
brated against star images acquired with the guider
at ∼ 0.2% accuracy. Note that this calibration is in-
dependent of the guider distortion. Then by putting
a fiber illuminated by a Zn lamp (emission lines at
λ = 202.61371 nm, 206.26604 nm, 213.92635 nm un-
der vacuum) at the focal plane of the 1-m paraboloid
(facing up) and by moving the siderostat, we are able
to perform any desired angular move of the observed
spot anywhere in the UV detector plane (without a
mask) and the guider plane (for each mask), indepen-
dently of the dispersion."
"This capability is used to attach the pixel position
of the guider stars to the targets position in the sky.
A detailed description of this method is beyond the
scope of this paper."
2.2.4 Focusing
"The autocollimation mode has also been used to
achieve and assess a 5-arcsecond image quality over"
"the 0.6-degree UV FOV using the full f/2.5 aperture
ratio to maximize precision."
"Because only the guider images can be used to
focus the instrument while in flight, the calibration
procedure has provided the offset between the guide
stars focus in visible light in the guider, and that of
the targets in UV at the spectrograph detector. To this
end, series of throughfocus have been performed at
different positions in the field with the same setup as
in 2.2.3. In flight, the best UV focus is thus reached
by setting the instrument to the calibrated defocus of
the guide stars."
2.3 Pre-flight performance
2.3.1 Instrument resolution
Spectral resolution
"The spectrograph spectral and angular PSF were
measured before the instrument integration. This was
performed using an holographic UV diffuser covering
the whole UV field with an f/2.5 aperture and fed by
a Zn emission line lamp. The diffuser was set near the"
"Fig 3 Left: FIREBall-2 instrument in full-pupil autocollimation mode. Right: Zoom on the actuated part. Moving the siderostat
actuators with high accuracy (black arrow) allows to move the image of the fiber (red dot on the siderostat focal plane) all over the
detector plane while staying in full-pupil illumination, which is necessary to avoid sub-pupil effects that would improve artificially
the point spread function (PSF) of the large optics."
"focal surface at the payload entrance and was found
to provide a uniform illumination to netter better than
a factor 2. It illuminates in turn each science mask
so that the image at the detector shows well separated
images of the three UV Zn lines over the whole field.
The detector was then shimmed iteratively to analyze
the evolution of the PSF at three wavelength (2.2.3)
with the focus. After integration, the spectrograph
resolution was re-evaluated for each science mask
by applying simple de-convolution algorithms. This
technique measures both the dimensions of the slits
and the resolution of spectrograph. The results for
each mask are shown in Figure 4. For a point source
object the spectral resolution of the spectrograph is
found to be ∼ 0.5 Å FWHM (R ∼ 2800λ/dλ). As
the PSF at the science mask level is smaller than the
slit’s width, adding quadratically the angular resolu-
tion of the guider, the large optics and the focal cor-
rector (see below) yields to an overall spectral resolu-
tion for a point source object of R ∼ 2000λ/dλ."
"For diffuse objects, the spectral resolution is de-
teriorated by the spectral dimension of the slit. This
leads to a λ/dλ spectral resolution between 1300 and"
"1600 for the two sets of masks, allowing the spectral
separation of components with a velocity difference
larger than 200 km/s. The mean dispersion is found
to be ∼ 608 ± 2 µm/nm in accordance with the ZE-
MAX optical model, which predicts ∼ 606 ± 0.5
µm/nm.16"
"Spatial resolution
The resolution of each subsystem of the instrument
has been evaluated independently using full-pupil il-
lumination and applying a deconvolution algorithm."
"The contribution to the spatial resolution of the
guider, the large optics, the focal corrector, and the
spectrograph are respectively 1.8′′, 1.8′′, 2.4′′, and
2.8′′ FWHM (see Figure 5)."
"The convolution of the different optical sub-
systems yields a FWHM of ∼ 4.5′′. In parallel, end-
to-end images have been taken with a 8-arcsecond-
diameter fiber at the parabola focal plane to illu-
minate the instrument in autocollimation (Figure 3):
the beam reflects off the large optics (twice on the
paraboloid) and then goes through the total payload
(focal corrector and spectrograph). After 2-D decon-"
"Fig 4 Left: Spatial and spectral resolution FWHM of the spectrograph alone for a point source object. For diffuse objects the
spectral resolution must be convolved by the ∼ 1.5 Å slit width. The resolution’s scatter is mostly due to the shape of the masks.
As the slits are located between the focal corrector and the spectrograph where the focal plane is spherical, the slits have been cut
on a sphere. Some masks depart slightly from this nominal sphere which generates a slight defocus across the field of view. Right:
Slits’ spatial and spectral dimensions for the four science masks. Two sets of masks are apparent, corresponding to a manufacturing
with a different laser cutting setup."
"volution of the fiber disk, the image at the detector
level predicts an overall spatial resolution of ∼ 4.9′′
FWHM, which is a conservative measurement as it
implies a double pass on the paraboloid and because
the fiber was not yet optimally at the center of the
FOV. Due to mechanical deformations and in-flight
defocus, we expect a small ground-to-flight image de-
terioration: the science masks’ Z position are known
with an accuracy of ∼ 50 µm, which generates a 1′′
FWHM degradation (tested under ZEMAX)."
"Fig 5 Contribution of the different subsystems to the FWHM
spatial resolution in arcseconds (black lines). The degradation
due to the pixels’ size (∼ 1.1′′/pix) is negligible and taken into
account in the resolution measurement performed on the flight-
detector images. The conservative end-to-end measurement in
autocollimation is plotted in red. The final prediction of the in-
strument in-flight resolution is plotted in orange and the flight
value in red."
2.3.2 Throughput and optics’ transmission
"A key optical component of the FIREBall-2 spectro-
graph design is the high- throughput cost-effective,
holographic 2400 l/mm, 110x130 mm2 aspherized re-
flective grating used in the range 199 - 213 nm, near
the 28◦ deviation angle.17"
"The throughput of the overall instrument is mea-
sured by comparing input and output fluxes with a
solar blind CsTe photocathode cell from ITT, which
gives a 17% efficiency for the instrument alone."
"The total FIREBall-2 throughput is found to be
11% (large optics: 65%, instrument: 17%).3 This is
a factor of 6 above what has been observed in flight
for FIREBall-1.18, 19 This has been achieved despite
the more complex optics required to correct the larger
field of view and double the angular resolution for
this new generation of the FIREBall instrument. The
throughput gain results from the 55% efficiency at
204 nm of the FIREBall-2 grating (versus 32%) and
from the large losses in the FIREBall-1 fibers. The
additional gain of a factor 6 on the detector quantum
efficiency combined with the above and the improved
guidance provides an order of magnitude gain in faint
source detection efficiency to FIREBall-2."
"3Vignetting is included, detector quantum efficiency is not."
3 2018 Flight and data processing
3.1 Flight
"FIREBAll-2 was launched on a 1.1-million-cubic-
meters balloon from the Fort Sumner Columbia Sci-
entific Balloon Facility on September 22nd at 10:20
AM local MDT. The flight sequence is detailed in
Hamden et al. (2020).8"
"After ∼ 3 hours of ascent and ∼ 3 hours at float
altitude, the balloon began to lose altitude around sun-
set, most likely due to a hole in the balloon. Because
of this anomaly, the balloon dropped to its minimal
mission requirement altitude after 45 minutes of sci-
ence acquisition instead of the > 6h required. Bal-
loon altitude is important for science as between 30
and 40 km altitude, each km of altitude loss repre-
sents a reduction of transmission of ∼ 5%."
"In addition, weather constraints resulted in a
launch the day before a full moon (moon 94% per-
cent full during the flight). The deshape of the bal-
loon due to the balloon’s deflation also impacted sci-
ence data by concentrating a specular reflection of the
moonlight over the balloon directly at the entrance of
the payload. This boosted our background levels by
> 1000 times what was expected. The resulting scat-
tered light produced ∼ 1 event/pix/50s frame back-
ground, nearly an order of magnitude too high to effi-
ciently perform photon-counting.20"
"Aside from these considerations, almost all sub-
systems performed nominally. Some flight anomalies
are detailed in Hamden et al. (2020)8 as well as the
four fields observed. In order to focus on the instru-
ment performance, we will only detail the reduction
and analysis of the first field (DEEP 2: RA=253.06,
DEC=34.97, θ = 20◦) when the instrument was at the
nominal altitude."
3.2 DS9 quick-look and reduction pipeline
"In order to analyze flight data in real time, we built a
python FIREBall dedicated DS9 extension similar to
the DS921 Quick Look plugin (https://people.
lam.fr/picouet.vincent/pyds9plugin).
Indeed, DS9 provides easy communication with ex-
ternal analysis tasks and is extensible via XPA. This
extension was designed for real time processing in
order to support in-flight decisions as well as assem-
bly, integration and tests (AIT). During the flight it"
"was mostly used for cosmic ray (CR) removal, back-
ground subtraction, help with object recognition, and
stacking."
"This extension proved its worth during the AIT
and the flight, so the same DS9-oriented method was
used to design the entire reduction pipeline to process
data after the flight. This extension is divided into
three main parts, each of which fills a specific need:"
"AIT: Supports assembly, integration, and test. This
include throughfocus and through-slit visual-
ization and analysis, XY calibration analysis,
radial and encircled energy profiles, etc."
"Flight reduction pipeline: Contains every part of
the flight data processing: Cosmic ray removal,
over-scan correction, background subtraction,
photon-counting processes, and image/object
stacking."
"Detector: Supports EMCCD characterization prior
to and after the flight: gain computation from
fluctuation analysis or histogram fitting, com-
putation of the different noise sources ( clock-
induced charges (CIC), read-out noise, etc.)
and other tests: auto-correlation, column-line
correlation, smearing analysis, etc."
3.3 Data processing
3.3.1 Cosmic ray removal
"Cosmic rays and other high-energy particles from
outer space produce spurious features when hitting
the detector. These random and unavoidable events
generate spikes that are amplified in EMCCDs like
any other photo-electron. Each impact creates a “tail”
in the direction of charge transfer due to deferred and
overspill charge in the serial multiplication register.
The tail of the impact is highly dependent on the par-
ticle’s energy. We note that each event profile on the
detector has unique properties that might also depend
on other characteristics, e.g., the integration time, the
electron multiplication (EM) gain (and thus the de-
gree of saturation in the high-gain register), the angle
of the impact, etc."
"In order to identify and remove cosmic rays’ peak
and tail in the EMCCD images, we implemented in
the DS9 extension a detection, identification, and re-
moval algorithm. Detection is quite simple as any im-
pact saturates at least one pixel on the device. The"
"https://people.lam.fr/picouet.vincent/pyds9plugin
https://people.lam.fr/picouet.vincent/pyds9plugin"
"
algorithm is based on a marching square code that
creates isolevels isolating cosmic ray impacts. It in-
corporates a basic but efficient classification code in
order to apply a more or less important mask depend-
ing on the particle energy."
"As we can detect up to 1000 cosmic rays in a
100-second exposure, we had to optimize the speed
performance of the detection/masking algorithm. Af-
ter optimization, the process takes approximately 20
ms/impact on a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 processor."
"We calculate a rate of ∼ 2.4 particles · cm−2·
sec−1 in flight at 30-km altitude compared to ∼
0.05 particles · cm−2· sec−1 on ground for the same
CCD201 (13-µm pixel pitch) setup. Between 26 and
33 km above the ground, we find a small increase of
the impact rate with altitude of about +1% per kilo-
meter."
"These cosmic rays generate important signal-to-
noise loss that affects about 0.05% of the image per
impact. On the 50-s exposure science frames, this
represents 25% of data that must be masked in order
to be fully conservative. This is equivalent to reduc-
ing the number of effective images by 25%, which
prevents FIREBall-2 from capturing images with too
long of an exposure time. In this respect, this con-
straint will be used in order to estimate optimum
single-frame integration time, currently estimated to
be ∼ 30 − 80s in order to maximize the signal-to-
noise-ratio (SNR) (see section 5.2)."
3.3.2 Systematics contribution removal
"Before further processing, we need to remove system-
atic contributions in the EMCCD, especially account
for the non-uniformity of the bias, and line-to-line
and column-to-column variations."
"The line-to-line variations seem to come from re-
maining charges in the serial amplifier or poor ampli-
fication register clearance that do not always empty it
to the same level. Because of a higher charge transfer
inefficiency for these highly saturated events, some
cosmic ray tails can continue on the left over-scan re-
gion4. Because of this, to estimate the bias level on
each line, we take the median value of the left part of
the right over-scan region (between column 2200 and
2400), just after charges have been cleared out from"
"the serial register. This prevents including in the bias
any background contribution in the spectral direction."
"We then correct the column to column variation
by subtracting for each column its median value.
Then the corrected value of the pixel in row i and col-
umn j is:"
"pcorri,j = pi,j − ˜p2200<·<2400,j − ˜pi,0<·<2069"
"The dot in the index is a placeholder to indicate
whether the mean was taken over rows or columns.
We then use this notation ˜pn1<·<n2,j for the median
value of the jth line between column n1 and column
n2."
"Note that the subtraction of the column medians
in flight images with background does not remove the
potential detections, as they overlap only a few lines
and are completely washed out in the subtracted me-
dians. In addition, the signal coming from the sky and
reflections in the instrument, and even more its series
of vertical medians, has only low spatial frequency
components, which do not affect our potential detec-
tions expected over only a few pixels."
3.3.3 Background subtraction
"The moon’s light reflected on the balloon (see Sec-
tion 3.1) creates high sky background count rates of
2×106 Line Units (LU) 5 for diffuse reflection, which
is more than 2 orders of magnitude greater than what
was expected."
"In addition, at very specific azimuth angle dif-
ferences between the instrument, the moon, and the
balloon, reflective parts in the instrument are illumi-
nated, increasing the parasitic light 10 times higher
than the diffuse reflection."
"Since the detector is not solar blind and we do not
see any correlation between the background intensity
and the altitude over a factor 5 in atmospheric trans-
mission, we infer that the background comes mostly
from visible light leaks. Post-flight accurate scatter-
ing analysis shows that the incoming light from the
balloon was not following the nominal optical path
but was reflecting from different mechanical compo-
nents inside the tank."
"4for extremely energetic events (∼ 0.1%) it also appears that the charges of the cosmic rays are not cleared and then continue
over several lines from the left over-scan to the right."
5Line Units : nphoton · s−1 · cm−2 · sr−1
"As the background changes quickly in shape and
intensity between exposures, and since the CR mask-
ing modifies significantly which exposures are re-
tained in the summation for each pixel, the mean
background value varies from pixel to pixel. There-
fore the background must be estimated and removed
individually on each cosmic ray free image."
"Besides this, there is a curved and net boundary
in the image background (see Figure 6). This break,
most probably due to a component shading the bot-
tom part of the detector, makes automatic background
subtraction difficult. In order to handle it, we di-
vide the image in two curved sub-images and perform
background subtraction on each independently."
"The average background level is computed itera-
tively within 40-pixel image bins by clipping out pix-
els at 3σ from the average (maximum 10 iterations)
and taking the median value."
"The low-resolution background image is then
convolved by a 3 × 3 2D median filter and is then
re-sized to the original data size using spline interpo-
lation."
"Because it is negligible compared to the high spu-
rious flight background, we do not need to correct for
dark current (0.08 e−/h/pix on ground)."
3.3.4 Stacking and hot pixel removal
"The images are stacked by taking the mean value at
each pixel position. Indeed as the nominal flux level
we want to detect are lower than 0.5 e−/pixel, taking
the median would throw away important detections."
"However, some hot pixels show up after stacking
the images. Because they have been identified on
ground dark images, and they only spread onto 3-4
pixels in the charge transfer direction, we masked ev-
ery 4 pixels following a hot pixel identified on ground
and interpolate the values of the pixels inside the
mask by applying a 2D σ = 1 pixel gaussian filter."
3.3.5 Flux map generation
"Assessment of the amplification gain
The gain is needed to convert the measured ADU lev-
els to photoelectrons, but careful calibration is re-
quired because of its dependency on detector tem-
perature (∼ 10% per degree at T ∼ −110◦C and
Gamp ∼ 1000 e− / e−). Three methods are usually
used to measure the amplification gain of the detec-
tor:"
"• Unique electron spectrum from a flat field im-
age having a low illumination level of < 1
e−/pix. Looking at the histogram of ADU
values with logarithmic counts, the bias cor-
responds to the mode (most frequent ADU
value), the readout noise to the width of the
parabola around the bias, obtained through a
quadratic fit, and the gain to the slope in the
amplified part (highest values).20 See Figure 7."
"• Fluctuation analysis derived from the slope of
the variance/mean ADU diagram without any
correction. This gain includes the amplification
process and the conversion gain.22"
"• Direct measurement by dividing two images
with and without gain. The input flux must
be as stable as possible and the exposure times
must be different so that we stay far from the
dark level for the non-amplified image and far
from the saturation level for the amplified im-
age."
"Because the two first measurements can be signifi-
cantly impacted if smearing appears in the CCD or in
the amplification registers, the gain in flight has been
post-calibrated on ground using the third method at
the flight temperature. Indeed, during the flight, the
smearing exponential length of ∼ 1 pixel drastically
affects the amplification gain derivation from two
first methods (∼ 1400 e−/e− →∼ 650e−/e− ). Using
method 3, we retrieve a flight amplification gain of
1370. This gain was corroborated by a complete elec-
tron spectrum model, including a toy linear model of
the smearing effect, that was tested at several illumi-
nation levels."
Fluxes outside atmosphere
"We can then compute the flux in the co-add im-
age:"
"Fe−/pix =
pixADU ×Gconv
Gamp × texp"
"with pixADU being each pixel value in ADU,
Gconv the conversion gain (1.8 e−/pix), Gamp the am-
plification gain (∼ 1370 e−/e−) and texp (50s) the ex-
posure time."
"Fig 6 Field 2 summed images. Left: The summed image before cosmic ray removal. Center: The summed image after cosmic
ray removal. Right: The summed image after cosmic ray removal and subtracting the out-of-band background scattered light. The
sharp drop-off in scattered light on the bottom fifth of the image makes the subtraction difficult, yielding a residual along the edge
of the scattered region. All images have been smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with sigma of 1.5 and a radius of 3 pixels. The
emission from the brightest star, Bright Star 1, is visible in the last two images as a horizontal line roughly in the middle.8"

the throughput of the FIREBall instrument."
4 In-flight performance
4.1 Detection and proof of performance
"The ground-based calibration for absolute pointing
and XY positioning described in Section 3 assumes"
"a stability better than 1 arcsec of the guider-to-mask
relative positioning until the end of the flight, in an
environment 40◦C colder than during the calibration."
"The continua of the three UV-bright GALEX stars
in the science field were detected, with a SNR ∼ 18
for the brightest one (MFUV =17.8). This proves that
the targets were positioned close to their nominal po-
sition, one of the toughest challenges of FIREBall-2.
Flight data do not allow us to access the residual de-
centering between the source and the exact slit center.
Photometric measurements are performed in Section
4.5."
4.2 Guidance performance
"In addition to its impact on the throughput and flight
duration shown in the previous section, the loss of
altitude also impacted the balloon’s (and consequen-
tially the gondola’s) motion because of the varying
wind direction with respect to altitude. This intensi-
fied the different gondola excitation modes, requiring
better damping and causing a decrease in the pointing
performance. Despite that, the pointing performance
stayed well within the technical specification.8"
"Fig 7 Unique electron spectrum. This fitting algorithm from the FIREBall DS9 extension allows fitting and recovering EMCCD
parameters in the absence of smearing. The red line represents the photo-counting threshold used to mitigate the excess noise factor
due to amplification. The dotted black line represents the readout noise. In photon-counting mode, this noise is lowered to the part
above the 5.5σ threshold. As explained in Section 3.3.5, the histogram shape is affected by the smearing that acts exactly as if the
amplification gain was lower (1400e−/e− → 600e−/e−)."
"The in-flight raw guider error signal is found to
be 0.7′′ RMS per axis, an upper limit to the guidance
error, as it includes the guider signal noise and the
field rotation guiding error of∼ 0.3′′ RMS. The latter
number derives from a 1.5 arcmin field rotation 1D
guidance error, and a typical distance guiding stars-
targets of 12 arcminutes.15"
4.3 Image quality
"An in-flight spatial resolution of 7′′ has been derived
from a gaussian fit along the spatial direction of the
GALEX brightest star continuum in the first field. We
are currently working at LAM on improving the fo-
cus of the spectrograph in order to obtain an in-flight
5′′ FWHM angular resolution all over the field for the
upcoming flight in 2021. This is of course a very im-
portant gain in resolution and it would also decrease
all the sources of noise in counts/PSF/hour as the PSF
gets sharper (this is taken into account in Table 3 and
detailed in Section 5.2)."
4.4 Detector performance
"FIREBall-2 incorporates a state-of-the-art 2Kx1K,
13-µm-pixels electron-multiplying CCD 201 from
Teledyne-e2v processed at JPL to increase its UV sen-
sitivity with a delta-doping procedure, which yields a
100% internal quantum efficiency device limited only
by the reflection losses, and a multi-layer antireflec-
tion coating to further enhance external QE.11 The
stochastic nature of the amplification process in EM-
CCDs generates an Excess Noise Factor (ENF="
"√
2 at"
"high gain) that can be removed under certain condi-
tions (Flux << 1e−/pix/exp and Gamp > 10× RN )
by applying a thresholding process known as photon-
counting.20 The different characteristics of the detec-
tor are summarized in Table 2. These state-of-the-art
devices require special parameter tuning in order to
take advantage of their performance, as well as spe-
cific data reduction such as cosmic ray removal or
photon-counting processing."
"The present model of FIREBall-2 detector has
been calibrated on the ground and shows a 55% peak"
"Fig 8 Left Evolution of in-flight fine guiding performance. Right Summary of the 2-axis (elevation and cross-elevation) fine guid-
ance errors in closed loop on Field 2 during the ∼ 1-hour observation. Data corresponding to ballast drops has been excluded. The
1D probability density histograms are fit with a 1D gaussian, which we use to measure the 1σ errors in the 1D distribution (vertical
lines). The 2D distribution in the center is interpolated with a gaussian kernel density estimation. The 1σ contour here corresponds
to 0.39 arcsec−2. FIREBall-2 achieves a (1σ) pointing of ±0.5 arcsec in elevation and ±0.71 arcsecond in cross-elevation (Melso
et al, in prep.) ."
"efficiency in the nominal UV instrument bandpass
and > 50% in the entire bandpass. This value is com-
pared to flight data in Section 4.5. The detector per-
formance is detailed further in Kyne et al. (2020).14"
"Relevant to the present analysis, the detector
shows sub-optimal charge transfer efficiency (CTE)
due to the unusually low temperature selected to min-
imize the dark current. We think this can be improved
by further optimization of the controller/parameter
tradeoff for the next flight."
"At flight temperature, this average CTE induces
a charge smearing that yields a performance simi-
lar to an electron multiplying (EM) gain three times
lower. This increases the noise contribution and
causes event loss when attempting to perform photon-
counting thresholding. This effect combined with
the high background prevented us from using photon-
counting. Smearing inversion algorithms can be ap-
plied, but there is an intrinsic limitation as these in-
versions always generate noise amplification.14"

4.5 2018 flight sensitivity
"The total efficiency was computed based on the
flux measured on Bright Star 1 using a fitting-based"
"photometric algorithm. The measured continuum
was found to be 30% lower than expected from
the ground-based calibration and atmospheric model,
which is well within statistical fluctuations derived
from applying the same photometric algorithm at ran-
dom locations. The main contributors to this un-
certainty are: target centering, photometric measure-
ment, atmospheric transmission model, focus, instru-
ment throughput and detector calibration. In addi-
tion, the photometric measurement on BS1 shows a
decreasing flux during the observation, which result
probably from defocus or target decentering rather
than atmospheric model bias.
No emission line has been detected at a statistically
significant level, neither by searching at the predicted
individual emission line locations, nor by stacking the
target galaxies or a subset of the brightest ones. In or-
der to measure the sensitivity limit for the total Lyα
emission line of a target, we have performed profile
fitting of a 2D gaussian matched to the PSF at random
locations in the image. We avoided areas where tar-
get signal can be expected. The derived 5σ sensitivity
limit for an unresolved z ∼ 0.7 source for the avail-
able 30-min observation is ∼ 1.5 × 1043erg/sec.This
limit is found consistent with a rather simple but quite
complete analytical calculation of the total sensitivity
of the instrument. As can be seen in Figure 7 of Au-
gustin et al. (2019)23 FIREBall-2 is presently lacking
a factor of 3 in sensitivity to constrain the models at
z ∼ 0.7."
"For the diffuse CGM Lyα emission, the
instrument-limiting flux ∼ 7′′ away from a single
object center, using one resolution element on each
side of the central one, translates to a surface bright-
ness detection limit of 1.7× 10−16ergs/cm2/s/arcsec2
(721,000 LU)."
"Limiting flux performance is, of course, lower
than what was expected without the spurious back-
ground but can be used as a starting point for evaluat-
ing the instrument’s ultimate sensitivity."
5 Ultimate sensitivity
"The operational success of the 2018 flight and clear
paths towards correcting the issues that reduced the
sensitivity motivated CNES and NASA to fund the
project for at least one more flight."
5.1 Major improvements for 2021 flight
"Table 3 describes the different sources of noise as ob-
served in 2018 and expected in 2021. It shows that the
major offender to the sensitivity is the high sky level,
mostly due to the moon-scattered light, as discussed
in Section 4.1. Because of the very short turnover
wind period, launch opportunities are scarce and can
occur very close to the full moon, as it happened in
2018. A launch far from full moon phase will always
be preferable, but stray light mitigation has to be suf-
ficient so that even in the worst scenario, sky noise
would not impact FIREBall-2’s performance.24"
"Our simple SNR model shows that to achieve this
goal, it is necessary to cut stray light to the UV detec-
tor by a factor larger than 200. In this case, the sky
background will be less than 3 counts/PSF/hour. Re-
finements of the stray light/off-axis reflections anal-
ysis are on-going but it is already clear that three
baffling stages need to be set up: a gondola top cap
combined with a lower baffle will prevent direct view
of the balloon from the spectrograph entrance (direct
view of the moon was already baffled). It will be
aided by an improved system of baffles internal to the
tank. A more stringent moon-angular-distance limit
and extensive testing of the baffling will ensure in-
specs background in the worst expected conditions."
"We experienced some additional background
noise which we distinguish from the detector dark
noise (Table 3). Indeed, during the flight we observed
a signal, when the shutter is closed, an order of mag-
nitude higher than the ground-based dark at the same
temperature. Even though it is not totally understood,
we think it is not an increased detector dark but rather
a consequence of either Cerenkov emission coming
mostly from the back of the FF2 mirror, a guider cam-
era leak or (less likely) a shutter failure that would
have let∼ 1cm2 of light through. We have decided to
reduce any possible Cerenkov contribution by mask-
ing all the mirrors’ backs and are currently address-
ing the other possible causes. We have also added
more comprehensive baffling around the immediate
detector environment. It is important to stress that the
level of additional background (shutter closed) might
come from other unknown causes as it is the very first
flight of these-state-of-the-art devices (large number
of very low energy cosmic rays or longer than esti-
mated smeared cosmic ray tails)."
"In addition, a new detector system will be used"
"for the next flight. It will equipped with a new ver-
sion of the detector controller (Nüvü v3), developed
specifically by Nüvü Cameras for these EMCCD de-
tectors.14 The expected lower read noise provided
by this controller combined with a slightly higher
temperature should make the photon-counting algo-
rithm more efficient. Data acquired with this new
setup will allow further optimization of the tempera-
ture/smearing/gain parameters in order to increase the
SNR."
"The improvements in the spectrograph alignment
and guidance algorithm also promise an image qual-
ity increase from 7′′ to ∼ 5− 6′′, which improves our
chances of disentangling CGM signal from the galaxy
signal and beginning to spatially-resolve CGM emis-
sion."
5.2 2021 flight predicted sensitivity
"In order to analyze the advantage of using photon-
counting, we compare here two scenarios for the next
flight: with [Counting] or without [Analog] thresh-
olding photon-counting process. We assume a 200-
factor sky reduction and that the additional back-
ground level (as defined in Section 5.1) is mitigated
by a factor of 10. To compute the SNR, we use one
resolution element on each side of the central one for
144 exposures, amounting to 2 hours observing time6."
"The noise contributions for these two cases are re-
ported in Table 3 so that they can be compared with
2018 values."
"In both scenarios, FIREBall-2 appears to be
photon starved: the biggest offender (highest noise
contribution) is the shot noise. In the photon-
counting scenario, stacking 10 targets with similar
galaxy properties/morphologies would decrease the
shot noise to a level comparable to the other noise
sources. This would make the major noise contribu-
tors (CIC, sky, background, shot noise) very similar,
prohibiting any further gain."
"As expected in photon-counting mode, the read
noise contribution becomes much smaller and part of
the CIC noise disappears as the serial CIC is only
amplified by an average gain of 200 instead of 1400
e−/e−. The Noise was computed assuming 30% count
loss and only 85% read noise reduction because of"
"smearing when applying the photon-counting thresh-
olding process. These values are representative of
the expected improvement of the charge transfer ef-
ficiency (CTE) with respect to the 2018 values."
"The fact that, in both scenarios, the detector dark
noise is not dominant might allow for a higher detec-
tor temperature, which would improve its CTE and
facilitate photon-counting."
"For these two 2021 cases, the respective limit-
ing 5σ total Lyα emissions are ∼ 4.3 × 1041 and
5.3 × 1041erg/sec for a ∼ 5′′ unresolved z ∼ 0.7
target. For the diffuse CGM Lyα emission limit
and using the same definition as in Section 4 (with
5′′), the surface brightness detection limits are respec-
tively 1.4×10−17 and 1.8×10−17 ergs/cm2/s/arcsec2
(61,000 LU and 75,000 LU). As we can see, these
limiting fluxes for the two scenarios are very close
despite very different total noise. This is due to
the fact that the high photon-counting threshold used
to mitigate the read noise and the serial CIC, cou-
pled with smearing, generates event loss and there-
fore lowers the total efficiency by ∼ 30%."
"In order to compare FIREBall-2’s performance
with that of the first generation of the instrument,
we gathered in Table 4 the characteristics and per-
formance of FIREBall-1 and 2 for their respective
flights. In Table 4, the sensitivity limit is computed
for 2 hours acquisition on an extended 30′′ object such
as a bright Quasi Stellar Object QSO."
5.3 Comparison with existing observations
"For total flux (unresolved source), according to
GALEX observations and simulations (Figure 7 of
Augustin et al. (2019)23), the ∼ 41.7 log(LLyα) limit
we find for both scenarios in Section 5.2 would be
constraining by an order of magnitude for the Lyα
integrated flux at z ∼ 0.7. Stacking 10 objects per
flight with similar galaxy properties/morphologies,
using a very accurate continuum subtraction, should
decrease this limit to ∼ 41.1."
"Concerning diffuse CGM emission, observations
at higher redshift with MUSE4 revealed some Lyα
haloes at z ∼ 3 reaching 4′′ (∼ 30 kpc) from the
galaxy at their limiting surface brightness of ∼ 10−19"
"6The effect of cosmic ray mentioned in Section 3.3.1 is taken into account. It is important to remind that when stacking over
a long period of time, the SNR does not increase as fast as"
"√
t. We accounted for that with the same 1.4 factor observed between"
50sec and 30min.

"7The discussion in Sullivan et al. (2019)3 suggests that average Lyα surface brightness in the vicinity of QSOs might decrease
with time (study from z ∼ 3 to z ∼ 2)."
"galaxies23 is thus expected to provide a detection sur-
face brightness limit at z ∼ 0.7 comparable to that
of MUSE at z ∼ 3 for individual galaxies. FIRE-
Ball detection of extended emission would thus only
be possible in presence of large spectral offsets due
to strong winds. Because of this, quasars, which have
a brighter and more extended diffuse Lyα emission,
are an even more interesting candidate for the 2021
flight.2"
6 Conclusion
"The 2018 flight of FIREBall-2 performed the first
space multi-object acquisition using a MOS, demon-
strated the successful performance of all subsystems,
and provided a test flight for several key technology
innovations such as the EMCCD,14 the sub-arcsecond
pointing system,15 or the aspherical grating.13 In this
paper, we have described the calibration of the second
generation of the FIREBall instrument and its perfor-
mance."
"FIREBall-2 gained a factor ∼ 10 in sensitivity
compared to the first generation of the instrument
(mostly detector and optical throughput) and now has
the capability to target ∼ 50 galaxies per mask. Un-
fortunately, the very high sky background on the de-
tector due to the near full moon and the punctured bal-
loon reflecting light to a non-baffled instrument part,
combined with a shortened flight, wiped out this effi-
ciency gain. A new baffling of the instrument is be-
ing implemented to mitigate stray light impact. Aside
from this, only minor changes will be performed in
order to launch FIREBall-2 again to minimize risks
and ensure the full benefit of the factor 10 efficiency
gain from generation one."
"The results of the 2018 flight combined with the
ultimate sensitivity analysis validates the instrument
design and its sub-systems. It demonstrates its capa-
bility to make valuable detections of the CGM and
circum quasar medium and to provide critical spatio-
spectral information about the medium surrounding
z ∼ 0.7 galaxies and QSOs. Such information is
currently missing in our search for gas dynamics in
the CGM at intermediate redshifts. FIREBall-2 is
the only UV instrument currently proven and able to
make these necessary discoveries at intermediate red-
shift (0.2< z <2)."
"Once FIREBall-2 puts a constraint on CGM emis-
sion at z ∼ 0.7, it motivates more detailed follow-"
"up with larger-class space missions, as they would fi-
nally know the sensitivity, spatial, and spectral res-
olution constraints required to successfully map this
emission. The implementation of this project is thus
an investment for future orbital projects such as LU-
VOIR or MIDEX-class telescopes (HALO). This ex-
periment, developed in the limited range of the strato-
spheric flights budget, allows both innovation with
higher risk and low cost iterative improvements."

"List of Figures
1 Left: FIREBall-2 optical design layout. For readability, the instrument is shown in the pay-"
"load layout as a flattened, plane optical layout, rather than the compact 3-D design in the real
world. Right: Interior of the FIREBall-2 spectrograph. Note that it is rotated of about 180
degrees along the z axis compared to the left side in order to improve the visualization of the
different components. During flight this equipment is in a vacuum tank kept at∼ 10−6 mB by
cryopumping and cryosorbtion at ∼ 100K which reduces heat losses in the detector cooling
chain by minimizing ice trapping, and cools the detector near 170K. The whole vacuum tank
is placed on tip-tilt actuators in order to control the focus and centering during the flight."
"2 Left: Mask-Guider-System (MGS) description scheme. The guider mask is a reflecting mir-
ror, just above the science maks,with holes at the target locations to let the light enter the
spectrograph. The guiding specification is 1 arcsec rms per axis for X and Y, but the hanging
ground test on a bench simulating the complete flight chain have achieved a few tenth of arc-
seconds.15 The 3rd guidance axis is provided by a rotating stage moving the complete payload
guided to 1 arcmin so that its contribution to the image is small. Right: Each mask unit, con-
sisting of a guider mask attached to a science mask, is mounted on a rotating carousel and
confocal within±50µm. Dotted lines represent light from guide stars which are reflected, the
solid lines are target galaxies, which pass through the slit mask."
"3 Left: FIREBall-2 instrument in full-pupil autocollimation mode. Right: Zoom on the actu-
ated part. Moving the siderostat actuators with high accuracy (black arrow) allows to move
the image of the fiber (red dot on the siderostat focal plane) all over the detector plane while
staying in full-pupil illumination, which is necessary to avoid sub-pupil effects that would
improve artificially the point spread function (PSF) of the large optics."
"4 Left: Spatial and spectral resolution FWHM of the spectrograph alone for a point source
object. For diffuse objects the spectral resolution must be convolved by the ∼ 1.5 Å slit
width. The resolution’s scatter is mostly due to the shape of the masks. As the slits are
located between the focal corrector and the spectrograph where the focal plane is spherical,
the slits have been cut on a sphere. Some masks depart slightly from this nominal sphere
which generates a slight defocus across the field of view. Right: Slits’ spatial and spectral
dimensions for the four science masks. Two sets of masks are apparent, corresponding to a
manufacturing with a different laser cutting setup."
"5 Contribution of the different subsystems to the FWHM spatial resolution in arcseconds (black
lines). The degradation due to the pixels’ size (∼ 1.1′′/pix) is negligible and taken into account
in the resolution measurement performed on the flight-detector images. The conservative end-
to-end measurement in autocollimation is plotted in red. The final prediction of the instrument
in-flight resolution is plotted in orange and the flight value in red."
"6 Field 2 summed images. Left: The summed image before cosmic ray removal. Center:
The summed image after cosmic ray removal. Right: The summed image after cosmic ray
removal and subtracting the out-of-band background scattered light. The sharp drop-off in
scattered light on the bottom fifth of the image makes the subtraction difficult, yielding a
residual along the edge of the scattered region. All images have been smoothed with a Gaus-
sian kernel with sigma of 1.5 and a radius of 3 pixels. The emission from the brightest star,
Bright Star 1, is visible in the last two images as a horizontal line roughly in the middle.8"
"7 Unique electron spectrum. This fitting algorithm from the FIREBall DS9 extension allows
fitting and recovering EMCCD parameters in the absence of smearing. The red line represents
the photo-counting threshold used to mitigate the excess noise factor due to amplification.
The dotted black line represents the readout noise. In photon-counting mode, this noise is
lowered to the part above the 5.5σ threshold. As explained in Section 3.3.5, the histogram
shape is affected by the smearing that acts exactly as if the amplification gain was lower
(1400e−/e− → 600e−/e−)."
"8 Left Evolution of in-flight fine guiding performance. Right Summary of the 2-axis (elevation
and cross-elevation) fine guidance errors in closed loop on Field 2 during the∼ 1-hour obser-
vation. Data corresponding to ballast drops has been excluded. The 1D probability density
histograms are fit with a 1D gaussian, which we use to measure the 1σ errors in the 1D distri-
bution (vertical lines). The 2D distribution in the center is interpolated with a gaussian kernel
density estimation. The 1σ contour here corresponds to 0.39 arcsec−2. FIREBall-2 achieves
a (1σ) pointing of ±0.5 arcsec in elevation and ±0.71 arcsecond in cross-elevation (Melso et
al, in prep.) ."
