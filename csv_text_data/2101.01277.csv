Abstract: exoplanetary science continues to excite and surprise with its rich diversity. We discuss here some key 
aspects potentially influencing the range of exoplanetary terrestrial-type atmospheres which could exist in nature. 
"We are motivated by newly emerging observations, refined approaches to address data degeneracies, improved "
theories for key processes affecting atmospheric evolution and a new generation of atmospheric models which 
couple physical processes from the deep interior through to the exosphere and consider the planetary-star system 
as a whole. Using the Solar System as our guide we first summarize the main processes which sculpt atmospheric 
evolution then discuss their potential interactions in the context of exoplanetary environments.  We summarize 
key uncertainties and consider a diverse range of atmospheric compositions discussing their potential occurrence 
in an exoplanetary context.

"Key words: exoplanetary, atmospheres, diversity, review "
"1. Introduction 
Exoplanetary science at the dawn of the 2020s lies at a fascinating juncture at which the basic "
"atmospheric properties of potentially rocky worlds lying in the habitable zone are already beginning to be 
constrained (see e.g. de Wit et al., 2018 which focused on TRAPPIST-1 planets in the Habitable Zone). Earlier 
works such as Forget and Leconte (2014) have discussed the potential diversity of exoplanetary atmospheres. 
Some new aspects were recently summarized by Jontof-Hutter (2019) and Madhusudhan (2019). Tinetti et al., 
(2018) summarized a chemical survey of exoplanets with the Atmospheric Remote-Sensing Infrared Exoplanet 
Large-Survey (ARIEL) mission. In the present review we highlight some recent aspects relevant for potential 
exoplanetary diversity for terrestrial-type exoplanets up to ~10 Earth masses. It is beyond the scope of our work 
however to review all aspects of this rapidly developing field. "
"There are numerous developments which motivate our review. First, improved mass-radius data for 
cooler mini gas planets and super-Earths (see e.g. Fulton et al., 2017; Fulton and Petigura, 2018; Weiss and Marcy, 
2014) are confirming that exoplanetary mass can vary over several orders of magnitude for a given radius 
whereas radius can vary by up to a factor of ~4 for a given mass.  Small planets are being found which lie above 
the pure water composition line in the mass radius diagram - which suggests they have atmospheres. Emerging 
measurements are providing initial observational constraints for the atmospheres of hot Super Earths. Such new 
data is providing first hints of atmospheric diversity and is driving emerging strategies for addressing the 
challenging degeneracies involved as discussed in e.g. Dorn et al. (2017) and Dorn and Heng (2018). Second, 
progress in detection methods has been made for several atmospheric species. These include theoretical studies 
involving spectroscopy of collisional pairs as a potential proxy for O2-rich (Schwieterman et al., 2016) and N2–rich 
atmospheres (Schwieterman et al., 2015; new proposed pathways for abiotically produced CO and O2 (Wang et 
al., 2016); observational constraints for escaping helium (Spake et al., 2018) on a giant exoplanet as well as new 
predictions for the mass and characteristic timescales of thin silicate atmospheres on magma ocean worlds (see 
e.g. Kite et al., 2016). Third, progress has been made regarding key processes such as escape (Owen, 2019) 
(including early water loss, see Tian et al., 2018) and outgassing (e.g. Gaillard and Scaillet, 2014) over evolutionary 
timescales. These are being complimented by a growing database of observationally constrained escape rates 
from exoplanetary atmospheres. Fourth, there have been numerous studies on newly-discovered planetary 
systems such as TRAPPIST-1 (Gillon et al., 2017) and Proxima Centauri-b (Anglada-Escudé et al., 2016). With the 
above in mind, we focus in our review on a specific selection of potential exoplanetary atmospheric compositions 
e.g. based on hydrogen, oxygen, water, silicate, halogen, hydrocarbon, sulfur etc. species and discuss their 
potential properties and feasibility.  "
"Section 2 introduces key processes and their uncertainties. Section 3 gives a brief overview of 
atmospheric diversity in the Solar System. Section 4 discusses some key phenomena affecting exoplanetary 
diversity. Section 5 discusses individual exoplanetary atmospheres. Section 6 presents the conclusions. 
 
2. Key Processes  "
"We provide here an initial brief summary of some key processes affecting atmospheric diversity. These 
include (1) gas accretion of growing protoplanets in the disk. Key uncertainties here are the timescales for 
protoplanetary growth and gas evaporation (Lammer et al., 2018); the role of planetary migration and the 
dynamical mechanism(s) for volatile delivery (Jacobson and Morbidelli, 2014); (2) Primary (catastrophic) 
outgassing at the end of the magma ocean phase and secondary (volcanic) outgassing. Uncertainties here are 
related to material properties, convection and composition of the interior; (3) Delivery via impacts. Uncertainties 
involve the effect of impactor properties (mass, composition, radius) over time (De Niem et al., 2012); (4) 
Atmospheric escape which can be broadly split into thermal (Jeans, hydrodynamic) and non-thermal (sputtering, 
pickup etc.) escape (see e.g. Tian, 2015a). A key uncertainty here is the evolution of stellar XUV (from 10-91.2nm) 
which drives atmospheric escape (see e.g. Johnstone et al., 2015; Tian, 2015a). Related processes important for 
atmospheric development include biogeochemical cycling, weathering, biomass emissions, climate and 
photochemistry. 
 
3. Lessons from the Solar System for Exoplanetary Science "
"The modern and early Solar System offer valuable lessons for understanding atmospheric diversity. 
Figure 1 provides a general overview:  "

"We now briefly discuss Solar System atmospheres with reference to the regions in Figure 1.  
 "
"3.1 Tenuous atmospheres – are defined here as objects with surfaces pressure less than a few tens of microbars. 
They are favored for smaller bodies with weak, gravitational fields or/and strong incoming insolation. Examples 
are modern Mercury, the Moon, the Galilean Satellites, Pluto and Triton. Table 1 (Grenfell, 2009 and references

" 
The extremely thin atmospheres (“collisionless exospheres”) can be strongly influenced by sputtering "
"from the solar wind (a source of helium e.g. for Mercury and the Moon, Table 1) and by surface mineral 
properties. The recent MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission 
revolutionized knowledge of Mercury’s alkali metal exosphere (see e.g. Merkel et al., 2017) and near-atmosphere 
gas-phase ion concentrations (Raines et al., 2014) useful for interpreting atmospheric evolution. Atmospheres of 
the Galilean moons could be influenced by sputtering onto ice surfaces which splits water and releases oxygen-
containing compounds (Table 1). 
 
 "
"3.1.1 Exoplanetary context 
Tenuous atmospheres have been proposed for ultra-short period (USP) (periods of <1day) hot Super-"
"Earths (SEs) such as CoRot-7b (Léger et al., 2009), Kepler-10b (Batalha et al., 2011), 55 Cancri e (Demory et al., 
2011) and HD80653 (Frustagli et al., 2020) plus several others (see e.g. Guenther and Kislyakova, 2020 and 
references therein). These highly-irradiated worlds could represent the stripped cores of smaller hot gas planets 
but possibly retaining thin atmospheres e.g. derived from refractory material such as silicate (see discussion in 
Lopez and Rice, 2018) whereas larger, less irradiated SEs could retain their volatile envelopes. Planetary 
population diagrams (e.g. Fulton et al., 2017; Lundkvist et al., 2016) suggest a radius minimum separating rocky 
SEs from mini gas planets which is a focus of numerous modeling studies (e.g. Mordasini, 2020). A central issue 
is whether hot SEs formed mostly in-situ or underwent inward migration which likely depends upon the central 
properties and timescales of the protoplanetary disk (see e.g. Raymond and Cossou, 2014; Martin and Livio, 
2016). Direct observations of the proposed tenuous atmospheres of hot SEs is rather lacking although proxy data 
for atmospheric mass and composition is emerging. "
"Regarding Corot-7b earlier model studies (e.g. Schaefer and Fegley, 2009) suggested silicate 
atmospheres with strong sodium and calcium absorption lines analogous to Mercury and Io. Kurokawa and 
Kaltenegger (2013) suggested that XUV-driven photoevaporative loss could remove one Jupiter mass of gaseous 
envelope on Corot-7b (and Kepler 10b) within ~1Gyr. Guenther et al. (2011) placed upper limits for alkali metals 
based on atmospheric spectral features for CoRot-7b.  Samuel et al. (2014) implied that obtaining a few transits 
with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could extend such analyses by constraining atmospheric mass and 
composition of CoRot-7b. Regarding Kepler-10b, Rouan et al. (2011) suggested the observed phase curves were 
best fitted by a rather high bond albedo of ~0.5 with a tenuous (po<2mb) silicate atmosphere (see also Herbort 
et al. (2020) who discuss theoretical atmospheres which can form above a (partially) melted crust).  By 
comparison Esteves et al., (2015) derived mostly lower albedos of <0.25 a sample of 14 close-orbiting Kepler 
mission planets  "
"Regarding 55 Cancri e, phase curve data (Tsiaris et al., 2016) based on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) 
Wide Field Camera (WFC3) suggested a hydrogen-helium dominated atmosphere with the surface pressure 
posterior peaking at 100mb (although this quantity was only loosely constrained) and a possible detection of 
hydrogen cyanide (HCN). High resolution transit spectroscopy (Ridden-Harper et al., 2016) suggested a modest "
"(3) sodium detection which would be consistent with an exosphere extending to ~five planetary radii.  Spitzer 
thermal flux observations (Demory et al., 2016b) suggested a strong (~1300K) gradient between the dayside and 
the nightside of 55 Cancri e which implies either a thin atmosphere or weak transport from day to night. Assuming 
partial vaporization and surface exchange from molten magma pools, Kite et al. (2016) suggested a tenuous 
atmosphere with a surface pressure of ~10Pa (~10-5 bar) on 55 Cancri e. Angelo and Hu (2017) however suggested 
a rather thick atmosphere with a surface pressure of ~1.4 bar based on a model fitted to time series of Spitzer IR 
photometry. Hammond and Pierrehumbert (2017) applied a General Circulation model to 55 Cancri e which 
suggested that a light (90:10, H2:N2) atmosphere with several bars surface pressure could best fit the phase curve 
data. Lightcurve observations including revised stellar activity (Bourrier et al., 2018) however did not support 
such a lightweight atmosphere. Miguel (2019) and Zilinskas et al. (2020) subsequently modeled the detectability 
of atmospheric spectral features by JWST assuming heavy, nitrogen-dominated atmospheres on 55 Cancri e 
varying [C/O] from 0.01 to 200. Results suggested e.g. that HCN should be clearly detectable for high C/O 
scenarios. Variability in 55 Cancri e lightcurves (e.g. Demory et al., 2016a; Tambura et al., 2018 and Sulis et al., 
2019) could arise due to e.g. stellar variability or due to a possible dust torus. The latter work suggested upper 
constraints on the optical albedo (<0.47 at 2-sigma) for 55 Cancri e based on the non-detection of secondary 
eclipses in visible light with the Microvariability and Oscillation of Stars (MOST) satellite. Folsom et al. (2020) 
modelled the stellar wind based on Zeeman Doppler Imaging and concluded that 55 Cancri e orbits inside the 
Alfvén surface which suggests that planet-star interactions could occur. Dorn et al. (2019) applied an interior 
model using a Bayesian approach which suggested that 55 Cancri e could have a mantle enriched in calcium and 
aluminium and may even lack a planetary core which would have poorly-known consequences for atmospheric 
evolution via outgassing. Modirrousta-Galian et al. (2020) suggested strong tidal forces could trap light 
atmospheres on the nightside where they could survive stellar driven escape. "
"In summary, a range of atmospheric masses and compositions have been suggested based on 
observations of Cancri 55e over the last decade. This could arise because such measurements approach the 
capability limits of modern instrumentation, or possibly due to intrinsic variability in the atmosphere via e.g. 
volcanism, or due to external variability via e.g. stellar luminosity or dust. Follow-up observations with JWST 
should help address these issues.  "
"Tenuous exo-atmospheres are favoured targets in the sense that they could be sampled over their entire 
vertical extent by exoplanetary transmission spectroscopy. For thicker atmospheres one typically samples only 
the upper regions since the underlying layers (pressures in the range of about (10 -100) millibars depending on "
"wavelength and composition) become optically-thick or the light is refracted away from the observer (García 
Muñoz et al., 2012; Bétrémieux and Kaltenegger, 2014). Tenuous atmospheres will therefore more likely offer 
atmospheric windows sampling down to the surface potentially revealing surface mineralogy (although 
identifying spectral signals of exoplanetary surfaces is observationally very challenging, see Hu et al., 2012; 
Madden and Kaltenegger, 2020) which via sputtering could influence the main atmospheric constituent - as on 
Mercury (Table 1). Also, such worlds could have extensive tails of e.g. sodium extending out to several planetary 
radii - as on Mercury (Potter and Killen 2008) and on the Moon (Matta et al., 2009). Such “cometary-like tails” 
have also been found for Hot Neptunes such as GJ436b in the form of escaping hydrogen (Kulow et al., 2014; 
Ehrenreich et al., 2015) and for super-Mercuries in the form of dust (Budaj, 2013). Upper atmosphere detections 
of atomic species (although currently most such detections have so far been achieved mostly for hot Jupiters, 
see Madhusudhan et al., 2016 and references therein) could be early probes of atmospheric composition.  "
"Close-orbiting planets are on the one hand favored targets due to short orbital periods which suggest a 
high number of transit events over a given period. On the other hand, tenuous exo-atmospheres are generally 
favored by smaller bodies with smaller transit depths which vary proportional to the factor (rp2/r*2). Also, low 
mass atmospheres in general could lead to weak planetary absorption features. Korablev et al. (this issue, chapter 
14) and Tinetti et al. (this issue, chapter 16) discuss future observations of exoplanetary atmospheres from space.  "
" 
3.1.2 Lessons for Exoplanetary Diversity – for Mercury-like worlds, observations from the Solar System suggest 
atmospheres could consist of (1) a helium component depending on e.g. planetary protection and the impinging 
stellar wind,(2) a gas-phase alkali metal component depending on e.g. the availability of alkali minerals and 
surface mineralogy and (3) a smaller (about x100 less) amount of outgassed noble gases. Regarding point (1), 
Vidotto and Bourrier (2017) (their Table 1) summarize estimates of stellar mass loss rates and atmospheric extent 
for different stellar classes. Boro Sakia et al. (2020) suggest that current model estimates of stellar wind 
properties such as mass and momentum loss rates could vary by a factor (2-10). Regarding point (2), the 
theoretical study by Hu et al. (2012) suggested that JWST could possibly identify e.g. surface silicate IR bands for 
some nearby targets although this will be very challenging. 
 
3.2 Silicate Atmospheres "
"The inner rocky planets and the Moon experienced an early period of intense bombardment lasting for 
a few hundred million years after formation. This led to local and global magma ocean (MO) events. Zahnle et al. 
(2010) suggested early hot rock (silicate) atmospheres having characteristic removal timescales of up to ~1000 
years with silicate rainout proceeding via the condensation rock sequence (e.g. corundum, forsterite, wüstite 
etc.). The order of condensation is uncertain depending upon the reducing nature of the MO-atmosphere system 
which is likely sensitive to the rate of iron rainout into the core as it formed. Pahlevan et al. (2011) discussed hot 
rock rainout on early Earth calculated with a two-phase thermodynamical model having magnesium rich droplets 
in an iron rich vapor. Fegley and Schaefer (2012) reviewed studies of Earth’s silicate vapor atmosphere including 
rainout, (silicate) snow formation and in-situ photochemical reactions. Somewhat lacking in the literature are 
calculations of silicate atmosphere rainout using modern, time-dependent microphysical models. Direct spectral 
observations of silicate atmospheres on e.g. hot rocky SEs are very challenging but could be achieved with JWST 
(see also discussion in section 5.1.) "
" 
3.3 Steam Atmospheres "
"Atmospheres dominated by water vapor represent a critical phase for the early development of 
terrestrial planets. The timing and interplay between key processes such as escape and outgassing during the 
steam atmosphere phase can strongly influence the onset and duration of the planet’s subsequent habitability. 
The nature and magnitude of outgassing at the end of the MO phase is related to the progressive exclusion of 
volatiles from the minerals driven by bottom-up solidification and depends on cooling rates and convection 
turnover timescales (see e.g. Maurice et al., 2017; Boukaré et al., 2018). Crustal formation occurred on Earth 
between (104-107) years after the final global MO phase began (see e.g. Lebrun et al., 2012; Nikolaou et al., 2019). 
The range of uncertainty arises mainly due to poorly-constrained material properties of the mantle and 
uncertainties in atmosphere-interior coupling. "
"Regarding Venus-Earth-Mars (VEM) Lammer et al. (2018) and references therein (their Table 2) 
suggested catastrophic outgassing of (450, 200, 50) bars of water on VEM respectively. Lebrun et al. (2013) 
estimated that the first global oceans condensed (~0.1, 1.5, 10) Myr thereafter on VEM respectively. Way et al. 
(2016) suggested early Venus could be habitable up to t=715 Myr assuming one tenth of an Earth ocean based 
on their 3D model study. Lammer et al. (2018) however suggested that on Venus the steam atmosphere may 
never have condensed and the water could have been possibly lost via early escape. On Earth, numerous studies 
(e.g. Elkins Tanton et al., 2008; Elkins-Tanton et al., 2012; Hamano et al., 2013; Lebrun et al., 2013; Massol et al., "
"2016; Salvador et al., 2017) investigated how the early thick steam atmosphere formed, cooled, condensed and 
ultimately formed the oceans. Model studies (e.g. Katyal et al., 2019) investigated cooling of Early Earth’s steam 
atmosphere due to outgoing longwave (LW) radiation at different stages of the MO.. Earth proxy data (ancient 
zircons) support early oceans 4.3 to 4.4 Gyr ago (Mojzsis et al., 2001). Direct spectral observations of giant steam 
atmospheres in an exoplanet context are currently lacking. 
 
3.4 Carbon Dioxide (CO2) - Nitrogen (N2) - Oxygen (O2) Atmospheres "
"After the onset of Earth’s oceanic and continental formation, carbon dioxide was increasingly subject to 
atmospheric removal via washout and weathering. The role of atmospheric escape weakened as the early stellar 
EUV output decreased (e.g. Ribas et al., 2005). Other long-term processes also began to play a role for subsequent 
atmospheric evolution.  These involved wide-ranging and sometimes subtle feedbacks within the interior-
hydrosphere-lithosphere-biosphere-atmosphere system (see e.g. Spohn, 2014). Processes such as secondary 
outgassing, weathering (continent formation), climate, photochemistry, feedback cycles and eventually biology 
and biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen (discussed below) start to influence atmospheric 
evolution. Charnay et al., (this issue, chapter 3) review climate evolution on the Early Earth and the faint young 
sun problem.  
 
3.4.1 Volatile Inventory of Earth’s chondritic building blocks "
"To gain insight into the volatile budget of the basic building blocks of our planet, Tables 2 and 3 show 
the gas compositions at p=100 bar which are in equilibrium with the metal chondrites (Table 2) and the 
carbonaceous chondrites (Table 3) at 500K, 1000K and 2000K. Data is from Zahnle et al. (2010) their Figures 2 
and 3 which are based on Schaefer and Fegley (2010): "

Table 3: As for Table 2 but for the carbonaceous chondrites. "
" 
Table 2 (iron chondrites) suggests the chemical equilibrium favors volatile speciation into methane and "
"ammonia at lower temperatures, shifting to hydrogen, carbon monoxide and water at higher temperatures. 
Table 3 (carbonaceous chondrites) suggests that chemical equilibrium favors mainly carbon dioxide with some 
water at lower temperatures, shifting to mainly water with some carbon dioxide together with sulfur compounds "
"and hydrogen at higher temperatures. Fegley and Schaefer (2012) discuss theories for constraining the relative 
amounts of chondritic material making up the bulk Earth. 
 
3.4.2 Venus Earth Mars  "
"Numerous texts have discussed the present-day (e.g. Yung and DeMore, 1999) and evolutionary 
compositional development (e.g. Lammer et al., 2018) of CO2-N2-O2 atmospheres on Venus, Earth and Mars (see 
also Lammer et al., 2020). Regarding Venus e.g. Lammer et al. (2018); Hamano et al., (2013) and Lebrun et al., 
(2013) suggested that strong insolation compared to the Earth may have lengthened the steam atmosphere 
phase for long enough (~100 Myr) such that efficient hydrodynamic escape could have effectively dried out the 
planet. In this scenario, the thick, hot, modern CO2 atmosphere on modern Venus results directly from outgassing 
at the end of the MO and not via the more frequently discussed runaway moist greenhouse effect. Regarding N2, 
nitrogen isotope data (Marty, 2012) favors a carbonaceous chondrite origin. Some nitrogen in the form of NH3 
(Lammer et al., 2018 and references therein) could have existed near the Venusian surface especially if the early 
atmosphere was shielded from UV.  "
"Regarding Earth, weaker insolation than Venus and long-term plate tectonics maintained surface oceans 
with stabilizing climate feedbacks involving atmospheric CO2 such as the carbonate-silicate cycle (Walker et al., 
1981) (Charnay et al., this issue) discuss climate on Early Earth and the faint young Sun problem).  The build-up 
of N2-O2 dominated atmospheres are favored by the presence of life (Lammer et al., 2018). "
"Regarding Mars, escape mainly drives atmospheric evolution. Odert et al. (2018) assumed outgassing of 
(CO2=11bar) and (H2O=85bar) at the end of the MO period and then calculated complete atmospheric loss via 
escape after 18 Myr (25 Myr) assuming a moderately (slowly) rotating early Sun. Supporting this, xenon data 
from ancient Martian meteorites suggest that early Mars lost most of its initial atmosphere (Cassata, 2017). 
Observations of modern Mars by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft (Jakosky et 
al., 2018) suggested integrated loss rates (assuming Solar evolution) on Mars of 0.8 bar CO2 and a 23m water 
ocean layer. Kite et al. (2019) review constraints in the evolution of atmospheric pressure and liquid water on 
early Mars based on geological data. Warren et al. (2019) suggested a continuous surface pressure upper limit 
of 1.9 bar at 4 Gyr on Mars based on an analysis of small craters. High Martian 15N compared to the other rocky 
planets suggests that Mars lost a significant amount of its early nitrogen inventory (Lammer et al., 2018). 
Regarding outgassing, the reduced Martian interior could favor enhanced outgassing of e.g. H2 and CO compared 
with Earth (Ramirez et al., 2014). This could lead to an interior-atmosphere negative feedback whereby 
outgassing of reduced species on Mars leads to enhanced atmospheric loss of the reductant H which drives 
oxidation of the atmosphere and hence (via e.g. deposition) ultimately favors mantle oxidation over time. Catling 
et al. (2003) discussed similar mechanisms operating on Early Erath. 
 
3.4.3 Isotopic fractionation 
 Several of the key process mentioned above e.g. escape, delivery and interior processes, result in 
isotopic fractionation. Numerous advances leading to reduced data precision for isotopic fractionation ratios 
have occurred in recent years. For example, Hin et al. (2017) suggested that accretional vaporization played an 
important role in the volatile budget of terrestrial planet formation based on improved isotopic magnesium 
ratios. New ruthenium isotope data (Fischer-Gödde and Kleine, 2017) suggested surprisingly that the late veneer 
featured an inner solar system origin and was likely not the primary source of volatiles on Earth. Improved noble 
gas and nitrogen isotope data has advanced knowledge of early escape, especially on Mars (Cassata, 2017; Füri 
and Marty, 2015) whereby observed neon and argon isotope ratios (Odert et al., 2018) support a slow to 
moderately rotating (rather than a quickly rotating) early Sun. 
 
3.4.4 Exoplanetary Context  "
"Inspecting volatile inventories of terrestrial planet building blocks (Tables 2 and 3) based on chondrites 
from the Solar System gives a general indication of the potential range of atmospheric species in an exoplanetary 
context where such observations are not available. Hints on exoplanetary mineral compositions can be gained 
from e.g. stellar metallicity measurements coupled with interior structure plus atmospheric escape modeling 
(Dorn and Heng, 2018). Planet formation and interior structure models (Alibert and Venturini, 2019) also provide 
some insight. Initial observations of infalling material from circumstellar debris onto white dwarfs as reviewed in 
Farihi (2016) have been performed. Results suggest exomineral compositions which are not dissimilar to those 
of the Solar System. Adibekyan et al. (2015) investigated observed [Mg/Si] ratios of [F,G,K] stars using HARPS. 
Their results suggested an evolution in this ratio through the Galaxy and that smaller mass stars have higher 
ratios. We now discuss briefly the key processes affecting atmospheric diversity of terrestrial exoplanets. "
"Regarding escape, progress is somewhat hindered by a lack of various parameters such as stellar EUV 
observations, stellar wind properties and planetary exospheric temperatures which can all influence atmospheric "
"escape. Improved estimates of such parameters e.g. improved stellar EUV by semi-empirical modeling (Fontenla 
et al., 2016) is useful in this regard. Section 4.3 discusses (extreme) escape processes in more detail.  Regarding 
outgassing, numerous factors could be relevant which we will briefly discuss in approximate order of observing 
difficulty. The bulk planetary density can be estimated already today for some SEs by measuring planetary radius 
from the transit depth together with planetary mass from the radial velocity method. The planet’s mass 
distribution throughout the interior can be in principle constrained by determining the love number although 
observations are presently limited to large, close-in exoplanets (e.g. Hellard et al., 2020). The core mantle ratio 
and interior composition can be constrained from Bayesian analyses (Dorn et al., 2015) and machine-learning 
(Baumeister et al., 2020) techniques driven by observations of e.g. planetary mass, radius, love number and 
stellar metallicity. Knowledge of surface composition e.g. via reflection spectroscopy could provide hints on 
mantle convection. For example active plate tectonics on Earth produces continental crust mainly in the form of 
granite (see discussion in Herbort et al., 2020, their section 3.2). Hu et al (2012) analyzed detectability of 
reflection and thermal emission spectra on “airless Earths” for a range of mineral surfaces including basaltic, 
ultramafic and granitoid. Distinguishing the resulting small signals (they suggested a few parts per million 
differences in the ratio of planetary to stellar flux for e.g. Kepler 20f) however is likely beyond the reach of JWST 
and is more an issue for spectroscopy missions further into the future. Other factors which could influence 
outgassing include the amount of water in the interior which could affect mantle convection. The water content 
of Earth’s mantle is not well constrained, ranging from (~0.2 to 3.0) Earth ocean masses (Ohtani, 2020) and is not 
known for rocky exoplanets. Recent works (e.g. Namouni and Morais, 2020) suggest that high inclination 
Centaurs in our Solar System could have an interstellar origin so could represent the first opportunity to constrain 
the building blocks of exoplanets, although such a task is very challenging. "
"Another interesting effect impacting outgassing is the change in the mantle oxidation state (oxygen 
fugacity) over time (see e.g. Gaillard et al, this issue; Kadoya et al., 2020; Gaillard et al, 2015) which can in turn 
depend on global processes which change the Earth’s redox balance and influence outgassing. Observational 
constraints of mantle composition (hence fugacity) in an exoplanet context are however weak as stated above.  
Over time, disproportionation reactions (3Fe2+ = Fe° + 2Fe3+) in the interior associated to the oxygen-friendly 
nature of minerals growing in the transition zone and lower mantle (Frost and Mc Cammon, 2008) that may 
induce an oxidation of the upper mantle. This would however be conditioned by the efficient removal of the 
produced metallic iron (Fe°) into the forming core and by the efficiency of global convection in mixing lower and 
upper mantle materials. These mass transfer processes are in turn conditioned by the establishment of plate 
tectonics representing an efficient convection regime at planetary scale. In brief, the physical status of the planet 
interior (style of convection, mantle size) and the chemical state, which rules the efficiency of mantle outgassing, 
are intimately intermingled. This implies that planetary mass and outgassing could be somehow related. Broader 
relationships exist between planetary interiors and surficial processes. For example, in the upper atmosphere, 
loss to space of atomic hydrogen from e.g. water photolysis escapes to space, must leave behind oxygen-enriched 
atmosphere, leading to oxidizing continental and seafloor weathering, which if introduced in the mantle by 
subduction processes could influence its redox state and outgassing efficiency. "
"Can we test the above feedbacks - proposed by theory and occurring between e.g. atmospheric escape 
and the planetary interior - in an exoplanetary context with observables? Regarding escape, an evaporating tail 
can form in the trailing planetary limb which could influence the transit lightcurve duration and shape e.g. in the 
Lyman-alpha for escaping H-atoms. Oza et al. (2019) summarize spectroscopic detections in the exospheres of 
hot Jupiters. Chen et al. (2020) discuss detection of sodium, magnesium and H in the hot exosphere of WASP-
52b and review species detections in the exoplanetary exospheres. Ehrenreich (2015) estimated from transit 
observations escape rates of (108 to 108) g/s for the warm Neptune GJ436b. For the potentially rocky SEs in the 
TRAPPIST-1 system, Bourrier et al., (2017) estimated H-escape rates of (4.6, 1.4, 0.6) x107g/s for TRAPPIST-b,c,e 
respectively based on Lyman-alpha transit data obtained with HST.  Whether the presence of a magnetic field 
increases or decreases atmospheric escape rates is debated (see Dehant et al. 2019, their section 4.2). Exoplanet 
science could soon actively contribute to this debate. Proposed techniques involving radio emission and 
polarimetry to constrain exoplanetary magnetospheres are under discussion (e.g. Zarka et al., 2019). Proxy 
approaches have provided first constraints e.g. magnetohydrodynamic simulations needed to reproduce 
observed excursions in peak brightness to the east and the west of the substellar point on the hot Jupiter HAT-
P-7b, required a planetary magnetic field of at least 6 Gauss (Rogers, 2017) (compared with ~0.5 Gauss on Earth’s 
surface). Cauley et al., (2019) estimated strong magnetic fields in the range (20-120) Gauss for four HJs based on 
measurements of the Calcium II K line. The potential role of escape in atmospheric evolution is discussed in 
section 4.3 below. "
"How central interior processes such as mantle convection, plate tectonics, outgassing etc. respond to 
changing planetary mass such as for SEs is still a subject of debate (see e.g. Noack et al., 2017; Stamenkovic and 
Breuer, 2014; Fratanduono et al., 2018), but this brief description shows that the style of geo(exo)dynamics is "
"pivotal in ruling the nature of outgassed atmosphere. Godolt et al. (2019) modeled rocky planets in the HZ of 
early M-dwarf stars which have very long active pre-main sequence phases. Their work suggested that planetary 
regassing could be important for re-instating habitability after the long (~1Gyr) intense (~x10-1000 EUV of the 
modern Sun). "
"Regarding delivery of water and other volatiles in exoplanetary systems, some key issues are e.g. 
identifying the main processes affecting planetary formation and orbital migration (see discussion in Morbidelli 
and Raymond, 2016); the extent of turbulent mixing in the disk (Furuya et al., (2013); determining the position 
of the water, ammonia and carbon dioxide ice lines (see e.g. Pinilla et al., 2017). The role of dynamical 
perturbations [e.g. the “Grand Tack” (Jacobson and Morbidelli, 2014)] which may be important for delivering 
volatiles to terrestrial planets which form dry, is not well known for different exoplanetary systems as a function 
of stellar and exoplanetary properties of e.g.  exo-Jupiters and exo-Saturns. Note that these objects are expected 
to be discovered by the ongoing Gaia mission. Regarding mini gas planets, water-dominated atmospheres are 
favored thermodynamically (T>~500K, P>~a few bar) for solar metallicities of ~x1000 (Moses et al., 2013, their 
Figure 4). More model formation studies are required investigating the effect of impacts upon atmospheric 
delivery and escape as a function of disk and planetary parameters. Direct observations of impact-driven delivery 
in exoplanetary atmospheres are not available. Next generation missions however observing dust distributions 
in protoplanetary and debris disks, as proposed for the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) (Nuecker 
et al., 2016; Douglas et al., 2018) could however help constrain bombardment rates of early exoplanets by 
asteroids which could ultimately help improve the planetary formation models. "
"Regarding CO2 atmospheres, the presence of an Earth-like ocean with active plate tectonics and a 
hydrological cycle could enhance CO2 removal via washout, formation of carbonate and subduction. For weak 
weathering cases without plate tectonics, e.g. Foley and Smye (2018) suggested possible runaway CO2 scenarios. 
Responses of CO2 on rocky exoplanets are generally challenging to predict, being subject to potentially complex 
process in the carbon cycle which are mostly unconstrained in an exoplanetary context.  Climate stabilizing cycles 
are sensitive to many factors including the land-sea mask (e.g. Lewis et al., 2018) and planetary orbital 
parameters (Williams and Pollard, 2002). Regarding exoplanets CO2 has been detected for several planetary 
atmospheres (mainly HJs) and JWST will aim to expand knowledge of this species in terrestrial-type atmospheres 
(Greene et al., 2016).  Obtaining observational hints for oceans (e.g. Robinson et al., 2014) and surface minerals 
(see e.g. Hu et al., 2012; Cui et al., 2018, as discussed) are however challenging. Regarding mini gas planets, CO2 
atmospheres are favored thermodynamically (T>~500K, P>~a few bar) for solar metallicities of ~x10,000  (Moses 
et al., 2013, their Figure 4). "
"Regarding N2 atmospheres, global sources and sinks are not well known (see e.g. Lammer et al., 2019; 
Wordsworth, 2016). Numerous processes such as volatile delivery (Hutsemékers et al., 2009), outgassing, 
lightning, cosmic rays and biological activity all play a role. Further exoplanetary studies are required to establish 
which key processes affect atmospheric N2 evolution (see also section 5.7). Direct spectral observations of N2 in 
exoplanetary atmospheres are currently lacking since its spectral features are weak. Schwieterman et al. (2015) 
discussed constraining nitrogen abundances via spectral absorption from N2-N2 collisional pairs. Oklopčić et al. 
(2016) discussed identifying N2 and H2 via so–called ghost line features in Raman spectroscopy. These signals 
however correspond to changes of up to a few percent in planetary geometric albedo in the UV so are beyond 
the reach of present day missions.  "
"Regarding O2 atmospheres, e.g. Gumsley et al. (2017) discuss relevant processes on Early Earth such as 
changes in carbon burial rates, mantle redox, biological activity etc. which could influence atmospheric oxygen 
abundance. Lingam and Loeb (2019) review the potential for photosynthesis on Earth-like planets. Abiotic O2 
production involving e.g. water photolysis followed by hydrogen atom escape (Luger and Barnes; 2015; Tian, 
2015b; Wordsworth et al., 2018) or via CO2 photolysis followed by self-reaction of oxygen atom (Gao et al. 2015, 
Tian et al., 2014) is an expanding field. Note however that NOx and HOx species (as on Mars) and additionally 
ClOx (as on Venus) can act as efficient catalysts to facilitate the formation of CO2 from CO and O as discussed 
above. In this case, the N2, O2, H2O and UV amounts in the planetary atmosphere (required to form NOx and 
HOx) could become important. Grenfell et al. (2018) suggested that atmospheric O2 abundances can be upper-
limited by explosion-combustion. Theoretical studies (e.g. Lόpez-Morales et al., 2019; Rodler and Lόpez-Morales, 
2014) suggested that several tens of transits are needed with the ELT to detect atmospheric O2 assuming a close-
by transiting Earth-like atmosphere.  Assuming an Earth-like atmosphere on our (non-transiting) neighbor 
Proxima Centauri-b would require about 55 hours (assuming R=150,000) ELT observing time (Hawker and Parry, 
2019) to detect the atmospheric O2 A-band in reflected light. Fauchez et al., (2020) suggested that atmospheric 
O2 could be detected via a relatively strong collision-induced absorption feature in the mid/far-infrared (6.4 
microns) and may thus be accessible with JWST. 
 
3.5 Hydrogen (H2) and Helium (He) atmospheres "
"ProtoEarth and ProtoVenus grew to (50-75%) (Lammer et al., 2018 and references therein) of their 
present planetary mass by ~10 Myr and accreted thereby (0.1-10%) Mearth hydrogen envelopes i.e. up to a factor 
of ~105 times present Earth’s atmospheric mass, after which time the gas in the protoplanetary disk had mostly 
evaporated. Earth’s primordial light atmosphere was likely formed mainly by impact-induced volatile degassing 
but also by direct gravitational accretion of gas from the disk (Abe, 2011). Escape processes driven by uncertain, 
early XUV evolution from the star are likely important for deciding timescales and to which extent the primordial 
atmosphere is lost (e.g. Kislyakova et al., 2015). 
 
3.5.1 Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune "
"Table 4 shows the composition by volume of the dominant atmospheric species (H2 and He) for the giant 
planets in the Solar system compared with the Solar Values: "
Species Solar Jupiter Saturn Uranus* Neptune* 
Hydrogen (H2) 0.912 0.897 0.963 0.85 0.80 
Helium (He) 0.085 0.102 0.033** 0.15 0.19 
" 
Table 4: Fractional composition by volume for the Sun (Grevesse et al., 2007), Jupiter and Saturn "
"(Bagenal et al., 2004) and Uranus and Neptune (Schmude, 2008). *Middle atmosphere measurements. 
 "
"Jupiter and Saturn - small differences between Jovian and Solar composition in Table 4 are suggested to arise 
due to helium differentiation in Jupiter’s core. First-order phase transitions from molecular to metallic hydrogen 
could also affect bulk composition (see e.g. Guillot, 1999). The Cassini mission considerably advanced knowledge 
of dynamical and temperature responses on Jupiter (e.g. Flasar et al., 2004) and Saturn (Dyudina et al., 2008). 
Helium amounts determined from this mission (Koskinen and Guerlet, 2018) suggest more abundant values, 
vmrHe=0.09 in the lower atmosphere compared with the earlier data shown in Table 4. Atmospheres of Jupiter 
and Saturn feature complex hydrocarbon chemistry (e.g. Smith and Nash, 2006) and cloud formation via e.g. 
phosphorous, water, and sulphur-containing species (Atreya et al., 1999). "
" 
Uranus and Neptune – likely have small rocky cores and are generally carbon-enriched compared with Jupiter 
and Saturn (Ali-Dib et al., 2014; Mousis et al., 2018). Recent advancements have been made in understanding 
the circulation (Orton et al., 2014) and brightness (Nettelmann et al., 2015) of Uranus as well as the composition 
(e.g. Moreno et al., 2017) of Neptune. Hydrocarbon photochemical responses on the ice giants are discussed in 
Moses et al., (2019).  
 
Atreya et al., (2020) comprehensively reviewed planetary composition, structure, origins and potential missions 
for the Solar System Gas and Ice Giants.  
 
3.5.2 Exoplanetary context "
"When interpreting the bulk composition of the Solar System’s giant planets, it is interesting to separate 
the influence of formation timescales and migration on the one hand, from that of planetary parameters such as 
mass, radius and core properties on the other hand. Studying cool exoplanetary giant planets in future will be 
useful in this regard. Helium detections in exo-Neptunes such as HAT-P-11b (e.g. Mansfield et al., 2018; Allart et 
al., 2018) are relevant in this respect. Hu et al. (2015) modeled helium exo-atmospheres on warm Neptunes such 
as GJ436b. Regarding atmospheric hydrocarbons, model studies (Moses et al., 2018) suggest summer-winter 
asymmetry due to photochemical responses in the atmospheres of the giant planets in the Solar System which 
they suggested could be tested in an exoplanetary context using the JWST if suitable cool giant exoplanet targets 
are found. Regarding (Ultra) Hot Jupiters [(U)HJs], their atmospheric composition and detection are reviewed in 
e.g. Maldonado et al. (2018) and Madhusudhan (2019); their atmospheric structure in Laughlin (2018) and 
transport in e.g. Komacek and Showman (2016). Grenfell et al. (2020) summarized potential atmospheric 
observations of HJs and nearby SEs using the planned color filters on the PLATO fast cameras.  We do not however 
discuss (U)HJs in detail here since our focus in the present work lies with the smaller mass terrestrial-type 
exoplanets  
 
3.6 Summary – the Solar System may be atypical in some respects. For example it features neither mini gas 
planets nor SEs which may be rather common in the Universe (Burke et al., 2015). Nevertheless, studying the 
Solar System provides valuable lessons regarding e.g. volatile budgets, delivery, magma oceans, outgassing and 
steam atmospheres for the inner terrestrial planets as well as lessons regarding the formation and composition "
"of outer gas planets. This can be an invaluable exercise when considering the potential diversity of exoplanetary 
atmospheres. 
 
4. Key Phenomena anticipated to affect Exoplanetary Atmospheric Diversity 
 
4.1 Elemental abundances in the protoplanetary disk "
"Molecular clouds (MCs) are one of the most investigated phenomena in the interstellar medium, yet the 
main mechanisms by which they form, evolve and collapse are not well understood (see overview by Vázquez-
Semadeni et al., 2006). MCs typically contain ~90% H2 gas with masses in the range ~(102-106)M* and 
temperatures (10-50K). Differential rotational rates in the branches of the Milky Way can lead to MC rotation. At 
the rotational equator of the MC, the outward centrifugal force balances the inward gravitational force. Along 
the MC rotational axis however, the unbalanced gravitational force leads to inward transport of material so that 
the MC flattens into an accretion disk (Maeder, 2009). Observations of evolving disks by the Atacama Large 
Millimeter Array (ALMA) telescope have greatly advanced the field (Matrà et al., 2018). "
"Metallicity distribution functions across the Milky Way were discussed e.g. in Nidever et al. (2014) and 
Hayden et al. (2015). The latter study suggested (Fe/H) values ranging from -0.5 to 1.5 for a sample of ~70,000 
stars. Variations in elemental abundances across the protoplanetary disk, however, depend on uncertainties in 
the dynamics and timescales of e.g. disk collapse, disk mass, dust-to gas ratios and photochemical effects. 
Predicting the position of disk snowlines and the resulting variation of planetary elemental ratios such as (C/O) 
and (C/H) in the gas and solid phases helps constrain whether such species were accreted as dust or gas during 
planetary formation. This can in turn help differentiate between proposed planetary formation mechanisms such 
as the ‘gravitational instability’ as opposed to the ‘core accretion’ mechanism (see Venturini and Helled, 2017). 
It can also provide information on migration rates and constrain location(s) in the disk at which the forming 
planet accreted its metals (see e.g. Booth et al., 2017; Krivov and Booth, 2018; Lin et al., 2018; Booth and Ilee, 
2019). Dorn et al. (2015) used stellar elemental data and planetary mass-radius observations to constrain core-
mantle radii and discussed future applications of this technique to constrain exoplanetary atmospheres and 
oceans. Several theoretical studies have varied metallicity and modeled the resulting atmospheres assuming 
chemical equilibrium (see review by Madhusudhan et al., 2016 and references therein). Moses et al., (2013) 
calculated the effect of varying metallicity values from x1 to x104 Solar in hot Neptunes and calculated (their 
Figure 5) atmospheres ranging from H2 and H2O for medium-range (x1-x102 Solar) metallicities and forming N2 
atmospheres for higher metallicities. For metallicities greater than x100 Solar, they noted CH4-dominated 
atmospheres for temperatures less than 600K and CO-dominated atmospheres for temperatures greater than 
800K. Hu and Seager (2014) varied assumed mole fractions, XH (from 0 to 1) and (XC/XO) (from 0 to 1 to 10) in a 
model study of the SE GJ1214b. Their results suggested atmospheres ranging from e.g. highly oxidized (e.g. O2-
dominated) at low (C/O) changing to highly reduced (CH4 and other hydrocarbons such as C2H2 (ethyne) and C2H4 
(ethene) at high (C/O)).  "
" 
4.2 Variations in initial interior volatile reservoirs and outgassing "
"Processes which influence outgassing can be broadly considered as follows. First, the initial (local) 
volatile concentration delivered to the planet, which is related to the concept of feeding zones (Grewal et al., 
2019) and the changes in orbital trajectory during planetary accretion (see 3.4.4). Then, the C-H-O-N-S elements 
which are supposedly outgassed from the planetary interior to form the atmosphere are not always volatiles. 
Recent research efforts (Hirschmann 2012; Rohrbach et al., 2014; Dasgupta and Grewal, 2019; Malavergne et al., 
2019) clearly show that these elements can be siderophile or refractory, implying that under certain conditions 
or during specific stages in the differentiation of a planet, they are not outgassed from the mantle, but remain 
sequestrated in the planetary interior. Technically, the effective partitioning of volatiles into the melt depends 
on e.g. redox state, melt fraction, composition, temperature and pressure. These parameters are linked to the 
exogeodynamics (see 3.4.4) defining the style of planetary internal convection (eg. Noack et al., 2014). On planet 
Earth, geochemical constraints indicate that carbon is in the oxidized form of carbonate in the shallow mantle 
(ie. <180 km depth) while it is completely in the form of diamond at greater depth (Frost and Mc Cammon, 2008; 
Gaillard et al., 2015). This redox transition is critical for the removal of carbon upon mantle melting since only 
oxidized carbon can be outgassed while diamond/graphite is refractory. This also has implications on the 
speciation of other volatiles like hydrogen, by affecting reduced volatiles such as H2 and CH4 (e.g. Dasgupta, 
2013). On Mars, oxidized carbon is not expected due to a much reduced mantle; this implies a limited carbon 
outgassing from the Martian mantle in comparison to Earth. Finally, the volatility of the C-H-O-N-S (transfer from 
melt to gas) is the last condition for outgassing into the atmosphere. Nitrogen and sulfur are not volatile under 
the most reduced conditions typical of Mercury for example (Gaillard et al., 2015). Under oxidizing conditions, 
however, they can be as volatile as other components (ie. CO2, CO, H2O, H2O). Outgassing CO2 and CO from the "
"melt is always favored since these are very volatile species. Water is much less volatile than CO2. This hierarchy 
in the volatility implies that the composition of the outgassed mixture from a basalt is chiefly pressure 
dependent: at high pressure (~a few tens of bar and above), water is not outgassed, while at low pressure (< 0.1 
bar), most of the C-H-O-N-S elements can be outgassed (Gaillard and Scaillet, 2014). In brief, pressure and oxygen 
fugacity are the parameters ruling the amount and nature of degassed mixture from a basalt. "
"How could mantle oxygen fugacity have evolved through time on planet Earth? Frost and McCammon 
(2008) suggested an oxidized mantle was reached at ~1Gyr after core formation. Li and Lee (2004) and Trail et 
al. (2011) provided evidence for constant fO2 values in the upper mantle over geological time back to 4.3 Ga. A 
consensus seems to emerge here, but there remain large uncertainties preventing the used redox poxies to 
provide firm conclusion (e.g. Yang et al., 2014). During core-mantle separation, conditions were extremely 
reduced implying an atmosphere dominated by H2 and CO (Hirschmann, 2012; Gaillard et al., 2015). After core 
formation, the efficiency of carbon removal into the core influenced the subsequent mantle fO2 and coeval 
atmosphere evolution (Hirschmann, 2012). How oxygen fugacity evolved during the late stage of the magma 
ocean appears pivotal (Elkins-Tanton et al., 2008; Elkins-Tanton et al., 2012). Recent efforts link the depth of the 
magma ocean to the evolution of its oxidation state and the fate of carbon (Armstrong et al., 2019). It is then 
possible that right at the end of the magma ocean stage, the oxygen fugacity of the Earth’s mantle was similar 
to the present-day one with an oxidized shallow mantle and a deep reduced one. But such planetary systems 
may not always be considered as a closed system: Over geological timescales, (a) prolonged hydrogen 
atmospheric escape (involving water photolysis followed by removal of hydrogen to leave behind oxygen which 
can be weathered into the surface), (b) delivery of oxidized late veneer material and (c) subduction of oxidized 
mineral could also drive mantle oxidation (Kasting et al., 1993). Orders of magnitude difference in the outgassed 
mass of volatiles can arise depending on the processes listed above. 
 
4.3 Extreme atmospheric escape "
"Atmospheric escape can be limited by diffusion (depending on e.g. atmospheric scale height of different 
species and the concentration of escaping species) or energy (depending on incoming XUV or high energy particle 
fluxes from the central star). Regarding atmospheric escape in the modern Solar System, Jupiter is sufficiently 
massive and far from the Sun to prevent efficient escape in virtually any form. Regarding Venus, Earth and Mars, 
escape processes have been reviewed by numerous works e.g. Shizgal and Arkos (1996). In the early Solar System, 
atmospheric escape on Venus, Earth and Mars was discussed in e.g. Lammer et al. (2018). On Pluto, Zhu et al. 
(2014) suggested energy-limited escape which hydrodynamic treatments under-estimate by ~13% (see also Hoey 
et al., 2017). The New Horizon observations suggest that theoretical calculations of atmospheric escape on Pluto 
generally over-estimate observed losses. "
"Regarding exoplanets, numerous earlier works modeled hydrodynamic escape on Hot Jupiters (see Tian, 
2015 and references therein). Tripathi et al. (2015) applied a 3D hydrodynamic model which suggested day-night 
asymmetries in outflow for tidally-locked Hot Jupiters. Weber et al. (2017) modeled plasma conditions near the 
exobase of Hot Jupiters. Insight into planetary formation and the role of escape has been revealed by 
observational studies of the so-called Neptunian desert (e.g. Mazeh et al., 2016) and the “radius” or “Fulton” gap 
(Fulton et al., 2017; Owen and Wu, 2017; Lehmer and Catling, 2017; Jin and Mordasini 2018; Gupta and 
Schlichting, 2019) for close-in planets. Lammer et al. (2013) suggested blowoff and Roche lobe overflow could 
occur for SE atmospheres. Tian (2009, 2013) modeled planetary upper atmospheres containing heavy molecules 
such as N2, O2 and CO2 under strong XUV radiation. Johnstone et al., (2015) and Erkaev et al., (2016) modeled 
the important role played by XUV for escape processes for SEs with hydrogen dominated atmospheres.  "
"Regarding rocky exoplanets orbiting M-dwarf stars, an important question is to what extent they can 
retain their atmospheres. Tian and Ida (2015) suggested that Earth-like planets with Earth-like oceans could be 
rare for cool star systems due to efficient water loss over the extended pre-main sequence. The model study by 
Owen and Mohanty (2016) included an updated escape model with improved radiative cooling and transition 
between hydrodynamic and ballistic regime, which suggested that large primordial hydrogen envelopes may 
survive the early, extreme early EUV phase for rocky worlds around cool stars. Dong et al. (2018) modelled the 
TRAPPIST-1 system and suggested ion escape rates (102-103) times faster than that on Earth assuming an initial 
one bar atmosphere with Venus-composition. Their modelled stellar winds were ~three times faster than the 
Sun for the same star-planet distance.  Their work suggested complete atmospheric removal for the inner 
TRAPPIST-1 planets for surface pressures up to ~10bar. They noted that more work is required to characterize 
the properties of the incoming stellar wind. It should also be noted that the impact of rapid loss on the energy 
budget of the underlying planetary upper atmosphere is not considered in Dong et al. (2018) and thus their loss 
rate could be more limited by the energy conservation principle proposed in Tian (2013).  Kubyshkina et al., 
(2018) presented an updated method based on gridded analytical fits to replace the energy-limited formula 
commonly employed to estimate atmospheric escape. Tian et al. (2018) reviewed recent progress in "
"understanding the evolution of stellar XUV and the relevance for water loss on terrestrial exoplanets. Johnstone 
et al. (2018) developed a flexible 1D upper atmosphere escape model validated for Earth and Venus to model 
the effect of e.g. stellar XUV evolution. Applying this model to terrestrial-type planets orbiting early, active solar-
like stars (Johnstone et al., 2019) suggested Earth-like atmospheres cannot form due to transonic hydrodynamic 
escape of e.g. C and O. 
 
4.4 Clouds "
"Clouds are common features in planetary atmospheres throughout the Solar System (see e.g. Taylor, 
2010). Cloud microphysical processes include homogeneous nucleation, heterogeneous nucleation (occurring on 
condensation nuclei such as aerosol and dust particles), coagulation (growth) and sedimentation. Complex 
climate feedbacks exist between clouds, radiation and transport which are still being unraveled in Earth’s 
atmosphere (see e.g. Ceppi and Hartmann, 2015).  "
"In exoplanet science, the central role of clouds and hazes is becoming more and more apparent. The 
presence of clouds can flatten the transmission spectra of Hot Jupiters (see e.g. Parmentier et al., 2016; Wakeford 
et al., 2016; Powell et al., 2018). Regarding hot SEs, Mahapatra et al., (2017) investigated the potential role of 
atmospheric mineral-based clouds.   Schaeffer and Fegley, (2009) suggested clouds consisting of sodium or/and 
potassium-containing minerals for hot SEs which (for favourable candidates) could be observable with current 
facilities. "
"Regarding warm SEs, Kreidberg et al. (2014) suggested the presence of clouds in the atmosphere of 
GJ1214b in order to be consistent with transit spectroscopy data (see also Charnay et al., 2015; Mollière et al., 
2017; Gao and Benneke (2018). Morley et al. (2015) modelled cloudy thermal emissions and reflection spectra 
in SE atmospheres. Kawashima et al. (2019) performed feasibility studies for spectral detections by the James 
Webb Space Telescope (JWST) assuming clouds and hazes on GJ1214b, GJ 436b, HD 97658b, and Kepler-51b. 
Benneke et al. (2019) suggested that Mie-scattering by clouds is responsible for the flat spectrum they observed 
for GJ3470b at visible and near infrared wavelengths. The impact of such clouds should decrease for observations 
at longer wavelengths.  
 
5.  Case Studies of Exoplanetary Atmospheres 
 
5.1. Magma Ocean Worlds "
"A magma ocean (MO) planet features a molten mantle without a planetary crust and surface 
temperatures in the range ~(1000-2000K) which is generally sufficient to melt silicate minerals depending on 
their composition. Such conditions can be reached temporarily e.g. after the planetary accretional phase, or 
permanently e.g. for close-orbiting terrestrial exoplanets as discussed in Hamano et al. (2013) and Nikolaou et 
al. (2019). A number of potential MO exoplanets have been identified, such as Corot-7b, 55 Cancri e, TRAPPIST-
1b and Kepler 10b (e.g. Hammond and Pierrehumbert, 2017; Henning et al., 2018; Nikolaou et al., 2019 and 
references therein).  "
"Exoplanetary model studies of MO atmospheres focused on e.g. interior-atmosphere coupling, 
atmospheric composition, cooling processes and the length of the MO phase (see e.g. Lebrun et al., 2013). Kite 
et al. (2016) suggested MO world atmospheres close to vapor-pressure equilibrium determined by fractional 
vaporization and surface-interior exchange. Marcq et al. (2017) applied a coupled interior-atmosphere model 
simulating H2O-CO2 atmospheres which confirmed that the outgoing LW blanketing effect saturates at the 
Nakajima limit (Nakajima et al., 1992) of ~280 Wm-2 (and ~40% less for atmospheres assuming clouds) for 
scenarios with 300 (100) bar surface pressure of H2O (CO2). They suggested the limit breaks down for surface 
temperatures above 1690K (1970K) for scenarios with (without) clouds, although these values depend on 
atmospheric composition and mass. Breakdown occurs as successively hotter planetary surfaces emit radiation 
at successively lower wavelengths. Lupu et al. (2014) modeled atmospheric composition and evolution of post 
giant impact atmospheres on Earth-like planets. Nikolaou et al., (2019) applied a coupled interior-atmosphere 
model to discuss whether a sample of potential MO exoplanets could lie in temporary (“evolutional MO”) or 
permanent MO states depending on e.g. albedo and incoming stellar radiation. "
"Atmospheric species on MO worlds can be removed directly by surface ingassing e.g. for noble gases as 
indicated by studies of mantle 3He/22Ne preserves (Tucker and Mukhopadhyay, 2014). Sharp (2017) suggested 
ingassing during the MO phase could represent a major mechanism for delivery of volatiles into the interior (see 
also Olson and Sharp, 2018). Wu et al. (2018) discussed mantle acquisition of noble gases, H2 and H2O during the 
MO phase. Wordsworth (2016) discussed thermolytic dissociation or/and dissolution of nitrogen-containing 
species into the MO. Kite et al (2019) suggest that ingassing of H2 during the MO phase may be responsible for 
forming the steep decrease in the planetary occurrence rate between 3-4 Earth radii. 
 "
"5.2 Steam Atmospheres 
A massive steam atmosphere e.g. with hundreds to thousands of bars pressure at the surface can be "
"outgassed during crustal formation at the end of the MO phase on terrestrial-type planets. Subsequent cooling 
could then lead to ocean formation via condensation. Elkins-Tanton (2011) noted that planetary formation 
models suggest SEs could commonly acquire their oceans via such a mechanism. On the other hand, if the 
planet’s incoming stellar radiation is strong, this could result in a prolonged steam atmosphere phase with 
atmospheric desiccation via water photolysis followed by escape. Alternative to steam outgassing, it is feasible 
that so-called waterworlds (Léger et al., 2004) could evaporate their water inventory and form massive steam 
atmospheres if they migrate sufficiently far inwards. Kite and Ford (2018) suggested that waterworlds could be 
common and modeled their habitability limits. Goldblatt (2015) modeled the dependence of steam atmosphere 
amount and duration upon planetary mass and incoming stellar radiation. Fegley et al. (2016) suggested that 
exoplanetary steam atmospheres could dissolve magnesium, iron and alkali metal oxide minerals which could 
potentially modify their surface composition. The model study of Pluriel et al. (2019) suggested high bond 
albedos (~0.8) for steam exo-atmospheres (Tsurf~1000K) (an effect associated with clouds) and medium bond 
albedos (~0.5) for hotter steam atmospheres ((Tsurf~2000K) where gas absorption becomes more important.  "
"Steam atmospheres are also investigated in the context of determining via model studies the inner 
habitable zone boundaries (HZ). Earlier works e.g. Kopparapu et al. (2013) noted the importance of employing 
detailed, up-to-date line-lists for water when determining the inner HZ. Leconte et al., (2013) investigated 
simulating in 3D the effect of under-saturated descending Hadley cells. A summary of 1D and 3D modeling studies 
of steam atmospheres near the inner HZ, including important cloud feedbacks are summarized in Godolt et al., 
(2016) and references therein. Thomas and Madhusudhan (2016) noted that thick steam atmospheres could 
increase the radii of water-rich planets by up to several tens of percent - which could be used as an observational 
indicator for the volatile content on sampled rocky exoplanets by future missions (see also Turbet et al., 2019 
and Turbet et al., 2020). 
 
 5.3 Oxygen Atmospheres "
"The global oxygen cycle (on modern Earth) is influenced by processes extending over the interior-
lithosphere-biosphere-atmosphere system (see e.g. Petsch, 2003; Catling and Claire, 2005).  
Regarding sources, the main net source of atmospheric O2 is via subductive burial (~12 Tmol C/yr; Holland, 2006) "
"occurring mainly near continental margins (Hartnett et al., 1998). This process regulates how much O2 from 
photosynthesis (forming O2) can enter the atmosphere by subducting organic material, making it unavailable for 
respiration (destroying O2). A minor source of O2 (3x108 molecules cm-2 s-1) on modern Earth, occurring ~100 
times slower than burial; see Yung and DeMore, 1999) is via atmospheric escape which proceed via photolysis of 
water followed by escape of H then self-reaction of the resulting O to form O2. This O2 source could however be 
important in Early Earth type environments and on terrestrial-type exoplanets (see below). 
     Regarding sinks, the main sinks of atmospheric O2 (on modern Earth) include (a) atmospheric reaction with 
reduced outgassed species such as CH4 and H2 (resulting in a net sink of ~1-3Tmol/yr O2; Catling and Claire, 2005), 
(b) metamorphic reactions of O2 directly on hot rock surfaces (~2.5 Tmol/yr O2; Catling and Claire, 2005) 
associated with volcanic activity, and (c) weathering (~16 Tmol/yr O2, Holland, 2002) occurring via O2 dissolving 
in rain followed by chemical reactions on surface rock. Earlier, mainly box model studies have investigated O2 
evolution over geological timescales on Earth (see Lenton and Watson, 2000; Berner, 2001). Lacking however in 
the literature are evolutionary studies with recent, coupled climate-photochemical models. Gebauer et al. (2017) 
and Gebauer et al. (2018) investigated processes affecting atmospheric oxygen on Earth and on Earth-like 
exoplanets respectively. On Earth, O2 levels have remained stable at ~21% for several hundred Myr. There is no 
firm understanding of the feedback mechanisms which maintain long-term regulation of O2 (Lasaga and Ohmoto, 
2002).   "
"Regarding exoplanets, lessons from Earth science suggest that processes affecting O2 are numerous and 
diverse. Regarding exoplanetary O2 sources, (a) the development of photosynthesis was likely an evolutionary 
singularity in the history of our planet, as reviewed by Fischer et al., (2016). Gale and Wandel (2017) (building on 
earlier work of Kiang et al., 2007) investigated the potential of Earth-like worlds orbiting M-dwarf stars to support 
exo-photosynthesis. Meadows et al., (2018) discussed interpreting O2 as an atmospheric biosignature in the 
context of its environment. Lingam and Loeb (2019) discussed the impact of exo-photosynthesis and its possible 
variants upon the atmospheres of Earth-like planets. Ward et al. (2019) review factors affecting atmospheric 
oxygen in the Solar System and beyond. The above studies assume that Earth-like planets in the HZ of M-dwarf 
stars can retain atmospheres although some works e.g. Airapetian et al. (2017) suggested that ion escape could 
efficiently remove Earth-like atmospheres on such worlds within tens to hundreds of Myr. Regarding (b) the O2 
source due to H-escape discussed above, clearly this process is favored for smaller-mass exoplanets orbiting stars 
active in XUV. Abiotic gas-phase reactions could also influence atmospheric oxygen in Earth-like planets. "
"Although not significant in Earth’s modern atmosphere, abiotic production of O2 could proceed efficiently in e.g. 
CO2-dominated atmospheres via CO2 photolysis whereby the resulting O-atoms self-react to form molecular 
oxygen. The abiotic production is strongly disfavored by the presence of hydrogen oxides (HOx) and nitrogen 
oxides (NOx). These species are produced in Earth-like atmospheres e.g. from lightning and cosmic rays which 
release HOx and NOx by breaking down their reservoir species such as nitric acid and water. HOx and NOx 
disfavor abiotic O2 production by driving catalytic gas-phase cycles which convert atomic O (from CO2 photolysis) 
back into CO2. In an atmosphere with a high concentration of O2 from CO2 photolysis, the O2 is likely to coexist 
with a high concentration of CO, therefore simultaneous observation of CO and O2 could therefore be an efficient 
method to distinguish the abiotically-produced from the biological O2 (Wang et al. 2016).  The mechanism was 
discussed in Selsis et al. (2002); Tian et al., (2014); Gao et al., (2015) and Luger and Barnes (2015). "
"Regarding exoplanetary O2 sinks, these likely depend upon (a) outgassing in both amount and 
composition of reduced compounds. These depend in turn upon mantle dynamics and the ability of the interior 
to absorb compounds e.g. during core formation, as discussed above. The metamorphic sink (b) will be favored 
on exoplanets with extended hot rocky surfaces. The weathering sink (c) will be favored on exoplanets with 
strong hydrological cycles and extensive, long-term continental coverage which are currently unknown 
parameters. Timescales for establishing the continents calculated by models for early Earth vary from several 
hundred Myr (fast growth) to several thousand (slow growth) Myr (Taylor and McLennan, 1985) depending on 
uncertainties in the dynamics and heat distribution in the mantle. Grenfell et al. (2018) suggested an upper limit 
sink for O2 on Earth-like planets (depending on T,p, composition) due to explosion-combustion initiated by cosmic 
rays or lightning. Wordsworth et al. (2018) performed modeling studies of GJ1132b, an Earth-sized planet 
transiting an M-dwarf star. Results suggested O2 atmospheres could vary over a large range - from tenuous 
atmospheres up to very thick (several thousands of bar at the surface) depending mainly on the initial planetary 
water budget assumed. Earth-like atmospheres, defined here as (N2-O2) dominated were suggested to be 
geobiosgnatures by e.g. Lammer et al., (2019), Airepatian et al., 2017) since their build-up together to significant 
values (>tenths of bar surface pressure or more) likely requires life to generate the required redox disequilibrium. 
Krissansen-Totton et al. (2016) suggested that strong redox disequilibrium arose on Earth due to the 
simultaneous presence of N2 together with O2 and liquid water (see also Krissansen-Totton et al., 2018). "
"In summary, the extent and diversity of O2-dominated atmospheres on Earth-like planets is currently 
difficult to estimate. Key uncertainties include the likelihood of photosynthesis occurring beyond the Earth and 
upon abiotic processes occurring in-situ in the atmosphere. Whereas biological O2 formation likely proceeds at 
the surface, abiotic O2 production likely peaks in the atmosphere depending on the trade-off between its 
chemical precursors and the availability of UV/XUV. This difference could lead to differing vertical distributions 
of O2 which if measurable could be a means to distinguish the two mechanisms. Strong and protracted outgassing 
of reduced compounds together with strong rainout and continental coverage and the presence of plate 
tectonics could lead to a reduction in the atmospheric O2 abundance via weathering.  We now apply the above 
ideas in order to discuss a current research question. "
" 
5.3.1 What is the fate of oxygen or/and water during runaway climate processes? "
"As discussed earlier, for planets that are close to their host stars, a runaway greenhouse could occur and 
the planet could develop a dense stream atmosphere with a hot climate for a certain period of time. If there is 
adequate UV radiation to dissociate water molecules and the XUV radiation imposed on the planet is strong 
enough, rapid loss of H and O will occur. Note that the loss of H has been suggested (Tian, 2015a) reach the ratio 
of 2:1 so that net loss of water occurs. If the initial loss of H is more than O, atmospheric O2 could build up and 
lead to more loss of O. If the inventory of water on the planet is massive, it is possible that the planet will remain 
a water-rich body with a dense steam atmosphere and an extended H and O envelope for an extended period of 
time. Such types of planets do not exist in our Solar System but might be observed in the future in exoplanetary 
systems. Observationally these types of planets would be similar to mini-Neptunes except that they have more 
oxygen in their extended atmospheres. We note that planets with an extended H and O envelope may also be 
experiencing a moist greenhouse state in which the atmosphere is not dense and steamy. "
"The initiation and maintenance of planetary (climate) runaway require an imbalance in climate 
feedbacks in which net positive (self-enforcing) feedbacks (e.g. ocean evaporation-greenhouse heating; ice-
albedo) outbalance net negative stabilizing feedbacks (carbonate-silicate cycle; cloud reflection; Planck 
emission). Some key processes which could prevent a runaway planet from accumulating O2 are as follows. 
Firstly, O2 may be absorbed into the magma ocean if the mantle is sufficiently reducing (see e.g. Wordsworth et 
al., 2018). Secondly, the surface could remove O2 via weathering (see 5.3) depending on e.g. mineral composition, 
or/and the presence of plate tectonics. Processes one or/and two could have occurred on early Venus and Venus-
like worlds (see Wong et al., 2019). Thirdly, O2 could rapidly escape in the hydrodynamical regime (see e.g. "
"Bolmont et al., 2017; Johnstone et al., 2019) e.g. if the star is highly active in XUV, as discussed. Modeling studies 
are required to disentangle the fate of oxygen and water due to runaway climate effects. 
 
5.4 Methane atmospheres 
 
5.4.1 What would Titan look like closer to the sun? "
"We discuss here a thought-experiment in which modern Titan is shifted towards the Sun and then 
consider how the atmosphere would respond. We consider thereby Titan as an example of an icy body 
(waterworld) which has migrated inwards from beyond the snowline (see e.g. Léger et al., 2004). The potential 
habitability of waterworlds was discussed in e.g. Goldblatt (2015) and Kite and Ford (2018). A central aim of our 
thought experiment is to instigate further discussion and to encourage additional modeling studies of 
atmospheric evolution on these worlds to understand atmospheric diversity. Note that Turbet et al., (2018) 
considered how Titan would evolve if placed at the orbit of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. They concluded that such a 
warm Titan would likely be efficiently depleted in CH4 due to strong photolysis. This is favored since CH4, unlike 
H2O, continuously exists in ""moist greenhouse"" since firstly, it has no atmospheric cold trap being hard to 
condense, and secondly, it absorbs efficiently in the near infrared which weakens the cold trap.  "
"Titan has a cold (94K) surface temperature with ~1.5 bar N2-dominated atmosphere containing ~1.4% 
CH4 in the stratosphere, up to ~5% CH4 near the surface (Tobie et al., 2005) and thick organic hazes in the middle 
and upper atmosphere (see e.g. Yung and DeMore, 1999 and references therein). Much was learnt about Titan’s 
atmosphere during the Cassini mission (see e.g. Coustenis et al., 2009). Krasnopolsky (2019) reviews 
observational and modeling insight. At the start of our thought experiment, instellation begins to increase so 
that methane in the upper layers is photodissociated e.g. at Lyman-alpha wavelengths to form (in the case of 
CH4) a mixture of radicals (C1D, CH, CH2, CH3) and hydrogen (H2, H) species (see Gans et al., 2011) and their ions. 
Nitrogen is also dissociated in the EUV into nitrogen atoms and ions. Titan’s mass is only 6.7% that of the Earth 
(~3.3 Earth moons) so that the atomic hydrogen resulting from methane photolysis could be efficiently lost as 
Titan moves inwards. This mechanism could be especially important for early exo-Titans which migrate inwards 
when the young central star is active in XUV. With increasing temperatures, evaporation of the lighter (short 
chain) organic aerosol is generally favored over heavier (long chain) aerosols which condense more easily than 
their lighter chain counterparts. The climate response of the thick haze is however potentially complex since it 
could either counteract (amplify) warming from increased instellation by reflecting (scattering) incoming 
shortwave radiation depending on its composition, shape, size distribution and altitude.  "
"An interesting level of instellation is reached in our thought experiment where the surface temperature 
exceeds Tevap(CH4) ~112K at which point liquid methane begins to boil. Lidar data from Cassini (Mastrogiuseppe et 
al., 2014) suggests Titan’s methane-ethane lakes would lead to ~70m mean coverage on Titan’s surface but 
contain only ~1.4% of atmospheric methane. Evaporation would therefore lead to only a modest influx of 
methane into the atmosphere. This would likely block incoming radiation, strengthen the anti-greenhouse effect 
and favor haze formation, but increase methane photolysis in the upper layers and hence likely increasing escape 
rates of hydrogen (a product of methane photolysis). Another interesting level of instellation is reached where 
water ice or/and ammonia-water layers melt (see e.g. Tobie et al., 2005) which have an estimated mean thickness 
from 50 to 200km based on Cassini orbital data (see e.g. Hemingway et al., 2013 and references therein). This 
global melting event could lead to the formation of deep surface oceans containing ammonium hydroxide which 
has a strongly suppressed freezing point compared to water.  "
"Further increasing instellation could eventually lead to evaporation of the NH3 and H2O ocean (see Yang 
et al., 2017). Depending on the UV environment, the H2O vapor could photolyse to form the hydroxyl (OH) radical 
which is a strong in-situ sink for atmospheric CH4, whereas the NH3 (if not efficiently shielded from UV) would by 
photolytically removed (see. e.g. Wolf and Toon, 2010). A plausible scenario for the final atmospheric state is 
therefore mainly N2 with some water vapor and CH4 depending on the uncertain initial water inventory and rate 
of atmospheric escape. Such a habitable state could however be potentially short-lived because of the relatively 
short timescale of H loss.  
 Although numerous studies have modeled Titan’s climate and composition, also with General 
Circulation Models (see e.g. Lora et al., 2015; Lebonnois et al., 2012) there are much fewer studies investigating 
Titan’s atmospheric response to changing insolation. Lorenz and Lunine (1997) modelled Titan’s future 
atmosphere response as the Sun evolves into a red giant. They proposed an initial insensitivity to increasing solar 
energy due to the thick organic haze and discussed UV-haze feedbacks as the Sun reddened and weakened in UV 
output.  They also discussed the potential presence of water-ammonia oceans. McKay et al., (1991) discussed 
potential climate responses on modern Titan due to the net greenhouse heating effect (+15K) which they 
decomposed into (a) an anti-greenhouse cooling (-9K) due to hazes plus (b) greenhouse heating (+21K)  due to 
collision-induced absorption of N2-N2, CH4-N2 and H2-N2.  "
"In an exoplanetary context, since modern Titan’s atmosphere originates either directly from the 
Saturnian high density disk or/and from cometary impacts early in its history (e.g. Lunine et al., 1998), one can 
therefore anticipate exo-Titan atmospheres to consist of N2-NH3-CH4-H2 gas mixtures depending on e.g. the 
location and timescale of formation and the role of cometary delivery. Migration likely depends on numerous 
factors such as the timing and location of the object’s early growth.  The presence of a large primordial H2 
envelope could strongly influence the photochemistry since H2 participates in “cracking” cycles which shorten 
the atmospheric hydrocarbon chain, as occurs also on Jupiter (see Yung and DeMore, 1999). On modern Titan, 
H2 is scarce, so the “cracking” effect is weak and photochemical cycles involving radical-radical combination lead 
to build-up of long chain hydrocarbons which fall out of the atmosphere and form tar like substances on the 
surface. "
"Gilliam and McKay (2011) simulated an exo-Titan with the same instellation as modern Titan but placed 
around an M4 dwarf star. Results suggested that enhanced incoming IR from the star could penetrate the exo-
atmosphere more efficiently since the haze is more transparent at such wavelengths. This led in their study to 
~10K surface warming to ~104K which is only ~7K below the boiling point of CH4.  One can therefore imagine 
exo-Titans which are moderately warmer than modern Titan so that the methane lakes have evaporated. Finally, 
note that proposed cryo-volcanism driven by tidal-heating on modern Titan (see e.g. Tobie et al., 2006) which 
could supply CH4 into Titan’s atmosphere from clathrate hydrates beneath the surface - would of course stop 
operating had Titan migrated inwards early in its history. This could shorten methane recycling timescales 
between surface and atmosphere by removing a potentially significant source.  "
"In summary our Titan-based thought experiment suggests that migrated bodies from beyond the ice line 
could feature oceans containing ammonia-water mixtures with depressed freezing points or/and atmospheres 
consisting of steam-ammonia-methane-nitrogen mixtures depending on e.g. the origin and rate of migration and 
the incoming instellation. 
 
5.5 Carbon monoxide atmospheres "
"Carbon monoxide (CO) can be formed in planetary atmospheres by several mechanisms including (a) in-
situ gas-phase processes e.g. via photolysis of CO2 or (b) outgassing if redox conditions in the mantle are suitable 
or (c) thermodynamically at high pressures and temperatures. For example, in the middle to lower atmosphere 
of Hot Jupiters and sub-Neptunes, CO can be the thermodynamically favored form of carbon for suitable 
metallicities.  
 
5.5.1 In-situ gas phase formation via CO2 photolysis  "
"CO2 features temperature-dependent photolysis in the UV absorption band at 120<λ<210nm to form 
CO(1Σ+) and (mostly) the ground-state O(3P) triplet together with vibrationally-excited O(1D) singlet (e.g. Schmidt 
et al., 2013). The product CO(1Σ+) can itself photolyse below 167nm. The atomic oxygen triplet can undergo 
three-body (termolecular) self-combination to form O2. For Earth-like atmospheres orbiting (F,G,K) stars, Selsis 
(2002) suggested that O2 formed abiotically in CO2-dominated atmospheres could limit its own production by 
absorbing the same photons needed to split CO2. For planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, however, the extended pre-
main sequence and strong early XUV was proposed to drive strong abiotic oxygen production through either (a) 
photolysis of CO2 followed by self-reaction of oxygen or (b) photolysis of H2O followed by rapid loss of H (see e.g. 
Luger and Barnes, 2015) as discussed above. The reverse reaction to the first step in (a) i.e. involving three-body 
(termolecular) recombination of CO and O is electronically quantum spin forbidden (Jasper and Dawes, 2013) 
and typically proceeds with a gas-phase rate ~104 times slower than the forward photolysis reaction in planetary 
atmospheres (Krasnopolsky, 1982).  "
"Families of gas-phase reactive species involving e.g. hydrogen oxides (HOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 
chlorine oxides (ClOx) can catalytically drive the recombination of CO and O into CO2. It is convenient to group 
fast-reacting species into “families” in this way since although the individual species can quickly inter-react, the 
sum of their concentrations (e.g. HOx=OH+HO2) is removed more slowly from the atmosphere and is therefore 
conserved (on timescales of ~weeks). Calculating the sum HOx, NOx, ClOx etc. is therefore useful since it indicates 
the atmosphere’s potential to drive catalytic cycles which e.g. form  CO2 from its precursors (on Mars and Venus) 
or to destroy ozone (on Earth). The family members are formed from so-called reservoir species which generally 
have longer lifetimes (weeks to months) and which typically release the reactive forms, HOx, NOx and ClOx via 
photolysis or thermal decomposition. Examples of reservoir molecules include nitric acid (HNO3), nitrogen 
pentoxide (N2O5) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). "
"Tian et al. (2014) suggested that high (FUV/NUV) ratios characteristic of M-dwarf stars (with ratio values 
up to x100 higher than the Sun) could favor abiotic O2 from CO2 photolysis in planetary atmospheres since firstly, 
strong FUV favors CO2 photolysis and secondly, weak NUV favors low release rates of HOx and NOx from their 
reservoirs hence weak regeneration of CO2. To develop these ideas further, it would be interesting to quantify "
"with climate-chemistry modeling studies the effect of varying (FUV/NUV) upon the release of HOx, NOx and ClOx 
in different background atmospheres and to clarify the role(s) of different reservoir molecules over a range of 
UV environments considering e.g. weakly-bonded reservoirs such as nitrous acid (HONO) and hypochlorous acid 
(HOCl) which photolyse in the visible and NUV respectively; medium-strength reservoirs such as chlorine nitrate 
(ClONO2), peroxynitric acid (HO2NO2) and nitric acid (HNO3) which photolyse in the UV and strongly-bound 
reservoirs  such as HCl and H2O which photolyse in the UV and EUV. On Mars and Venus, HOx and ClOx cycles 
respectively have been suggested to play an important role in regenerating CO2 (see e.g. Yung and DeMore, 1999 
and references therein). Stock et al. (2017) modelled catalytic cycles which operate in the modern Martian 
atmosphere. Grenfell et al., (2010) suggested an alternative route to converting CO into CO2 via heterogeneous 
oxidation of CO on the surface of transition metal containing minerals such as hematite on (hot) planetary 
surfaces.  "
"Could CO-dominated atmospheres build-up in-situ via CO2 photolysis in the gas-phase? This would 
require firstly, CO2-rich atmospheres which photolyse into CO plus O under conditions where the reverse reaction 
(reforming CO2) is suppressed due to a lack of HOx, NOx or ClOx (see Selsis et al., 2002). In general, HOx is formed 
in atmospheres with trace amounts of water vapor in the presence of UV whereas NOx can build up in 
atmospheres containing N2 with some O2 in the presence of EUV or/and cosmic rays and lightning. Secondly, 
build-up of a CO-dominated atmosphere would be favored by atmospheres in which the abiotic O2 formed as a 
by-product of CO2 photolysis could be removed by weathering (see 5.3 and Zahnle et al., 2008). "
"In summary, CO atmospheres could therefore be favored for atmospheres with the following conditions:  
(1) strong early CO2 outgassing, (2) dry atmospheres (suggesting low HOx), (3) weak dynamical transport cells 
(suggesting weak lightning), (4) protected from cosmic rays. Attaining a CO-dominated atmosphere in this way 
would require removal of the co-produced abiotic O2 via e.g. weathering. More work is required however to 
explore this parameter range. Zahnle et al. (2008) (their Figure 11) explored a parameter range where CO is 
favored depending upon humidity and temperature. They also noted that CO atmospheres on early Mars, if they 
existed, could have left behind metal carbonyls in the Martian soil, which would be a proxy for their existence.  
 
5.5.2 Outgassing "
"Outgassing of CO directly could also favor formation of CO-dominated atmospheres on early terrestrial 
exoplanets if mantle fugacity is suitable (Miyakawa et al., 2002). On modern Earth, even if carbon were outgassed 
as CO, it would nevertheless be rapidly removed due to its rather short lifetime of ~2 months (Novelli et al., 1994) 
in Earth’s damp troposphere which proceeds mainly (~85% Khalil and Rasmussen, 1990) via HOx-catalysed CO-
oxidation into CO2 with smaller contributions from surface losses and diffusion into the stratosphere.   "
" 
5.5.3 Thermodynamics "
"Observed values of CO, CH4 and H2O in the atmospheres of Hot Jupiters (e.g. Tinneti et al., 2007; de Kok 
et al.,2013) and in particular the [CO/CH4] ratio have presented a challenge for photochemical-climate-transport 
models to interpret (see e.g. Venot et al., 2014 and references therein). More work for example is required to 
understand better the potential role of e.g. vertical transport, metallicity and photochemistry upon [CO/CH4] in 
such atmospheres. CO is generally the thermodynamically favored form of carbon compared to CH4 in (Ultra) Hot 
Jupiters [U(HJs)] for pressure regions typically sampled during emission (Kataria, et al., 2016) such that [CO/CH4] 
~10 for cooler HJs increasing to up 10-8 for UHJs and where the sum [CO+CH4] constitutes ~1% of the atmosphere. 
More work is required however to understand better the potential role of e.g. vertical transport and 
photochemistry upon the [CO/CH4] ratio. "
"Regarding warm and hot SEs, modeling work by Hu et al. (2014) (their Figures 5 and 6) suggested that 
chemical equilibrium favors CO-dominated atmospheres e.g. for GJ1214b and for 55 Cancri e in the pressure 
region (1-100mb) (assuming 0.5<X[C/O]<2 and X[H]<0.5, where ‘X’ denotes mole fraction) generally observable by 
transmission spectroscopy. More work is required to explore the role of photochemistry and the importance of 
vertical transport which can upwell CO from lower hotter regions where it is thermodynamically favored. "
" 
5.5.4 Other Processes "
"Additional sources of atmospheric CO potentially important on e.g. Early Earth include delivery of CO 
directly via comets (e.g. Lupu et al., 2007). Another suggested source of CO occurs on the surface of hot metallic 
iron from impact plumes which can reduce CO2 into CO (Kasting, 1990). Finally, it is interesting to note that 
Miyakawa et al. (2002) suggested there is no geological proxy to preclude CO-dominated atmospheres on Early 
Earth and that such atmospheres could even have favored prebiotic synthesis.  
 
5.6 Sulphur-containing atmospheres "
"Sulfur and its compounds have fascinatingly diverse applications in planetary science. This diversity 
stems from sulfur’s ability to adopt a range of redox and valence states which enable the formation of stable 
chemical compounds applicable to a wide range of chemical and biological systems extending from the planetary 
interior to the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere.  
 
5.6.1 Solar System "
"Regarding Earth, the modern and ancient global sulfur cycles were reviewed by e.g. Brimblecombe 
(2014) and Fike et al. (2015) respectively. In Earth’s core, seismology measurements suggest that light alloying 
elements including sulfur could be present (see e.g. review by Poirier, 1994; sulfur compounds were also 
suggested to occur in the core of other planets such as Mercury (Rivoldini et al., 2009) and Mars (Schubert and 
Spohn, 1990). In Earth’s upper mantle, sulfur compounds are estimated to make up 300-400ppm (von Gehlen, 
1992). On Earth’s surface sulfur is cycled from lithosphere to interior via burial of oxidized (sulfate) and reduced 
(sulfide) and returned to the atmosphere via outgassing of e.g. H2S and SO2. Analyzing deviations from standard 
mass dependent fractionation of isotope ratios in sulfur sediments from the Early Earth (see e.g. Harman et al., 
2018) can be used as a proxy for atmospheric oxygen abundance.  "
"In modern Earth’s atmosphere, important surfaces sources of sulfur-containing species include: SO2 (60-
80 Tg S/yr) and H2S (7-8 Tg S/yr) arising mainly via anthropogenic and volcanic emissions and dimethyl sulfide 
(DMS) (CH3-S-CH3) (13-25 Tg S/yr) arising mainly via biogenic emissions (Sheng et al., 2015). Potentially complex 
gas-phase oxidation cycles in the troposphere (see for example von Glasow and Crutzen, 2004) involving oxidants 
such as hydroxyl (OH) and ozone (O3) then lead to formation of gas-phase sulfur trioxide (SO3) which quickly 
undergoes the gas-phase reaction: SO3+H2O+M🡪H2SO4+M (where ‘M’ denotes any species needed to carry away 
excess vibrational energy). The gas-phase products sulfuric acid quickly reacts with liquid water to form sulfate 
aerosol. The so-called Junge layer (Junge et al., 1961) denotes Earth’s stable, globally-distributed sulfate aerosol 
peaking around 18-22km which influences climate, clouds and composition. Faloona (2009) review uncertainties 
in the processes affecting atmospheric sulfur in the Earth’s marine boundary layer. "
"On Venus, a thick cloud layer extends from ~48 to 70km which likely consists mostly of sulfate aerosol 
droplets formed from SO2 oxidation. These clouds strongly influence atmospheric albedo, climate and 
composition. Below the clouds at 35-40km, VEx data (Svedhem et al., 2007) suggested 50-500ppmv SO2 and 2-8 
ppmv COS. Above the clouds, Mahieux et al. (2015) suggested significant variability of SO2 (from ~tens to 
hundreds of ppbv) based on Venus Express (VEx) data.  Sulfur-based catalytic gas-phase cycles have been 
proposed above the clouds (Yung and Demore, 1999, their chapter 8) to drive recycling of CO back into CO2 on 
Venus. Recent observations of the glory phenomenon by Vex (Markiewicz et al., 2014) suggested that elemental 
polysulfur chains or/and iron sulfide could be the unknown UV absorber. "
"On Mars, the presence of mineral sulfates (see e.g. review by King and McLennan, 2010), (which were 
also suggested by the Curiosity Rover, Nachon et al., 2017), together with a general lack of carbonates, suggest 
that sulfur cycles could have played an important role in the lithosphere-atmosphere system on early Mars. Some 
works e.g. Tian et al., (2009), Kerber et al., (2015) modelled the influence of atmospheric SO2 and sulfate aerosol 
upon climate on early Mars. Results suggested e.g. that sulfate aerosol cooling could prevent SO2 greenhouse 
heating from producing habitable surface conditions. Halevy and Head (2014) used an updated model to 
reinvestigate this problem. They found that on a cold, early, dusty Mars the net effect of SO2 outgassing could 
be warming yet could be cooling if the atmosphere is clear, consistent with the findings in Tian et al. (2009). 
  In the outer Solar System, observations of sulfur-containing atmospheric species are rather sparse. 
Wong et al. (2004) suggested (68-110) ppmv of H2S in the deep Jovian atmosphere (from 8.9-11.7 bar) based on 
a revised Galileo Probe analysis. Sulfur-containing species could make up an important constituent of clouds e.g. 
NH4SH detected on Saturn (Baines et al., 2009) and H2S on Uranus (Irwin et al., 2018). Regarding the icy moons, 
SO2 has been detected on Io as discussed above (see Table 1). Moses et al. (2002) modelled photochemical 
responses of sulfur species during volcanic eruptions on Io. Some studies hypothesized biogeochemical cycles 
including sulfate occurring in the deep oceans of icy moons such as Europa (Zolotov and Shock, 2004). "
"Regarding exoplanets, what range of sulfur-containing atmospheres could be feasible? On terrestrial 
planets under oxidizing conditions (e.g. on Earth or above the cloud-top on Venus) in the presence of UV, reduced 
sulfur compounds could form oxidized species such as SO3. This species quickly reacts with trace amounts of 
water vapor to form sulfate aerosol. Under reducing conditions (e.g. on giant planets), on the other hand, 
reduced sulfur species such as NH4SH or/and elemental sulfur could condense to form aerosol.  The model study 
by Hu et al. (2013) for example, who investigated H2-dominated atmospheres for SEs for example suggested the 
presence of sulfur which can form multiple structures including a stable S8 crown (whose spatial arrangement 
leads to low strain on the S-S bonding) which could condense and form aerosol. Kaltenegger and Sasselov (2010) 
discuss spectral signals for sulfur species assuming hypothetical exoplanetary geochemical sulfur cycles. 
Regarding gas planets, Zahnle et al., (2016) also noted the potential importance of S8 hazes in their model study "
"of the warm Jupiter 51 Eri b.  Zahnle et al. (2009) discussed sulfur photochemistry on hot Jupiters (see also Gao 
et al., 2015). Loftus et al. (2019) evaluated the co-existence of a thick (observable) sulphur aerosol haze layer 
together with a significant ocean on a rocky exoplanet, including the fundamentals of the sulphur cycle. Results 
suggest that such an observable haze layer is not compatible with such an ocean. "
"Could sulfur containing or even sulfur-dominated atmospheres be common in nature? There are 
theoretical arguments which suggest that the build-up sulfur-dominated atmospheres could be challenging: in 
oxidizing atmospheres, sulfur species would be converted to sulfate aerosol which would eventually undergo 
removal via deposition or washout; in reducing atmospheres e.g. elemental sulfur such as stable S8 could similarly 
build-up, condense and undergo removal. The extent by which sulfur species can build up depends therefore on 
the UV intensity and the abundance of water-vapor. Increased sulfur abundances are expected to be favored for 
weak UV, dry conditions. 
 
5.7 Nitrogen Atmospheres "
"Nitrogen species play a major role in planetary atmospheres, influencing climate, composition and (on 
Earth) biogeochemical cycling. Modern VEM have surface partial pressures of N2 equal to (3.3, 0.78 and 1.7x10-
4) bar respectively (Yung and DeMore, 1999). VEM interiors are estimated to have (2.2, 3.4, 0.3) (in units of 1019) 
kg N respectively (Johnson and Goldblatt, 2015) where values are uncertain by a factor of two to three. The 
evolution of atmospheric nitrogen on VEM and terrestrial exoplanets was discussed e.g. in Lammer et al., (2019). 
Wordsworth (2016) suggested that enhanced nitrogen in the Venusian atmosphere compared with Earth could 
be related to stronger N2 outgassing on Venus, related to enhanced oxidation of the mantle due to enhanced 
H2O photolysis followed by H-escape. Goldblatt et al. (2009) and Wordsworth and Pierrehumbert (2013) 
suggested that atmospheric molecular nitrogen could have helped warm the early Earth to achieve and maintain 
habitable conditions. A difficulty of this hypothesis is that the atmospheric pressure on Archean Earth might have 
been too low to support a strong N2-H2 greenhouse effect based on measured raindrop distributions ~3 Ga (Som 
et al., 2012; Som et al., 2016). The model study of von Paris et al. (2013) suggested that adding 0.5 bar N2 to the 
early Martian atmosphere led to +13K surface warming. In the present work, we summarize important general 
processes affecting atmospheric nitrogen evolution with the aim of discussing what possible range of 
atmospheric N2 abundances could be expected on terrestrial exoplanets. We do not focus here on the so-called 
waterworlds since potential nitrogen cycles on such worlds are likely very different (see discussion in Lammer et 
al., 2019). "
"Important processes affecting planetary nitrogen evolution include (1) delivery during planet formation 
via nitrogen-containing ices present on bodies from the outer solar system (see section 3.4.4). Recent estimates 
of modern Earth’s nitrogen budget suggest ~x50 times the present day Atmospheric Mass N2 (AMN) which is 
mainly stored in the mantle (~x7 AMN in reduced forms, NHx) and possibly a large reservoir in the core (~x43 
AMN alloyed with iron in the form FexNy as suggested by Laneuville et al., 2018, their Table 1) (see also Marty, 
1995); (2) regarding early hydrodynamic escape of nitrogen, Lammer et al., (2018) discussed weak loss on early 
Venus and Earth but efficient loss on early Mars based on nitrogen isotope data; (3) outgassing which depends 
on mantle redox and pH which determine whether nitrogen exists in the molecular state (easily outgassed, 
favored at  pH ~1-3 at ~positive Quartz-Fayalite-Magnetite buffer values in mantle wedges) or in the ammonic 
(NH4+) state (easily retained, favored at negative pH in the upper mantle, see e.g. Mikhail et al., (2017) and Zerkle 
and Mikhail (2017) their Figure 2). Lammer et al., (2019) suggested ambient N2 reached up to ~0.2bar during the 
Archaean associated with e.g. outgassing at the magma ocean phase;  (4) efficient dissolution of outgassed N2 
into the mantle during the MO phase (Wordsworth, 2016); (5) efficient biological fixation and denitrification  with 
a rate of ~1-2 x102 Tg N year on modern Earth (Laneuville et al., 2018; see also Canfield, 2010); (6) lightning which 
fixates molecular nitrogen at a rate of  ~(3-10)x109kg N/yr on modern Earth (Laneuville et al., 2018). The resulting 
nitrogen-containing reactive species form nitrogen oxides or/and nitric acid (HNO3) which is efficiently dissolved 
by scavenging rain droplets and washed out into the ocean on timescales of weeks to months to form 
thermodynamically stable nitrate (NO3- ) anions; (7) cosmic rays (see discussion below) which can remove N2 and 
O2 on Earth especially at higher latitudes during strong solar activity (see e.g. Jackman et al., 2005); molecular 
nitrogen can be returned to the atmosphere via outgassing  with an estimated rate (including the contribution 
from mid-ocean ridges) of up to ~0.4x109 kg N/yr (Laneuville et al., 2018, their section 2.6); (8) meteoritic impacts 
can thermolyse atmospheric nitrogen where reaction products form nitrogen oxides and are removed from the 
atmosphere (Grady et al., 1998); (9) escape, depending upon upper atmosphere temperature and incoming XUV 
on the Hadean Earth which are not well constrained (see discussion in e.g. Lammer et al., 2019). "
"Regarding theories and proxy data for nitrogen on early Earth, surface partial pressure of nitrogen was 
likely low during Earth’s magma ocean phase due to efficient dissolution of nitrogen from the atmosphere into 
the hot mantle (see Lammer et al., 2019; Wordsworth, 2016). Som et al. (2012) suggested an upper limit of about 
twice modern levels for Archaean surface air density based on an analysis of fossilized raindrop imprints. "
"Kavanagh and Goldblatt (2015) revised the method and suggested an upper limit of about four times the modern 
value. An updated study by Som et al. (2016) then revised downwards the Archean upper limit for atmospheric 
surface density, to a value less than half the modern amount. Regarding model studies, Rimmer and Rugheimer 
(2019) suggested that ~0.3 bar surface pressure on Early Earth would enable sufficient oxidizing conditions in the 
upper atmosphere to oxidize incoming Archaean micrometeorites, consistent with proxy data. Johnson and 
Goldblatt (2018) modelled the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle including deep and shallow ocean 
parameterizations and linking with phosphorous chemistry in the lithosphere. Their results for surface nitrogen 
partial pressure over Earth’s history varied from about (0.1 to 6.0) times the present day atmospheric nitrogen 
level, depending upon uncertainties in the amount of nitrogen in the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) as well as the timing 
and magnitude of key processes such as burial, continental evolution, weathering and  biological activity. In order 
for their evolutionary scenarios to finish with the correct present day atmospheric nitrogen (PAN) required (4 to 
6) times PAN to be present in the BSE. Stüeken et al. (2016) applied an Earth system box model to study the 
evolution of nitrogen on Earth. Results suggested that depending on uncertainties in nitrogen burial rates (which 
can strongly fluctuate based on the geological record) the surface partial pressure of nitrogen can vary from 
about (0.1 to 1.1) times the present day value. "
"Regarding exoplanets, Lammer et al. (2019) considered the effect upon atmospheric nitrogen evolution 
for (a) an Earth-like planet without plate tectonics, (b) a planet with anoxic life, and (c) an Earth-like planet where 
life becomes extinct. Their results suggested that in case (a) the absence of plate tectonics would hinder mixing 
of oxidized forms of nitrogen into the mantle. This suggests enhanced abundances of nitrogen in its reduced 
forms (e.g. NH4+) in the interior, which are more easily retained hence only a weak conversion to N2 and reduced 
outgassing of nitrogen. In case (b) anoxic fixation in the absence of denitrification led to low atmospheric nitrogen 
whereas in case (c) the absence of nitrogen recycling associated with life resulted in atmospheric nitrogen 
removal via lightning and cosmic rays reading to low atmospheric abundances.  Stüeken et al. (2016) also applied 
a biogeochemical box model to scenarios of anoxic planets with and without life. Their results suggested that 
whether atmospheric nitrogen could recover to present day levels depended on the rate of burial assumed and 
whether or not continents were assumed to be present (scenarios without continents did not lead to nitrogen 
recovery). Laneuville et al. (2018) modeled atmospheric nitrogen evolution on an Earth-like planet without life 
and suggested variations from ~(0.2 to 8) times the present atmospheric level (PAL) depending mainly on 
uncertainties in the atmospheric fixation rate due to e.g. lightning and cosmic rays, with a weaker variation of 
~(0.6 to 2) PAL arising due to uncertainties in mantle mixing and ocean circulation. "
"Regarding Earth-like planets orbiting in the close-in HZ of active, low mass stars, the atmosphere could 
be strongly exposed to high energy particles (Grenfell et al., 2012; Tabataba-Vakili et al., 2016; Scheucher et al., 
2018; Herbst et al., 2019, see also  Airapetian et al., 2018). Stellar proton events (SPEs) on Earth can dissociate 
molecular nitrogen and lead to ~2x1033 NO molecules/day (Jackman et al., 2005, their Table 1). Assuming such 
events are experienced continuously for an Earth-like planet orbiting an active M-dwarf star, would lead to a 
removal rate of atmospheric nitrogen due to cosmic rays of 0.04 Tg NO/yr. By comparison, lightning fixation on 
modern Earth (which without life would remove atmospheric nitrogen within a few hundred Myr without 
regassing; Laneuville et al., 2018) removes atmospheric nitrogen about x100 slower. For superflaring stars 
however (see e.g. Davenport, 2016) the cosmic ray fluxes could be 103 to 105 times higher than Earth SPEs, 
suggesting nitrogen removal fluxes up to ~4000 Tg/yr which would remove Earth’s atmospheric nitrogen in ~105 
years. In addition to potentially strong nitrogen removal due to cosmic rays, lightning removal could also be 
potentially strong on, for example, tidally-locked Earth-like exoplanets which could have strong day to night 
transport cells, although such effects are not well quantified. Planets with high meteoritic bombardment could 
fix and efficiently remove atmospheric nitrogen. "
"In summary, what range of N2 atmospheres could we expect in terrestrial exoplanets? Earth system 
modeling suggests values from below a tenth of a bar up to several bar over Earth’s history. Isotope estimates 
suggest a large range up to ~43 times the present day atmospheric budget in the Earth’s core. The extent and 
rate at which nitrogen is removed to the core during planet formation needs further study. The main 
uncertainties in atmospheric processes lie in the distribution of nitrogen in the Earth system and the timing and 
nature of key processes such as biology and subduction. Model feedbacks such as the effect of e.g. atmospheric 
oxidation via escape and the influence upon the interior are lacking. A detailed intercomparison of current 
nitrogen cycle models including their reservoirs and fluxes for clearly defined scenarios would be informative.  
On a positive note, there is some hope that exoplanet science could help by constraining nitrogen abundances 
from observing spectroscopic collisional pairs (Schwieterman et al., 2015 as mentioned above) which will be 
invaluable in disentangling the possible evolution scenarios. 
 
 
6. Conclusions "
" 
● Key properties such as the metallicity and early rotation rates of interstellar clouds could vary "
systematically across the Galaxy. The extent by which this variation could imprint itself upon resulting 
planetary diversity is currently unclear.  
" 
● Although tenuous atmospheres could have weak spectral features they could nevertheless feature large "
“cometary like” tails and transmission windows down to the surface - making them favorable targets in 
this respect. 
● If water delivery to rocky exoplanets depends mainly on impact-induced de-volatization during 
formation then water-rich terrestrial worlds could be quite common. If however it depends on a “Grand 
Tack” type analogue then more work is required to investigate how this mechanism operates for 
different exoplanetary systems. 
"● Magma oceans with silicate atmospheres, light primordial atmospheres and outgassing of massive "
steam atmospheres could be universal stages in the evolutionary track of rocky worlds. How long these 
"phases endure however depends on key processes such as instellation, escape and outgassing. "
"● The relative occurrence of oxidized atmospheres (e.g. O2, CO2, CO, H2O) compared with reduced "
atmospheres (CH4 and higher hydrocarbons) and other atmospheric compositions (e.g. sulfur and 
nitrogen-containing species) depends on numerous processes such as the initial disk metallicity and its 
"dynamics, how efficiently the planetary interior stores reduced compounds and also upon long-term "
"escape, outgassing and biogeochemical cycling. "
● Sulfur species can form aerosols in both oxidized and reduced atmospheres.  Build-up of such aerosols 
would eventually be limited by sedimentation and surface deposition. Sulfur-rich atmospheres could be 
"favored where conditions are (a) dry, since water is needed to form sulfate from its precursors, or (b) "
"have weak UV, which leads to suppressed formation of aerosol precursors. "
● Nitrogen abundances in the atmosphere vary over two orders of magnitude depending upon 
"uncertainties in interior, subduction and biological processes. "
