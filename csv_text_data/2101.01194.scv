"ABSTRACT
X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in AGN allow us to probe and understand the nature
of accretion in highly curved space-time, yet the most robust form of detection (i.e. repeat
detections over multiple observations) has been limited to a single source to-date, with only
tentative claims of single observation detections in several others. The association of those
established AGN QPOs with a specific spectral component has motivated us to search the
XMM-Newton archive and analyse the energy-resolved lightcurves of 38 bright AGN. We
apply a conservative false alarm testing routine folding in the uncertainty and covariance
of the underlying broad-band noise. We also explore the impact of red-noise leak and the
assumption of various different forms (power-law, broken power-law and lorentzians) for the
underlying broad-band noise. In this initial study, we report QPO candidates in 6 AGN (7
including one tentative detection in MRK 766) from our sample of 38, which tend to be
found at characteristic energies and, in four cases, at the same frequency across at least two
observations, indicating they are highly unlikely to be spurious in nature."

1 INTRODUCTION
"The accretion of gas onto black holes provides insights into the
behaviour of matter in the strong gravity regime and can therefore
test general relativity (GR) itself. As the X-rays trace the inner-
most regions (the disc and corona in black hole binaries – BHBs,
and the corona in AGN) it is the rapid variability in this band
which encodes the most valuable diagnostic information. Such stud-
ies have proven capable of disentangling the geometry of the flow
(Fabian et al. 2009; Kara et al. 2019;Wilkins & Fabian 2013; Alston
et al. 2020a) whilst quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), ubiquitous
in BHBs (Motta 2016) can provide information about the dynamics
of the disc and the effects of external torques (e.g. the Lense-Thirring
effect: Stella et al. 1999; Fragile et al. 2007; Ingram & Done 2011)."
"Discovering QPOs in AGN has been of importance for some
time, as they provide tests for the scalability of the accretion flow
by black hole mass (e.g. McHardy et al. 2006), and a ‘slow-motion’
view of the process creating them (i.e. many more photons per QPO
phase bin relative to BHBs). QPOs detected in BHBs (with masses
∼ 10M�) range from 1-100 s (the low frequency QPOs - LFQPOs),
to 0.01 - 0.1 s (the high frequency QPOs - HFQPOs, see Remillard
& McClintock 2006). Assuming a linear scaling to SMBH masses
of ∼106−7M� , implies AGN QPOs should have periods of days to
weeks for LFQPO analogues, and hundreds of seconds to hours for
the HFQPOs. It is therefore reasonable to speculate that, should a"

"simple scaling hold, the latter should be present within some long
observations of AGN taken by existing X-ray instruments."
"To-date there have been numerous claims of X-ray QPOs in
AGN, although only a very small number have proven to be statis-
tically robust upon detailed investigation. The first widely accepted
detection was in the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1), RE J1034+396
(Gierlinski et al. 2008) with a QPO period of approximately one
hour, thereby resembling a mass-scaled BHB HFQPO (Middleton
& Done 2010). This QPO has been speculated to originate in the
hardest energy spectral component, similar to the 67 Hz QPO of
GRS 1915+105 (Middleton et al. 2009, 2011), and has remained
detectable at around the same frequency across several observations
(Alston et al. 2014, Jin et al. 2020). The chance probability of mak-
ing a false signal appear across multiple observations at the same
frequency is extremely low, and so the repeat detection of the QPO
in RE J1034+396 lends strength to its identification as a bona-fide
signal. In addition to RE J1034+396, there has been aQPOdetection
claim in a single observation MS 2254.9-3712 (Alston et al. 2015)
with a period of ∼ 2 hours, and reports of possible QPOs following
different methodolgies in 1H 0707-495, MRK 766, IRAS 13224-
3809 and ARK 564 (McHardy et al. 2007; Pan et al. 2016; Zhang
et al. 2017, Zhang et al. 2018; Alston et al. 2019) (as well as in
tidal disruption events, e.g. Pasham et al. 2019a). The confirmation
of tentative QPO claims and the discovery of new AGN QPOs is
important; the present sample size of robust detections is extremely
small which hinders a rigorous analysis of their origin, and critiques
of their similarities or differences when compared to BHB QPOs."
Central to the detection of a QPO is a statistical method which

"robustly tests the null hypothesis, and accounts for the shape of
the underlying broad-band noise onto which the QPO is imprinted
(Vaughan 2005, 2010; Vaughan et al. 2016). Previous large-scale
efforts include González-Martín & Vaughan (2012) who studied
a large sample of 104 AGN and described the properties of the
high frequency noise en-masse but without locating new QPOs.
Here we build on previous work by searching for QPOs in energy-
resolvedAGN lightcurves, and present the discovery of several new
statistically significant QPO candidates."
"The paper is laid out as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the
AGN sample and our methods of data reduction for these obser-
vations. In Section 3 we outline the statistical framework for our
QPO search, including the tests we apply to probe any candidates in
greater detail. In Section 4 we outline the results of the QPO search.
In Section 5 we discuss the additional uncertainty in the broad-band
noise and its possible impact on QPO detections. Lastly, we discuss
the relevance and impact of our findings in Section 6."
2 OBSERVATIONS
2.1 AGN Sample
"We construct our AGN sample primarily from the Palomar Green
QSO (PGQSO) catalogue used by Crummy et al. (2006) and Mid-
dleton et al. (2007) as these are extremely bright sources and have
been well-studied by XMM-Newton; this provides high signal-to-
noise ratio data and the possibility of long (up to 130 ks) unbroken
observations. In addition to this sample, we include 1H 0707-495,
MS 22549-3712, NGC 4151, PHL 1092 and data from the most re-
cent campaign of IRAS 13224-3809 (see Alston et al. 2019, 2020b
for details). The total sample consists of 22 NLS1s and 16 Type-1
Seyferts, as defined by Veron-Cetty & Veron (2010). Of particu-
lar interest are the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 AGN, which include the
widely-accepted case of X-ray QPOs in RE J1034+396 (Gierlinski
et al. 2008) as well as the reported case in MS 2254.9-3712 (Alston
et al. 2015)."
2.2 Data Reduction
"For each AGN in our sample, we considered all observations in the
XMM-Newton public HEASARC archive1 up to September 2019
(see online table). We selected EPIC-PN data only for this analysis,
as the PN has a higher throughout than the MOS detectors leading
to a lower Poisson noise contribution. A circular aperture source
region of 40"" radius was centred on each AGN, with a background
source region (also a circular aperture of 40"" radius) positioned on
the sameCCD, but away from the source and chip read-out direction.
We then followed standard procedure of selecting only single/double
pixel events (with PATTERN<=4). Using the standard XMM-Newton
data reduction pipeline 2, we extracted source and background light
curves, using EVSELECT in SAS v17.0.0. We extracted lightcurves
with a binsize of 100 s and utilised a sliding energy window across
the nominal 0.3 - 10 keV range of the instrument. This window is
split into 50 approximately linear energy bins, allowing 1225 energy
combinations to be studied (e.g. 0.3 - 0.5 keV, 0.3 - 0.7 keV etc.).
We proceeded to use EPICLCCORR to subtract the background and
apply the necessary corrections to the light curves. Whilst detector
pile-up is present in some of the observations, the redistribution of"
"1 https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/
2 https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton/sas-thread-timing"
"counts from soft to hard energies (where the count rate is typically
much lower) is not expected to lead to false QPO detections as
non-QPO counts act to dilute the signal’s presence. Pile-up could,
however, result in QPO candidates being located in energy bands in
which they are not intrinsically the strongest. We will re-visit this
issue in a forthcoming paper and here re-iterate that there will be
some unaccounted-for distortion."
"For each observation, the high-energy (10 - 12 keV), full-field
background lightcurve was extracted with a binsize of 10s in order
to identify soft-proton events which could contaminate the source
lightcurve. We apply a cut-off such that any flares at 5𝜎 (where 𝜎 is
the standard deviation in the 10-12 keV lightcurve) ormore above the
stable (non-flaring) count rate level are removed. This process can
introduce gaps into the lightcurves, which, if left unmodified, have
the potential to introduce peaks in power (making QPO detections
harder). Whist there is no standard method to correct for gaps,
previous approaches include linearly interpolating between short
missing segments of data (e.g. < 200s), with count-rate variations
accounted for by drawing from a Poisson distribution (González-
Martín & Vaughan 2012; Alston et al. 2015). This method has the
caveat of introducing a non-red noise background component to the
light curve, which cannot replicate the component which has been
removed, and thus is best applied sparingly (e.g. the interpolation
used by Alston et al. 2015 is typically applied to < 0.5% of the
duration of the lightcurve)."
"In our analysis, we take the most conservative approach of
considering only the longest continuous segment between flares
(see Figure 1). This avoids all interpolation assumptions, but has
the limitation of reducing the amount of data available for analysis.
However, we find that many of the longest continuous segments in
our sample are of sufficient duration to probe down to ≤ 10−4 Hz,
below the frequencies of previously detectedAGNQPOs (Gierlinski
et al. 2008; Alston et al. 2015)."
"We also note that we automatically create the lightcurve of the
background, the periodogram of which we can inspect to ensure
that any potential QPO candidate is associated with the AGN. An
example of this is shown in Figure 1, where the absence of a feature
in the background confirms the QPO candidate originates in the
AGN, in this case, in NGC 4051."
3 PERIODOGRAM ANALYSIS AND QPO SEARCH
"A robust statistical framework in which to search for QPOs in broad-
band noise is vital (see Vaughan & Uttley 2005), and we base our
approach on that of Vaughan (2005). We produce periodograms for
each energy-resolved lightcurve (reduced to 2𝑛 bins where 𝑛 is an
integer) by applying a fast-Fourier transform (FFT) and a fractional-
rms normalisation (Vaughan et al. 2003). Using the periodogram
(rather than averaged power spectral distribution: PSD) allows us to
maximise the number of Fourier frequencies, improving our con-
straints when modelling, whilst also allowing for QPO searches
down to the lowest possible frequencies in the lightcurve."
"Similar to the work by González-Martín & Vaughan (2012),
we fit the periodogram using the maximum likelihood statistic.
Following Vaughan (2005), we see that maximising the likelihood,
L, is equivalent to minimising 𝑆 ≡ −2 ln [L]. Assuming a model"

3.1 Analysis Procedure
"We first apply the plc model to our periodogram, using maxi-
mum likelihood statistics inbuilt into a limited memory Broyden-
Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS-B) minimisation algorithm,
with bounds set at (-10, 10) for 𝛽 and (0, ∞) for the normalisation,
𝑁0. We perform a preliminary fit with this minimisation routine to
obtain the parameters (𝛽, 𝑁0) which are successful in minimising
the negative log likelihood, 𝑆. Following the procedure of Vaughan
(2005), we perform a frequency cut where the Poisson noise begins
to dominate over the red noise (where 𝐶 > 𝑃j), and ignore frequen-
cies above this. We set a minimum number of Fourier frequencies
in the remaining periodogram to ensure we have a sufficient num-
ber of degrees of freedom to constrain the underlying noise with
simple models (in practice we have set an arbitrary lower limit of
13 Fourier bins). Note, we reject any lightcurve/energy-bin where
the fitting returns a positive 𝛽, although this only occurs in the case
of poor quality or Poisson noise-dominated data."

3.1.1 Defining the null hypothesis
"We define a QPO candidate to be a peak of power above the broad-
band noise, and for simplicity, that this lies within a single Fourier
frequency bin. We follow Vaughan (2005), where we compute and
then maximise the ratio 𝑅 ="
"2𝐼j
𝑃j
, comparing the observed powers"
"𝐼j and the model powers, 𝑃j, across all frequencies. The frequency,
𝑗 , in which 𝑅j is maximised, is defined as the QPO candidate fre-
quency, aQ, with power, 𝑃Q."
"In order to determine the statistical significance of any out-
lier (or QPO candidate), we must first define our null hypothesis.
We define our null hypothesis to be the power in the QPO candi-
date, 𝑃Q, being a random fluctuation of the underlying red noise,
intrinsic to the AGN. Following Vaughan (2005), we remove the
candidate from the periodogram (leaving ≥ 12 bins as per our re-
strictions mentioned above) and refit up to the previously defined
white noise cutoff frequency, with a plcmodel in order to obtain the
best description of the underlying continuum (the impact of fixing
the position of the white noise cutoff is discussed in section 5.1).We
obtain constraints on the best-fitting model parameters by applying
a bootstrap-with-replacement L-BFGS-B minimisation algorithm,
using maximum likelihood statistics over 10,000 iterations. This
bootstrap-with-replacement method has several advantages over a
single fitting iteration including reducing the significance of any
individual bin variance."
"For each iteration of the bootstrap, we randomly draw initial
parameter estimates for use within the minimisation algorithm, us-
ing an arbitrary Gaussian distribution centred on the parameters of
the initial periodogram fit – (𝛽, 𝑁0) – and with a standard deviation
of ∼ 10%. This simple measure ensures the minimisation algorithm
most effectively searches across parameter space for a true global
minimum and does not prematurely meet the minimisation criteria."
"Over the 10,000 bootstrap iterations, we require a minimum
of 5% to fulfil the minimisation success criteria, which includes
returning a negative value of 𝛽. We group the resulting distribution
of successfully minimised bootstrapped parameters into 100 bins
and take the 1𝜎 distribution about the 50th percentile, to constrain
variation in mode. The modal values of these distributions represent
our new minimised set of parameters (𝛽, 𝑁0) which describe the
plc of the broad-band noise minus the QPO candidate."
"We note that in restricting our search to excess power residing
at a single Fourier frequency, any lower coherence feature which
spans more than one bin will lead to us inferring a flatter power-
law index and higher normalisation for the underlying broad band
noise. We act to reduce the impact of this through our bootstrap
fitting approach, which minimises the effect of individual bins on
the overall model fit."
3.1.2 Power-law vs broken power-law
"Given sufficient data quality, AGN power spectra spanning a large
frequency rangemay be better described by a broken power law (Ut-
tley et al. 2002; McHardy et al. 2007; González-Martín & Vaughan
2012). To explore the presence of a break, we also fitted each peri-
odogram with a bknplc, and used a Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC) test (Liddle 2007) to evaluate the statistical preference be-
tween the plc and bknplcmodels. For the fitting process, we again
used an L-BFGS-B minimisation algorithm, with bounds of (-10,
0), (-10, 0), (0, ∞) for parameters 𝛽1, 𝛽2 and 𝑁1 respectively, over
a set of possible break frequencies: ab,j (we note that we require 𝛽1
and 𝛽2 to only take physically relevant, negative values). In order
to perform a consistent BIC test, we kept the number of frequency"
"bins the same between plc and bknplcmodels, with possible break
frequencies set to lie below thewhite noise cutoff frequency. Finally,
we reject any maximum likelihood model fit where 𝛽2 > 𝛽1. The
BIC is defined as:"
𝐵𝐼𝐶 = 𝑆 + 𝑘 ln (𝑚) (5)
"with negative log-likelihood, 𝑆, number of model parameters, 𝑘
and number of data points, 𝑚 (the number of data points in our
periodogram). The 𝐵𝐼𝐶 value is minimised for the most statistically
preferred model, i.e. it allows us to identify which model, plc or
bknplc, best describes our observed data (we explore the impact of
noise entering from outside of our bandpass in Section 5)."
"Across our sample of non-white noise dominated observations
(i.e. those with sufficient data points for our analysis), we find the
bknplc model is preferred in ∼ 10% of cases. By comparison
González-Martín & Vaughan (2012), found 16% of AGN PSDs in
their sample to be best described by a bending power-law, and, as
with our analysis, themajority by a simple power-law. For simplicity,
we chose to focus on the remaining datasets best described with a
plc model, although we note the possibility that – should a break
be present – in some cases we will lack a sufficient number of
frequency bins below it to constrain its presence. We explore the
impact of such unreported breaks on our QPO candidate detection –
and the potential impact of more complex broad band noise models
– later in the paper."
3.1.3 Uncertainty on the best-fitting plc model
"In order to have a more complete grasp of our null hypothesis,
we consider the uncertainty on the maximum likelihood parame-
ters which describe the broad-band noise model. To do so we can
follow the approach of Vaughan (2005) and use Δ𝑆 = −2Δ ln [L]
to map confidence contours, analogous to Δ𝜒2. For a generic M-
dimensional model, we would expect the relationship between pa-
rameters to form an M-dimensional paraboloid. Vaughan (2005)
demonstrates this for the simple 2-dimensional power-law case,
where the relationship between parameters (𝛽, log[𝑁0]) forms a
highly covariant ellipse. The 1𝜎 parameter limits are defined fol-
lowing 𝜒2a where in this case, a is the number of model parameters
(such that 1𝜎 for a 2-dimensional model occurs at ΔS = 2.3), and
may be determined from mapping the Δ𝑆 space. Given these confi-
dence limits, it is then possible to determine the terms of the covari-
ance matrix (Coe 2009) describing the M-dimensional Gaussian
distribution, which can then be used as the basis for Monte-Carlo
simulations."
"A direct approach to modelling the parameter space is to use a
numerical grid; this allows the 1𝜎 parameter limits to be accurately
determined, but is computationally intensive and also dependent
on the data quality (which sets the scale of the initial grid). Semi-
analytical methods assuming a Gaussian symmetry in the parameter
space can also provide reasonable limiting values, however, such
symmetry does not hold universally. Our chosen bootstrap method
(section 3.1.1) automatically constructs a discretised distribution
of model parameters, centred on the best fitting values. This dis-
crete distribution represents a true sampling of probability space,
a distribution which we then seek to describe with a continuous
function. To model the discretised bootstrap dataset and directly ac-
cess the covariance matrix, we applied a Gaussian-mixture-model
(GMM), unsupervised machine learning approach, which identifies
and describes the data as a continuous model. GMM uses a single
Gaussian, or sum of Gaussian distributions, with maximum like-
lihood statistics in its fitting process, with the covariance matrix"
"MNRAS 000, 1–22 (2020)"
Searching for energy-resolved QPOs in AGN 5
"defined internally. We use the GMM algorithm implemented within
scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011)."
"In order to determine the number of independent Gaussians
needed to best describe a given boostrapped parameter space, we
again apply the BIC test. For every iteration of GMM, we allow the
fitting of an additional Gaussian distribution, up to a maximum of
10 iterations. The BIC penalises the added complexity of additional
model parameters and the 𝐵𝐼𝐶 value is minimised in the case where
the likelihood is maximised. For each iteration, the 𝐵𝐼𝐶 value is
recorded, with the ideal number of GMM parameters determined
from the iteration in which the 𝐵𝐼𝐶 is minimised. This method
most efficiently allows us to model the Δ𝑆 parameter space with a
continuous model, an example of which is shown in Figure 2."
3.1.4 Effect of low count rates
"The combination of utilising narrow energy bandswith falling count
rates above the nominal response of the detector, can result in source
count rates approaching the background count rate at high energies,
even for the most luminous AGN (e.g. 1H 0707-495). Due to the
stochastic (Poisson) nature of the background, in the case of very
low source count rates, the background-subtracted lightcurve may
contain bins with unphysical, negative count rates. Across our full
sample of ∼ 240, 000 energy resolved lightcurves, we find a mini-
mum of a single negative count rate bin in∼ 30% of cases. However,
as shown in Figure 3, the vast majority of such lightcurves contain
only a very small fraction of negative bins overall. For those cases
where negative bins are present, we find the mean proportion of
negative bins to be ∼ 3% of the lightcurve, with the 90th percentile
at 7%."
"We explore the impact of negative count rates on our anal-
ysis, by simulating red noise lightcurves (using a plc model and
the method outlined in Timmer & Koenig (1995) and changing the
fraction of negative count rates (by changing the mean count rate
of the background). The bias introduced from such negative count
rate bins can then be directly inferred from the difference between
the input index and that determined from fitting the resulting peri-
odogram (Δ𝛽 = 𝛽in − 𝛽out)."
"To perform the simulations, we utilised the best fitting models
for IRAS 13224-3809, OBSID:0792180501 (𝛽 = −1.95, ln 𝑁0 =
−5.09) and ARK 564 OBSID:0670130801 (𝛽 = −0.99, ln 𝑁0 =
−2.59) as these both have PLC models which well describe the
data, with indices close to −2 and −1 respectively, allowing us to
explore PLC parameter dependence. From the lightcurves gener-
ated following (Timmer & Koenig 1995), we added Poisson noise
to the lightcurves based on the corresponding mean count rate
and a Poisson noise background to simulate X-ray background in
the detector. To simulate a real observation, we then subtracted
a new Poisson noise background, to leave the new background-
subtracted lightcurve, the periodogram of which we model follow-
ing the method already described. We repeat the simulation 10, 000
times in total (across a range of increasing background count rates)
to sample the red noise, with the results shown in Figure 4. This
indicates that for the vast majority of our actual lightcurves con-
taining negative bins (7% at the 90th quantile level), their presence
introduces a bias error on the index of Δ𝛽 < 0.2, which lies com-
fortably within the expected 68% confidence intervals of 𝛽 values
using a plc, as seen in Figure 4. We find this effect is slightly more
pronounced in cases of steeper indices, 𝛽 ∼ −2, but even at the
limit of the % of negative bins observed in our real data, this effect
is negligible compared to the uncertainty from fitting with a PLC
model itself – as can be seen in Figure 2. We note that, for both"
"PLC models, the number of simulated cases which our methodol-
ogy would deem to be white noise dominated (where the number of
Fourier bins below the white noise cut off is < 13) increases with
the % of negative bins. This is especially true in simulated cases
with flatter indices (𝛽 ∼ −1), where this proportion becomes very
high, at > 70% of cases when considering 10% negative bins. The
application of our strict cut-off has helped avoid these issues and
leaves uswith typically only a very small proportion of negative bins
which introduce only a small source of secondary error unlikely to
impact our results."
"We also explore an alternative method of replacing all negative
bins with zeros (as shown in Figure 4), finding that this introduces
an increased level of uncertainty in the index, with Δ𝛽 increasing
linearly with the fraction of negative bins in the time series, similarly
to the case where we keep negative bins. This approach clearly does
not act to reduce the impact on the measured index, Δ𝛽, as we
introduce a non-stochastic count rate which does not reflect the
nature of the stochastic source and background. We therefore gain
no benefit from this method and so avoid such an approach."
3.1.5 QPO candidate significance testing
"To evaluate the significance of outliers identified in our energy-
resolved periodograms, we simulated red noise power spectra, pro-
duced through the procedure detailed in Timmer & Koenig (1995)
accounting for the small white noise contribution through the ad-
dition of the constant offset, 𝐶, which we use as an approximation
for Poisson noise in our stochastic background explicitly – as its
contribution is small. For each candidate, we simulated 10,000 fake
periodograms using a plc model to describe the broad band noise,
with parameters drawn at random from the mapped M-dimensional
parameter space described above. This approach accounts for the
intrinsic uncertainty in our estimated broad-band noise and there-
fore provides a more conservative significance estimate for a QPO
candidate. We treated each simulated dataset in an identical man-
ner to the real data, first by fitting each fake periodogram using
a maximum likelihood minimisation routine (using a plc model
only), before identifying the largest oulier in each, removing it and
refitting the underlying continuum as before. If the fitting routine
was unsuccessful (as there is a low but finite chance that the fitting
algorithm cannot minimise), we drew a new fake dataset, as we re-
quire the number of simulations to equal 10,000. In each successful
case, we then evaluated the ratio 𝑅TK ="

be treated with caution until additional evidence is obtained (e.g.
the persistence of the signal across multiple observations and at
similar frequencies – Alston et al. 2014 – or other characteristic
behaviour which distinguishes it from the broad-band noise). In a
similar fashion, we can produce 3𝜎 confidence limits on observed
powers from our Monte-Carlo simulations following the method of
Vaughan (2005) where the false alarm probability is determined"

"cutoff, for at these frequencies, the relative fraction of Poisson noise
(which we assume is constant rather than providing any additional
stochastic variability) increases relative to the simulated red noise."
"Whilst we treat each frequency as independent, we do not
consider each energy bin to be a free trial, as we expect some level
of correlation between bands (as evidenced in AGN covariance
spectra - e.g. Middleton et al. 2011); we will explore techniques
to address this directly in future. Finally, we note that one could
take each AGN observation itself to be an independent free trial,
however, as we do not yet know the conditions required to produce
a QPO, nor for how long they persist, we take a more heuristic
approach and treat only the frequencies as independent trials."
3.2 Further QPO candidate significance tests
"As we have suggested earlier, it is plausible that, regardless of the
fact a plc model may be statistically preferred in a given case,
our BIC test may exclude a bknplc model due to a low number
of frequency bins below any putative break. Any unaccounted-for
break in the broad-band noise has the potential to produce spurious
peaks of power and so we perform a series of further tests to better
judge the validity of any QPO candidates located with a plcmodel."
"(i) In only those energy bands where a QPO candidate is located
to ≥ 3𝜎, we refit the entire frequency bandpass (minus the a priori
known QPO candidate frequency bin, but including the previously
discarded white noise) with a bknplc model. We allow the index
above and below the break (𝛽1, 𝛽2) and the break frequency ab to
be free (although in the case of the break set to be ≤ aQ). We
establish the new white noise cutoff frequency – which can differ
from that found in the plc fitting (see Section 5.1), and freeze the"

these frequencies (Middleton & Done 2010) occur above the high
frequency break in the PSD (Morgan et al. 1997)."
4 RESULTS
"From a total of 200 observations across our sample of 38 AGN, we
detect 21 QPO candidates at a ≥ 3𝜎 significance, and 3 at a bor-
derline 3𝜎 level, all from 7 AGN. We re-confirm the well-reported"
"QPO in 4 observations of RE J1034+396, with up to 20 additional
detections across a further 6 AGN. Our initial results based on the
procedure described above, are shown in Table 1 which indicate the
energy band in which the detection significance is maximised, the
SMBH mass and the fractional rms in the QPO candidate (found
by integrating the QPO candidate’s power and removing the Pois-
son noise). Although we analyse all available observations of MS
2254.9-3712, our restriction of using only continuous data prevents
us from locating the QPO reported in Alston et al. (2015) as, after
flare subtraction, we have a lightcurve of only 27.8 ks in compari-
son to the 63 ks combined EPIC-PN/EPIC-MOS segment defined
in Alston et al. (2015) where gaps were removed via interpolation."
"We note that these results are only initial, and change in signif-
icance as we perform the additional tests in the case of each AGN,
as we shall proceed to describe."
4.1 RE J1034+396
4.1.1 Initial plc search
"To test our approach for locating QPO candidates, we examined
the eight observations of RE J1034+396, comparing our results to
those of Alston et al. (2014) noting once again that we do not include
interpolation (which can restrict our frequency range)."
"We detect the previously reported QPO to a > 3𝜎 confidence,
at a frequency of 2-3×10−4 Hz in four observations – see Figure
5. Notably, the maximum significance energy band extends down
to 0.7 keV and reflects the presence of the QPO in the soft X-ray
component (see Middleton et al. 2011). Alston et al. (2014) detect a
QPO in five of the eight observations (with the QPO now detected
in new observations - Jin et al. 2020); including the four where
we find a significant candidate. Whilst we do not detect a QPO in
OBSID:0655310101, we select only the first 28.2ks as a flare-less
segment, and subsequently detect a QPO at only a > 2𝜎 level."
"In Figure 6, we present energy-resolved significance heat-maps
which indicate the ≥ 3𝜎 significant detections detailed in Table 1,
as well as the global significance of any signal at this specific fre-
quency in all the other energy bands. We note that the significances
we present in Figure 6 are purely blind (i.e. the full number of
independent trials is still taken into account)."
4.1.2 Further tests
"As the QPO in RE J1034+396 is well established and thoroughly
investigated in the literature (e.g. Vaughan 2010), we refrain from
applying our additional tests in this instance."
"Frequency-restricted search: Given our detection of multiple
≥ 3𝜎 QPO candidates at consistent frequencies, we make the rea-
sonable assumption that we have a-priori knowledge of the QPO
frequency in RE J1034+396, across any observation. We then test
whether a signal is located at this frequency – in this case the modal
frequency of 2.34×10−4 Hz (or the closest Fourier frequency) – in
those observations without blind detections. In effect, this separate
p-value test lowers the effective threshold for detection, as it reduces
the number of free trials to a single Fourier bin of interest. However,
this further analysis does not locate any additional QPO candidates
at ≥ 3𝜎."

4.2 IRAS 13224-3809
"IRAS 13224-3809 is one of the most variable NLS1 AGN and has
been the focus of a recent 1.5 Ms study with XMM Newton, yielding
high quality data with almost full orbits (see Alston et al. 2019,
Alston et al. 2020b). We studied 16 available observations, and in
6 of these detect QPO candidates at ≥ 3𝜎, with one additional
observation with a borderline 3𝜎 detection."
4.2.1 Initial plc search
"Three observations all have consistent QPO candidate frequen-
cies at 9.77×10−5 Hz (OBSIDs:0780561701, 0792180301 and
0792180601) with an extremely high fractional rms (> 20%) –
see Figure 7 In addition to these, we find a borderline 3𝜎 QPO can-
didate with a frequency of 1.66×10−4 Hz in OBSID:0792180201;
although the significance fluctuates around 3𝜎, it sits close to the
frequency of QPO candidates detected in other observations and is
therefore of interest."
We also detect a > 3𝜎 QPO candidate at 7.81×10−5 Hz in two
"observations (OBSID:0780561301 and 0780561401). These two
observations provide a potentially intriguing result in that they con-
tain > 3𝜎 QPO candidates at two different frequencies, dependent
on the energy band selected, both of which are presented in Table
1. In OBSID:0780561301, the higher frequency QPO candidate is
found at 2.83×10−4 Hz, whilst in OBSID:0780561401 it is found
at 4.69×10−4 Hz. If we assume these to be harmonically related to
the 7.81×10−5 Hz feature then these would be at 7:2 and 6:1 reso-
nances respectively. Figure 8 displays the energy dependence of the
global significance of these QPO candidates; the energies at which
they become statistically significant at ≥ 3𝜎, are almost entirely
confined to hard energies > 3 keV. The notable exception to the
energy-dependence is that of OBSID:0792180501, which appears
to show several features that are unique amongst our sample."
"The QPO candidate in OBSID:0792180501 is found at a still
higher frequency of 1.02×10−3 Hz, as shown in Figure 9. This QPO
candidate is almost unique amongst our detections (the other exam-
ple being found in ARK 564), as it lies at a frequency higher than
the Poisson noise cutoff for the vast majority of our observations,
and we only detect it due to the high count rates. In combination"

false peaks in power across multiple observations at the same frequency."
"with the length of this observation (setting the size of the natural
Fourier frequency bin), this QPO candidate has the largest 𝑄 value
of any of our detections (𝑄 > 50). The energy band at which the
significance of this QPO candidate is maximised also differs from
those of the lower frequency QPO candidates, being found at softer
energies (specifically 0.9 − 1.6 keV – see Figure 8) without signifi-
cant detections above 2 keV (although at these higher energies, the
data quality becomes insufficient to study such high frequencies).
It is of interest to note that those QPO candidates detected at lower
frequencies do not appear in this observation."
4.2.2 Further tests
"We proceed to apply the two additional tests discussed in Section
3.2 and describe the results on an observation-by-observation basis."
Test(i):
"• OBSID:0780561301. We find a break at ∼ 2×10−4 Hz at en-
ergies ∼ 2 − 6 keV. In this case we observe a sudden drop in power
above the high frequencyQPOcandidate at 2.83×10−4Hz, as shown"
"in the lower panel of Figure 10. This behaviour may not be best de-
scribed by a break but is similar to the findings of González-Martín
& Vaughan (2012) when modelling the PSD of MS 22549-3712,
in which they report a poorly constrained fit using a bending-power
law with an extremely steep index above the break, but no QPO.
Assuming a free bknplc model does not lower the significance
of the higher frequency candidate QPO in this observation. In the
case of energies >6 keV, we find a break at ∼ 2 × 10−5 Hz or
∼ 6 × 10−5 Hz, and in doing so, the significance of the QPO can-
didate at 7.81 × 10−5 Hz drops to below 3𝜎 – as shown in upper
panel of Figure 10. By including a break, the white noise cutoff
(i.e. the frequency at which the Poisson noise dominates over the
red noise) is brought to lower frequencies and restricts the number
of frequency bins in the periodogram; as a result, we find multiple
energy bands which contained ≥ 3𝜎 QPO candidates using the plc
model, to now be white noise dominated, i.e. with < 13 Fourier bins
below the cutoff (which technically includes the QPO candidate
bin, although the power in this bin is ignored in defining the null
hypothesis)."
"• OBSID:0780561401. We find the high-frequency QPO can-
didate at 4.69×10−4 Hz lies consistently above the 3𝜎 threshold
when within the white noise limit, see upper panel of Figure 11. For
energy ranges above 3.2 keV however, we find the white noise cutoff
moves to frequencies below 4.69×10−4 Hz and the QPO candidate
is no longer considered. We also find that the low-frequency QPO
candidate at 7.81×10−5 Hzmay be well described by a break across
an energy range of 2 − 10 keV, although the strength of the QPO
candidate increases with increasing energies and becomes less well
described by a break given our methodology, see lower panel of
Figure 11. Given the result of this test, we remain cautious of the
validity of this low-frequency QPO candidate and believe it requires
further investigation."
"• OBSID:0780561701. We find a weak break (i.e. a value of
𝛽1/𝛽2 close to unity) at ∼ 2 × 10−5 Hz and at energies > 3 keV,
which has no impact on the significance of the QPO candidate at
9.77 × 10−5 Hz."
"• OBSID:0792180201. We reported only a borderline detection
using a plc model. We subsequently find a break at ∼ 8×10−5
Hz, however, the QPO candidate at 1.66 × 10−4 Hz becomes more
significant."
"• OBSID:0792180301. We lose the QPO candidate at 9.77 ×
10−5 Hz entirely with a weak break at ∼ 4 × 10−5 Hz and before a
steep drop in power at frequencies above theQPOcandidate.Wefind
that neither the plc or bknplc models provide a good description
of the broad band noise, but in assuming a bknplcmodel, the white
noise cutoff is brought to sufficiently low frequencies for the data to
be white noise dominated."
"• OBSID:0792180501. We find a weak break around ∼ 4×10−5
Hz, but the QPO candidate at 1.02 × 10−3 Hz remains significant."
"• OBSID:0792180601. The lower frequency white noise cutoff
means we are close to datasets becoming white noise dominated,
however, the QPO candidate at 9.77 × 10−5 Hz remains significant
on the edge of our frequency range."
"Test(ii):
All of the results with a fixed 𝛽1 agree with our findings from"
"test(i), (as expected given 𝛽1 = -1.1 was found previously in the case
of IRAS 13224-3809 Alston et al. 2019) although this assumed
shape for the broad band noise does not always provide a good
description depending on the energy range under consideration."

tion of multiple ≥ 3𝜎 QPO candidates at consistent frequencies, al-
lows us to assume a-priori knowledge of a possible QPO candidate
at frequencies of 7.81×10−5 Hz and 9.77×10−5 Hz (or the closest

pear in Table 1. Assuming a frequency of 7.81×10−5 Hz, we find a
single frequency-restricted ≥ 3𝜎 QPO candidate at 2.8 - 3 keV in
OBSID:0792180201."
"In light of the possible harmonic features observed in OB-
SIDs:0780561301 and 0780561401, we also search for QPO can-
didates at frequencies of 2.83×10−4 Hz and 4.69×10−4 Hz respec-
tively. At a frequency of 2.83×10−4 Hz,we find frequency-restricted
≥ 3𝜎 candidates in OBSIDs: 0673580101 and 0780561601, both
in the 3 - 6 keV range, comparable to the QPO candidate in OB-
SID:0780561301. At a frequency of 4.69×10−4 Hz, we also find
frequency-restricted ≥ 3𝜎 candidates in OBSID:0673580101 in
the 2 - 8 keV range, and in OBSID:0780560101, at energies around
2 keV. The apparent detection of a higher frequency QPO candidate
in the same observation (OBSID:0673580101) but at both frequen-
cies highlights the potential problem with searching at a reduced
number of frequencies: even with an a priori expectation – the sig-
nificance is artificially higher and care must be taken when claiming
any detection (i.e. independent evidence is still required)."
4.3 1H 0707-495
"1H 0707-495 has been studied extensively by XMM-Newton with a
total observing time in excess of 1 Ms (e.g. Kara et al. 2013)."
4.3.1 Initial plc search
"As shown in Figure 12, we detect ≥ 3𝜎 QPO candidates in three
observations (including one borderline detection), from a total of
11, with high fractional rms (> 20%) and across a narrow frequency
range of 1-2×10−4 Hz."
"We find a borderline ∼ 3𝜎 QPO candidate in OB-
SID:0653510601, although in this case, the QPO candidate fre-
quency lies close to or even at the white noise cutoff in some energy
bins. For this observation, we find a slight shift towards lower fre-
quencies, but there is minimal change in the fractional-rms of the
QPO candidate between each of these observations."
"We find the peak QPO candidate significance in OB-
SID:0653510301 and 0653510501 to lie in the ∼4 - 6 keV range,
with no ≥ 3𝜎 energy bands extending below 3.8 keV, whilst we
find only borderline 3𝜎 features in OBSID:0653510601 in the ∼4
- 8 keV energy range. The extent of the significance variation is
highlighted in Figure 6. We note also that the fractional-rms of
the QPO candidates in 1H 0707-495 is similar to that found in
IRAS 13224-3809."

indicate energy bands which do not fit the plc criteria we set out in Section 3 – including both white noise dominated observations and bknplcmodel preferred
fits."
"• OBSID:0653510301. Assuming a free bknplcmodel, we find
a weak break at ∼ 1×10−4 Hz. The biggest impact is the shift of
the white noise cutoff; in the 4.4 - 5.4 keV energy range the QPO
candidate remains above the 3𝜎 threshold but at the limit of non
white noise dominated bins. As we move to harder energy bands,
(namely 4.8 - 6.2 keV), the QPO candidate sits at the location of the
white noise cutoff and we thus cannot discern its significance."
"• OBSID:0653510501. In the 3.8 - 5.4 keV band, the peri-
odogram is best described by a break at ∼ 8×10−5 Hz, whilst at
4.2 - 5.8 keV, the break extends back to ∼ 3×10−5 Hz. In both cases,
the QPO candidate at 1.95×10−4 Hz remains ≥ 3𝜎. As with the
previous observation, there are also energy bands in which we are
now restricted by the white noise cutoff. This is seen in narrower
energy bands (e.g. 3.8 - 4.8 keV and 4.2 - 5.4 keV), as the number
of counts is restricted. In these cases, the QPO candidate remains
≥ 3𝜎 but at a frequency closer to the white noise cutoff.
• OBSID:0653510601. A borderline detection with a plcmodel,"
when assuming a bknplc model we find a tentative break around
"the QPO candidate frequency ∼ 1×10−4 Hz. For this observation,
we are investigating only two ≥ 3𝜎 energy bands, where the QPO
candidate is found at frequencies below the plc white noise cutoff.
For the peak significance band (5.6 - 8.2 keV), we find the QPO
candidate remains ≥ 3𝜎, whilst in the 4.8 - 5.4 keV band, the QPO
candidate falls below our detection threshold due to the presence of
the break."
Test(ii):
"• OBSID:0653510301. Similar to the free-index case above, we
find the QPO candidate remains significant above the broad band
noise, but with a white noise cutoff located at a lower frequency
which reduces the number of frequency bins below our limit."
"• OBSID:0653510501. Due to the forced upper index 𝛽1 = −1.1
providing a poor description of the power spectrum of 1H 0707-495,
we find only a limited number of breaks with this model. Notably,
we find that the ≥ 3𝜎 detection remains in the peak significance"

of being white noise dominated."
"Frequency-restricted search: Based on our QPO candidate detec-
tions, we proceed to search the other observations of 1H 0707-495
without blind detections at the modal QPO candidate frequency
of 1.95×10−4 Hz. We detect a broad peak of power spanning
this frequency in OBSID:0506200501 in the energy range of 4 -
9 keV, with a frequency-restricted p-value > 3𝜎 and an outlier
with a frequency-restricted > 3𝜎 p-value in OBSID:0653510601 at
this same frequency. The latter is of particular interest, as in OB-
SID:0653510601 we observe a borderline 3𝜎 global significance
detection at 1.27×10−4Hz,which is strongest in the 5.6−8.2 keV en-
ergy range, but herewe find the strongest frequency-restricted candi-
date at 3.4−4.0 keV, which extends to higher energies with reduced
significance. It appears this feature may be similar to those QPO
candidate detections in OBSIDs:0653510301 and 0653510501, but
is intrinsically weaker and becomes dominated by a candidate at
1.27×10−4 Hz at higher energies."
"Previous claims: We note previous claims of significant QPO de-
tections in 1H 0707-495, both concerning a single observation, OB-
SID:0511580401. Both Pan et al. (2016) and Zhang et al. (2018)
report a QPO at 2.6×10−4 Hz in the full 0.2 - 10 keV XMM-Newton
energy range, via a Fourier and a non-Fourier wavelet analysis re-"
"spectively. We do not recover a 3𝜎 result at this frequency, instead
finding a 2𝜎 outlier at energies > 2.2 keV. We note that our blind
selection criteria leads us to explore an 88.9 ks flare-subtracted seg-
ment in this observation, whereas Pan et al. (2016) opt instead to
focus on the first ∼ 55 ks. This selection maximises their QPO sig-
nificance, whilst considering the full observation reduces it to 90%,
well below the 3𝜎 detection threshold. We will revisit the impact of
such segment selection on QPO detection in a forthcoming paper."
4.4 PG 1244+026
4.4.1 Initial plc search
"From a total of 7 XMM-Newton observations of the NLS1
PG 1244+026, we detect only a single ≥ 3𝜎 QPO candidate, within
the 71 ks longest continuous segment of OBSID:0675320101. We
detect a QPO candidate at a frequency of 2.15 × 10−4 Hz (see Fig-
ure 13), similar to the frequencies of those found in RE J1034+396,
IRAS 13224-3809 and 1H 0707-495. The ≥ 3𝜎 detections are
largely restricted to energies above ∼ 3 keV, as shown in Figure 6.
This differentiates it from RE J1034+396, IRAS 13224-3809 and
1H 0707-495, which also show ≥ 3𝜎 detections at softer energies."

Test(ii):

almost identical to those from test (i), returning a QPO candidate
well above the 3𝜎 threshold for those energy bins not deemed to be

spectrum is not well described with a lower index of -1.1, and
the magnitude of the break is reduced near the QPO candidate
frequency. In this case, the excess of power around the break is
sufficient for the QPO candidate to remain detected at > 3𝜎 –
highlighting the importance of model selection."
"Frequency-restricted search: With two QPO candidate frequen-
cies, it is difficult to motivate a single a-priori frequency for a search
across those observations without blind detections. Searching at the
two frequencies reported in Table 1, we find no supporting evidence
of a feature at 1.56×10−4 Hz, but we do find a frequency-restricted
≥ 3𝜎 candidate at 3.52×10−4 Hz in OBSID:0606320301, strongest
at 3.6 - 5.0 keV, similar to the case of OBSID:0109141401."
"Previous claims:NGC 4051 has been the subject of multiple X-ray
variability studies over several decades, with Papadakis &Lawrence
(1995) reporting a broad QPO-like feature in EXOSAT data at a fre-
quency of ∼ 4×10−4Hz, which appears stronger in their low-energy
band (0.05 − 2)keV, than their medium-energy band (2 − 10) keV.
It should be noted that their methodology does not include the sim-
ulation of red noise following Timmer & Koenig (1995), but does
consider fitting with complex models. They find a plc + Gaus-
sian model provides a good description of the underlying power
spectrum and QPO-like feature at low energies, with a highly sig-
nificant improvement over a plc model. We note that the QPO
candidate we observe in OBSID:0109141401 lies at a similar fre-
quency (3.52×10−4 Hz), but is significant at harder energies within
their medium-energy band (see Figure 6)."
"Green et al. (1999) study two, 0.1−2 keV ROSAT observations
of NGC 4051 and suggest the possible presence of a QPO-like
feature at frequencies >∼ 10−3Hz, but this is above the white noise
limit for our observations. Lastly, Vaughan et al. (2011) conducted
a variability analysis of NGC 4051 using a series of XMM-Newton
observations (with a total of ∼ 570 ks), across the full energy range
of 0.2 − 10 keV, and across a frequency range of ∼ 1 × 10−4− ∼
1× 10−2 Hz. They report no QPOs, although they do note that their
analysis at harder energies (2− 10 keV) provided tentative evidence
for a possible feature at ∼ 4 × 10−3 Hz."

SID:0006810101) is similar to the higher frequency QPO candidate
we have located in IRAS 13224-3809, at a frequency of 1.88×10−3
Hz. The longest segment in this observation is uncharacteristically
short, at only 4.95 ks, but with a period of ∼ 532 s we can still ob-
tain a moderate quality factor of𝑄 ≈ 6. In OBSID:0670130501, we
detect a QPO candidate at a frequency of 8.59 × 10−4 Hz, prior to
the observations of OBSID:0670130701 and OBSID:0670130801
in which we find QPO candidates at 2.73×10−4 Hz and 2.54×10−4
Hz respectively. The energy ranges in which these four QPO candi-
dates are detected are largely consistent, being dominated by counts
at 2 − 3 keV. The full range of candidate significance as a function
of energy is shown in Figure 6."
4.6.2 Further tests
Test(i):
"• OBSID:0006810101. In requiring a break to occur at or before
the QPO candidate, we find every energy bin in this observation
to be considerably restricted in the number of available frequency
bins below the white noise cutoff. As a result, we cannot discern
the significance of this QPO candidate. As such, this detection is
dependent on our selection of white noise cutoff, so as a result it
difficult to discern from white noise and is brought into question."
"• OBSID:0670130501. We find a clear break at a frequency of
3 × 10−4 Hz above 2 kev, and find a break at 5 × 10−4 Hz when
including energies below 2 keV. In the case of the former, we find
the QPO candidate at 8.59× 10−4 Hz to increase in significance. In
those energy bands where the break is located at 5 × 10−4 Hz, the"
"significance of the QPO candidate is reduced, but remains around
3𝜎."
"• OBSID:0670130701. We find a break at a frequency of 8 ×
10−5 Hz in the 2.4 - 3 keV energy range, with the break moving to
1 × 10−4 Hz for 2.6 - 3.0 keV and 2 × 10−4 Hz for 2.6 - 3.2 keV
– with the QPO candidate at 2.73 × 10−4 Hz. The QPO candidate
remains > 3𝜎, but decreases in significance with increasing energy
and a higher break frequency. We also find the peak significance
band (2.6 - 2.8 keV) now classes as white noise dominated as the
bknplc invokes a cutoff at a lower frequency."
"• OBSID:0670130801. This observation contains the strongest
QPO candidate we have located in ARK 564. Once again, the break
is highly energy dependent: a break is found at ∼ 1 × 10−4 Hz in
the 3.0 - 4.0 keV energy range, but a strong break is instead found at
∼ 6×10−5 Hz for 5.0 - 10.0 keV, before the power spectrum flattens
for energy bands > 6 keV, resulting in a weak break. In each case,
the QPO candidate is found above the 3𝜎 threshold, although the
significance lessens in energy bands > 6 keV."
Test(ii):
"• OBSID:0006810101. All energy bands are classified as white
noise dominated assuming this model."
"• OBSID:0670130501. A lower index of -1.1 does not provide
a good description for the break across the full range of energy
bands. This model typically locates the break at 6 × 10−4 Hz and
reduces the QPO candidate significance, although not below the 3𝜎
threshold."
"• OBSID:0670130701. Again, a lower index of -1.1 does not
allow for a good description of the periodogram, but the QPO
candidate remains above the 3𝜎 threshold."
"• OBSID:0670130801. As with the other observations, the pe-
riodograms are not well described with a lower index of -1.1. As a
break is not preferred, most QPO candidates remain above the 3𝜎
threshold, with the exception of energy bands > 5.6 keV, in which
the candidates lie at the white noise cutoff frequency."
"Frequency-restricted search: The observed variation in QPO can-
didate frequency means we have minimal a-priori knowledge of a
stable frequency for deeper searches, and therefore we exclude this
step for ARK 564."
"Previous claims:McHardy et al. (2007) reported an excess of power
in the 2.0 - 8.8 keV band in OBSID:0206400101 at ∼ 2 × 10−4 Hz
– similar to two of our QPO candidates in OBSID:0670130701 and
OBSID:0670130801 – but only at a 90% significance. Our analysis
of this observation does not reproduce the feature, as the longest
continuous segment of this ∼ 101 ks observation is only ∼ 21 ks,

"As our significance tests are based on an underlying stochastic
background, it is quite possible we may determine an outlier to lie
very close to 3𝜎 (peaking above or dipping below this threshold
under repeated tests). For our analysis of MRK 766, this occurs for
our only candidate. This borderline 3𝜎 detection, coupled with a
lack of supporting evidence from other observations (e.g. in IRAS
13224-3809 and 1H 0707-495 we have found multiple QPO can-
didates across multiple observations at the same frequency across
similar energy ranges) means we remain sceptical of this detection,

to future studies."

significant QPO in a single observation of MRK 766 (OB-
SID:0304030601) identified through a non-Fourier wavelet method
(Zhang et al. 2017). However, we do not find a significant feature at
their reported frequency of 1.55 × 10−4 Hz."
4.8 Observations as free trials
"The significance values we have quoted for each QPO candidate
rely on the assumption that each observation is independent and
the number of free trials is limited to only the frequency range
of interest, per observation. Our motivation for not treating each
observation as being a free trial stems from the observation that
certain spectral states, connected to the accretion rate, seem to be
necessary for such QPOs to appear (e.g. Alston et al. 2014)."
"We can instead employ the most conservative perspective and
assume each observation (200 in total) to be a free trial – regardless
of data quality – and obtain the most stringent QPO candidate
significance."
"In the case of QPO candidates present at a single frequency
in a single observation, such as PG 1244+026 and NGC 4051, we
find the significance values fall to < 3𝜎. In the case of NGC 4051
OBSID:0109141401, this is reduced to the ∼ 2𝜎 level, while PG
1244+026 OBSID:0675320101 falls to < 2𝜎. However we note that"
"MNRAS 000, 1–22 (2020)"
18 D. I. Ashton et al.
"such decreases are overestimates of the impact (as we have assumed
the data quality to be equivalent in all observations)."
"For those AGN with QPO candidate detections at the same
frequency across multiple observations, we consider both the more
stringent ‘look elsewhere’ effect set against the conditional probabil-
ity of detecting a QPO candidate at the same frequency. Combining
the two leads to the QPO candidate in 1H 0707-495 being at > 6𝜎
significance, while the IRAS 13223-3809 QPO candidate at a fre-
quency of 9.77×10−5Hzmay similarly be found at > 6𝜎 – although
this drops to> 4𝜎 if excluding the detection inOBSID:0792180301,
where the broad-band noise is not well constrained. In the cases of
ARK 564 and RE J1034+396, our global significance values for
some candidates of interest reach 𝐺𝑆 = 1.0000, whereby we reach
a precision limit for 10, 000MC simulations. If instead we consider
these individual global significance values to be similar to those
observed in 1H 0707-495, we find the 2.54 − 2.73 × 10−4Hz can-
didate in ARK 564 to be > 4𝜎, whilst RE J1034+396 reaches the
> 7𝜎 level, with four observations all at equivalent frequencies.
We note that these values in themselves are conservative, as they
consider only > 3𝜎 global significance values in Table 1, and no
supplementary evidence from observations with lower significance
candidates."
"5 ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY IN THE BROAD-BAND
NOISE"
"We have chosen to focus on relatively simple models for the broad
band noise as these are typically a good description in the frequency
range we are studying (e.g. González-Martín & Vaughan 2012).
However, there is the potential for further underlying complexity
in the broad band noise and leakage which can effect our QPO
candidate significance claims and which we explore here."
5.1 The impact of the white noise cutoff
"Determining the frequency at which the underlying white noise
(Poisson noise) within the observation becomes dominant over the
intrinsic red noise is subject to inherent uncertainty in any fitting
of the broad-band noise. In our approach to defining the null hy-
pothesis (Section 3.1.1) – the QPO candidate is removed from the
periodogram and the broad-band noise is re-fitted (see Vaughan
2005), but the white noise cutoff frequency is left unchanged from
our fit where theQPO candidate is included. Defining this frequency
is a somewhat complex issue as the periodogram is by definition
only one realisation of the underlying power spectrum (and sowould
be best represented by a probability distribution) and the position
of the cutoff naturally has an uncertainty, correlated with those un-
certainties on the normalisation and power-law index (such that a
different draw from the covariant distribution – Figure 2 – pro-
duces a different cutoff). As we are required to select a single cutoff
frequency (otherwise we introduce an uneven bias into our signif-
icance testing), we opted to retain the value from our initial fit but
now explore the impact of this choice."
"Re-fitting the broad-band noise with the QPO candidate re-
moved tends to reduce the white noise cutoff frequency. The result
is that bins at high frequency may then be outside of our range
of interest. As we also require 13 Fourier bins (which includes
the QPO candidate bin – although this frequency is ignored when
the null hypothesis is defined) for fitting purposes, this can have
the knock-on effect of removing energy bands from our study. The"

"Figure 17. Example of the impact of the white noise cutoff selection via our
two approaches (see Section 5.1), for the established QPO in RE J1034+396,
OBSID: 0675440101 (within the most significant energy band, see Table 1).
We show two plc model fits, one (gold) including the QPO candidate bin,
and the other (black) without the QPO candidate bin. The respective white
noise cutoff frequencies in each case are determined to be the point where
the underlying plc model (dot-dashed) intersects the constant white noise
level. As shown here, excluding the QPO candidate in our fitting results in
the frequency of the white noise cutoff being lowered on average by ∼ 2− 3
bins. As we demonstrate in this example, we then risk reducing the number
of bins in our periodogram to below the minimum requirement we have
set for modelling the broad band noise – this would lead us to exclude this
established and accepted QPO."
"combination of these two effects can remove QPO candidates ei-
ther because they now fall into the white noise dominated region or
because there are too few bins for reliable fitting. We investigated
these effects by setting the white noise cutoff frequency from the
plc model applied to the data without the QPO candidate. We find
that ∼ 39% of the > 3𝜎 energy bands are now white noise domi-
nated (with < 13 frequencies in the periodogram, or 12 bins when
excluding the QPO candidate bin), a change driven by the removal
of those narrow energy bands with relatively low count rates and so
large amounts of white noise, which were close to this boundary in
our original analysis. Despite the loss of numerous energy bands,
the majority of our reported > 3𝜎 QPO candidates remain, with a
few exceptions, namely: IRAS 13224-3809 OBSIDs: 0780561301

OBSID:0675440101 (as well as almost all energy bins of OB-
SID:0655310201). It should be noted that a number of these obser-
vations were already borderline/close to the white noise threshold."
"We note that, although setting the white noise cutoff to the
higher of the two frequencies is a more conservative approach, it
also has the potential to remove real signals, as is evident for the case
of RE J1034+396 (see Figure 17). In a similar fashion, the QPO can-
didate of 1H 0707-495 in OBSID:0653510301, is discarded by this
more stringent analysis but is still observed in OBSID:0653510501
at the same frequency, and so we find we can lose high probability
detections."

5.2 The effect of windowing/red noise leak
"As we are only selecting a relatively small frequency range com-
pared to the full extent of the underlying power spectrum (see e.g.
Uttley et al. 2002, McHardy et al. 2006), we may expect some
leakage of power into our observed band (see González-Martín &
Vaughan 2012). In Fourier space this is equivalent to convolving the
Fourier transform of the window function (the Fejér kernel) with the
underlying power spectrum (van der Klis 1988). As a result, the in-
trinsic broad-band noise may not be well represented by that which
we measure in our periodogram. We explore the impact of leakage
on those periodograms in which we have significant QPO candi-
date detections, by simulating a lightcurve based on an underlying
power-law with an index of -2 following Timmer & Koenig (1995)
but extending back to 10−5 Hz, i.e. to lower frequencies than we typ-
ically observe down to, and then apply a window equivalent to our
segment selection. To obtain an appropriate normalisation for our
input power-law, we first create very long simulated lightcurves (far
longer than the real data) from a power-law with an index of -2 and
trial normalisation stepping over log space. From these lightcurves
we select a random segment of the same length as our real data
and minimise the log-likelihood when compared to our observed
periodogram (by minimising the median of the distribution of 𝑆
values). Using this best-fitting normalisation – which is different
for each QPO candidate-detected observation – we simulate 10,000
fake lightcurves, apply our window, obtain the periodogram, and
search for false outliers. We note this to be a somewhat extreme test
as it is quite likely that a break to to flatter indices occurs before such
low frequencies are reached (see e.g. McHardy et al. 2007) or that
the power-spectrum itself is flatter (𝛽 > -2) as we move to higher
energies (Jin et al. 2020; Ashton et al. in prep.) where our QPO
candidates are mostly located. In Figure 18 we present an example
of our test for the impact of windowing as applied to NGC 4051
(OBSID:0109141401), where we plot the intrinsic noise needed to
create the observed noise."
"We apply the above test to only the most significant
energy-resolved QPO candidates (as listed in Table 1) and find
that 8 out of the 24 candidates remain above the 3𝜎 thresh-
old. These include RE J1034+396 (OBSIDs: 0506440101 and
0675440201), IRAS 13224-3809 (OBSIDs: 0780561401 and
0792180501), NGC 4051 (OBSID: 0109141401) and ARK564
(OBSIDs: 0006810101, 0670130701 and 0670130801). The re-
mainder lie above a ∼ 98% threshold, i.e. an upper 2𝜎 level. This
is a clear indication that under extreme conditions it is possible for
red noise leak to have an impact on QPO detection. However, we
note that this may not rule out the now < 3𝜎 candidates as, in many
cases (e.g. RE J1034+396), we find the QPO candidate frequencies
to remain similar across multiple observations, which is hard to re-
produce through fake signals generated by an underlying stochastic
process."
5.3 Complex broad-band noise models
"A natural extension to a test using a bknplc model is one in which
the underlying noise is described by a series of Lorentzians (e.g.
McHardy et al. 2007). This makes sense physically where each
radius acts as a low pass filter with variations suppressed on a local
viscous timescale (e.g. Churazov et al. 2001; Ingram et al. 2016),
although in reality these are well known to be coupled (Uttley et al.
2017).Whilst we do not have a-priori knowledge of the nature of the
Lorentzians that might describe the shape of the broad band noise
in any of our energy-dependent observations, we can test the impact"

the intrinsic, pre-windowed plc model."
"such a model might have on QPO significance tests more generally.
Assuming the high energy Lorentzians which describe the data of
ARK564 fromMcHardy et al. (2007)withoutwhite noise, we create
fake periodograms down to 10−5 Hz, a distribution of 𝑅 values, and
obtain the free-trial-corrected 3𝜎 contours (see Vaughan 2005). We
then proceed to fit the average of these simulated periodograms
with our plc model (minus white noise) and, using the best-fitting
value for the index and normalisation, simulate again to obtain
another set of 3𝜎 contours. As shown in Figure 19, by comparing
the two sets of contours, we can see that, over much of the frequency
range, the significance is under-estimated when a power-law model
is used as an approximation, although the significance contours are
comparable as the higher frequency Lorentzian starts to dominate
the broad band noise."
"Should a multiple Lorentzian model be a more appropriate de-
scription of the underlying noise for all of our observations at high
energies, then the impact on our QPO candidate significance is ex-
pected to be relatively minor. However, given the lack of constraints
on the nature and energy-dependence of any Lorentzians underlying
our data, we stress that this is an open question and reiterate that"

significance claims (see Vaughan et al. 2016 for more discussion on

6 DISCUSSION
"To-date, the presence of AGN X-ray QPOs across multiple obser-
vations has been limited to strong detections in the NLS1 AGN,
RE J1034+396 (Gierlinski et al. 2008), with a single claim in MS
2254.9-3712 (Alston et al. 2015), a number of tentative claims in
other NLS1s, and signals in TDEs (see Pasham et al. 2019b). Here
we have performed the first energy-resolved search for QPO candi-
dates within 38 AGN, comprising 200 XMM-Newton observations.
We initially find 24 QPO candidates across 7 AGN, and subject to
further tests, report the detection of 16 QPO candidates across 6
AGN (we exclude MRK 766 from this category – see Section 4.7)."
"Our results include the QPO in RE J1034+396 which we
used to corroborate our approach, as well as confirming signals
in IRAS 13224-3809, 1H 0707-495 and ARK 564 albeit it in some
cases at different frequencies to those quoted in the past. In addition,
we provide details of the energy dependence and the repeat occur-
rence of these signals across observations. This last point is impor-
tant - in many cases (notably IRAS 133224-3809 and 1H 0707-495)
the QPO candidates appear at the same or very similar frequencies
(see Table 1); it is very difficult to create such repeat signals by
chance alone, increasing the likelihood that they are genuine (see
Section 4.8, where we reach significance levels in excess of > 6𝜎
for 3 AGN). We also note that, in most cases, the quality factor and
rms of the signal is large (Q > 10 and FRMS & 10%) in keeping
with those established QPOs in RE J1034+396."
"A possible limitation in our approach to estimating the signif-
icance of our QPO candidates, is our data-led maximum likelihood
search for a break in the power spectrum, which does not incorpo-
rate any prior expectations we have for the position of the break
(e.g. McHardy et al. 2007; González-Martín & Vaughan 2012). At
present, we merely force a break into the periodogram as a rigorous
test of the QPO candidate significance (see Section 3.2); the oc-
casional change in QPO candidate significance then underlines the
need for caution when claiming the presence of a QPO, even when
the broad-band noise model is statistically preferred. In future, and
with data which extends to lower frequencies, we will be able to
performmore stringent tests. We note that, whilst our approach may
appear to discard information prior to our fitting, the present lack of
a well-constrained probability distribution describing the position
and energy dependence of the break prevents such an approach.
Given the situation of poorly motivated priors and somewhat lim-
ited data, we have chosen to follow a frequentest approach, although
Bayesian inference may allow for a more accurate assessment of the
presence of breaks in future. Bearing in mind the above caveats
and our warnings about the uncertainty in the broad-band noise, we
proceed to discuss the QPO candidates our analysis has identified,
and the possible unifying features in our sample."
"RE J1034+396 is well known for having a strong soft excess
(Puchnarewicz & Soria 2002; Casebeer et al. 2006; Middleton et al.
2007, 2009), likely a result of extremely high accretion rates, which
has led to comparisons being made between its QPO and the 67 Hz
HFQPO observed in GRS 1915+105 when accreting at high Ed-
dington fractions (Morgan et al. 1997; Ueda et al. 2009; Middleton
& Done 2010, Jin et al. 2020). More generally, HFQPOs are only
seen in BHBs in their very high state (see Remillard & McClintock
2006), when the mass accretion rates can reach significant fractions"
"of their Eddington limit (e.g. see Nowak 1995). It is therefore rea-
sonable to postulate that the HFQPOmechanism is intrinsically tied
to these high mass accretion rates (Blaes et al. 2006)."
"Of our sample of AGN containing QPO candidates,
RE J1034+396, IRAS 13224-3809, PG 1244+026, 1H 0707-495
and ARK 564 have all been reported accreting at close to their Ed-
dington limits (Done & Jin 2016; Alston et al. 2020b; Kara et al.
2017; Done et al. 2012b) as is also the case for MS 2254.9-3712
(Alston et al. 2015)."
"Indeed, NGC 4051 may be the only exception, accreting at
∼ 0.1 Eddington (Peterson et al. 2000; Alston et al. 2013). Whilst
the uncertainty involved in mass accretion rate determinationmeans
we cannot be completely certain of the true nature of these sources,
there could well be a link between the high accretion rates in these
AGN (as well as in TDEs) and the QPO candidates we have found."
"Naturally, high accretion rates (and therefore high luminosities)
could result in some level of selection bias – our ability to detect
a QPO relies on high signal-to-noise ratio data and so we may be
more likely to detect signals in predominantly bright, high accretion
rate AGN. We have been unable to test this in our present sample
due to the uncertainty in SMBH mass measurements and therefore
accretion rate estimates. It is quite possible however, that QPOs in
AGN are far more commonplace than previously thought, but the
present difficulty in obtaining the required data quality to probe a
sufficient frequency range, biases our study towards intrinsically
bright, or sufficiently local AGN. In future, new, high-throughput
instruments such as STROBE-X and Athena will be able to probe
many more AGN to higher frequency ranges."
"The energy bands in which we have found significant QPO
candidates vary between sources, but remain largely consistent be-
tween observations of the same source and, with the exception of
RE J1034+396, the detections are most significant in bands above
2 keV. This was also found by Alston et al. (2015) in their investiga-
tion ofMS 2254.9-3712, where the QPO is detected at 2−5 keV and
provides further compelling evidence that the hard energy compo-
nents (i.e. the coronal emission and reflection), of the AGN energy
spectrum appear to be central to QPO production. The energy-
dependence of detection significance also indicates why previous
studies (e.g. González-Martín & Vaughan 2012) have been unlikely
to detect theseQPO candidates, as they do not appear in the typically
studied full bandpass 0.3 − 10 keV, nor generic soft, 0.3 − 2 keV, or
hard, 2 − 10 keV bands. In a forthcoming paper we will investigate
the full energy-dependence and detailed nature of these candidates
to search for confirmatory evidence of their QPO (i.e. non-broad-
band noise) nature, and thereby hope to better understand the QPO
production mechanism in AGN."
"The QPO frequency is naturally an important parameter in
understanding the accretion flow (e.g. as a result of motion of the
flow or characteristic timescale of an instability). Our prior knowl-
edge of QPO frequencies in this regard was somewhat limited to
the ∼ 2.5 × 10−4 Hz detection in RE J1034+396 (Gierlinski et al.
2008) and the ∼ 1.5 × 10−4 Hz detection in MS 2254.9-3712 (Al-
ston et al. 2015). Here we have found QPO candidates with similar
frequencies in 1H 0707-495 and PG 1244+026, whilst NGC 4051
and IRAS 13224-3809 have QPO candidates with comparable fre-
quencies, but with greater variation between observations."
"IRAS 13224-3809 is of particular interest for both the number
of ≥ 3𝜎 candidates and the consistency of their frequencies, with
many close to ∼ 1 × 10−4 Hz. The presence of possible harmonic
features (the nature of which we will explore in more detail in the
near future) is also unique amongst all of our observations, although
this may simply be a consequence of being able to probe to higher"

we assume a plc model but a double Lorentzian model is the correct description of the broad-band noise, we would potentially underestimate QPO candidate
significance at low frequencies."
"frequencies due to the higher count rates in this AGN. As further
indicated by the higher frequency QPO candidate detected in ARK
564 (∼ 1 × 10−3 Hz), being able to probe to high, non-white noise-
dominated frequencies (especially at higher energies) may reveal
many more QPO candidates."
"ARK 564 is rather unusual amongst our sample, with a QPO
candidate frequency decreasing with time, before an apparent sta-
bilisation around ∼ 2 × 10−4 Hz. This may be due to the changing
frequency range we can probe, as the lowest frequency and white
noise cutoff frequency also evolve across observations. Conversely,
it may be the result of the physical process creating a genuine QPO
changing with time, potentially settling, as suggested in the case
of RE J1034+396 (Gierlinski et al. 2008). As noted earlier, these
results assume a simplified description of the underlying broad-
band noise and, for ARK 564 specifically, previous modelling has
identified the presence of breaks and Lorentzians (e.g.Papadakis
et al. 2002, McHardy et al. 2007), which in one observation oc-
curs close to our QPO candidate frequency (OBSID:0006810101).
As we point out via simulations, it is unlikely that modelling the
broad-band noise with Lorentzians could lead to an overestimate of
QPO significance, however, as we have demonstrated, care should
be taken when assuming the shape of the broad-band noise to be
simple."
"Althoughwewill probe the detailed nature of theseQPO candi-
dates in a follow-up paper, we note that, should they be analogous to
those HFQPOs in BHBs (e.g. Middleton & Done 2010) then a sim-
ple inverse-mass relation might be expected for the QPO frequency.
Unfortunately, the SMBHs in our sample are of comparable mass"
"(see Table 1), and the present uncertainty in the mass measuring
techniques renders any correlation to be dominated by uncertainty."
7 CONCLUSION
"The search for X-ray QPOs in AGN has been an ongoing chal-
lenge within the field for a number of decades (Vaughan & Uttley
2005) with multiple studies claiming QPO detections (e.g. Vaughan
& Uttley 2005). To-date, only two AGN (non-TDEs) have signals
which have been widely accepted as genuine (Gierlinski et al. 2008;
Alston et al. 2015). Following Alston et al. (2015) we have anal-
ysed energy-dependent periodograms following a robust statistical
method and have located significant (≥ 3𝜎) QPO candidates in five
additional AGN."
"A number of these candidates appear at the same or similar
frequencies across multiple observations, further diminishing the
likelihood that they are spurious in nature. However, whilst our ap-
proach is robust, there naturally remains uncertainty over the exact
shape of the broad-band noise – although we don’t anticipate this
affecting our results, we will investigate the nature of our candi-
dates in the near future to establish if they demonstrate QPO-like
properties."
"Our robust detection of QPO candidates using a rigorous ap-
proach not only expands the known sample size of such signals, but
opens up the possibility of exploring the QPO formation mecha-
nism in new, remarkable detail (Ashton et al. in prep) and implies
that new missions (e.g. Athena and STROBE-X) will more regularly
detect such features."
