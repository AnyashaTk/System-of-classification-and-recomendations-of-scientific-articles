ABSTRACT
"Context. The formation and evolution of light elements in the Universe act as important cosmological constraints. It has long been
assumed that the oldest stars of the Galaxy display the primordial lithium abundance in their outer layers, although studies of stellar
physics have proven that this abundance must have decreased with time. The primordial Li abundance deduced from the observations
of the cosmic background is, indeed, larger than the maximum observed in these stars. Recent observations have given evidence of
a large Li abundance dispersion in very metal-poor stars. Many of these stars are carbon-rich, that is, the so-called carbon-enhanced
metal-poor (CEMP) stars. A large number of them also present overabundances of s process elements (CEMP-s).
Aims. We address the general question of the observed abundances in metal-poor stars and we focus our study on the case of CEMP-s
stars. We study how the accretion of the wind of stellar companions, especially asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, modifies the
element abundances of metal-poor stars and, in particular, lithium, taking into account the stellar structure and the hydrodynamic
processes that take place after accretion. We compare the results with the observations of lithium and heavier elements in these old
stars on the main sequence.
Methods. We use the Montréal/Montpellier stellar evolution code, which includes atomic diffusion and thermohaline convection, to
compute the internal structure of the proto-CEMP-s stars and their evolution, from [Fe/H] = −2.31 down to [Fe/H] = −5.45. We
study a number of cases that vary according to the masses of the stars, their ages, metallicities, and the distances to their respective
companions.
Results. We show that the observations of lithium dispersion that is associated (or not) with carbon enrichment are well accounted for
in terms of accretion on to the metal-poor stars of the winds of stellar companions, with accreted masses smaller than those considered
in previous studies. The derived primordial value is in accordance with the cosmological results."

1. Introduction
"Most of the light elements that are currently observed in the Uni-
verse, namely, D, 3He, 4He, and 7Li, were produced about five
minutes after the Big Bang as part of the so-called Big Bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN). The precise quantity of the elements
formed in this process closely depends on the baryonic density of
the Universe ΩB (ratio of the baryonic to the total matter-energy
density). For this reason, determining their original abundances
from the observed ones by taking into account their abundance
evolution over time is crucial from a cosmological viewpoint.
The largest uncertainties in this respect lie in the way their time
evolution is evaluated. Comparisons between the constraints ob-
tained on ΩB from BBN and, independently, from the cosmo-
logical background lead to important information on the mass-
energy content of the Universe."
"Each of the four primordial isotopes represents a special
case. The determination of their abundances at the present time
and the evaluation of their evolution with time since the Big
Bang are different. Here we focus on the lithium problem. The
main constraints on this element rely on spectroscopic obser-
vations of the oldest stars of the Galaxy. Lithium is observed
through only one doublet, at 607.78nm. When Spite & Spite"
"(1982) discovered that this lithium feature was similar in all
the PopII stars that they observed, they deduced that they had
reached the primordial lithium abundance, and they gave the
value of A(Li) = 2.05 ± 0.15 in the usual scale1. Since this
work, many other studies found that the dispersion in this lithium
plateau was small and within the error bars (Rebolo et al. 1988)."
"Meanwhile, stellar physicists immediately pointed out that
the currently observed lithium abundance in these stars could
not, in fact, be the original one (Michaud et al. 1984). The
lithium nucleus is easily destroyed by proton capture at a tem-
perature of about 2.5 million degrees, not very deep inside the
star. If the stellar gas is stable against turbulence or any kind of
mixing, the lithium must have partially sunk from the outer lay-
ers owing to atomic diffusion (dominated by the gravitational
settling contribution). In the case that some mixing exists in-
side the star that is strong enough to prevent this settling, then
the lithium atoms are transported down to the layers where they
are then destroyed. This was confirmed by several subsequent
works from various studies, showing that the original lithium
abundance in these stars should have been at least twice that
which had been observed (e.g Vauclair 1988). More recently,"

"Korn et al. (2006, 2007) studied the lithium and heavy element
abundances in the globular cluster NGC 6397. They could repro-
duce both the lithium plateau and the iron abundance observed
in the stars of this cluster, with an original lithium abundance
two times the present one, as well as depletion processes includ-
ing both atomic diffusion and parametrised turbulence. Similar
results were found in the globular clusters NGC 6752 (Gruyters
et al. 2013) and M30 (Gruyters et al. 2016)."
"The basic reasons supporting the belief that the observed
plateau abundance was primordial were twofold. The first rea-
son was the very small dispersion, which seemed, at first sight,
difficult to reconcile with any type of depletion. Precise compu-
tations show, however, that the mass range of the plateau stars is
small, between 0.70 and 0.78 M�, and their internal structures do
not differ very much, with metallicities between [Fe/H] = −1.31
and −2.31, so that transport processes lead to similar depletion
factors (see Figure 2 of Richard et al. 2002). The second reason
was the peculiar behaviour on the part of the observed lithium
abundance with stellar metallicity. In young metal-rich stars, the
lithium dispersion is large. The maximum lithium abundance is
about ten times that which is observed in old stars and the disper-
sion is the signature of lithium depletion in these stars via settling
or nuclear destruction. On the other hand, when observing older
stars with smaller metallicities, it appeared that the dispersion
would decrease rapidly, leading to the plateau value (Steigman
2002). We notice, however, that lithium was not detected in a
few of these stars (Spite & Spite 1993), leading to upper limits
that were not taken into account in most subsequent studies."
"More recently, two different observations have thrown stones
into the water. Firstly, there were the observations of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) by the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and then Planck proved that the pri-
mordial lithium abundance is indeed larger than the plateau value
(Cyburt et al. 2016; Coc & Vangioni 2017). Secondly, the spec-
troscopic observations of very low-metallicity stars show that,
contrary to expectations, the lithium dispersion is very large
(Bonifacio et al. 2007; Cayrel et al. 2008; Sbordone et al. 2010)."
"The extremely metal-poor stars (EMP) are classified in var-
ious types, according to their observed chemical composition
(Beers & Christlieb 2005). A large number of these stars are
carbon-rich, namely, carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars (CEMP)
and some of them are also enhanced by s-process elements
(CEMP-s)."
"The formation of CEMP-s stars is currently attributed to the
accretion of the wind of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) com-
panion (McClure & Woodsworth 1990; Jorissen et al. 2016). In
this case, the accreted matter is diluted inside the newly formed
CEMP-s star due to macroscopic and microscopic transport pro-
cesses. The study of these transport processes is necessary for
improving our understanding of the surface abundance patterns
of CEMP-s stars. One of these processes is thermohaline convec-
tion. Stancliffe et al. (2007) presented the first models of CEMP-
s star formation that include this process. Then atomic diffusion
without radiative acceleration, in the trace element approxima-
tion, was included in the models (Stancliffe & Glebbeek 2008;
Stancliffe 2009). More recently, the effects of radiative acceler-
ations (without rotation) and the effects of rotation (without ra-
diative accelerations) were included in the models (Matrozis &
Stancliffe 2016, 2017). All these studies showed that these pro-
cesses are crucial for explaining the formation of CEMP-s stars
and are able to reproduce the surface abundances of these stars
relatively well from the main sequence to the red giant phase at
[Fe/H]= −2.31."
"In this paper, we simultaneously treat two questions, namely:
lithium depletion from the primordial value to the present one
observed as an upper envelope in the old stars and the rea-
son for the increase of the dispersion at very low metallicity.
The CEMP-s stars offer the opportunity to address these ques-
tions in the presence of accretion, which has a strong impact on
lithium abundance, particularly because of thermohaline convec-
tion. Stancliffe (2009) already addressed the lithium abundance
in CEMP-s stars in this context for stars with [Fe/H]= −2.31 and
accretion masses from 0.001 to 0.1 M� according to the Bondi–
Hoyle–Lyttleton theory (Bondi & Hoyle 1944; Hoyle & Lyttle-
ton 1939). They found that lithium was completely depleted at
the surface of their models (in contradiction with the lithium
determined from observations), and they concluded that either
the efficiency of thermohaline was overestimated or the accreted
masses were too large."
"In this study, we focus on main-sequence CEMP-s stars,
where the surface abundance pattern is not affected by con-
vective dredge-up, in order to study, specifically, the effect of
atomic diffusion (including radiative accelerations), turbulent
mixing, and thermohaline convection on lithium surface abun-
dances. We computed models with the Montreal/Montpellier
code. This code uses completely different numerical schemes,
micro-physics, and physical prescriptions than were applied in
previous studies. This allows for comparisons and a verification
of the robustness of the results. Furthermore, we explore the ef-
fect of smaller accreted masses and we also extend the study to
lower initial metallicities."
"In Section 2, we analyse the status of the observed lithium in
CEMP stars. In Section 3, we describe the stellar code that we
use in the computations, the input physics, the turbulent mixing
prescription, and the processes of lithium diffusion and destruc-
tion. Section 4 is devoted to the consequences of the accretion
of AGB winds on extremely metal-poor stars according to the
stellar masses, the chemical composition of the wind, and the
age of the EMP star at the time of accretion. We also discuss
thermohaline convection, which appears as soon as heavy matter
is accreted at the stellar surface. The quantitative results of the
accretion on the lithium abundances are given in Section 5 for a
large number of different cases. The scenario for heavy elements
is also discussed in this section, as well as the carbon isotopic ra-
tios. Section 6 is devoted to a general discussion of these results,
along with a qualitative discussion of cases of various observed
EMP stars showing different chemical characteristics in compar-
ison to the CEMP-s stars."
2. Lithium in CEMP stars
"The observations of the most metal-poor stars of the Galaxy
show specific patterns in heavy elements that have to be taken
into account when discussing the lithium abundances. Most of
the observed EMP stars present an overabundance of carbon and
are therefore classified as CEMP stars. The exact proportion of
these stars is however difficult to evaluate. We must start by mak-
ing note of the two different definitions for CEMP stars pub-
lished in the literature. Firstly, Beers & Christlieb (2005) take
CEMP to refer to all stars with [C/Fe] > 0.7, whereas Aoki et al.
(2007) put the limit up to [C/Fe] > 1. In addition, it is not always
possible to measure the carbon abundance in these stars owing
to low signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) in the stellar spectra (Bonifa-
cio et al. 2015; Aguado et al. 2019b). In spite of these difficul-
ties, it appears to be well-established that the carbon enhance-
ment increases with decreasing metallicity (Beers & Christlieb
2005; Bonifacio et al. 2015; Chiaki & Wise 2019). Aguado et al."
"Article number, page 2 of 14"
M. Deal et al.: Matter accretion in metal-poor stars down to extremely metal-poor stars and the lithium problem
"(2019b) report a fraction of CEMP stars (with [C/Fe] ≥ +0.7) of
41 ± 4% for stars with −3 < [Fe/H] < −2 and 58 ± 14% for stars
with [Fe/H] < −3."
"Some of the CEMP stars, called CEMP-s, are also enriched
in s-process elements, whereas some others, the CEMP-rs are
overabundant in both r and s elements. Very few CEMP stars are
overabundant in r-process elements only. There are also CEMP
stars with a normal (solar) pattern of heavy elements, which are
referred to as CEMP-no (Beers & Christlieb 2005; Masseron
et al. 2010, and references therein)."
"The most promising scenario for the formation of these
CEMP-s stars states that during their main-sequence phase, they
were subject to strong accretion episodes from winds emitted by
a more evolved companion. As shown by many authors (Fuji-
moto et al. 2000; Stancliffe & Glebbeek 2008; Masseron et al.
2010, 2012), the observed patterns of CEMP-s stars are well ac-
counted for by accretion from an AGB star. The final results de-
pend on several parameters: the composition of the wind, the
initial mass of the AGB, the distance of the two stars at the time
of accretion, and the age of the system when the accretion oc-
curred."
"The situation for other subclasses of CEMP stars is less clear
than that of the CEMP-s. The theories include accretion from
type II supernova (SNII) transfer, accretion-induced collapse of
white dwarfs (Jonsell et al. 2006), failed SN (Umeda & Nomoto
2003), and non-standard AGB (Suda et al. 2004). A statistical
analysis of radial velocity variations (Lucatello et al. 2005) in-
deed shows that most CEMP-s and CEMP-rs are binaries."
"As discussed further on in this paper, the accretion of heavy
matter on to a star leads to an inversion of the mean molecu-
lar weight, which may trigger thermohaline convection. The re-
sulting abundances depend on the strength and extension of this
mixing episode. During its main-sequence evolution, the proto-
CEMP star may undergo atomic diffusion, which leads to helium
settling that builds a stabilising mu-gradient below the convec-
tive zone prior to the accretion episode (Thompson et al. 2008).
This original gradient competes with the one induced by accre-
tion, strongly influencing the mixing and, thus, the final observed
abundances."
"The lithium abundances are very interesting to study in this
context. The observations show a large abundance spread among
the CEMP stars, larger than for normal EMP stars (Masseron
et al. 2012). Many main-sequence CEMP stars have lithium
abundances smaller than that of the Spite Plateau and some of
them have abundances that are compatible with the plateau."
3. Stellar models
3.1. Input physics
"The models are computed using the Montréal/Montpellier stel-
lar evolution code. Below we give a brief summary of the in-
put physics used in this code. A complete description may be
found in papers by Turcotte et al. (1998), Richer et al. (1998)
and Richard et al. (2001)."
"Atomic diffusion is taken into account in all our models for
H, 3He, 4He, 6Li, 7Li, 9Be, 10B, 11B, 12C, 13C, N, O, Ne, Na, Mg,
Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni. Here, we com-
pute the diffusion velocities in a more rigorous way than in previ-
ous computations of CEMP-s models. We extensively solve the
Burgers (1969) equations, whereas previous works only used the
trace element approximation. The formulations of Paquette et al.
(1986) are used to determine the collision integrals. A partial
ionisation of elements is taken into account (Turcotte et al. 1998;"

lowing an opacity sampling method and with OPAL monochro-
matic data (Iglesias & Rogers 1996; Richer et al. 1998; Vick
et al. 2010). The considered initial metallicities for the mod-
els used in this work range from [Fe/H]ini=−2.31 (metallicity
used in previous studies, see Section 1) to metallicities as low as
[Fe/H]ini = −5.45. We adopted an initial distribution for heavy
elements as given by Asplund et al. (2009) and normalised for
the considered metallicities. We added an α-elements enhance-
ment of [α/Fe]=+0.3, as expected for population II stars (Van-
denBerg et al. 2000). The initial lithium abundance is that given
by Coc & Vangioni (2017) from the standard Big Bang nucle-
osynthesis (SBBN) results, that is, A(Li)=2.74. The complete
initial chemical mixtures can be found in Table 1."
"The equation of state is that of Eggleton, Faulkner and
Flannery, including Coulomb interactions (CEFF, Christensen-
Dalsgaard & Daeppen 1992), which takes into account the exact
chemical mixture during the stellar evolution, as modified by the
atomic diffusion and additional transport processes. Most other
equations of state may only be computed for fixed or very lim-
ited ranges of mixtures of heavy elements. The Rosseland opac-
ity is computed at each mesh point and each time step from the
OPAL monochromatic data (Iglesias & Rogers 1996). The opac-
ities are complemented at low temperatures (T < 12000 K) with
the Kurucz opacity tables (Kurucz 1993). The nuclear reactions
rates are from Bahcall & Pinsonneault (1992). We used grey at-
mospheres as surface boundary conditions. The convection is"

Vitense (1958) with a solar calibrated mixing-length parameter

on the Schwarzschild criterion."
3.2. Turbulent mixing prescription
"The surface abundance evolution is the result of a complex in-
teraction between microscopic and macroscopic transport pro-
cesses. Atomic diffusion alone produces too large or too small
surface abundances, depending on the elements, compared to
those deduced from the observations. Several competing trans-
port processes, such as mass loss (Vick et al. 2010; Michaud
et al. 2011; Vick et al. 2013; Matrozis & Stancliffe 2016), tur-
bulence (Richer et al. 2000; Richard et al. 2002; Stancliffe 2009;
Matrozis & Stancliffe 2016), rotation (Palacios et al. 2003; Talon
et al. 2006; Eggenberger et al. 2010; Matrozis & Stancliffe 2017;
Deal et al. 2020), and thermohaline convection (Théado et al.
2009; Deal et al. 2016) are known. These processes may all be
at work together in a given stellar situation, leading to complex
mixing. Because the aim of this paper is not to study the in-
dividual influence of these processes, we decided to adopt the
simple adhoc parametrisation developed in Richer et al. (2000),
which has been used in many studies (Richard et al. 2001, 2005;
Michaud et al. 2011). The associated turbulent diffusion coeffi-
cient is expressed as"
"Dturb = 400 DHe(T0)
(
ρ(T0)
ρ"
")3
, (1)"
"where T0 is a reference temperature that may be defined as such,
or as the temperature at a reference depth (Richer et al. 2000;
Richard et al. 2001; Michaud et al. 2011). Furthermore, DHe(T0)
is the diffusion coefficient of helium at the reference point, ρ the
local density, and ρ(T0) the density at the reference point. Here,
we use the same parametrisation as (Richard et al. 2005, ie. an
amplitude equal to 400 and a power law of 3) to be able to com-
pare our results with theirs. As explained in the next section,
the reference point is parametrised so as to reproduce a lithium
plateau in the considered range of effective temperatures. We
note that the reference temperature (or reference depth of the
mixing) is the only free parameter in this parametrisation. The
models are labelled as T[log10(T0/K)], as, for instance, T5.80."
3.3. Lithium abundances induced by turbulent mixing
"The evolution on the main sequence of surface [Fe/H] and
lithium abundance versus Teff are presented in Fig. 1, for dif-
ferent prescriptions of turbulence below the convective zone.
Atomic diffusion is fully effective in the model in which no other
mixing than standard convection is added (magenta dotted lines)
and is dominated by the gravitational settling contribution, for
both iron and lithium, in the first part of the main-sequence evo-
lution. Around Teff = 6300 K, the surface convective zone is thin
enough that radiative acceleration becomes the dominant contri-
bution for iron but not for lithium, while later when Teff rises
above 6400 K, radiative acceleration becomes the dominant con-
tribution for lithium (see also Richard et al. 2002). In the models
computed with the turbulence mixing T5.80 and T6.24 (respec-
tively: blue dashed lines and green lines, as described in Section
3.2), there are no surface element over-abundances compared to
the initial one – contrary to the models without turbulence. Tur-
bulent mixing prevents any strong element accumulation. The"

and the green line correspond, respectively, to the models with no other
mixing than standard convection, with T5.80 turbulence and with T6.24
turbulence. The horizontal black dashed line represents the initial abun-
dances of the models."
"surface abundance of iron is indeed always smaller than the ini-
tial one, by less than 0.3 dex for the T5.80 model and 0.1 dex for
the T6.24 model."
"In Fig. 2, we present the behaviour of the lithium surface
abundance with Teff , at 12.5 Gyr for models without accretion
with different masses and [Fe/H]ini (different symbols) and with
different prescriptions for turbulence below the convective zone.
The magenta symbols correspond to models in which no other
mixing than standard convection is introduced. In this case,
lithium is only subject to atomic diffusion below the convec-
tive zone. The lithium abundance decreases with increasing Teff ,
due to the dominant contribution of gravitational settling, up to
Teff=6400 K. Above this effective temperature, the lithium abun-
dance increases due to radiative accelerations, which become
large enough to overcome gravity for the two lower metallicities.
The blue and green symbols correspond respectively to models
with T5.80 and T6.25 turbulence below the convective zone. In
this range of turbulence prescriptions, the effect of turbulence
is twofold. Firstly, it reduces the lithium variations induced by
atomic diffusion for hotter stars. We can see in the figure that
this effect happens for the two cases, and that it is larger when the
turbulence is stronger, as expected. Above 6000 K, the lithium
depletion in the T6.24 model is nearly horizontal as a function"

it transports lithium down to its nuclear burning layers in cooler

destroyed for T5.80 models, that is, for the weakest turbulence,
whereas it is strongly destroyed in the T6.24 models."
"These models show that the reference temperature for the
turbulent diffusion coefficient should be between log(T0) = 5.8
and log(T0) = 6.24 to be consistent with a lithium plateau at
[Fe/H]ini = −2.31 down to [Fe/H]ini = −5.45, which is in agree-
ment with the results of Richard et al. (2005) for Spite plateau
stars. We also show here that the efficiency of the mixing does
not depend on the considered initial chemical mixture (Grevesse
& Noels 1993 or Asplund et al. 2009) nor on the metallicity in
the range of our study."
"4. Accretion of AGB winds on main-sequence EMP
stars"
4.1. Method
"In the following, we compute the effects of the accretion of AGB
winds on main-sequence extremely metal-poor stars, leading to
the formation of CEMP-s stars. The proto-CEMP-s models are
evolved up to the age at which the more massive companion is
going through the AGB phases and ejects matter. The wind mat-
ter accreted on to the star is considered as fully mixed inside the
convective zone on a time scale smaller than the evolution time
step. This accretion is modelled by changing the chemical com-
position of the convective zone at this age. Then the evolution
goes on with the new composition up to the end of the main se-
quence. The chosen accreted masses are 3.8 × 10−3, 3.8 × 10−2,
3.8 × 10−1, 5.0 × 10−1, 6.0 × 10−1, 8.0 × 10−1, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.8,
8, and 38 MX. These modify the total stellar mass by less than
about 0.5%, which is small enough to be neglected in this type
of model, and can be up to about 5% when 38 MX are accreted
in the case of a companion of 1 M�."
4.2. Chemical composition of the accreted wind
"For the chemical composition of the accreted matter, we have
selected that given in the literature for AGB winds, according"
"to the metallicity range of the CEMPS-s stars by, namely, Stan-
cliffe & Glebbeek (2008) for [Fe/H]ini=−2.31 and Campbell &
Lattanzio (2008) for the lower metallicities of [Fe/H]ini=−3.00,
−4.00 and [Fe/H]ini=−5.45. We only considered the elements
taken into account in the Montréal/Montpellier code. The con-
sidered chemical compositions and ejection ages are presented
in Table 2 for the different masses of AGB companions used.
We note that these wind compositions do not take into account
the possible increase of lithium inside the wind due to the ther-
mohaline convection that may occur during the AGB phase as
shown by Stancliffe (2010). The impact of neglecting this aspect
is discussed in Section 6.5."
4.3. Age at the time of accretion
"Another important aspect is the age at which the winds are
ejected, that is, when they are accreted by the proto-CEMP-s.
Stancliffe & Glebbeek (2008) provided ages at which the ejec-
tion of AGB winds end. We considered these ages as the time
when all the accreted matter reaches the surface convective zone
of the accreting star. This assumption is valid as long as the time
step of evolution of the accreting star (in our models, between 10
and 150 Myr on the main sequence) is on the same order as or
larger than the typical time of the AGB phase of the companion,
namely, between 10 and 17 Myr at 0.9 M�, decreasing with in-
creasing mass, as given by Bressan et al. (1986) and Bossini et al.
(2015) or between 1.3 and 0.32 Myr, according to Dell’Agli et al.
(2019). From the point of view of the evolution of the accret-
ing star model, this can be considered as instantaneous accretion
over a time step."
4.4. Thermohaline convection
"Thermohaline (fingering) convection occurs when the thermal
gradient is stable and the mean molecular weight gradient unsta-
ble. If the thermal stabilising effect is smaller than that of the µ
destabilising, this leads to dynamical convection (Ledoux crite-
rion). In the reverse case, the medium should be stable in the first
approximation but it is not; this is due to the fact that the ther-
mal diffusivity is much larger than the particle diffusivity. When
a blob of matter falls towards the centre of the star, the heat goes
in more quickly than the particles escape and the blob keeps on
sinking. This effect generates a mixing of chemicals in that re-
gion. Such an instability may occur during the main-sequence
phase in the case of the accumulation of local elements by atomic
diffusion (Théado et al. 2009; Deal et al. 2016; Hui-Bon-Hoa &
Vauclair 2018) or in the case of accretion (Vauclair 2004; Stan-
cliffe et al. 2007; Théado et al. 2010; Garaud 2011; Deal et al.
2013, 2015; Wachlin et al. 2017, and reference therein). In the
low-mass models of this study, atomic diffusion does not lead to
any unstable mean molecular weight gradient. On the other hand,
the accretion of heavy matter is able to produce such a gradient
and trigger thermohaline convection."
"We implemented the 1D prescription of Brown et al. (2013)
in the Montréal/Montpellier code in the same way as it was ap-
plied in the Toulouse Geneva Evolution code (Zemskova et al.
2014; Deal et al. 2015, 2016). This prescription has been shown
to be in better agreement with 3D than the previous simulations.
In particular, the study of Kippenhahn et al. (1980) overestimates
the mixing efficiency in some configurations (Prat et al. 2015).
Here, we do not include the possible effects of shears (Garaud
et al. 2019) or magnetic fields (Harrington & Garaud 2019)."

"on the AGB mass, the composition of the wind, the distance be-
tween the two stars, and the convective mass of the secondary.
At the same time, we introduce the mixing induced by thermo-
haline convection, which depends on the internal structure of the
secondary, and on its age."
5.1. The formation of CEMP-s stars and lithium abundance
"In order to assess the impact of thermohaline convection in-
duced by accretion on the surface abundances of EMP stars, we
computed models at three initial metallicities, for two masses
of the primary (the AGB), three masses of the secondary (the
proto-CEMP-s), and for accreted masses between 3.8×10−3 and
38 MX. The characteristics of the models are presented in Ta-
ble 3."
"As shown in Tables 2 and 3, in all cases, the initial total
metallicity (Zini) of the secondary (the proto-CEMP-s) is be-
tween two and seven orders of magnitude lower that the metallic-
ity of the wind (Zwind). This means that small amounts of matter
accreted by the proto-CEMP-s stars are enough to induce unsta-
ble mean molecular weight gradients at the bottom of the surface
convective zones and lead to thermohaline convection in these
regions. The 12C relative abundance is at least two orders of mag-
nitude larger in the wind than at the surface of the EMP star. The"
"amount of accreted matter needed to create a CEMP star is then
quite small. As for lithium, the final abundances strongly depend
on the stabilising µ-gradients that the EMP stars had time to de-
velop before the accretion episodes."
"For example, for a 1 M� star with [Fe/H]ini=−2.31 (Zini =
6.0 × 10−5), Stancliffe & Glebbeek (2008) predicted an AGB
wind ejection at the age of 5.83 Gyr. Up to that age, the main-
sequence proto-CEMP-s star had enough time to build a strong
stabilising µ-gradient below the outer convective zone, basically
due to helium settling (lower panel of Fig. 3). After accretion,
thermohaline convection may only develop down to the stabilis-
ing µ-gradient, that is, log(M/M∗) ≈ −2.2. This leads to heavy
element overabundances in the stellar outer layers, but no extra
lithium destruction, because the mixing process did not reach the
lithium nuclear destruction layers. The accreting star becomes a
CEMP-s star with surface lithium close to the plateau abundance."
"For a 3 M� star with the same metallicity, [Fe/H]ini=−2.31,
the AGB wind ejection occurs much earlier, at an age of 270
Myr. In this case, the proto-CEMP-s star did not have enough
time to build a strong stabilising gradient before the accretion
episode. The induced thermohaline convection is not prevented
from proceeding deep into the star, so that the accreted matter
is mixed down to the lithium destruction region (upper panel of
Fig. 3). The accreting star becomes a CEMP-s star with depleted"

ously been obtained (eg. Stancliffe & Glebbeek 2008)."
"We present in Fig. 4 the results of the predicted abundances
of our models together with the most recent observations of the
surface lithium abundances in CEMP-s main-sequence stars and
in some unclassified CEMP stars, as gathered in the SAGA data
base2 (Suda et al. 2008, 2011; Yamada et al. 2013; Suda et al.
2017 and Matsuno et al. 2017). We notice that around half of
observed lithium abundances are, in fact, upper limits, so that
the real lithium abundance may still be smaller than the given
points."
"The surface lithium abundances shown with open symbols
in this figure are those predicted by our models at an age of
12.5 Gyr. Each model has undergone an accretion episode at a
time related to the evolution and, thus, to the mass of the AGB
companion (top panels: 1.0 M�, accretion at 5.83 Gyr; middle
panels: 2.0 M�, accretion at 0.748 Gyr; bottom panels: 3.0 M�,
accretion at 0.27 Gyr). The left and the right panels display, re-
spectively, the results as a function of the effective temperature
and metallicity for the three considered masses of the proto-
CEMP-s, that is, 0.7, 0.75, and 0.78 M�. We can see that an im-
portant lithium dispersion appears in the models for AGB masses"
2 http://sagadatabase.jp/
"of 2.0 M� and 3.0 M�, which is in accordance with the observa-
tions."
"The reason for the appearance of lithium destruction for
large-enough AGB masses is indirect. The larger the AGB mass,
the more rapid its evolution and the smaller the age of the proto-
CEMP-s when the accretion episode occurs. For small ages, the
stabilising µ−gradient did not have enough time to settle below
the convective zone, so that thermohaline convection was not
prevented from proceeding down to the lithium destruction layer.
For the 3.0 M� AGB (earliest accretion), with accreted masses
between 0.38 and 1 MX, the models predict depletion of lithium
down to A(Li) ≈ 0.5. For the 2.0 M� AGB slightly higher ac-
creted masses, between 1 and 3.8 MX, are needed to obtain a
similar depletion. For the 1.0 M� AGB, the models predict deple-
tion of lithium for accreted masses of at least 38 MX. For larger
accreted masses, lithium would be even more depleted because a
larger µ-gradient inversion induces a more efficient thermohaline
convection."
"Figure 5 is similar to Fig. 4 and presents the lithium sur-
face abundances as a function of [C/Fe]. The carbon-over-iron
ratio [C/Fe] increases according to the accreted mass due to the
chemical composition of the AGB wind, but its final value also
depends on the mixing process below the convective zone, which
dilutes the abundances downwards inside the star. We can also
see in Fig. 5 that the maximum [C/Fe] which is reached de-
creases for increasing AGB mass. Here again, the reason is re-
lated to the age at which the accretion episode occurs. For large
AGB masses, thermohaline convection is not prevented from go-
ing deep into the star, so that carbon is more diluted. This is also
the reason why, for an AGB mass of 3.0 M�, lithium destruction
appears for [C/Fe] ratios smaller than 0.7: deep mixing leads
both to lithium depletion and carbon dilution. We note that the
variation of [C/Fe] for each case depends on the detailed chemi-
cal composition of the wind and of the metallicity of the consid-
ered stars. On the contrary, the lithium depletion mainly depends
on the mean molecular weight of the accreted matter."
"The lithium abundance in the wind may vary according to
the metallicity and the mass of the AGB star. However, in the
cases where lithium is not destroyed by nuclear reactions, all
models lead to lithium abundances that are very close to those
of the plateau. The reason is that the mass of the region where
the chemical composition is homogenised by the turbulent mix-
ing is similar in all models and much larger than the accreted
masses (see Mmix in Table 3). In this situation, the total mixed
zone is much more important than the dynamical convective
zone of the proto-CEMP-s and the lithium abundance differences
are smoothed out by dilution."
"The proto-CEMP stars also accrete s-process elements from
the AGB wind so that they become CEMP-s stars. We do not
include a detailed study of the evolution of s-process elements
in these stars in this paper and we limit our discussion to the
evolution of a few heavy elements below."
5.2. Heavy elements and isotopic carbon ratios
"In this section, we only consider models with [Fe/H] > −5.45 so
as to be consistent with the metallicity of the stars for which the
considered chemical elements are observed."
"The ratio 12C/13C is smaller in CEMP-s stars than in C-
normal stars. Figure 6 presents the comparison between our
models and the observations from the SAGA data base (same ref-
erences as in Fig. 4). CEMP-s main-sequence stars have 12C/13C
between 0 and 60. Models without accretion show larger values
of 12C/13C≈ 91. On the other hand, the observed ratios are easily"

by Stancliffe (2009). This indicates either a possible issue in the
predicted chemical abundances in AGB winds or in the accre-
tion/transport scenario. The fact that lithium surface abundances
are well reproduced in our models may point to the first expla-
nation because lithium is a powerful probe of the transport of
chemical elements in stars."
6. Discussion and conclusions
"6.1. Impact of the input physics on the computed lithium
abundances"
"The results presented in this paper show that the observations
of lithium abundances in extremely metal-poor stars may be ac-
counted for in the framework of the accretion scenario. A main-
sequence metal-poor star accretes matter from the wind of an
AGB companion. This creates an inversion of the mean molec-
ular weight and leads to thermohaline convection. The effect of
this convection depends on the accreted mass, but also on the
physical state of the accreting star before accretion. If this star
had time to build a stabilising helium gradient under its convec-
tive zone, the thermohaline mixing is less efficient. Our results
differ from the previously published ones for several reasons, in-
cluding the input physics, the range of metallicities of the studied
stars, and the range of accreted masses."
"Concerning the input physics, basic improvements may be
found in the computation of atomic diffusion and that of ther-
mohaline mixing. In our code, the treatment of atomic diffusion
is done by solving the full set of Burgers equations, whereas
previous studies remained in the framework of the trace ele-
ment approximation. To show the importance of atomic diffu-
sion in the final results, we present in Fig. 8 computations of
lithium abundance variations during the evolution of a 0.75 M�,
[Fe/H]ini = −2.31, in which we have suppressed atomic diffu-
sion (orange curve, compared to the blue one done with the cor-
rect physical input). There is a difference of about 3 dex for the
lithium abundance obtained at 12.5 Gyr."

"For thermohaline convection, we used the prescription of
Brown et al. (2013), which is based on 3D simulations. Pre-
vious studies used either the Kippenhahn et al. (1980) approx-
imate diffusion coefficient, or that same coefficient multiplied
by 100 as proposed by Charbonnel & Zahn (2007) to reproduce
some abundance trends on the red giant branch (e.g. Stancliffe

code, using different prescriptions for thermohaline. The differ-
ences may reach 0.4 dex."

"paper, we also carry out computations for very small metallic-
ities ([Fe/H] = −3.0, −4.0 and −5.45), which are smaller than
these already studied in the past ([Fe/H] = −2.31). We also used
smaller accreted masses than before."
6.2. Back to context
"More than 75% of massive stars in our Galaxy belong to binary
or multiple systems and their evolution strongly depends on their
interactions with smaller companions (Sana et al. 2012). Con-
versely, most of the very old low-mass stars that are still on the
main sequence must have been part of binary or multiple systems
including more massive companions. These secondary stars have
had various opportunities to accrete matter from the winds of the
more evolved primaries. As a consequence, the chemical com-
position of the outer layers of these secondaries was modified
according to the given accretion episodes."
"The chemical transformation depends on many parameters.
Firstly, the mass of the primary determines the age of the ac-
cretion episode and the chemical composition of the wind. Sec-
ondly, the distance between both stars at the time of accretion
affects the accreted mass. Thirdly, the internal constitution of
the secondary depends on its mass and age. Last but not least,
the atomic diffusion processes that occurred in the secondary
before accretion act as important constraints on the resulting fi-
nal abundances. When the secondary accretes matter of heavier
mean molecular weight than its own, thermohaline convection
develops. This mixes the accreted matter downwards. If, how-"
"Article number, page 11 of 14"
A&A proofs: manuscript no. CEMP
"ever, atomic diffusion had time to build a stabilising µ-gradient
below the outer stellar convective zone, before accretion, this
gradient acts against thermohaline mixing and prevents it from
developing deep inside the star."
"Such a scenario has been successfully invoked to account
for the carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars enriched in s-process
elements (CEMP-s), with winds coming from AGBs onto the
proto-CEMP-s (Fujimoto et al. 2000; Stancliffe et al. 2007; Stan-
cliffe & Glebbeek 2008; Stancliffe 2009; Masseron et al. 2010,
2012; Matrozis & Stancliffe 2016, 2017, and references therein).
This scenario offers a straightforward explanation for the car-
bon enhancements and also the s-process overabundances as ob-
served in most of these stars. CEMP-no stars (without any excess
of s-process elements) also show a binary fraction of 32% (Ar-
entsen et al. 2019). Lithium abundances could then be affected
by thermohaline mixing induced by wind accretion in this type
of CEMP star too. Accretion from other types of evolved stars,
such as type II supernovae (SNII), failed SN, white dwarf col-
lapses, non-standard AGBs, have been invoked to account for
very metal-poor stars with different chemical compositions, with
the possible effect of depleting lithium as compared to that of the
plateau ."
6.3. Lithium in old metal-poor stars
"In any case, if accretion occurs early enough onto the main-
sequence companion (where early enough means that the pri-
mary star is massive enough), no stabilising µ-gradient had time
to build before the accretion episode and thermohaline convec-
tion can mix the accreted matter down to the lithium destruction
regions. We thus expect, in quite a natural way, for lithium to be
depleted in many of these stars as long as the total metallicity
of the wind is larger than that of the accreting star. We note that
the lithium destruction depends only on the metallicity of the
wind, not on the detailed chemical composition. Furthermore,
this depletion naturally occurs in various ways, according to the
aforementioned parameters of the stellar system. We thus expect
a large lithium dispersion, as has been observed."
"Here, we have focused our quantitative study on the CEMP-
s case because these stars have been extensively observed and
their formation is believed to be caused by a wind accretion from
AGB companion. The chemical compositions of these winds are
available in the literature (Stancliffe & Glebbeek 2008; Camp-
bell & Lattanzio 2008), so it was possible for us to do precise
computations on the induced lithium abundances. We found a
large dispersion in the final lithium abundances, as observed.
The lithium depletion generally occurs in concordance with car-
bon and heavy element enhancements, except for the cases of
massive AGB stars and low-age accretion. In this case, lithium
is destroyed but the greater mixing below the convection zone
also reduces the accreted overabundance to a point where it is no
longer observable."
6.4. Accreted masses
"The accreted masses needed to deplete lithium are quite small.
The minimum is around 0.5 MX, which corresponds to about
5 × 10−4 M�. An accreted mass of 4 MX, i.e. 4 × 10"
"−3 M�
is enough to reduce the lithium abundance by three orders of
magnitude. Some general estimates of the accreted mass on to
a stellar companion have been obtained with numerical simu-
lations according to the Bondi–Hoyle–Lyttleton theory, without
angular momentum loss (Stancliffe et al. 2007) – or with angular"
"momentum loss and wind-assisted Roche-lobe overflow (Abate
et al. 2015). The estimates of the mean accreted masses in all
these cases lie between 0.002 and 0.35 M�. This is larger than
what is needed to destroy lithium. The orders of magnitude are
however not so different and we must recall that around half
of the observed lithium abundances given in these stars are in
fact upper limits (Fig. 4 and 5). It is also important to note that
CEMP-s with a lithium surface abundance at the plateau value
are observed (see dark grey symbols of Fig. 4 and 5 for observed
lithium abundances that are not upper limits). Our models sug-
gest that such small accreted masses are common and should be
considered in future studies of the formation of CEMP-s stars."
6.5. Chemical content of AGB winds
"In this work, we use the chemical composition of AGB winds
from two works: one by Stancliffe & Glebbeek (2008) for
[Fe/H]= −2.31 and the other by Campbell & Lattanzio (2008)
for smaller metallicities. These wind compositions were deter-
mined with different codes and methods, so that the effect of the
metallicity on the resulting surface abundances of CEMP-s stars
could be biased when comparing the models at [Fe/H]=-2.31
with the others. Furthermore, the results on the chemical com-
position of AGB winds at low metallicity are subject to large un-
certainties (e.g. Campbell & Lattanzio 2008). In spite of this, we
clearly see an impact of the metallicity on the accreted masses
needed to deplete lithium. Our results show that exploring the
impact of metallicity is crucial for the modelling of CEMP-s
stars."
"The wind compositions used in this work do not include the
possible increase of lithium due to thermohaline mixing inside
the AGB star itself. Without this effect, the lithium abundance in
winds lies between 0.15 and 0.4 dex (see A(Li) in Table 2). Ac-
cording to Stancliffe (2010), at [Fe/H]= −2.31, the lithium abun-
dance can reach 1.03 dex for a 1 M� AGB, 2.51 dex for a 1.5 M�
AGB, and 1.38 dex for a 2.0 M� AGB. No such computations
are available at the lower metallicities that we study and report
on here. We tried nevertheless to evaluate the possible effects
of such a lithium overabundance in the AGB wind. An accreted
mass of around 0.5 MX is needed to start the lithium depletion
induced by nuclear reactions This mass is about 12 times smaller
than the mass of the surface region where the chemical elements
are homogenised by the turbulent mixing (see Table 3 for Mmix)
in the proto-CEMP-s star models. This implies that the potential
lithium overabundance in the wind is diluted in the stellar outer
layers just after accretion. Then lithium destruction by nuclear
reactions at the bottom of the outer mixed zone should erase, in
most cases, the initial abundance differences – if there are any.
Furthermore, the region where the chemical composition is ho-
mogenised is even larger when thermohaline convection occurs."
"In order to test this effect quantitatively, we computed addi-
tional models including a lithium abundance of A(Li)= 2.51 dex
in the wind of a 1 and 2 M� AGB star at [Fe/H]= −2.31. We
made this choice because it is the maximum lithium abundance
predicted by Stancliffe (2010). The accreted mass in both models
is 0.5 MX. The proto-CEMP-s models have a mass of 0.75 M�.
For both models, the increase of the lithium abundance in the
winds has an impact of at most 0.005 dex on the CEMP-s sur-
face abundance at the turn-off. This comes from the fact that
at the moment of accretion, the surface lithium abundance of
the proto-CEMP-s model is somewhere between the primordial
value (2.74 dex) and the plateau value (2.2±0.2 dex). This is not
so different from the 2.51 dex of the wind. It implies that even for
larger accreted masses, the result would be the same. Moreover,"
"Article number, page 12 of 14"
M. Deal et al.: Matter accretion in metal-poor stars down to extremely metal-poor stars and the lithium problem
"the dilution of the accreted material occurs in a region which
is at least ten times more massive. Due to the combination of
these two effects, changing the lithium content of the wind leads
to an almost negligible effect on the final surface abundance of
CEMP-s stars."
6.6. Conclusion
"We computed CEMP-s models formed from the accretion of
an AGB companion wind using the Montréal/Montpellier evo-
lution code. We showed that in most cases, our models give
similar results to previous studies that include similar physics
but different prescriptions for atomic diffusion and thermohaline
convection at [Fe/H]= −2.31 (e.g. Matrozis & Stancliffe 2016,
and references therein). We also explored smaller metallicities
of [Fe/H]ini=−3.00, −4.00 and −5.45. We demonstrated that ac-
creted masses larger than 0.5 MX are needed in order to deplete
lithium thanks to thermohaline convection mixing, while smaller
accreted masses or no accretion lead to stars with lithium plateau
surface abundances. We were able to explain the lithium scatter
in CEMP-s stars taking into account different accreted masses,
initial metallicities, and masses of AGB companions."
"As mentioned in Section 6.4, the lithium abundance in the
accreted matter has a negligible impact on the surface lithium of
the accreting star. We thus expect a similar lithium evolution at
lower metallicities in our range of Teff , as long as the AGB wind
is over-metallic compared to the initial metallicity of the AGB
progenitor. For [Fe/H]ini < −5.45, it is possible to predict obser-
vations of stars with surface lithium abundances close to that of
the plateau (Aguado et al. 2019a), under two possible conditions:
firstly, for stars which accreted matter late in their evolution, af-
ter which a µ-gradient had time to build below the convective
zone; and secondly, for stars that accreted matter earlier but in
small quantities. Under all other conditions, lithium abundance
should be depleted compared to the plateau value."
"In conclusion, the lithium abundances observed in old stars
may be accounted for in most cases by simple depletion from an
original BBN value. This is exactly what is expected if the ob-
served stars accreted high mean molecular weight matter from
more evolved companions. These companions may still be vis-
ible or the system may have evolved in such a way that they
are no longer detectable. All these computations were performed
with an initial lithium abundance as deduced from SBBN. The
lithium plateau itself is a consequence of the competition be-
tween atomic diffusion and mixing processes. The so-called
’lithium problem’ may disappear for accreting stars in the sense
that the abundances of old stars are well understood in terms of
lithium depletion with an original abundance as obtained from
the cosmological background. Other types of accreting metal-
poor stars need to be investigated to extend the implications of
this result."
