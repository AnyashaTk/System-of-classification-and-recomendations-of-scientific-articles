"ABSTRACT
Constraints on the time-scales of quasar activity are key to understanding the formation and growth of supermassive black holes
(SMBHs), quasar triggering mechanisms, and possible feedback effects on their host galaxies. However, observational estimates
of this so-called quasar lifetime are highly uncertain (𝑡Q ∼ 104–109 yr), because most methods are indirect and involve many
model-dependent assumptions. Direct evidence of earlier activity is gained from the higher ionization state of the intergalactic
medium (IGM) in the quasar environs, observable as enhanced Ly𝛼 transmission in the so-called proximity zone. Due to the
∼ 30Myr equilibration time-scale of He ii in the 𝑧 ∼ 3 IGM, the size of the He ii proximity zone depends on the time the quasar
had been active before our observation 𝑡on ≤ 𝑡Q, enabling up to ±0.2 dex precise measurements of individual quasar on-times
that are comparable to the 𝑒-folding time-scale 𝑡S ∼ 44Myr of SMBH growth. Here we present the first statistical sample of 13
quasars whose accurate and precise systemic redshifts allow for measurements of sufficiently precise He ii quasar proximity zone
sizes between ' 2 and ' 15 proper Mpc from science-grade Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectra. Comparing these sizes to
predictions from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with one-dimensional radiative transfer, we infer a
broad range of quasar on-times from 𝑡on . 1Myr to 𝑡on > 30Myr that does not depend on quasar luminosity, black hole mass,
or Eddington ratio. These results point to episodic quasar activity over a long duty cycle, but do not rule out substantial SMBH
growth during phases of radiative inefficiency or obscuration."

1 INTRODUCTION
"Quasars1 are themost powerful sources of radiation that have emitted
at an almost sustained high luminosity during the short . 60 yr
time-frame accessible tomodern astronomical observations (Schmidt
1963). Most likely they are powered by accretion of baryons onto
SMBHs (e.g. Salpeter 1964; Lynden-Bell 1969; Rees 1984), and it
is believed that past quasar phases are required to explain the 𝑀BH =
109–1010 𝑀� SMBHs found in the centres of nearby quiescent bulge-
dominated galaxies (Soltan 1982; Kormendy & Richstone 1995; Yu
& Tremaine 2002; Kormendy & Ho 2013). In numerical models of
galaxy and black hole co-evolution, SMBH growth is triggered by
gas inflow from major galaxy mergers (e.g. Di Matteo et al. 2005;
Springel et al. 2005; Hopkins et al. 2005a,b, 2006, 2008; Capelo
et al. 2015; Steinborn et al. 2018) and/or secular disc instabilities"
"★ E-mail: gworseck@uni-potsdam.de
1 Unless otherwise specified, we use the term “quasar” to refer to an unob-
scured accreting supermassive black hole that radiates at a substantial fraction
of its Eddington luminosity."
"(e.g. Hopkins & Quataert 2010; Novak et al. 2011; Bournaud et al.
2011; Gabor & Bournaud 2013; Hopkins et al. 2016; Anglés-Alcázar
et al. 2013, 2017, 2020), but the physical processes on the relevant
scales (sub-pc to a few pc) are still not fully understood. In both
scenarios, kinetic and thermal feedback from stars and the SMBH
self-regulate SMBH growth and obscuration. Once enough gas has
been expelled, the SMBH shines as a short-lived UV-bright quasar
until feedback quenches SMBH growth, and potentially also the star
formation in the host galaxy (e.g. Sanders et al. 1988; DiMatteo et al.
2005; Springel et al. 2005; Hopkins et al. 2005b, 2006).
Although these models successfully reproduce many observed"
"properties of galaxies and quasars, it remains challenging for them to
explain the prevalence of 𝑀BH = 109–1010 𝑀� SMBHs in 𝑧em & 6
quasars, i.e. only < 109 yr after the Big Bang (Jiang et al. 2007; Kurk
et al. 2007;Mortlock et al. 2011; Venemans et al. 2013; De Rosa et al.
2014; Wu et al. 2015; Mazzucchelli et al. 2017; Bañados et al. 2018;
Shen et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020). These early
SMBHs require either quasi-continuous Eddington-limited accretion
onto massive black hole seeds (Sĳacki et al. 2009; Di Matteo et al.
2012; Johnson et al. 2013), super-Eddington accretion (Volonteri &"

"Rees 2005; Pacucci et al. 2015; Inayoshi et al. 2016), or radiatively
inefficient accretion in possibly obscured phases (Madau et al. 2014;
Volonteri et al. 2015; Pacucci et al. 2015; Davies et al. 2019).
Constraining the characteristic time-scales governing quasar ac-"
"tivity is key to understanding the existence of early SMBHs, quasar
triggering mechanisms, and whether feedback from SMBH growth
might quench black hole fuelling and star formation. There is a grow-
ing consensus frommodels of galaxy and black hole co-evolution that
fuelling, feedback, and quenching are intimately intertwined, which
conspire to produce episodic quasar activity on a wide range of time-
scales (104–108 yr, Ciotti & Ostriker 2001; Di Matteo et al. 2005;
Hopkins et al. 2005b, 2006; Hopkins & Hernquist 2009; Hopkins
et al. 2016; Novak et al. 2011; Gabor & Bournaud 2013; Steinborn
et al. 2018; Anglés-Alcázar et al. 2017, 2020), often with significant
variability in the accretion rate down to the time resolution limit of the
simulation (10–100 yr, e.g. Novak et al. 2011; Anglés-Alcázar et al.
2020). Such short-term changes in the accretion rate may explain
why some quasars show strong variability in their luminosity and/or
their emission lines on time-scales of days to decades (LaMassa et al.
2015; Runnoe et al. 2016; MacLeod et al. 2016; McElroy et al. 2016;
Yang et al. 2018). However, for longer time-scales the constraints
from observations are uncertain by several orders of magnitude (e.g.
Martini 2004), because the methods (i) are necessarily more indirect,
(ii) are sensitive to particular time-scales, (iii) often yield a popula-
tion average, and (iv) involve many model-dependent assumptions.
Comparisons of the quasar number density to their host darkmatter"
"halo abundance inferred from quasar clustering studies constrain
the quasar duty cycle 𝑡dc, i.e. the total time over the age of the
Universe that a galaxy hosts a quasar (Haiman & Hui 2001; Martini
& Weinberg 2001). Due to varying assumptions on how quasars
populate dark matter haloes applied to partially discrepant quasar
clustering measurements at 𝑧em ∼ 2–4, the inferred quasar duty
cycle spans a wide range 106 yr . 𝑡dc . 109 yr, and may depend
on redshift and/or luminosity (Porciani et al. 2004; Croom et al.
2005; Adelberger & Steidel 2005; Shen et al. 2007; White et al.
2008, 2012; Eftekharzadeh et al. 2015). Alternatively, the quasar
duty cycle can be estimated by extending the Soltan (1982) argument
such that that the quasar luminosity function traces the gas accretion
history onto SMBHs in present-day early-type galaxies. For present-
day𝑀BH > 109 𝑀� SMBHs that shone as quasars at their Eddington
limit the inferred duty cycle is 𝑡dc =(6–30)×107 yr (Yu & Tremaine
2002; Marconi et al. 2004; Shankar et al. 2004). The quasar duty
cycle is a population average that is insensitive to the duration of
individual quasar episodes.
The time distribution of high-accretion events, often called the"
"episodic quasar lifetime 𝑡Q, can be predicted by current numerical
models or observationally estimated based on light travel time argu-
ments. It has been suggested that mismatches between the level of
nuclear activity and the ionization conditions of gas in and around
the host galaxies imply significant nuclear variability on time-scales
𝑡Q ∼ 0.1Myr (Schawinski et al. 2015; Sartori et al. 2016; Schirmer
et al. 2016; Keel et al. 2017; Oppenheimer et al. 2018). However,
such short quasar lifetimes cannot explain the existence of giant
(∼ 400 kpc) Ly𝛼 nebulae around 𝑧em ∼ 2–3 quasars (Cantalupo
et al. 2014; Hennawi et al. 2015; Cai et al. 2017; Arrigoni Battaia
et al. 2018), which require sustained activity for a few Myr. More-
over, the measured equivalent widths of Ly𝛼 emitters, enhanced by
quasar-powered fluorescence, suggest quasar lifetimes of 1–40Myr
depending on the emitter sample and the quasar opening angle (Adel-
berger et al. 2006; Cantalupo et al. 2012; Trainor & Steidel 2013;
Borisova et al. 2016; Marino et al. 2018). However, due to geometric
dilution of the quasar flux, luminous Ly𝛼 emitters at distances of"
"several Mpc are more likely to be powered intrinsically (Khrykin
et al. 2016).
The quasar lifetime can also be constrained from the locally en-"
"hanced UV radiation field in the quasar vicinity, the so-called prox-
imity effect, which manifests itself as a region of enhanced IGM Ly𝛼
transmission (e.g. Bajtlik et al. 1988; Scott et al. 2000; Dall’Aglio
et al. 2008; Calverley et al. 2011). Because the IGM reacts to a change
in the photoionization rate Γ within a finite equilibration time-scale
𝑡eq ≈ Γ−1, the existence of the proximity effect implies that quasars
had been emitting continuously for 𝑡Q & 𝑡eq (e.g. Bajtlik et al. 1988).
With an H i UV background photoionization rate ΓH i ' 10−12 s−1
measured in the 2 . 𝑧 . 5H iLy𝛼 forest (Becker&Bolton 2013) one
obtains a weak lower limit 𝑡Q & 0.03Myr for the quasar population.
During and shortly after H i reionization at 𝑧 & 5.7, the low IGM"
"H i Ly𝛼 transmission enables measurements of well-defined sizes of
H i proximity zones around individual quasars (Fan et al. 2006; Carilli
et al. 2010; Eilers et al. 2017). The observation of any particular
quasar is only sensitive to the time the quasar had been active prior
to our observation at a random point during its current luminous
episode, henceforth called the on-time 𝑡on ≤ 𝑡Q. From their very
small proximity zones given their luminosity, Eilers et al. (2020)
concluded that 5–10 per cent of all 𝑧em ∼ 6 quasars had recently
turned on (𝑡on . 0.1Myr), which is also supported by a lack of
extended Ly𝛼 emission around them (Farina et al. 2019). However,
because H i quickly equilibrates after quasar turn-on, 𝑧em ∼ 6 H i
proximity zones are insensitive to turn-on times 𝑡on > 0.1Myr unless
the IGM was significantly neutral (Keating et al. 2015; Eilers et al.
2017, 2018; Davies et al. 2020).
Stronger limits on the quasar lifetime may be inferred from the"
"transverse proximity effect of a foreground quasar in a background
line of sight via the additional light travel time. This effect has not
been unambiguously detected in the 𝑧 ∼ 2–3 H i Ly𝛼 forest due
to overdense environments around quasar hosts, quasar obscuration,
and the small quasar boost to the overall H i photoionization rate (e.g.
Liske & Williger 2001; Croft 2004; Hennawi & Prochaska 2007;
Kirkman & Tytler 2008; Prochaska et al. 2013, but see Gonçalves
et al. 2008). The low UV background in the post-reionization IGM
increases the chance to discover the transverse proximity effect in
the H i (𝑡on > 11Myr, Gallerani et al. 2008) and the He ii Ly𝛼
forest (𝑡on & 10–25Myr, Jakobsen et al. 2003; Worseck &Wisotzki
2006; Worseck et al. 2007; Schmidt et al. 2017), but frequent non-
detections can either be explained by a young age (𝑡on < 10Myr) or
obscuration (Schmidt et al. 2018).
Direct estimates of prolonged quasar activity can be inferred from"
"the line-of-sight He ii proximity zones of 𝑧em ' 3–4 quasars at the
tail end of the He ii reionization epoch, thanks to the long He ii
equilibration time-scale 𝑡eq ≈ Γ−1He ii ' 30Myr (Khrykin et al. 2016).
This is comparable to the 𝑒-folding time-scale of SMBH growth
𝑡S ∼ 44Myr (Salpeter 1964), and may offer unique constraints on
the range of episodic quasar lifetimes in models of galaxy and black
hole co-evolution. In Khrykin et al. (2019, hereafter Paper I) we
introduced a new statistical Bayesian method to infer on-times of
individual quasars from their He ii proximity zones, accounting for
the degeneracy between the initial ambient IGM He ii fraction and
the quasar on-time that had affected previous analyses (Syphers &
Shull 2014; Zheng et al. 2015). Applying our method to six He ii-
transparent quasars2 at 𝑧em > 3.6 we inferred 0.3 dex precise on-"
"2 He ii-transparent quasars are rare quasars with sufficient flux at He ii Ly𝛼
to secure a science-grade (signal-to-noise ratio & 3) spectrum with HST (e.g.

PROXIMITY ZONES"
2.1 HST/COS spectra of He ii proximity zones
"We use the HST UV spectra of seventeen out of twenty 𝑧em < 3.6
He ii-transparent quasars from Worseck et al. (2019), to which we
refer for a detailed description of the data reduction. Three 𝑧em ' 3
quasars (HS 1157+3143, SDSS J0924+4852, SDSS J1101+1053)
from Worseck et al. (2019) were excluded due to geocoronal H i
Ly𝛼 contamination of the He ii quasar proximity zone. For two
𝑧em ' 2.94 quasars (SDSS J0818+4908, SDSS J0936+2927) we
used only data taken in HST’s orbital shadow to exclude contamina-
tion of their He ii proximity zones by geocoronal N i _1200Å emis-
sion, as discussed in Worseck et al. (2019). Likewise, geocoronal
O i was excluded for four 𝑧em ' 3.28 quasars (HE2QS J1706+5904,
HE2QS J2149−0859, Q 0302−003, HE2QS J0233−0149). Although
the sightline to HE2QS J1706+5904 is not suitable for studying in-
tergalactic He ii due to an optically thick H i Lyman limit system at
𝑧 = 0.4040 (Worseck et al. 2019), its He ii proximity zone is not
impacted. Table 1 lists the relevant properties of our sample.
All 17 HST spectra were taken with the Cosmic Origins Spectro-"
"graph (COS; Green et al. 2012), employing the G140L grating (12
spectra) or the G130M grating (5 spectra). Their resolving power
𝑅 = _/Δ_ varies with wavelength and with the spatial position
on the detector. Table 1 lists the appropriate values in the spectral
range of interest. The spectra were rebinned to 2–3 pixels per reso-
lution element (𝑅 < 3000: ' 0.24Åpixel−1, 10000 ≤ 𝑅 ≤ 15000:
' 0.04Åpixel−1, 𝑅 > 15000: ' 0.03Åpixel−1), yielding a signal-
to-noise ratio S/N=3–19 in the quasar continuum immediately red-
ward of the He ii quasar proximity zone.
After correction for Galactic extinction, the spectra were normal-"
"ized by power laws 𝑓_ ∝ _𝛽 , fitted to spectral regions without strong
emission and absorption features, but accounting for identified par-
tial H i Lyman limit breaks (Worseck et al. 2019). Since our sample
lacks contemporaneous and continuous spectral coverage from the
rest-frame extreme UV to the near UV, a detailed correction for cu-
mulative H i Lyman continuum attenuation is not possible. As such,
the fitted power laws with a typical range in slope −3 . 𝛽 . −0.5"
"do not represent the intrinsic quasar spectral energy distributions
(SEDs). The typical continuum error of a few per cent does not af-
fect our analysis. We do not account for quasar He ii Ly𝛼 and metal
emission that is difficult to predict in detail in quasar accretion disc
models (e.g. Syphers et al. 2011a; Syphers & Shull 2013). Only
two quasars (SDSS J0936+2927 and SDSS J2346−0016) show such
features, and they are sufficiently weak that they do not change our re-
sults. Likewise, contamination of the proximity zone by low-redshift
H i Lyman series lines is expected to be weak compared to the He ii
Ly𝛼 absorption.
Together with the seven 𝑧em > 3.6 quasars discussed in Paper I,"
"we arrive at a total sample of 24 quasars with He ii proximity zones
(Table 1)."
2.2 Ancillary optical and near-infrared spectra
2.2.1 Near-infrared spectroscopy
"We obtained near-infrared spectra of 14 quasars from our combined
sample to accurately measure their redshifts from their near-UV
and optical emission lines. We successfully observed ten quasars
with the Triple Spectrograph (TripleSpec, wavelength coverage 1.0–
2.45 `m at 𝑅 ∼ 2700; Herter et al. 2008) at the 200-inch Hale
Telescope at Palomar Observatory in several observing campaigns
between April 2011 and August 2012. Results on SDSS J1319+5202
have been reported in Paper I. The total exposure times ranged from
0.625 to 2.5 hours depending on the brightness of the target and the
observing conditions. The TripleSpec spectra were reduced using
a custom pipeline based on the lowredux package3 (Prochaska &
Hennawi 2009). Wavelength solutions were computed from OH sky
emission lines, and heliocentric corrections were applied. For all
spectra, relative fluxing was performed with a telluric standard star
observed close in time and in airmass to the science target. In the
TripleSpec sample the S/N per 91.4 km s−1 pixel ranges from 6 to 50
near the quasar emission lines of interest.
Near-infrared spectra of two further quasars were successfully ob-"
"tained with the Large Binocular Telescope Utility Cameras in the
Infrared 1 and 2 (LUCI1/2; Seifert et al. 2003) in January 2014. We
used the N1.8 cameras in seeing-limited mode. HS 1024+1849 was
observed for a total 20 minutes with the LUCI1 G200 grating in
the wavelength range 0.95–1.34 `m and the 0.5′′ slit (𝑅 ∼ 2400).
HS 0911+4809 was observed for 20 minutes during LUCI2 commis-
sioning with the G150 grating in the wavelength range 2.02–2.28 `m
and the 0.75′′ slit (𝑅 ∼ 2700). The LUCI data were reduced with
a custom set of IRAF4 routines. Each exposure was flat fielded and
cleaned of cosmic ray hits using the procedure described in van
Dokkum (2001). Wavelength calibration was achieved by matching
the position of OH sky lines in the two-dimensional spectra, and sky
subtraction was performed by subtracting subsequent pairs of frames
that had been taken in a standard ABBA dithering pattern. Relative
flux calibration and telluric correction of the extracted spectra was
performed with A0V stars observed immediately after the science
targets. In the wavelength range of interest the LUCI1 (LUCI2) spec-
trum of HS 1024+1849 (HS 0911+4809) reaches S/N= 10 (S/N= 5)
per 2.13Å (2.67Å) pixel.

kindly provided by R. Simcoe (private communication). It reaches a
S/N' 40 per 12.5 km s−1 pixel in the wavelength range of interest."
2.2.2 Optical spectroscopy
"The remaining ten quasars from our combined sample have only
optical spectra available, which cover their rest-frame far-UV emis-
sion lines. For four quasars from Table 1 we use 𝑅 ∼ 200 dis-
covery spectra taken with Calar Alto Faint Object Spectrograph
(CAFOS) at the Calar Alto 2.2m telescope (Worseck et al. 2019).
HE2QS J2311−1417 from Paper I had been discovered with the Kast
spectrometer at the Lick 3m Shane Telescope (Worseck et al. 2019).
For HE2QS J2354−2033 from Paper I we employed a higher-quality
follow-up spectrum taken with the Keck Low Resolution Imaging
Spectrometer (LRIS; Oke et al. 1995; Steidel et al. 2004). For the re-
maining 4/24 quasars from our He ii proximity zone sample that had
been discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al.
2000) we retrieved their highest-quality spectra from SDSS Data
Release 14 (Abolfathi et al. 2018), taken either with the original
SDSS spectrograph or the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
(BOSS) spectrograph (Smee et al. 2013).
For five quasars with small He ii proximity zones we also dis-"
"cuss below medium- and high-resolution optical spectra of their H i
proximity regions. We observed HS 0911+4809 with the Keck High-
ResolutionEchelle Spectrometer (HIRES;Vogt et al. 1994), using the
C1 decker (0.86′′ slit, 𝑅 ∼ 45, 000) and the red cross disperser. The
combined reduced spectrum reaches a S/N∼ 60 per 2.6 km s−1 pixel
in the H i proximity region. SDSS J1319+5202was observedwith the
Keck Echelette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI; Sheinis et al. 2002)
using the 0.75′′ slit (𝑅 ∼ 5400), yielding a S/N∼ 60 per 10 km s−1
pixel. The H i proximity region of SDSS J1237+0126 was covered in
an archival Keck/HIRES spectrum (O’Meara et al. 2015) at S/N∼ 20
per 2.6 km s−1 pixel. The VLT and Keck spectra of HE 2347−4342
and SDSS J2346−0016 were taken from Worseck et al. (2016)."
2.3 Redshift measurements
"Quasar redshifts were determined from UV-optical quasar emission
lines covered in the available optical and near-infrared spectra, ac-
counting for their velocity shifts relative to systemic (traced by [O ii]
emission or Ca ii absorption). The velocity shifts are due to bulk
motions in the quasar broad line region, with high-ionization lines
showing a strong dependence of the blueshift on the continuum lu-
minosity (e.g. Gaskell 1982; Tytler & Fan 1992; Vanden Berk et al.
2001; Richards et al. 2002, 2011; Hewett & Wild 2010; Shen et al.
2016). We measured the mode of each emission line using the al-
gorithm described in Hennawi et al. (2006), which accounts for line
blending (in particular C iv_1549 blended with He ii_1640, and
H𝛽 _4863 blended with [O iii]__4959, 5007), and is robust against
noise, line asymmetries, and associated absorption for the lines that
were used eventually (S/N> 10). Considering our typical S/N we
fitted each emission line with a single Gaussian profile. The mea-
sured redshifts were corrected to the systemic frame by accounting"
"MNRAS 000, 1–20 (2021)"
Dating quasars with the He II proximity effect 5
"for their average blueshifts, and precisions were assigned from the
standard deviations 𝜎𝑣 of the velocity distributions in large quasar
samples (Richards et al. 2002; Boroson 2005; Richards et al. 2011;
Shen et al. 2016). The redshift precision was our primary criterion
for the eventually adopted emission line and redshift in Table 1:"
"(i) We preferred redshifts from detected narrow [O iii]_5007
emission (S/N> 10 across the line, peak to continuum ratio > 0.3, 5
quasars in Table 1). We assumed a luminosity-independent blueshift
of −27.1 km s−1 w.r.t. the systemic frame defined by low-ionization
forbidden lines ([O ii], [N ii], [S ii]), and a velocity precision 𝜎𝑣 =
44.4 km s−1, both based on the high-confidence sample in Boroson
(2005). The values are in good agreement with Hewett &Wild (2010)
and Shen et al. (2016).
(ii) If [O iii] was not covered or not detected due to low S/N or"
"the Baldwin effect (e.g. Baldwin 1977; Stern & Laor 2012; Shen &
Ho 2014; Shen 2016), we took broad Mg ii if the line was detected at
S/N> 10 (6 quasars). We assumed the same luminosity-independent
blueshift of −27.1 km s−1 as for [O iii], and a velocity precision
𝜎𝑣 = 273 km s−1 derived by Gaussian error propagation of the [O iii]
velocity precision (44.4 km s−1) and the Mg ii velocity dispersion
w.r.t. [O iii] (269 km s−1) from Richards et al. (2002). These values
are consistentwithmore recent determinations (Hewett&Wild 2010;
Shen 2016; Shen et al. 2016).
(iii) If neither [O iii] nor Mg iiwas usable, but broad H𝛽 had been"
"covered in our𝐾 band spectra, we took the H𝛽 line, which reasonably
traces the systemic frame. We adopted a blueshift of −109 km s−1
and a velocity precision 𝜎𝑣 = 400 km s−1 (Shen et al. 2016). Three
quasars in our sample have H𝛽 redshifts.
(iv) For the 10 quasars lacking near-infrared spectra of sufficient"
"quality we measured the redshift from C iv covered in the optical
spectra. We corrected for the known correlation of the C iv blueshift
with continuum luminosity (Hewett & Wild 2010; Richards et al.
2011; Shen et al. 2016) using a sample of lower-redshift BOSS
quasar spectra covering C iv and Mg ii (see Paper I for details). Our
determined blueshift w.r.t. Mg ii"

"is in reasonable agreement with the independent determination by
Shen et al. (2016) for a distinct sample and line centring algorithm.
Considering the large standard deviation𝜎𝑣 = 656 km s−1 of the cor-
rected C iv redshifts w.r.t. the Mg ii redshifts, we ignored the smaller
spread of the Mg ii redshifts about the systemic frame (Paper I)."
"For all five He ii-transparent quasars with previous systemic red-
shift determinations (Mg ii, H𝛽, H𝛾 and/or [O iii]) from the literature
our results are broadly consistent, in spite of differences in the em-
ployed methods (Table 2). The main sources of discrepancy are the
treatment of line asymmetries and the averaging of results for multi-
ple emission lines."
2.4 Absolute magnitudes and photon production rates
"Optical photometry of the quasars was mainly obtained from
SDSS Data Release 12 (Alam et al. 2015), with the exception of
HE2QS J2311−1417 that has been covered in Data Release 1 of
the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1
(Pan-STARRS1; Chambers et al. 2016; Flewelling et al. 2020), and

Due to cumulative IGM absorption by H i Lyman limit systems"
"(e.g. Worseck & Prochaska 2011) and the He ii Lyman series, the
He ii-ionizing power has to be inferred by extrapolation of the SED.
As in Paper I we assumed a power-law SED slope 𝛼a = 1.5 at
a > a912, consistent with recent measurements in stacked and com-
posite quasar spectra (Shull et al. 2012; Stevans et al. 2014; Lusso
et al. 2015). Since the actual value of 𝛼a depends on the chosen
continuum windows, the total spectral coverage, and the exclusion
of weak quasar emission lines (Stevans et al. 2014; Tilton et al.
2016), the large range in 𝛼a values from the literature is not sur-
prising. SED reconstructions for two He ii-transmitting quasars with
complete spectral coverage indicate quasar-to-quasar variations in
𝛼a around our chosen value (Syphers & Shull 2013, 2014). A very
hard SED (𝛼a = 0.7; Tilton et al. 2016) increases 𝑄 by a factor 6.5,
but may violate constraints on the He ii reionization history (Khaire
2017; Kulkarni et al. 2019). Very soft SEDs (𝛼a & 2; Lusso et al.
2018) are ruled out by the HST/COS spectra, and would lead to a
modest ∼ 0.4 dex increase in the inferred quasar on-times (Paper I).
Changes in the slope at a > a228 do not significantly change our
results (Khrykin et al. 2016, 2019).
Equation (3) assumes that the escape fraction of He ii-ionizing"
"photons is unity. Recently, Shull & Danforth (2020) have suggested
that many quasars could have escape fractions≈ 0.5–0.9 based on the
observed range in the IGM He ii/H i column density ratio. However,
these observations are likely explained by radiative transfer in the
IGM and the contribution of star-forming galaxies to the H i-ionizing
background (e.g. Haardt & Madau 2012; Khaire & Srianand 2019;
Puchwein et al. 2019; Faucher-Giguère 2020). In these models the
required sample-averaged H i Lyman continuum escape fraction of
galaxies is ∼ 1 per cent at 𝑧 ∼ 3, which is within recent observational"

6 G. Worseck et al.
"constraints (Grazian et al. 2017; Steidel et al. 2018; Fletcher et al.
2019). Therefore, theHe ii/H i column density ratio does not uniquely
constrain the He ii-ionizing escape fraction of unobscured quasars,
such that our assumption of a unity escape fraction is justified."
2.5 Black hole masses and Eddington ratios

2009) and (_c, 𝑎, 𝑏) = (5100Å, 0.91, 0.5) for H𝛽 (Vestergaard &
Peterson 2006).
Due to the varying spectral coverage and quality, measurements of"
"the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of Mg (H𝛽) were made for
10 (6) quasars. We adopt the H𝛽 measurements when available. Ta-
ble 3 lists the measurements and the derived quantities. The spectra
were iteratively fit with a combination of a local power-law contin-
uum, the Tsuzuki et al. (2006) Fe ii emission template, and Gaussian
emission line profiles. Due to the modest S/N, a single Gaussian
was considered sufficient for most Mg ii lines. Each H𝛽 emission
line was decomposed into one narrow and two broad Gaussians,
and the nearby [O iii] doublet was considered simultaneously with
two Gaussians for each line of the doublet. Bayesian joint posterior
distributions of the degenerate line parameters were estimated us-
ing the Goodman &Weare (2010) affine-invariant ensemble sampler
for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) as implemented in emcee
(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). From the Mg ii and H𝛽 broad line
parameter posterior distributions we computed the posterior proba-
bility density functions (PDFs) of the total FWHM, and adopt their
median values and their equal-tailed 68 per cent credible intervals
as our measurements and statistical uncertainties, respectively. Due
to the inaccurate fluxing of the near-infrared spectra, the continuum
luminosities at _c were estimated from 𝑀1450 by extrapolating the
Lusso et al. (2015) power-law continuum 𝑓a ∝ a−0.61 obtained be-
tween 912Å and 2500Å, and assuming an uncertainty of 0.2 dex.
The propagated statistical uncertainties in 𝑀BH are much smaller"
"than the ' 0.55 dex uncertainty in the scaling relations, as estimated
from the scatter of quasars with black hole masses from reverberation
mapping (Vestergaard & Peterson 2006; Vestergaard & Osmer 2009;
Shen 2013).Other scaling relations yield similar values towithin 0.1–
0.4 dex (McLure & Dunlop 2004; Ho & Kim 2015; Mejía-Restrepo
et al. 2016; Woo et al. 2018; Bahk et al. 2019). We note that using
the Tsuzuki et al. (2006) Fe ii template instead of the Vestergaard
& Wilkes (2001) template used to derive the Vestergaard & Osmer
(2009) scaling relation may underestimate the black hole mass by
' 0.2 dex (Schindler et al. 2020). For the three quasars with Mg ii
and H𝛽 FWHM measurements we obtained comparable virial black
hole masses.

quantify its extent while limiting the impact of small-scale density
fluctuations and observational effects in heterogeneous samples, such
as differences in spectral resolution and S/N. To that aim, we adopted
a procedure similar to work on H i quasar proximity zones at 𝑧em ∼ 6
(e.g. Fan et al. 2006; Carilli et al. 2010; Eilers et al. 2017), and
smoothed the normalized HST/COS spectra with a Gaussian filter
with an FWHM of 1 pMpc at the respective quasar redshift. The
smoothing FWHM corresponds to 4.5–8.5 pixels in our COS G140L
spectra binned to 0.24Åpixel−1. The proximity zone size 𝑅pz is then
defined as the cosmological proper distance to the first pixel where
the smoothed normalized flux drops below 0.1. At 𝑧 > 3 the inter-
galactic He ii Ly𝛼 transmission on similar scales rarely exceeds this
threshold (Worseck et al. 2016, 2019), such that the He ii proximity
zones are well defined. At lower redshifts the He ii proximity zone
sizes become less distinct due to the emerging post-reionization He ii
Ly𝛼 forest. However, our radiative transfer simulations (Section 4.1)
account for density fluctuations in a predominantly ionized IGM
with an initial He ii fraction as low as 1 per cent, consistent with
the inferences from the He ii Ly𝛼 forest (Worseck et al. 2019). Fur-
thermore, we verified with realistic mock spectra that our HST/COS
spectra are of sufficient quality to yield robust proximity zone sizes

and He ii identifies gas flows in the quasar environment. Large infall
velocities 𝑣 . −1000 km s−1 may not be correctly captured by our
simulations, hampering estimates of the quasar on-time."
"The luminous quasar HE 2347−4342 lacks a He ii proximity zone,
which is likely explained by its peculiar associated absorption system
(Reimers et al. 1997; Fechner et al. 2004). Many of its Nv and Ovi
bearing components are consistent with being photoionized by the
quasar (Fechner et al. 2004). Because their He ii column densities
are insufficient to shield He ii-ionizing photons, Shull et al. (2010)
argued that HE 2347−4342 has recently turned on (𝑡on < 1Myr).
However, the location of the absorbing gas is unconstrained. The
accurate and precise [O iii] redshift 𝑧em = 2.8852 ± 0.0006 implies
large gas infall velocities of ∼ 1500 km s−1 onto the circumnuclear
region (Fig. 3), and even higher velocities if the gas resides in the
circumgalactic medium of the host galaxy. Redshift space distor-
tions (Hui et al. 1997; Weinberg et al. 1997) significantly affect the
He ii transmission profile, possibly masking the He ii proximity ef-"
"fect altogether. Conclusive evidence for or against HE 2347−4342
being a young quasar requires detailed numerical modelling of gas
associated with the quasar or its host galaxy, which is outside the
scope of this work. Because of the extreme peculiar gas velocities
that are not represented in our simulations (Section 4.1), we exclude
HE 2347−4342 from further discussion."
"The other four quasars shown in Fig. 3 are less extreme.
SDSS J1237+0126 has a blended optically thin H i system at
𝑣 ' 500 km s−1 that is likely responsible for its small measured He ii
proximity zone. No high-velocity infall is detected. The He ii trans-
mission at 1500–2200 km s−1 may belong to the proximity zone.
However, provided that our simulations approximately capture the
density and velocity field around the quasar host halo, our strict and
simple definition of 𝑅pz ensures a one-to-one comparison to our
models (Section 4.1) that include cases of misestimated proximity
zone sizes due to the density field and peculiar velocities, similar
to recent work on 𝑧em ∼ 6 H i proximity zones (Eilers et al. 2017,
2020). The strong Nv absorbers at 5312 and 5481 km s−1 may either
indicate a much larger proximity zone of SDSS J1237+0126 or a
high-velocity outflow. The He ii spectra of SDSS J2346−0016 and
HS 0911+4809 are modulated by the density field traced by H i ab-
sorption. Their short He ii proximity zones do not seem affected by
peculiar velocities. Finally, SDSS J1319+5202 from Paper I shows a

ciated C iv and Nv in two components. The complex does not affect"

4 THEORETICAL METHODS
4.1 Radiative transfer models of He ii proximity zones
"To explain the diversity in the measured proximity zone sizes and to
infer the on-times of the quasars, we used a combination of hydrody-
namical simulations and one-dimensional radiative transfer simula-
tions of He ii quasar proximity zones, described in detail in Khrykin
et al. (2016, 2017). For their cosmological setting, we used the out-
put of a Gadget-3 (Springel 2005) smooth particle hydrodynamics
simulation run in a cubic volume of (25ℎ−1)3 comoving Mpc3 con-
taining 5123 baryonic and dark matter particles, respectively. Us-
ing periodic boundary conditions, we drew 1000 one-dimensional
density, velocity, and temperature distributions (skewers) in random
directions around the most massive halo in the 𝑧sim = 3.1 snap-
shot of the simulation. Assuming that cosmic structure evolution is
negligible between 𝑧sim and the quasar redshifts (Table 1), we ac-
counted for density evolution by rescaling the gas densities by a factor
(1+𝑧em)3/(1+𝑧sim)3. The resulting skewers have a length of 160 co-
moving Mpc, sampled at d𝑟 = 11.9 comoving kpc, corresponding to
d𝑣 = 0.86–0.93 km s−1 at 𝑧em = 2.74–3.5.
The skewers were processed with a one-dimensional radiative"
"transfer algorithm based on the C2-Ray code (Mellema et al. 2006),"
"which tracks the evolution of H i, He ii, 𝑒−, and the gas tempera-
ture to generate He ii Ly𝛼 transmission spectra of quasar proxim-
ity zones (Khrykin et al. 2016, 2017). Analogous to Paper I, we
created a set of radiative transfer models for each quasar at its
respective redshift 𝑧em and photon production rate 𝑄 (Table 1),
varying the quasar on-time 𝑡on and the initial He ii fraction in the
ambient IGM at quasar turn-on 𝑥He ii,0 (or equivalently the UV
background photoionization rate ΓHe ii). We assumed for simplic-
ity that the quasars emitted continuously at their inferred luminos-
ity for a time 𝑡on prior to our observation, i.e. as a “light bulb”.
We considered a base-10 logarithmically spaced grid of on-times
log (𝑡on/Myr) ∈ [−2, 2] with a step size Δ log (𝑡on/Myr) = 0.125.
For the initial He ii fraction we took the inhomogeneously spaced
grid 𝑥He ii,0 ∈ {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0}. Be-
cause the quasars are at lower redshifts than those from Paper I we
included models with 𝑥He ii,0 = 0.01 representative of the IGM at
the end of He ii reionization (Khrykin et al. 2016; Worseck et al.
2019). This resulted in a grid of 330 radiative transfer models per
quasar, each with 1000 He ii Ly𝛼 transmission spectra. Redshift error
is incorporated in our Bayesian inference (Section 4.2)."
"Figure 4 shows an example of model He ii proximity zone spectra
varying 𝑡on (left) and 𝑥He ii,0 (right) for the same density skewer.
The model proximity zone size 𝑅sim measured analogously to the
HST/COS spectra (Section 3) depends on the quasar on-time, as the
IGM responds to changes in the radiation field on the He ii equili-
bration time-scale 𝑡eq ≈ Γ−1He ii ' 30Myr in the 𝑧 ∼ 3 IGM (Khrykin
et al. 2016). For 𝑡on . 𝑡eq the proximity zone size increases with
𝑡on, but stalls for longer on-times (Paper I), as illustrated in the lower
left panel of Fig. 4. The proximity zone size only weakly depends
on the initial IGM He ii fraction due to the thermal proximity effect
(Khrykin et al. 2017) and the definition of the proximity zone size
that does not probe the actual size of the ionized region (Khrykin
et al. 2016). Only at the lowest initial He ii fractions 𝑥He ii,0 < 0.05,"

"𝑅sim falls at sufficiently large distances where the quasar does not
dominate the total He ii photoionization rate (Fig. 4), such that the
proximity zone size becomes weakly sensitive to 𝑥He ii,0. This weak
sensitivity combinedwith quasar redshift uncertainties makes it chal-
lenging to infer 𝑥He ii,0 (Paper I). Furthermore, the joint distribution
𝑅sim (𝑡on, 𝑥He ii,0), estimated from the 1000 spectra per model, is sig-
nificantly blurred by density fluctuations at low initial He ii fractions.
We did not account for the lower resolving power of our HST/COS
spectra or their data quality, because they do not significantly affect
our results (Appendix A)."
4.2 Bayesian inference of the quasar on-time
"To estimate the on-times of individual quasars in our sample, we
performedMCMC inference on their measuredHe ii proximity zones
𝑅pz using the Bayesian statistical method introduced in Paper I.
First, we incorporated the individual quasar redshift uncertainties
into the radiative transfer models by adding a Gaussian-distributed
random deviate with a standard deviation 𝜎𝑅pz (Table 1) to each 𝑅sim
realization, similar to Paper I. For each resulting distribution 𝑅′sim we
can write a Bayesian likelihood L given the combination of model
parameters"

used kernel density estimation (KDE) on the respective set of 1000
model spectra. An example KDE on the distribution of proximity
zone sizes in one radiative transfermodel is illustrated in the left panel
of Fig. 5. We then computed the likelihood of each radiative transfer
model in our"
"{

"}
grid via Equation (8), and constructed"
"each quasar’s continuous two-dimensional likelihood by bivariate
spline interpolation.
To infer 𝑡on for each individual quasar we sampled the respective"
likelihood with MCMC. Because the initial He ii fraction is quite
"uncertain at the redshifts of interest due to large-scaleUVbackground
fluctuations at the tail end of He ii reionization (Davies et al. 2017;
Worseck et al. 2019), we chose to impose a uniform prior 0.01 ≤
𝑥He ii,0 ≤ 1. Similarly, we set a uniform prior on log(𝑡on/Myr) in the
range 0.01–100Myr. The lower limit is motivated by the ubiquitous
H i proximity effect implying 𝑡on & Γ−1H i ≈ 0.03Myr at 𝑧 ∼ 3 except
for the few youngest 𝑧em & 6 quasars in Eilers et al. (2020). The
upper limit of 100Myr is driven by estimates of the quasar duty
cycle (𝑡dc =1–1000Myr, e.g. Yu & Tremaine 2002; White et al.
2008). Furthermore, approximations of our modelling break down
at longer on-times for two reasons: i) 𝑡on becomes comparable to
the cooling time meaning that cooling cannot be neglected; ii) our
assumption of a static density field for the radiative transfer in post-
processing is not valid anymore (Khrykin et al. 2016).
As an example, we show the results of the MCMC inference for"

"Many studies on 𝑧em ∼ 6 H i quasar proximity zones (Maselli et al.

proximity zones (Khrykin et al. 2016, 2019) have emphasized that by
definition 𝑅pz probes fully reionized gas in the quasar vicinity, and is
always smaller than the actual size of the ionized region. Moreover,
simple scaling laws with luminosity 𝑅 ∝ 10−0.4𝛾𝑀1450 with 𝛾 = 1/3

"Davies et al. 2020). Although the H i proximity zone sizes of 𝑧em ∼ 6
quasars generally increase with luminosity (Eilers et al. 2017), 5–10
per cent of the population has undersized proximity zones that likely
indicate short on-times 𝑡on . 0.01–0.1Myr (Eilers et al. 2018, 2020).
Figure 6 shows the measured He ii proximity zone size 𝑅pz as"
"a function of absolute magnitude 𝑀1450 for the combined sam-
ple of 22 quasars, i.e. Table 1 excluding HE 2347−4342 and
HE2QS J2354−2033. We see no clear relation between 𝑅pz and
𝑀1450. For the eight 𝑀1450 ∼ −28 quasars with precise systemic
redshifts there is a factor ∼ 5 spread in 𝑅pz. We overplot predictions
of the average 𝑅pz (𝑀1450) from our radiative transfer simulations
at the median redshift 𝑧em = 3.29 of our combined sample6. The
model predictions for extreme values of the IGM He ii fraction be-
fore quasar turn-on 𝑥He ii,0 ∈ {0.01, 1} and two representative on-
times 𝑡on ∈ {1Myr, 10Myr} cover a similar range of 𝑅pz as the
observations. IGM density fluctuations give rise to intrinsic scat-
ter in the simulated 𝑅pz that increases toward low He ii fractions,
i.e. in the emerging He ii Ly𝛼 forest. The He ii fraction and the
on-time are often degenerate (Khrykin et al. 2016, 2019), as illus-
trated by the overlapping curves for (𝑥He ii,0, 𝑡on) = (0.01, 1Myr)
and (𝑥He ii,0, 𝑡on) = (1, 10Myr). Nevertheless, the smallest pre-
cisely measured He ii proximity zone sizes require short on-times of
. 1Myr, whereas the largest ones require long on-times of & 10Myr.
Therefore, our measurements are sensitive to 𝑡on up to the He ii equi-
libration time-scale 𝑡eq ' 30Myr at 𝑧 ∼ 3 (Khrykin et al. 2016,
2019).
Our finding that He ii proximity zone sizes do not scale with lu-"

"the lack of sensitivity of H i proximity zone sizes to 𝑡on & 0.1Myr,
which is rooted in the shorter H i equilibration time-scale. If most
𝑧em ∼ 6 quasars shone longer than 0.1Myr, their similar H i prox-
imity zone sizes result in an overall strong scaling with luminosity
(Davies et al. 2020), with shorter on-times being apparent as outliers
(Eilers et al. 2017, 2018, 2020). In contrast, He ii proximity zone
sizes probe 𝑡on . 30Myr, so variations in the individual on-times
can effectively remove any correlation with luminosity.
As shown in Fig. 7 the He ii proximity zone size does not depend"
"on redshift. Some of the scatter in 𝑅pz vs. redshift is due to the
' 3mag range in 𝑀1450, but due to the lack of a clear correlation
with luminosity we do not take out this dependence. The large scatter
in 𝑅pz for the eight quasars at 𝑀1450 ∼ −28 with precise systemic
redshifts confirms that there is no evidence for a scaling with redshift.
Our measurements do not support previous claims of a significant
decline of the luminosity-normalized 𝑅pz at 𝑧em > 3.3 by Zheng
et al. (2015) for a slightly different definition of the proximity zone
size that does not track the quasar ionization front (Khrykin et al.
2016). At fixed luminosity our radiative transfer simulations show a
shallow decrease of 𝑅pz with redshift for a large range of on-times
and IGM He ii fractions (Fig. 7). This is a direct consequence of
the observational definition of 𝑅pz and its insensitivity to the IGM
He ii fraction (Khrykin et al. 2016, 2019). Only for long on-times
and small He ii fractions is there a significant decrease with redshift
that is driven by IGM density evolution. Similar shallow relations
have been obtained for H i proximity zones at 𝑧em ∼ 6 (Eilers et al.
2017; Davies et al. 2020). For the model relations in Fig. 7 we
chose 𝑀1450 = −27, somewhat fainter than the median 𝑀1450 of our
sample, in order to facilitate comparison with Eilers et al. (2017).
For the three 𝑀1450 ∼ −27 quasars from Paper I small but uncertain
proximity zone sizes indicate 𝑡on � 10Myr irrespective of the initial
IGM He ii fraction, consistent with our joint analysis in Paper I. On
the other hand, the large He ii proximity zone of the 𝑀1450 ∼ −27

5.2 Constraints on the quasar on-time
"Figure 8 shows the MCMC estimates of the quasar on-time posterior
PDFs marginalized over the initial He ii fraction for the 16 remaining
𝑧em < 3.6 quasars excluding HE 2347−4342. Most PDFs are based
on ∼ 130, 000 posterior samples depending on the width of the PDF.
Many PDFs are� 0 at the upper or lower limit of our flat logarithmic
prior on the quasar on-time 0.01Myr ≤ 𝑡on ≤ 100Myr. Because the
lower limit of our prior is physically motivated by the H i proximity
effect, while the flatness of the posterior at 𝑡on & 30Myr is effectively
determined by the equilibration time-scale, some of these posterior
PDFs provide only limited constraints on 𝑡on. Specifically, if the
posterior at 𝑡on = 0.01Myr is > 10 per cent of its maximum, we
quote a 1𝜎 upper limit on 𝑡on as the 84th percentile of the posterior.
Likewise, if the posterior at 𝑡on = 100Myr is > 10 per cent of its
maximum, we define a 1𝜎 lower limit on 𝑡on as the 16th percentile of
the posterior. For the remaining quasars we quote the median of the
posterior as a measurement of 𝑡on with a 1𝜎 equal-tailed credibility
interval derived from the 16th and the 84th percentile of the posterior,
respectively.
The upper panel of Fig. 8 shows the 𝑡on posteriors of the five"
"quasars from Table 1 whose 𝑅pz values are highly uncertain due to
C iv redshift errors. Large redshift errors significantly broaden the
model 𝑅sim distributions and result in weak constraints on 𝑡on, sim-
ilar to four quasars from Paper I. According to the above definition,
we obtain 1𝜎 upper limits on 𝑡on. Quasars with more precise red-
shifts (𝜎𝑣 ≤ 400 km s−1) have significantly narrower 𝑡on posteriors,
except SDSS J1237+0126 whose He ii proximity zone size may have
been underestimated (Section 3). For four quasars we obtain lower
limits on the quasar on-time (middle panel of Fig. 8) due to their
combination of a large proximity zone and moderate to low lumi-
nosity (PC 0058+0215). The bottom panel in Fig. 8 shows the 𝑡on
posteriors of the six quasars for which we obtain individual on-time
measurements. Their posteriors span distinct ranges in 𝑡on, indicating
an intrinsically broad distribution of quasar on-times from . 1Myr to
∼ 10Myr. The precision of the measurements ranges from 0.28 dex
(HS 1700+6416) to 0.48 dex (HS 0911+4809), which mainly reflects
the redshift precision. On-times of up ' 10Myr can be measured
securely, but for longer on-times the flat tail due to the finite equi-
libration timescale becomes stronger, eventually resulting in lower
limits on the on-time. Both the middle and lower panels show that
with sufficiently precise redshifts, He ii proximity zones constrain
individual on-times from ' 1Myr up to the He ii equilibration time
of ∼ 30Myr, which sets the physical limit of the method.
In Fig. 9 we plot the inferred quasar on-times or limits thereof as a"
"function of quasar absolute magnitude. We also show the results for
the six 𝑧em > 3.6 quasars from Paper I with updated inferences based
on our extended model grid and adjusted to our different definition
of limits on 𝑡on. There is strong diversity in the quasar on-times with
no obvious dependence on absolute magnitude. This is similar to
the lack of a trend in 𝑅pz (𝑀1450) in Fig. 6, but now we account for
the redshift dependence and provide quantitative constraints on 𝑡on
based on the observed scatter of He ii proximity zone sizes."

6 DISCUSSION
6.1 Dependence on the He ii fraction prior
"The inferred quasar on-times depend on the assumed prior on the
initial He ii fraction in the surrounding IGM. Similar to Paper I,
we adopted a uniform prior 0.01 ≤ 𝑥He ii,0 ≤ 1 to reflect the con-
siderable uncertainty in the local ionization conditions during He ii
reionization. The measured large-scale He ii absorption indicates a
low median He ii fraction of 2–3 per cent at 𝑧 ' 3.1 (Khrykin et al.
2016; Worseck et al. 2019) with spatial variations that are consistent
with semi-numerical models of a fluctuating He ii-ionizing back-
ground after He ii reionization (Davies & Furlanetto 2014; Davies
et al. 2017). However, the parameters of these models are not well
constrained bymeasurements of theHe ii effective optical depth, such
that the spatial distribution of the He ii fraction is still uncertain.
In order to explore how our results change with the 𝑥He ii,0"
"prior, we repeated the analysis with a restricted uniform prior
0.01 ≤ 𝑥He ii,0 ≤ 0.05 that is consistent with the inferences from
the He ii Ly𝛼 absorption at 2.8 < 𝑧 < 3.3 (Worseck et al. 2019).
In Figure 12 we compare the resulting posterior PDFs for 𝑡on to
the ones from Section 5.2 for the 13 quasars with precisely mea-
sured He ii proximity zone sizes based on their precise systemic
redshifts (𝜎𝑣 ≤ 400 km s−1). Table 4 compares the on-times for all
22 quasars whose He ii proximity zone sizes are not significantly
negative, and therefore allow us to constrain 𝑡on (Table 1 excluding
HE 2347−4342 and HE2QS J2354−2033). Due to the fewer ionizing
photons required to create a large proximity zone, the posterior PDFs
shift to lower values, in agreement with the credible regions for the
unrestricted prior at low 𝑥He ii,0 (Fig. 5). Upper and lower 1𝜎 limits
on 𝑡on decrease by ' 0.4 dex and ' 0.5 dex, respectively. The eight
𝑡on measurements also shift to lower values by ' 0.5 dex, resulting
in three more limits due to the decreasing ratio between the peak of
the posterior and its tail at 100Myr according to the definition in
Section 5.2. Nevertheless, we still infer a broad range in 𝑡on from
. 0.3 to & 10Myr. Our constraints can be improved either by more"

for the growth histories of their SMBHs to their measured masses.
In our modelling we assumed that each quasar shone at a constant

Because the inferred on-times are generally much smaller than the
Salpeter time, the light bulb model is still a good approximation to

growth these would be equal to the on-times 𝑡on. For about half
of our sample (7 out of 13) the on-times inferred from the He ii
proximity zone sizes (𝑡on . 5Myr) are considerably shorter than
the Salpeter time 𝑡S � 𝑡gr, implying SMBH growth during episodic
quasar activity and/or in obscured phases.
Episodic quasar activity on a wide range of time-scales has been"

bulb” model in which every quasar episode of 𝑡Q = 20Myr is fol-
lowed by a quiescent phase of 𝑡off = 30Myr. In this case, our obser-
vations sample random times 𝑡on ≤ 𝑡Q, and after each quasar episode
the surrounding IGM will re-equilibrate to the He ii fraction implied
by the UV background (𝑡eq ≈ Γ−1He ii '10–30Myr at the redshifts

"age of the Universe to acquire their black holemasses. The problem is
exacerbated by shorter quasar lifetimes implied at lower initial He ii
fractions in the end stages of He ii reionization (Section 6.1). This in-
dicates that either the off-times must be shorter than the equilibration
time, such that the proximity zones do not disappear (see Davies et al.
2020 for the similar case of 𝑧 ∼ 6 H i proximity zones) or that black
holes continue to grow in obscured phases, i.e. during 𝑡off . X-ray-
selected samples of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) revealed that the
fraction of Compton-thin (equivalent line-of-sight hydrogen column
density 𝑁H = 1022–1024 cm−2) obscured AGN depends on X-ray
luminosity and redshift (e.g. Merloni et al. 2014; Ueda et al. 2014;
Buchner et al. 2015; Aird et al. 2015). While at 𝑧 ∼ 2 the obscured
fraction decreases with luminosity from ∼ 70 per cent to ∼ 30 per
cent (Ueda et al. 2014; Aird et al. 2015), at 𝑧 ∼ 3 the obscured frac-
tion is ∼ 60 per cent independent of luminosity (Buchner et al. 2015;
Aird et al. 2015), possibly increasing further toward higher redshifts
(Vito et al. 2018). It is therefore plausible that much of the mass
growth occurred when the SMBH was obscured by gas and dust,
such that SMBH mass and the duration of the UV-luminous quasar
phase are uncorrelated. We will consider more complex lightcurves
than the simple light bulb model in future work."
7 CONCLUSIONS
"We have used a sample of 17 2.74 < 𝑧em < 3.51 He ii-transparent
quasars with science-grade (S/N& 3) HST/COS spectra (Worseck
et al. 2019) tomeasure the sizes of their highly ionizedHe ii proximity
zones. Given that these zones typically span only a few pMpc, precise
measurements are often hampered by quasar redshift error. Therefore,
we obtained ancillary near-infrared spectroscopy tomeasure accurate
and precise systemic redshifts of 12 quasars from low-ionization UV
and optical emission lines (Mg ii, H𝛽, [O iii]) that also allow for
estimates of the quasar black hole masses and Eddington ratios.
Together with two 𝑧em > 3.6 quasars from Paper I and excluding
the peculiar quasar HE 2347−4342 (e.g. Reimers et al. 1997), we
have compiled the first statistical sample of 13 quasars with accurate
and precise He ii proximity zone sizes (𝜎𝑅pz . 1 pMpc). Our main
results are the following:"
"(i) He ii proximity zone sizes span a large range 2 pMpc . 𝑅pz .
15 pMpc. Nine out of 13 quasars with precise systemic redshifts have
𝑅pz > 5 pMpc, suggesting that large proximity zones are common,
and that quasar redshift error significantly limits further use of the
remaining He ii-transparent quasars.
(ii) He ii proximity zone sizes do not correlate with quasar UV"
"luminosity or redshift (Figs. 6 and 7). Given their weak sensitivity
to the He ii fraction in the ambient IGM (Khrykin et al. 2016, 2019),
the factor ∼ 5 spread of 𝑅pz at similar luminosity is mainly due to
variations in the individual quasar on-time, but variations in the He ii
fraction due to patchyHe ii reionization and IGMdensity fluctuations
contribute as well.
(iii) Exploiting the sensitivity of 𝑅pz to quasar on-times 𝑡on shorter"
"than the equilibration time of He ii in the ambient IGM 𝑡eq = 10–
30Myr at these redshifts (Khrykin et al. 2016; Worseck et al. 2019)
we have inferred individual quasar on-times using our Bayesian
framework developed in Paper I. The 13 quasars with precise He ii
proximity zone sizes span a large range in on-time from 𝑡on . 1Myr
to 𝑡on > 30Myr, larger than the typical ±0.3 dex statistical uncer-
tainty due to remaining redshift error, the IGM density field, and the
initial He ii fraction prior to quasar activity.
(iv) The quasar on-time neither correlates with quasar luminos-"
"ity (Fig. 9), nor with black hole mass (Fig. 10) or Eddington ratio
(Fig. 11)."
"The predominantly short quasar on-times 𝑡on < 10Myr and the
lack of correlation with the black hole properties suggest that our ob-
servations sample the distribution of episodic quasar lifetimes.Unless
these quasars are radiatively highly inefficient (Davies et al. 2019),
their black holes must have grown in bursts significantly shorter than
the 𝑒-folding time-scale 𝑡S ∼ 44Myr. Such short quasar lifetimes
suggest a long quasar duty cycle that is, however, not well constrained
given the age of the Universe at 𝑧 < 4 (> 1.6Gyr). This is different
to the situation for 𝑧 & 6 H i proximity zones that are insensitive to
quasar on-times 𝑡on & 0.1Myr (Eilers et al. 2017, 2018; Davies et al.
2020), but probe the growth of SMBHs . 1Gyr after the Big Bang.
If SMBHs of quasars at 𝑧 ∼ 6 accreted similarly to their counterparts
at 𝑧 ∼ 3, most of their mass must have been built up during phases
of obscuration or radiative inefficiency.
The sensitivity of individualHe ii proximity zones to the time-scale"
"of prior quasar activity of up to ∼ 30Myr offers a unique opportunity
to constrain the underlying distribution of episodic quasar lifetimes
(Khrykin et al. 2021), which can be compared to predictions from
models of galaxy and black hole co-evolution. Moreover, we antic-
ipate to more than double the sample of He ii-transparent quasars
with precise systemic redshifts in our ongoing joint programme with
HST/COS andGemini/GNIRS (PIWorseck) to further resolve quasar
activity on time-scales of several tens of Myr."

"APPENDIX A: MOCK HST/COS HE ii PROXIMITY ZONE
SPECTRA"
"In our radiative transfer models, the He ii proximity zone sizes
were determined from high-resolution (d𝑟 = 11.9 comoving kpc,
d𝑣 = 0.86–0.93 km s−1 at 𝑧em = 2.74–3.5) noise-free He ii prox-
imity zone Ly𝛼 transmission spectra that had not been degraded
to the spectral resolution and quality of the actual HST/COS spec-
tra. We explored the consequences of this simplification with fully
forward-modelled mock HST/COS He ii proximity zone spectra of
two quasars from our sample (Q 1602+576 taken with the G130M
grating and SDSS J1253+6817 taken with the G140L grating), anal-
ogously to Worseck et al. (2016, 2019). For twelve different com-
binations of initial He ii fraction 𝑥HeII,0 ∈ {0.01, 0.05, 0.5, 1.0} and
quasar on-time 𝑡on ∈ {1, 10, 100}Myr twenty model spectra were
convolvedwith the respectiveHST/COS line-spread functions. Given
the actual quasar continuum flux, grating sensitivity, exposure time,
background conditions and spectral binning, expected COS counts
per pixel were computed from the convolved He ii transmission spec-
tra. Realistic COS Poisson counts were simulated as Poisson deviates
of the expected counts, and then converted back to He ii transmis-
sion. Finally, 𝑅pz was determined in the same way as for the observed
spectra. Redshift error was not included here.
Figure A1 shows the observed HST/COS He ii proximity zone"
"spectra and representative mock spectra of Q 1602+576 and
SDSS J1253+6817. We chose the combinations of 𝑥HeII,0 and 𝑡on
the 𝑅pz distribution of which match best the measured values. Apart
from the small-scale structure in the proximity zone sourced by the
density field, the mock spectra resemble the observed spectra very
well. The bottom panels show the relative deviations of the proximity
zone sizes determined in the mock spectra (𝑅pz) with respect to the
ones in the high-resolution noise-free model spectra (𝑅sim). For most
of the 240 mock spectra per quasar the values are very similar, in
particular for the range of quasar on-times our method is sensitive
to (𝑡on < 30Myr). For long quasar on-times 𝑡on ∼ 100Myr, 𝑅pz
is sometimes significantly larger than 𝑅sim due to subtle deviations
between the smoothed He ii transmission profiles when accounting
for the broad wings of the COS line-spread functions and the coarser
binning of the COS spectra. In G140L spectra, proximity zone sizes
. 5 pMpc are overestimated by up to 10 per cent, primarily due to
the sharp drop of the He ii transmission profile for short quasar on-
times . 1Myr. However, this bias is smaller than the error in 𝑅pz
induced by quasar redshift error (Table 1). For larger 𝑅sim the bias"

"Figure A1. Comparison of observed HST/COS He ii quasar proximity zone spectra (top panels, labelled) to representative realistic mock spectra (middle
panels). The left (right) panels show COS G130M (G140L) spectra, plotted in grey with statistical 1𝜎 Poisson errors. Distances are for the He ii Ly𝛼 transition
relative to the quasar at redshift 𝑧em, with negative distances indicating pixels in the quasar continuum. The violet squares with error bars mark the quasar
redshift uncertainties. The blue lines show the flux smoothed with a Gaussian filter with FWHM 1pMpc. The red dots mark the measured 𝑅pz. The green solid
lines in the middle panels show the smoothed high-resolution noise-free He ii transmission from our radiative transfer models employed in our MCMC analysis,
yielding a different proximity zone size 𝑅sim (green dashed). The bottom panels show the relative deviation of 𝑅pz with respect to 𝑅sim in the radiative transfer
models for three values of the quasar on-time 𝑡on (labelled). The dashed lines mark zero deviation."
"monotonically decreases to . 2 per cent, as the He ii proximity zone
transmission profile drops more gradually. In COS G130M spectra
the proximity zone size is generally not significantly overestimated
even at small 𝑅sim, as expected. The intrinsic scatter of 𝑅pz around
𝑅sim is small, i.e. 𝑅pz is robustly estimated in the COS spectra used
in our analysis (see the middle panels of Fig. A1). We verified the
robustness of 𝑅pz in the lowest-quality spectra (S/N∼ 3)."
