ABSTRACT
"We present a detailed analysis of 99 optically thin C iii absorption systems at redshift, 0.2 6
I 6 0.9 associated with neutral hydrogen column densities in the range, 15 6 log # (H i)
(cm−2)6 16.2. Using photoionization models, we infer the number density (=H), C-abundance
([�/�]) and line-of-sight thickness (!) of these systems in the ranges, −3.4 6 log =H (in
cm−3) 6 −1.6, −1.6 6 [�/�] 6 0.4, and 1.3 pc 6 ! 6 10 kpc, respectively with most of
the systems having sub-kpc scale thickness. We combine the low−I and previously reported
high−I (2.1 6 I 6 3.3) optically thin C iii systems to study the redshift evolution and various
correlation between the derived physical parameters. We see a significant redshift evolution
in =H, [�/�] and !. We compare the redshift evolution of metallicity in C iii systems with
those of various types of absorption systems. We find that the slope of [�/�] vs. I for C iii
absorbers is stepper compared to the redshift evolution of cosmic metallicity of the damped
LyU sample (DLAs) but consistent with that of sub−DLAs. We find the existence of strong
anti-correlation between ! vs. [�/�] for the combined sample with a significance level of
8.39f. We see evidence of two distinct [�/�] branch C iii populations (low−[�/�] branch,
[�/�] 6 −1.2 and high−[�/�] branch, [�/�] > −1.2) in the combined C iii sample when
divided appropriately in the ! vs. # (C iii) plane. Further studies of C iii absorbers in the
redshift range, 1.0 6 I 6 2.0 is important to map the redshift evolution of these absorbers
and gain insights into the time evolution physical conditions of the circumgalactic medium."

1 INTRODUCTION
Galaxies accrete gas from its surrounding regions in order to sustain
the star forming activity over long timescales (∼Gyr) (Fox & Davé
"2017). In return, various stellar activities push back the gas into the"
halo of the galaxy and/or into the circumgalactic medium (CGM)
through winds (Heckman et al. 2000; Veilleux et al. 2005; Zhang
2018; Lochhaas et al. 2018). The gas flows around a galaxy provide
crucial information on the initial mass function and star formation
"rate (SFR) history of the host galaxy. So, the measurement of"
chemical abundances and physical parameters of the CGM gas are
essential to explore processes driving the evolution of galaxies.
"However, it is impossible to detect these inflows/outflows in"
"emission via direct observations with current telescopes. Therefore,"
these gas flows are usually detected in absorption lines embedded
in the spectra of luminous background sources (such as quasars
and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs); Ford et al. 2014; Hafen et al. 2020;
"Ho & Martin 2020). Currently, high-resolution spectrographs have"

the ability to trace the inflow/outflow in the intervening galaxies
with significant sensitivity and resolve the individual components
up to a few km s−1.
Metals observed in quasar spectra originating from galactic
haloes (or CGM) around the intervening galaxies are found to
evolve with cosmic time (Bergeron 1986; Adelberger et al. 2005;
Steidel et al. 2010; Keeney et al. 2017; Tumlinson et al. 2017;
"Muzahid et al. 2018). In the past few decades, absorption line"
studies show that the photoionized gas with a temperature of
about 104 are ubiquitous throughout the gaseous halo of the
galaxies up to impact parameters of ∼100 kpc (Stocke et al. 2013;
"Werk et al. 2013). Using the low redshift COS-Halos sample,"
"Stern et al. (2016) have shown that for ∼ !∗ galaxies, the haloes"
are reservoirs of cool gas with masses in the range ∼ 1010 −
"1011 ""⊙ . Despite having ample of CGM surveys using quasar"
"absorption lines, the origin and distribution of halo gas in the"
"CGM is still uncertain. However, it has been shown from several"
hydrodynamic simulations that the enrichment of heavy elements in
the CGM is predominantly due to the galactic winds (Veilleux et al.
2005; McCourt et al. 2015; Muratov et al. 2015). The massive

superwinds of supernova explosions drive the metal enriched
out-flowing gas into the haloes of galaxies. The wind material
goes through fragmentation due to thermal instabilities to form
clumps of clouds (Field 1965; Thompson et al. 2016). The clump
of gas then cools with time and reaches pressure equilibrium with
the surroundings (McCourt et al. 2015; Heckman et al. 2017) or
"become self-gravitating (Dedikov & Shchekinov 2004). Recently,"
several simulation results also suggest that the condensations under
thermal instabilities and fragmentation of cool gas are responsible
for forming small cloudlets (sizes ∼ pc) in the galactic halos
(McCourt et al. 2018; Liang & Remming 2020).
"Primarily, Mg ii __2976, 2803 doublet transitions have been"
used over the years to trace the relationship between metal ions and
parent galaxies at low to intermediate redshifts (0.3 6 I 6 2.5)
(Petitjean & Bergeron 1990; Chen et al. 2010; Dutta et al. 2017;
"Joshi et al. 2017). However, the scenario has drastically changed"
"with the use of other metal ions such as low ionized ions of Si ii, C ii,"
"Si iii, (Narayanan et al. 2005; Herenz et al. 2013; Muzahid et al."
2018; Bouma et al. 2019) intermediate to high ionized ions of
"Si iv, C iv, O vi, Ne viii (Chen et al. 2001; Bergeron & Herbert-Fort"
"2005; Muzahid 2014; Muzahid et al. 2015; Hussain et al. 2017),"
"etc., with the help of high-quality and high-resolution UV"
spectroscopy.
Measurements of column densities of successive ionization
stages of an element is advantageous to infer the ionization
parameter (U) (alternatively =H) of photoionized cool absorbing gas
with an assumed incident ultraviolet background (UVB) radiation.
"Additionally, # (H i) of the absorbing gas is further used to"
"constrain the physical parameters accurately. Hence, large surveys"
of successive ions of heavy elements with additional coverage of
H i are potentially essential to identify the underlying mechanism of
"the stability and origin of the absorbing gas. With large surveys, we"
wish to capture the broad statistics of absorption systems and study
various correlations between the derived physical and chemical
parameters. This can further enhance our understanding of the
absorbers and provide essential ingredients to perform more realistic
hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation and the evolution of
IGM/CGM.
"However, the luxury of finding such idealized absorbing gas"
"sample is limited due to various constraints such as, wavelength"
"coverage of all the ions, blending due to the other ionic transitions,"
"detection limits due to signal to noise ratio (SNR), etc. Mostly,"
carbon is used as a common tracer of metals associated with H i
absorbing gas originating from the IGM/CGM (Cowie et al. 1995;
"Schaye et al. 2007; Boksenberg & Sargent 2015). The C iv __1548,"
1550 doublet and C ii _1334 lie redward to the LyU emission peak
of the quasar making them easily detectable and relatively free
"from contamination. On the other hand, C iii _977 falls inside"
the LyU forest usually blended by other higher-order H i Lyman
series transitions. Due to difficulty in finding clean C iii absorption
lines and the dearth of C ii detection in the low−# (H i) absorption
"systems, the physical and chemical properties of these absorbing gas"
"often remain poorly constrained. However, considering ionization"
"state, oscillatory strength, and elemental abundance, the C iii line is"
one of the best and strongest ultraviolet (UV) transition to study the
optically thin gas absorbers.
Kim et al. (2016) have produced a systematic survey of
"optically thin C iii absorber sample at high redshift, 2.1 6 I 6 3.3."
"In Mohapatra et al. (2019) [hereafter, M19], we have analysed"
this sample using the updated Khaire & Srianand (2019) UVBs
to explore the redshift evolution of these C iii absorbers. We
also emphasized the use of accurate UVB in photoionization (PI)
models and its impact on the derived parameters in M19. We
found various interesting correlations and anti-correlations of the
inferred parameters. We suggested that the anti-correlation between
line-of-sight thickness (! = #H/=H) and C-abundances ([�/�])
can be well explained using a simple toy model where ! is driven by
the cooling time (C2>>;) as seen in the fragmentation of clouds due
to thermal instabilities (McCourt et al. 2018). The C iii absorbing
gas studied in M19 are expected to be predominantly originated
from the galactic haloes or gas around the galactic discs via inflows
"or outflows. However, we do not find any confirmed detection of"
galaxy sources within one Mpc impact parameter in the archival
spectroscopic or photometric data.
"Motivated by the aforementioned findings of M19, we have"
further extended our study of the C iii absorbers to the low redshift
"range, 0.2 6 I 6 0.9 to explore whether the C iii selected absorbers"
substantially trace the cool fragmented gas clouds in the CGM.
"Note that, the C iii absorption is expected to be relatively less"
contaminated by the higher-order H i Lyman series absorption at
"low−I than at high−I and hence, are more reliable in deriving"
the metallicity of the gas. To derive the physical and chemical
"parameters of the low−I C iii absorbers, we have used grids of"
"PI models. In the PI models, we have implemented the recently"
updated Khaire & Srianand (2019) [hereafter KS19] UVBs using
"quasar spectral index (U) values, −1.6, −1.8 and −2.0 to study the"
uncertainties in the derived parameters. Combining the low−I C iii
"absorbers with the high−I C iii absorbers from M19, we present a"
comparative study of the C iii absorbers in a wide redshift range of
"0.0 6 I 6 3.3. Note that, we do not find any galaxy association"
"for the high−I C iii absorbers in M19. In contrast, the low−I C iii"
absorbers are a part of the COS-CGM survey with at least one
galaxy within one Mpc projected distance.
"This paper is arranged as follows. In §2, we describe the details"
of the low−I C iii sample. We briefly explain the PI models and
present the physical and chemical properties of the low−I optically
"thin C iii absorbers in §3. In §4, we discuss the redshift evolution"
of various parameters and analyse various correlations between the
"absorber properties. In §5, we discuss our results and emphasize the"
need for a large survey of homogeneous optically thin C iii absorbers
across the redshift range which can be used as an essential tracer of
the cool fragmented gas around the CGM. Throughout this study
"we use Λ��"" cosmology with �0 = 70 km s
−1 ""?2−1 , ΩΛ ="
"0.7, and Ω< = 0.3. We denote [�/�] = log (�/�) − log (�/�)⊙ as"
the abundances of metals and use solar relative abundances values
from Grevesse et al. (2010).
2 DATA
Lehner et al. (2018) [hereafter L18] have produced a catalog of
224 H i-selected absorption systems referred to as COS CGM
compendium (CCC) using 335 background quasar spectra. The
quasar spectra of this CCC sample have been observed using
the G130M and/or G160M gratings of the Cosmic Origins
Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
There are 152 strong LyU forest systems (SLFs) detected in the
"CCC with # (H i) (cm−2) in range, 15.0 6 log # (H i)6 16.2 which"
"is spanning over a redshift range, 0.2 6 I 6 0.9. The absorption"
systems are systematically analysed by L18 to obtain the Doppler
"parameters (1), # (H i) and the column densities of other observed"
heavy elements. They have reported the integrated # (H i) and the
column densities of the other metal ions of each absorption system.
The complete information on detection and column densities of the
"MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)"
Low−I C iii absorbers 3
observed ions is provided by L18. The detection of several metal
ions along with H i is helpful to constrain the physical parameters
of the cool CGM gas absorbers. L18 have reported that the lower
column density SLFs trace the diffuse CGM gas as well as their
transition phase from the CGM to LyU forest/IGM. The quasar
spectra of the SLFs sample have coverage of the wavelength range
of both C ii and C iii ions which allows us to perform PI modelling
as explained in M19.
We extract a total of 99 C iii absorption systems from the SLFs
"in the CCC sample. Out of these 99 C iii absorption systems, we"
find 67 well detected C iii systems and 32 systems with detections
albeit of having saturated C iii profile or blended by other metal
line transitions which are considered as lower limit C iii systems.
"Similarly, in case of C ii, we have firm detections for 18 systems"
only whereas for the remaining 81 systems we obtain upper limits.
The low−I C iii absorption systems have the following flags on the
measurement of column density:
(i) Nine clean systems where we could measure the column
densities of both C iii and C ii.
(ii) 58 systems with clean detection of C iii and upper limits on
C ii ions.
(iii) 23 systems where we could obtain lower limits on C iii and
upper limits on C ii ions.
(iv) Nine systems with clean detections of C ii ions and with
lower limits on C iii ions due to line saturation.
Since the low−I C iii sample has about 32% absorbers with lower
"limits on C iii, we use the column densities of other detected metal"
"ions (for e.g., Si iii, Si ii, O iii and O ii) to further constrain the"
=H in our PI models. We find 24 Si iii + Si ii and 24 O iii +
"O ii absorption associated with the low−I C iii sample. Hence, we"
have categorized total 99 low−I C iii absorption systems based on
observed # (C iii)/# (C ii) as follows:
(i) Sample A (SA): It consists of 51 C iii systems which is further
divided into two sub-samples on the basis of the presence of other
metal ions:
SA1: It consists of nine absorption systems with clean C iii + C ii
"detections (for such absorption systems, Col ID (8) on observed"
"# (C iii)/# (C ii) is denoted by ‘0’ in Table B1). Out of which,"
"seven systems have only C iii and C ii detection, (IDs 18, 19, 30, 39,"
"56, 66 and 76 in Table B1) and the other two systems also have Si iii"
and Si ii detections (IDs 22 and 35 in Table B1 and B2).
SA2: It consists of 42 absorption systems (shown in Table B2 and
B3) with lower limits on observed # (C iii)/# (C ii) but with the
presence of other metal ions (Col ID (8) denoted by ‘−2∗’ in
"Table B1). Out of which, 22 absorption systems have Si iii + Si ii"
associations (Table B2) and 24 absorption systems have O iii + O ii
associations (Table B3). There are four absorption systems (marked
with superscript ‘*’ on the IDs in Table B2 and B3) which have
both Si iii + Si ii and O iii + O ii ions associations. For systems
"in this sample, we could get stringent constraints on =H and other"
parameters from our photoionization models.
(ii) Sample B (SB): It consists of 48 absorption systems which
have lower limits on N(C iii)/N(C ii) without presence of any other
"metal ion combinations. Out of these 48 absorption systems in SB,"
we have 39 absorbers with clean C iii detections and upper limits
on C ii. Other nine absorbers in this sample have lower limits on
N(C iii)/N(C ii) due to saturated or blended C iii profiles and/or
"upper limits on C ii. Since, the absorption systems in this sample"
have only lower limits on the observed # (C iii)/# (C ii) (Col ID
(8) denoted by ‘−2’ in Table B1) without the presence of other
"detected metal ion combinations, we could only derive upper limits"

3 PI MODELS
We have constructed PI models for C iii absorbing gas using the
simulation code CLOUDY version c17.021 (Ferland et al. 2017). The
extragalactic background radiation spectrum of KS19 is inbuilt in
this version of CLOUDY and can be included in the model through
“table input” command. The basic assumptions in our single phase
constant density photoionization models for the absorbing gas are:
(i) it has a plane parallel geometry (ii) it is in ionization and thermal
equilibrium with an assumed incident UVB radiation and (iii) it
has negligible dust depletion. We consider solar relative metallicity
measured by Grevesse et al. (2010) which is also the default metal
abundances in CLOUDY.
3.1 The UVBs at low−I
The ionization states of metals seen in the CGM/IGM are assumed
to be maintained by PI equilibrium with the UVB radiation. In our
"PI models, we have used the updated KS19 UVB contributed by"
quasars and galaxies (Q + G) as input ionizing source instead of the
"frequently used UVBs in the past (i.e., HM05 and Haardt & Madau"
"(2012) (hereafter HM12)). In Fig. 1, we show the KS19 UVB"
"spectra for U = −1.6, −1.8 and −2.0 along-with the two HM UVBs"
(HM05 and HM12 UVBs) at I = 0.5. The ionization energies
"of different ions (such as H i, Si ii, C ii, Si iii, C iii, Si iv, C iv,"
"He ii, etc.) are marked with vertical lines. As seen in Fig. 1, the"
KS19 UVBs differ significantly from the HM UVBs due to the
different model parameters. The KS19 UVBs exhibit shallower
"slope in comparison to HM05 UVB between 1.5 − 4 Ryd. Hence,"
use of HM05 UVB in the PI models as compared to the KS19
"1
CLOUDY version c13.03 (Ferland et al. 2013) was used in M19 for PI"
"models of the high−I absorbers. However, we note that change in CLOUDY"
version does not alter our inferred results obtained from the PI models.
"MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)"
"4 Mohapatra, A. et al."
UVBs will under produce model predicted column densities of
"ions with ionization potential (IP) in the range, 1.5 − 4 Ryd (e.g.,"
"Si iv, C iii and C iv) relative to the ions with lower IP (e.g., Si ii"
and C ii). KS19 have incorporated the updated quasar emissivity
from Khaire & Srianand (2015a) and the SFR density of the low−I
"galaxies from Khaire & Srianand (2015b). As a result at low−I,"
the KS19 UVB models have higher H i ionizing photons than the
"HM12 UVB. Also, the H i PI rates (ΓHI) estimated at low−I using"
the KS19 UVBs reproduce the measurements of Shull et al. (2015);
Kollmeier et al. (2014); Gaikwad et al. (2018) and Gaikwad et al.
(2017b) consistently at different redshifts. KS19 have also used
the updated # (H i) distribution reported in Inoue et al. (2014) to
calculate the opacity of the IGM.
The shape of the UVB mostly relies on (i) the spectral energy
distribution (SED) of quasars (basically depends on the value of the
spectral index U) and (ii) the escape fraction( 5esc) of H i ionizing
"photons escaping from the galaxies. However, at redshift I < 1,"
the integrated intensity of the UVB (at � > 13.6 eV) is mainly
"dominated by quasars. Hence, the extragalactic UVB radiation at"
low−I is mostly contributed by quasar SED. The quasar SED is
"usually calculated by a power law, 5a ∝ a
U , with U values in Far-UV"
"(FUV) are in the range, −0.72 to −1.96 (Vanden Berk et al. 2001;"
Telfer et al. 2002; Scott et al. 2004; Shull et al. 2012; Stevans et al.
"2014; Lusso et al. 2015; Tilton et al. 2016). Recently, Khaire (2017)"
has shown that the UVB model with U = −1.8 reproduces the
He ii LyU optical depth measurements in different redshift ranges
"(also see Gaikwad et al. 2019). Hence, we use KS19 UVB with"
U = −1.8 as our fiducial UVB throughout this work. We also
"calculate the ranges of different cloud parameters [density (=H),"
"metallicity([�/�]), over-density (Δ), and line-of-sight length, (L ="
#(H)/=H)] considering KS19 UVBs with U = −1.6 and −2.0.
3.2 PI modeling of the low−I C iii absorbers
The average gas temperature corresponding to the C iii sample
obtained from L18 is ) 6 5 × 104 K which is estimated from the
"1 parameter of H i absorption. At this temperature, photoionization"
is the dominant ionization mechanism for these gas absorbers.
"Hence, the required ionization correction is obtained using the"
ratio of the column density of metal ions having well-aligned
successive ionization stages. The observed column density ratio
"of two consecutive ionized states of an element (e.g., C ii/C iii,"
"Si ii/Si iii, O ii/O iii etc.) mildly depends on the metallicity but it"
varies significantly with the shape and intensity of the assumed
"UVB radiation field, temperature and the density of the absorbing"
gas (Lehner et al. 2013; Werk et al. 2014; Hussain et al. 2017;
"Muzahid et al. 2018). The ionization parameter, * (or =H) of an"
absorbing gas is constrained by matching the observed column
density ratios of successive ionized states of metal ions with the
corresponding PI model predicted ratios for an assumed ionizing
"UVB. Moreover, detection of H i absorption originating from these"
systems help us to fix the metallicity by matching individual
observed column densities heavy elements and # (H i) with the PI
model predicted column densities. The necessary initial conditions
"of PI models for each cloud are: (1) the ionizing UVB, (2) assumed"
"hydrogen density (=H), (3) the stopping criteria and (4) the chemical"
composition of the gas.
"In our PI models, we use the fiducial KS19 UVB (with"
U = −1.8) corresponding to Iabs of each absorber as the input
ionizing radiation. We use the observed # (H i) for each C iii
absorption systems as the stopping criteria to terminate the CLOUDY
"computations. We generate grids of PI models for =H, −5 6 log"
"=H (cm
−3) 6 −1, with a grid size of 0.05 dex. Then, we equate the"
observed column density ratio of the consecutive ionization stages
"of all the available metal ions (C ii/C iii, Si ii/Si iii and O ii/O iii)"
with the model predicted column density ratio to uniquely constrain
the U (or =H) of the absorber. We use this constrained =H to generate
"another grid of PI models varying the metallicity [-/�] (X = C,"
"Si and O) in the range, [-/�] = [−2, 0.5] (grid size of 0.05 dex)."
Then we match the individual column densities of respective metal
"ions (C ii, C iii, Si ii, Si iii, O ii and O iii) with the model predicted"
"column densities to uniquely fix the respective ion abundances (i.e.,"
"C−abundance [�/�], Si−abundance [(8/�] and O−abundance"
[$/�]) for an absorption system. We allow CLOUDY to determine
the kinetic gas temperature self-consistently under PI equilibrium.
The PI models for the sub-sample SA1 are ideal as these
"systems have clean detections of C iii and C ii. For SA2, we use"
other metal ion combinations to put stringent constraint on the
"derived =H and hence, the =H obtained from these systems are"
"consistent with other observed ion ratios (for e.g., # (Si iii/# (Si ii)"
and/or # (O iii/# (O ii)) as discussed in the following section. As
"mentioned in §2, for sub-sample SA (SA1 + SA2), we stress that"
the physical and chemical parameters obtained using our PI models
"are well constrained. However, for the sub-sample SB which has"
"48 lower limit systems, we could only put limits on the derived"
parameters from our PI models.
3.2.1 Results from the PI models
"Here, we discuss about various parameters constrained using our"
"PI models with the fiducial KS19 UVB. Also, we systematically"
analyse the consistency of the derived parameters of the two
"sub-samples, (� and (�. We have provided the details of the PI"
model predicted parameters for all the 99 low−I C iii absorption
systems in Table B1.
"Hydrogen density (=H): In panel (a) of Fig. 2, we have shown"
the normalized histogram density (NHD) and the cumulative
probability density (CPD) distributions of =H for the low−I C iii
sample in red colour. The =H values for the low−I C iii absorption
"systems derived from the PI models are in the range, −3.4 < log =H
(in cm−3) < −1.6, with the mean and median values being −2.45"
"and −2.48 dex, respectively. Similarly, the =H ranges for the two"
"sub-samples SA and SB are −3.4 6 log =H (in cm
−3) 6 −1.8 and"
"−3.1 6 log =H (in cm
−3) 6 −1.6, respectively. As the sub-sample"
SB (≃ 48% of the absorption systems of the low−I C iii sample) has
"only limits on the column density ratio of # (C iii)/# (C ii), we could"
only derive the upper limits on =H for these absorption systems from
our PI models. The median =H values of the two sub-samples differ
only by 0.14 dex which indicates that the derived =H for both the
samples (� and (� are similar. We also notice that 39 systems
from SB show similar =H distribution (i.e considering =H lower
limits as detections) like SA with a median density difference of
0.19 dex. We find a median difference of 0.3 dex in =H between
our prediction and previously reported values for these absorbers
in Lehner et al. (2019) [hereafter L19]. This discrepancy is due to
"the use of updated UVB in our PI models (see, Hussain et al. 2017,"
for similar discussions for Ne viii absorbers). We see that the use
of KS19 UVBs with U = −1.6 and −2.0 for any absorber causes a
"maximum uncertainty of 0.34 dex in derived log =H values. Hence,"
we associate an error of ±0.17 dex in the derived log =H for our
"fiducial model, mostly due to the uncertainty of UVBs irrespective"
of the observational errors.
"For comparison, we have also shown the =H distribution of"

"Figure 2. Normalized histogram density (NHD) and cumulative probability distribution (CPD) of derived parameters (=H, [�/� ], Δ, and L) of the low−I"
C iii absorption systems obtained using our PI models with the fiducial KS19 UVB. We also show the NHD and CPD of derived parameters for high−I C iii

"S3 from M19, respectively."
the high−I C iii sample (S3) from M19 in panel (a) of Fig. 2 in
blue colour. Since we are using total integrated column densities
"for low−I absorbers, the appropriate comparison will be with"
the system-wide analysed sample S3 rather than component-wise
"analysed sample S1 + S2 of M19. As seen in the figure, the peaks of"
the =H distribution show a significant difference between low−I and
high−I C iii samples. We perform z-test on the =H distribution of
the low− and high−I samples and find that the null hypothesis of the
two samples being same is rejected with a negligibly small p-value.
This clearly indicates either a redshift evolution of =H between the
two samples or different biases in the way the two samples are
constructed. The median =H of the low−I C iii sample is 0.6 dex
"higher than the high−I C iii systems (S3) in M19. The CPD of =H
distributions for the low−I C iii sample is also significantly different"
when compared to the high−I sample S3 of M19.
C-abundance [C/H]: The C-abundance [C/H] of each absorption
system is obtained by matching the individual column densities of
C ions (C ii and C iii) with the model predicted column densities
"at a fixed density. However, we have only nine systems ((�1),"
"which have clean detections of C iii and C ii absorption. So, for"
"most of the absorption systems (for sub-sample SA2 and SB), we"
have obtained [�/�] by matching the model predicted column
density with that of at least one of the observed carbon ion (C iii
or C ii) while making sure the column density of the other ion
is consistent with the limiting value obtained from observations.
"As discussed in the PI models, the different U values (−1.6 and"
−2.0 in KS19 UVBs) also causes uncertainty of ±0.12 dex in the
measurement of [�/�] with respect to our fiducial KS19 UVB
model. The median [�/�] of SA2 (SB) is 0.10 (0.04) dex lower
"(higher) than the median [�/�] of sub-sample SA1, where we"

have only nine clean C iii + C ii systems. For the two sub-samples
"SA and SB, the [�/�] ranges are, −1.3 6 [�/�] 6 0.4 and"
"−1.6 6 [�/�] 6 0.3 with the median values −0.51 and −0.41,"
respectively. We also find that 39 systems with C iii detections and
limits on C ii from SB show identical [�/�] distribution as SA with
"a negligible median difference of 0.06 dex. Hence, we conclude that"
different sub-samples of low−I C iii absorbers show similar [�/�]
distributions irrespective of sample choices.
As we have =H measurements using other ion ratios for C iii
"systems in SA2 without C ii detections, we use the ionization"
corrections for C iii ( 5C iii) and H i ( 5H i) predicted by the PI models
"to check the consistency of our derived [�/�]. In this case, we"
"calculate C-abundance as,"
[�/�] = log N(C iii)/N(H i)−log 5C iii/ 5H i − log (�/�)⊙ (1)
for each absorption system using the observed # (C iii) and # (H i).
We find that the [�/�] obtained using this method is well within
error range (±0.12 dex due to uncertainty in the quasar SED while
modeling the UVBs) of the derived [�/�] from our PI models with
"a median difference of 0.05 dex. Thus, even if we have only upper"
"limits for # (C ii) for the sub-sample SA2, our PI model inferred"
[�/�] are robust and reliable.
"In panel (b) of Fig. 2, we have shown the NHDs and CPDs"
of [C/H] distribution for both the low−I (red) and high−I (blue)
"samples. The derived [C/H] for low−I C iii systems is in the range,"
−1.6 6 [�/�] 6 0.4 with a median value of −0.46. We find that
"the overall [�/�] distribution for low−I is unimodal. Moreover, the"
C iii selected sample seems to be associated with high metallicity
end of its parent SLF sample of L19. The median [�/�] of the
low−I C iii systems is found to be 1.1 dex higher than the high−I
C iii systems in M19. There are total 14 (≃14%) absorption systems
"in (� + (�, which show super solar C-abundances. Comparatively"
"in M19, there are eight (≃15%) super solar C iii systems in S3."
"However, when we restrict ourselves to absorbers with # (H i) >"
"1015 cm−2(like the low−I absorbers), we found only one (≃3%)"
super solar system in S3 of M19. This once again is consistent
with the fact that the low−I C iii absorption systems are more
metal enriched than their high−I counterparts. Kim et al. (2016)
suggested a bimodal distribution of metallicity among high−I C iii
systems. This is also barely apparent in panel (b) of Fig. 2. The
[�/�] distribution of the low−I C iii sample almost lies within the
high metallicity branch ([�/�] > −1.4) of high−I C iii systems.
"Interestingly, we do find the paucity of low metallicity ([�/�] <"
−1.6) absorption systems in low−I C iii sample despite of having
overlapping # (H i) ranges.
Over-density (Δ) and the line-of-sight thickness (!): In panel (c)
"in Fig. 2, we have shown the NHDs and CPDs of gas over-density"
"parameter (Δ = =H/=� , where =� = 1.719 × 10
−7 cm−3 (1 + I)3 is"
the mean hydrogen density of the universe). The derived Δ for the
"low−I C iii systems are in range, log Δ ∼ 3 − 4.5, with a median"
"over-density, <log Δ ><4380= ∼ 3.74. The over-densities for these"
systems clearly confirms that these absorbers do not resemble the
physical properties of typical IGM gas and are probably originating
from high over-dense regions like CGM.
Hydrodynamical simulations of the low−I LyU forest at I ∼ 0
indicate that most of the absorption with # (H i) ∼ 1015 cm−2 and
) < 105 will be associated with the condensed gas phase and
"originated from regions with Δ > 100 (i.e, log Δ > 2.0) (see Fig. 5"
and Fig. 8 of Gaikwad et al. 2017a). The above inferred range in
"Δ is at least an order of magnitude higher (i.e, log Δ = 3 − 4.5"
for # (H i) (cm−2) = 1015 − 1016.2) than that predicted by Δ vs.
# (H i) relationship for the LyU forest absorbers (see equation 10
"of Gaikwad et al. 2017a, and values given in their Table 2). This"
once again suggests that the C iii absorbers may be related to CGM.
The median Δ measured for the low−I C iii absorbers is 1.6 dex
higher than their high−I counterparts. The large difference in Δ as
compared to =H is mainly due to the strong redshift dependence of
mean density =� .
Panel (d) in Fig. 2 shows the NHDs and CPDs of line-of-sight
"thickness, ! ∼ # (H)/=� . We find that the ! obtained for SA +"
SB is varying over a large range from 1.3 pc to 10 kpc with a
median line-of-sight thickness of 60 pc. The median ! of the low−I
C iii systems is ∼10 times lower than that measured for the high−I
counterparts. As the size of the regions may be related to physical
"MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)"
Low−I C iii absorbers 7
"parameters such as sound speed, cooling time-scale, etc., (see M19),"
this difference suggests a strong redshift evolution in the physical
parameters (like metallicity and density) of the C iii absorbers.
"PI model predictions for other ions: As discussed earlier, for"
"constraining =H, we consider other metal ions (Si iii, Si ii, O iii"
and O ii) present in the absorbing gas in our PI models. We have
presented the constrained [(8/�] and [$/�] for sample SA2 in
"Table B2 and B3, respectively. In order to show the consistency, we"
compare the observed column density ratios involving Si iii and O iii
"with the PI model predictions. In panel (a) and panel (b) of Fig. 3,"
we plot the observed column density ratios of # (C iii)/# (Si iii) and
# (C iii)/# (O iii) against their respective PI model predicted values.
The filled circles show detections of the observed ratios whereas the
open circles with arrows show the lower limits. The errors in the
observed ratios are shown by vertical bars. The solid line represents
the ‘y = x’ equality line where the observed ratio is exactly equal
to the model predicted ratio. The dotted lines indicate uncertainty
range of ± 0.17 dex around the ‘y = x’ line which arises due to
the PI model uncertainties (caused by the UVBs). We found 20
(resp. 17) S iii (resp. O iii) detections and 4 (resp. 7) lower limit
systems out of the total 24 (resp. 24) Si iii + C iii (resp. O iii + C iii)
systems in the low−I C iii sample. It is seen from Fig. 3 that for
"all the systems, the observed column density ratios are consistent"
within the uncertainty range of ±0.17 dex of the PI model predicted
"column density ratios. From the above validations, it is quite evident"
that the =H obtained using observed column densities of Si and O
ions are well constrained and consistent. We have also obtained
the [(8/�] and [$/�] for all the systems while reproducing the
"observed column density of C ii, C iii, Si ii, Si iii and O ii, O iii,"
respectively. The mean [(8/�] and [$/�] of the absorbers are
"∼ 0.09 ± 0.17 and ∼ 0.31 ± 0.22, respectively. The mean [(8/�] in"
the C iii absorbers are close to the solar value whereas mean [$/�]
"to be super solar. However, for some of the Si iii + C iii absorbers"
"(marked in red stars in panel (a) of Fig. 3), we find [(8/�] to be"
super solar and require slight enhancement of [(8/�] in order to
produce the observed # (C iii)/# (Si iii) in our PI models. Further
investigations of such absorbers will be explored in a future work.
4 DISCUSSION
4.1 Evolution of physical parameters with redshift
"In this section, We discuss redshift evolution of physical parameters,"
"=H, Δ, L, and [�/�] of the low−I C iii absorption systems"
obtained using our PI models with the fiducial KS19 UVB. We
use Spearman rank correlation test to study the correlation between
different parameters. Since ≈ 48% of the absorption systems in the
"low−I C iii sample (i.e, for sample SB) have limits on the derived"
"parameters, we perform a survival test with ASURV package"
(Astronomy Survival analysis package) (Lavalley et al. 1992)
for the correlation analysis. ASURV package implements the
statistical methods for handling censored data with upper limits
as presented in Feigelson & Nelson (1985) and Isobe et al. (1986).
We have used the bivariate method to determine the correlation
between any two derived parameters considering the samples with
the limits as the censored sample (see Table 1). ASURV provides
generalizations of Spearman’s rank correlation which also allows
upper limits in both the variables.
"In panel (a) of Fig. 4, we show redshift vs. =H for the"
low−I C iii absorption systems. The =H of the C iii systems show
an increasing trend with redshift. We find the Spearman rank

The sub-sample SA shows correlation coefficient dB = 0.37 at a
confidence level of 2.65f whereas SB shows a stronger correlation
"with dB = 0.71 at a confidence level of 4.85f. Hence, the stronger"
∼ 5f level correlation observed in the full sample could be due to
the presence of lower limit C iii systems in SB. While the clean C iii
"absorbers in sub-sample SA (i.e., SA1) do not show any statistically"
"significant correlation between I and =H, we find similar dB (= 0.51)"
like the full low−I sample albeit of slightly lower significance level
(3.33f) for the sub-sample SA2. The survival analysis for the
full low-I sample shows 3.27f confidence level correlation with
dB = 0.33 (see Table 1) as seen in the case of SA where we have
stringent constraint on the derived =H.
"In panel (a) of Fig. 5, we show the cumulative distribution"
of =H obtained in two redshift bins (L1: 0.2 6 I < 0.45 and
L2: 0.45 6 I < 0.9) for the low−I C iii absorbers. We provide
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistics with maximum deviation
(� () and the probability of finding the difference by chance (? −
E0;D4) for different redshift bins in Table 2 . A two-sided KS test
on =H distributions of the low−I bins shows a maximum difference
"between the cumulative distributions, � ( = 0.47 and p-value,"
? = 2.23 × 10−5. It confirms that =� shows a mild increasing
"trend with redshift for I 6 0.9. As discussed in §3.2.1, the =H
range obtained at high−I is lower than the =H range measured at"
low−I. A two-sided KS test also indicates statistically significant
"difference (� ( = 0.72 and ? = 4.01 × 10
−12) in =H distribution"
between low−I and high−I C iii absorbers (see Table 2). We have
also divided the high−I C iii sample of M19 into two redshift bins
"(H1: 2.0 6 I < 2.5 and H2: 2.5 6 I < 3.3). From panel (a) of Fig 5,"
we see that there is no clear =H dependence of I between these two
"high−I redshift bins. Thus, our analysis suggests that the redshift"
evolution of =H for C iii absorbers is not monotonic. Interestingly
this trend we notice is very much similar to the redshift dependence
of ΓHI in the KS19 UVBs (see Fig. 4 of Khaire & Srianand 2019).
We discuss this further in §4.1.1.

"For the low−I C iii absorption systems, [�/�] lacks a clear trend"

The survival test also confirms the same with similar dB = −0.16
at a slightly higher significance level of 1.58f. The commutative
"distributions for L1 and L2, as shown in panel (b) of Fig. 5 also"
"confirms the same. As seen from Table 2, the two-sided KS test"
gives � ( = 0.09 with a high p-value. The large spread in [�/�]
distribution for the low−I sample indicates that these absorbers
probably trace the CGMs of different types of host galaxies. Note
"that, in our analysis of C iii selected absorbers, [�/�] solely"
"depends on the column densities of C ions and hence, it is slightly"
"different from the metallicity reported in L18. Similar to =H, we find"
a strong redshift evolution of [�/�] between low−I and high−IC iii
absorbers of M19 which is also confirmed using a two-sided KS test
"indicated in Table 2 (� ( = 0.75 with a p-value 3.92 × 10

"However, we do not see such strong redshift evolution of [�/�]"
within small redshift intervals for both the cases of the low−I

"CGM evolves slowly with redshift. In §4.4, we compare the redshift"
evolution of metallicity seen in C iii systems with other types of
quasar absorption systems.
"In panel (c) of Fig. 4, we plot ! vs. I. We find a mild redshift"
evolution of ! with redshift (dB = −0.24 at a significance level

Low−I C iii absorbers 9
also confirm the shallower trend in ! as a function of I for the low−I
C iii absorption systems. This mild correlation is mainly due to the
lower limit absorbers of sub-sample SB. We see a large spread in
! within small intervals of redshift which suggests that the low−I
C iii absorbers are tracing in-homogeneously mixed population of
"pc to sub-kilo parsec scale absorbers in the CGM. However, when"
we compare our ! measurements with those of M19 we do see
a statistically significant evolution in ! with I (see panel (c) of
Fig. 5). A two-sided KS test on ! for the low−I and high−I samples
"gives � ( = 0.81 and ? = 2.82 × 10
−15, implying a significant"
difference in ! distributions. It is also clear from this figure that the
! distributions are similar for the two high−I bins (� ( = 0.38 and
? = 0.15) compared to a slight different distributions of ! between
"the two low−I bins (� ( = 0.36 and ? = 2.5× 10
−3). The median"
! of the entire low−I sample is ∼51 pc whereas the median ! of
"the sub-sample SA and SB are ≃75 pc and ≃31 pc, respectively. We"
see similar C iii systems having sub-kilo parsec scale line-of-sight
length predominantly present at I ∼ 2.1 − 2.5 as reported in M19.
"However, the frequency of occurrence of such systems is only 15%"
"at high−I. Interestingly, when we consider absorbers with # (H i)"
"> 1015 cm−2, we find only 6% of these high−I C iii absorbers with"
sub-kpc scale line-of-sight thickness.
"In panel (d) of Fig. 4, we plot the redshift evolution of Δ for"
the low−I C iii absorption systems. We do not see any statistically
significant correlation between these two for the low−I C iii sample
in contrary to the strong correlation found for high−I C iii sample
"of M19. As seen in panel (a) of Fig. 4, there is a positive correlation"
"between =H and redshift and also, there is a strong dependence of"
"=� on I as, =� = 1.719 × 10
−7 cm−3 (1 + I)3. Hence, Δ becomes"
almost independent of I for low−I C iii sample. The survival test
also confirms the same with dB= 0.10 at a significance level of
1.01 f. The lack of redshift evolution of =H and Δ is generally
expected if the C iii absorbers predominantly originate in the CGM
"of galaxies. In this case, the =H distribution is dominated by the"
prevailing local physical conditions and not from the cosmological
density fluctuation (as in the case of LyU absorption from the IGM).
4.1.1 UVB and density evolution with I:
"In §4.1, we have discussed about the evolution of =H as a function"
of I. We notice that the inferred evolution is not monotonous and
to some extent seems to follow the redshift evolution of the UVB.
It is also important to remember while we use #(C iii)/#(C ii) to
"measure =H at low−I, at high−I, we preferred #(C iv)/#(C iii)"
instead. The difference in choice is purely due to observational
"constraints. So, in order to study the UVB and =H evolution in a large"
"redshift range, we have therefore combined the low−I (0.2 − 0.9)"
sample with the previously analysed high−I (2.1−3.3) sample from
M19 for the absorbers having # (H i) > 1015 cm−2.
"In top panel of Fig. 6, we show the variation of observed"
#(C iii)/#(C ii) vs. I using scattered circles. The red and blue circles
"represent the low and high redshift data, respectively. We have"
obtained #(C ii) for the high−I C iii systems from Kim et al. (2016).
We have estimated the upper limits using apparent optical depth
method from the spectra for some of the absorbers where C ii was not
reported by Kim et al. (2016). We have divided the entire redshift
"range into four redshift bins, [0.2, 0.45], [0.45, 0.9], [2, 2.5] and [2.5,"
3.3]. The ranges of observed # (C iii)/# (C ii) in logarithmic scale
"corresponding to the above redshift bins are, [-0.34, 0.93], [-0.55,"
"1.38], [0.21, 2.52] and [0.20, 2.31], respectively. The filled stars"
"indicate the median observed # (C iii)/# (C ii) (0.36, 0.24, 1.24 and"
"1.35) at each median value of the four redshift bins (0.35, 0.58, 2.37"
Figure 6. Top panel: The observed # (C iii)/# (C ii) for low−I and high−I
C iii systems versus redshift. The red and blue circles represent the low−
"and high−I data, respectively. The thick stars denote the median value of"
the observed ratio obtained over the extent of each horizontal bar in the
redshift range with the vertical bar showing the 1f range in the median
values. The model predicted column density ratios obtained using different
"UVBs (KS19 UVBs for U, −1.6, −1.8 and −2.0 and HM12 UVB) are"
over-plotted using different lines as shown in the legends. From bottom
"to top, =H is decreasing as denoted by the legends. The vertical red line"
shows the reionization redshift (IA4) of He ii obtained using KS19 UVB
(Khaire 2017). Bottom panel: The observed # (C iv)/# (C iii) for the low−
and high−I C iii systems versus redshift. Symbols and colours are same as
the top panel. Note that the lack of C iv at low−I is just observational bias.
"Hence, we use the model curves obtained with the median density (log =H ≃"
−2.5) of the low−I C iii absorption systems along with the 1f ranges (log
=H ≃ −2.8 and −2.2).
"and 2.91), respectively. The median observed # (C iii)/# (C ii) show"
a mild variation within small redshift ranges (0.2−0.9 and 2.1−3.3)
which again indicates a slower evolution of C iii absorbers in the
"CGM as discussed in §4.1. However, the median #(C iii)/#(C ii) for"
low−I absorbers is approximately ≃1.2 dex lower than the high−I
counterparts which may drive the observed =H evolution at low−I.
"To further investigate this, we run a set of constant =H PI models"
"using different UVBs (KS19 UVBs (U = −1.6, −1.8 and −2.0) and"
HM12 UVB) assuming a constant temperature and metallicity of
"2 × 104 K and 0.1 Z⊙ , respectively. The stopping criteria for the PI"
model is set at (# (�)) for an assumed =H and taken from Schaye

"56 = 0.16 to evaluate the stopping criteria # (�)� for each =H
values. We have generated grids of column densities of observed"
"ions in the redshift range, 0 to 3.3 (with a step size of 0.1) for =H in"
"range, −1.0 6 =H 6 −4.0 (with a step size of 0.05). Note that, this"
assumption is valid for deriving the physical parameters of typical
IGM LyU absorbers and are simple enough to explain the UVB
evolution and =H variation due to the UVBs (for a brief discussion
"see, Section 3.2 of M19). Here, the model curves may not predict"
the true physical =H of the C iii absorbers as derived in our fiducial
PI models.
The model generated #(C iii)/#(C ii) for three =H values
(median =H (log =H = −2.5; green) of the low−I absorbers
along-with the 1f ranges (log =H = −2.8; red and −2.2; black))
are over plotted in the top panel of Fig. 6 with different line styles
as shown in the legends. It is clear from this figure that for a given
=H the model predicted #(C iii)/#(C ii) is almost one dex lower
at I ≈ 0.5 than at I ≈ 2.5 with a steeper slope for I 6 1.2. As
"discussed above, the median observed #(C iii)/#(C ii) in low−I"
"bins are almost constant in the low−I range, 0.2 6 I 6 0.9."
"Therefore, this nearly constant #(C iii)/#(C ii) observed for I 6 0.9"
will require =H to increase mildly with increasing I. As seen from
"this figure, the range of =H that explains the low−I points under"
"predict #(C iii)/#(C ii) at high−I. Hence, for a given UVB, one has"
to decrease =H values compared to that at low−I. It is also evident
that this difference can not be accommodated using the change in U
"(i.e., the quasar SED in the UV range used in the UVB calculations)."
"Next, to check whether #(C iv) to # (C iii) predict the same =H
evolution, we show the the variation of observed #(C iv)/#(C iii)"
"with redshift in bottom panel of Fig. 6. Note that, at low−I"
(0.2 6 I 6 0.9) the C iv is not observable owing to the limitation
of �()/�$( wavelength coverage. We have also over plotted
the model predicted #(C iv)/#(C iii) for the same =H ranges as
discussed above for different UVBs indicated by different line-styles
as shown in the legends. It is evident from the figure that the
high−I #(C iv)/#(C iii) will also require slightly lower =H values
"as suggested by #(C iii)/#(C ii). So for a given UVB, the =H needs"
to be changed for C iii absorbers at low−I compared to high−I but
not in a monotonically way in order to yield the observed column
density ratios.
"There are few possible biases that could have lead to the =H
evolution we note here. The low−I sample typically has higher"
# (H i) compare to the high−I sample. In cosmological simulations
one finds absorption from a given # (H i) originating from higher
"densities at low−I. The =H values discussed here are for a system,"
"i.e., averaged over different individual velocity components. Also,"
"our measurements assume a single phase for C ii, C iii, and C iv."
Therefore a better picture will emerge if we can do the analysis
of individual components over the full redshift range including
addition data of C iii absorbers at 1.0 6 I 6 2.0.
4.2 Correlations between derived parameters:
"In M19, we have studied the correlations between different derived"
parameters of C iii absorbers for component-wise analysed data (S1
"+ S2) and system-wide analysed data (S3), separately (see Fig. 10"
of M19). We found an interesting anti-correlation between ! and
"[�/�] with significance level, 6.1f and 3.8f for S1 + S2 and"
"S3, respectively. We explain this anti-correlation using a simple"
toy model where ! is driven by the cooling length scale (C2>>;) ×
2B) as seen in the cloud fragmentation under thermal instabilities
(McCourt et al. 2018).
"In Fig. 7, we show the correlations between various derived"
parameters of the low−I C iii absorption systems (indicated by
circles). We also have over-plotted the same parameters of high−I
"C iii sample, (3 from M19 (indicated by squares) in order to"
"make a comparative correlation analysis. In each panel, the redshift"
"value increases with the symbol size, for the systems of respective"
samples.
4.2.1 ! vs. [ C/H]:
"In panel (a) of Fig. 7, we show the anti-correlation between !"
and [�/�] for the low−I sample (filled circles) with colour coded
=H values as displayed in the side colour bar. For the low−I C iii
"absorption systems, we see an anti-correlation in ! vs.[�/�] with"
"Spearman rank correlation coefficient, dB = −0.47 at 4.61f level"
"(see, panel (a) of Fig. A1 for ! vs. [�/�] of the low−I sample"
only). The survival analysis test also confirms the anti-correlation
between these two parameters with dB = −0.39 at a significance
level of 3.86f (see Table 1). Muzahid et al. (2018) have noted a
similar correlation in their I < 0.3 COS-weak sample. We also plot
"the data from high−I C iii sample, (3 from M19 (open squares) in"
"Fig. 7. As shown in the figure, the low−I C iii absorption systems"
"are skewed towards the high−[�/�] and low !, whereas the high−I"
C iii sample has a wider spread in [�/�] and !. In the overlapping
"metallicity range (i.e., [�/�] > −1.2) the low−I absorbers tend"
to have smaller ! than the high−I counterparts. It is also evident
from the figure that the low−I systems with smaller ! also have
"higher =H. We observe a strong anti-correlation in ! vs. [�/�],"
with Spearman rank correlation value dB = −0.69 significant at
"8.39f level, for the combined sample of the low−I and high−I C iii"
"absorption systems. To show the strong correlation, we have also"
plotted linear regression fit (LRF) with 1f range using black solid
and dashed lines in Fig. 7. We obtain a strong dependence of ! on
[�/�] as:
;>6 ! = (−1.49 ± 0.07) + (−0.93 ± 0.08)[C/H] . (2)
The LRF for the combined sample has a steeper slope compared
to the low−I C iii sample (log ! = (−1.60 ± 0.10) + (−0.78 ±
0.15)[C/H]). It is also evident that the size of the absorption
system for a given [�/�] is typically smaller for low−I. This also
implies that the actual sizes of the low−I absorbers are smaller than
the predictions of the toy model used by M19 for modelling this
"correlation at high−I. Furthermore, we find that for the combined"
"C iii absorbers, the correlation remains unchanged (dB = −0.68 with"
7.78 f) even if we restrict the high−I sample to SLFs only (# (H i)
> 1015 cm−2).
4.2.2 ! vs. # (C iii) :
"In panel (b) of Fig. 7, we plot the observed # (C iii) vs. ! with the"
same symbols and colours as mentioned above. For the low−I C iii
"sample, we find a tight correlation between these two parameters"
"with dB = 0.59 at 5.83f (see, panel (b) of Fig. A1) which is"
also confirmed using a survival analysis test as shown in Table 1
"(d = 0.52 at 5.16f). However, high−I data points typically have"
larger ! for a given # (C iii).
"While analyzing similar plot of ! vs #(C iv), Kim et al. (2016)"
argued for the presence of two population based on metallicity.
Following similar logic we divide the combined sample into
high−[�/�] metallicity ([�/�] > −1.2 and log ! < −0.6) and
low metallicity absorbers ([�/�] < −1.2 and log ! > −0.6).

Figure 7. The plots show correlations among various model predicted parameters along with their rank correlation coefficients and significance levels. Panel
(a): ! vs. [�/� ] and the symbols are colour coded with =H values as shown in the side colour bar. The solid line represents the linear regression fit to
"the data, whereas the dashed lines indicate 1f deviation around the linear regression fit. The dotted horizontal and vertical lines show segregation between"
high−[�/� ] ([�/� ] > −1.2 and log ! < −0.6) and low−[�/� ] ([�/� ] < −1.2 and log ! > −0.6) branch C iii absorbers (see text for details). Panel (b):
! vs. # (C iii) with the face of the symbol colour coded with =H values similar to panel (a) whereas the thick outer lines are colour coded with the [�/� ]
"values as shown with the side colour bar. The regions marked by red and blue boxes show the high−[�/� ] and low−[�/� ] branch absorbers, respectively.;"
Panel (c): ! vs. # (H i) and the symbols represent same colour coding as panel (b). The vertical red line show # (H i) cut off at log # (H i) (cm−2) > 15.
"The panels (d) and (e) show the [�/� ] vs. # (C iii) and [�/� ] vs. # (H i), respectively, with the side colour bars representing log =H values embedded in"
"the symbols. The solid circles and squares represent the parameters corresponding to low−I (0.2 6 I 6 0.9) and high−I (M19; 2.1 6 I 6 3.3) samples,"
respectively. The symbol sizes increase with the increasing of redshift within the specified redshift range.
"From the boxes drawn in panel (b) of Fig. 7, we find a clear"
segregation of high−[�/�] (red box) and low−[�/�] (blue box)
systems in the ! vs # (C iii) plane. We see that the high−[�/�]
branch absorbers show a clear trend of increasing ! with increasing
log #(C iii) whereas such a trend is missing for the low−[�/�]
"branch absorbers with log ! > 0.4 kpc. As a result, two distinct"
populations in C iii sample on the ! vs. # (C iii) plane are visible
in the combined sample with the low−I C iii sample following
the ! vs. # (C iii) evolution of high−[�/�] branch of the high−I
C iii absorbers. While this is in line with the discussions presented
"in Kim et al. (2016), in our sample the low−[�/�] branch is"
predominantly dominated by the high−I systems and high−[�/�]
"MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2019)"
"12 Mohapatra, A. et al."
"by the low−I systems. Hence, it will be interesting to increase the"
number of C iii selected absorbers (spanning a broader range in !
"and metallicity, [�/�]) to confirm the existence of statistically"
significant bimodality in metallicity among the C iii absorption
systems.
4.2.3 ! vs. # (H i) :
We show the correlation between ! and # (H i) in panel (c) of
Fig. 7. The low−I and high−I C iii sample have significantly
"different # (H i) distributions with # (H i) in ranges, 12.8 6"
"log N(H i) (2<−2) 6 16.6 and 15 6 log N(H i) (2<−2) 6 16.2,"
"respectively. In the low−I C iii sample, all the absorption systems"
have # (H i) > 1015 cm−2 compared to only ≃63% of the high−I
"absorption systems. Similarly, the size distribution of the absorption"
systems are different with most of the low # (H i) high−I absorbers
"showing similar ! as the low−I absorbers. Hence, as seen in the"
figure the low−I and high−I C iii absorption systems are separable
and have two different distributions on the ! vs # (H i) plane. We
find a statistically significant correlation between ! and # (H i) for
"the low−I C iii sample with dB = 0.35 (3.48f) (see, panel (c) of"
Fig. A1). The low−I C iii absorption systems are skewed towards
the lower right end of the ! vs. # (H i) plane whereas the high−I
C iii absorption systems have a larger spread in # (H i) and ! and
"show a stronger correlation with dB = 0.52 at 3.48f. In addition, it"
is also clear from the figure that analogous of some of the highest
metallicity absorbers with smaller ! originating from low #(H i)
systems are not probed in the low−I sample. For the combined
"low−I and high−I C iii systems, no correlation between ! and"
# (H i) (dB = −0.04 at 0.49f) was found as anticipated based on
well displayed segregation.
4.2.4 [�/�] vs. # (C iii) :
"In panel (d) of Fig. 7, we show [�/�] as a function of # (C iii)"
"for all the systems. For the low−I C iii sample, we see a moderate"
"correlation with dB = 0.33 (3.27f) (see, panel (d) of Fig A1) which"
is also confirmed from the survival analysis test with dB = 0.31
(3.07f). The high−I sample has a large scatter in# (C iii) compared
to the low−I sample and shows a strong correlation with [�/�]
(dB = 0.56 (4f)). It is also evident from the figure that for a
"given # (C iii), the low−I C iii absorbers have systematically higher"
[�/�] compared to high−I absorbers. This is mainly due to the
redshift evolution of metallicity among the C iii absorbers as we
have discussed in §4.1.
4.2.5 [�/�] vs. # (H i) :
We show [�/�] as a function of observed # (H i) for the low−I and
high−I absorbers in panel (e) of Fig. 7. We find an anti-correlation
between these two quantities with dB = −0.44 (at 4.38f) for
the low−I C iii absorbers as shown in panel (e) of Fig A1. A
survival analysis test also confirms the trends with a dB = −0.33
"at 3.27f significance. Note that, this trend is weak compared to the"
low−I survey of the COS-Halos sample of Prochaska et al. (2017)
(dB = −0.69 at 3.80f) and the COS-weak sample of Muzahid et al.
(2018) (dB = −0.94 at 5.24f). The high−I C iii absorbers over
plotted on panel (e) of Fig. 7 also show a weak anti-correlation
(dB = −0.34 at 2.49f) with most of the lower-# (H i) absorbers
(# (H i) 6 1014 cm−2) having [�/�] > −0.5 and higher-# (H i)
absorbers (# (H i) > 1014 cm−2) having large scatter in [�/�] in

"was observed between [�/�] and # (H i) (dB = −0.65 at 5,80f)"
"for the component-wise analysed data, S1 + S2 of M19. Hence, the"
weak trend of C iii absorption systems could be due to the possibility
of poor small scale metal mixing so that the low-ionization metal
lines need not necessarily be associated with the entirely observed
"# (H i) (for e.g., Schaye et al. 2007). Also, the high−I C iii sample"
on # (H i) vs. [�/�] plane gives a strong hint of metallicity
evolution for weak # (H i) (# (H i) < 1015 cm−2 ) absorbers. These
absorbers are believed to be transients caught in the act and maybe
related stripping of metal enriched gas from galaxies or galactic
outflows (Schaye et al. 2007). These absorbers seem to be present
in group environments and are less active at a later Universe than
they were earlier (Muzahid et al. 2018). A homogeneous sample of
such absorbers at low and intermediate redshift could shed light to
the detail physical process of such transient absorbers in the CGM.
4.2.6 Summary
We find a strong correlation between ! and [�/�] for the low−I
"C iii absorption systems as seen in high−I absorbers. However, the"
low−I and high−I absorbers show different ranges in ! and [�/�]
"for similar # (H i). This means, if ! is related to the cooling length"
"(C2>>; × 2B) as argued by M19, the higher density and metallicity"
could be the reason for the small ! seen in the low−I absorbers
having same # (H i). We also notice that the trend seen in the ! vs
# (C iii) plane is consistent with the two population idea suggested
by Kim et al. (2016). We find when appropriately divided in ! and
"[�/�] ranges, the high metallicity branch exhibits a correlation"
"between ! and # (C iii), while the low metallicity branch does"
"not show such correlation. Unfortunately, in the combined sample,"
low metallicity range (resp. high metallicity range) is dominated
by the high−I (resp. low−I) absorbers. Confirming this with an
increased number of C iii absorbers spanning the ! and # (C iii)
phase uniformly will have interesting implications in understanding
the metallicity evolution of CGM gas .

Low−I C iii absorbers 13
4.3 Size metallicity relationship
The strongest correlation we notice in our study is the one between !
vs. [�/�]. While this correlation is seen for both high−I and low−I
"samples, the slopes of the distributions are different. In particular for"
"a given metallicity, ! is smaller for low−I systems as these systems"
"tend to have higher =H compare to the high−I systems. In M19,"
this correlation is explained through a simple toy model where the
cloud size is decided by the cooling length.
"To explore this further, we obtained C2>>; × 2B for the"
‘isochoric’ case with our simple toy model as discussed in M19.
"In Fig. 8, we show the PI model predicted [�/�] vs. ! in scattered"
"points with over plotted ‘isochoric’ model predictions of C2>>; × 2B
for different =H (i.e., for the median =H of low−I (log =H ≃ -3) and"
"high−I (log ≃ -2.5) with 1f upper and lower range, respectively)."
"We use an initial temperature, log )8 (K) = 5.5 in our model."
"As shown in M19, the model curves roughly follow the observed"
anti-correlation between [�/�] vs. ! for the high−I.
The slight enhancement in =H at low−I explains that the size
of the low−I absorbers is less than that of the high−I absorbers
"for a given metallicity. However, for the low−I, the observed slope"
is steeper than what is predicted by the model. This is mainly due
to the presence of small size clouds near solar metallicity. Also
for a given metallicity the predicted range in ! is narrower than
"what we observe. In our toy model, to increase the slope, we have to"
decrease the cooling time for high metallicity gas. This can naturally
happen if we introduce a correlation between the initial density and
"metallicity in our models. In our data, we do see a moderate (i.e.,"
2f) correlation between =H and [�/�]. Another possibility is the
fragmentation of a larger high metallicity parent cloud to reach
pressure equilibrium with its surroundings at a final cooling time
"scale (McCourt et al. 2018). However, it is important to remember"
"that in this work, we use total column densities (and not the column"
"densities measured for individual components) to derive =H, [�/�]"
"and !. Thus, the inferred length can also be related to the number"
of individual components along the line-of-sight.
4.4 Redshift evolution of [�/�]
Understanding the redshift evolution of metallicity of a particular
class of absorption systems (like damped LyU systems (DLAs) and
metal line systems) is very important as it is intimately related to
the redshift evolution of star formation and associated feedback
"processes in galaxies. Generally, DLAs, sub−DLAs (s−DLAs),"
Lyman limit systems (LLSs) and partial-LLSs (pLLSs) are used to
study the evolution of metallicity of gas around the galaxies which
show an increasing trend with age of the Universe (Rafelski et al.
"2012; Lehner et al. 2013, 2016; Quiret et al. 2016; Wotta et al."
"2019). In this section, we compare the redshift evolution of [�/�]"
of C iii absorbers with the redshift evolution of metallicity of
"DLAs, s−DLAs, and pLLS + LLS systems. As we have discussed"
"before, the C iii absorbers studied here are optically thin to Lyman"
continuum radiation and typically have # (H i) < 1017 cm−2.
"In Fig. 9, we show the [�/�] evolution of C iii absorbers as a"
"function of redshift (and time since big bang). At high−I, the scatter"
in metallicity is larger (over ≃3 dex spread in [C/H]) compared to
the low−I (≃2 dex spread in [C/H]). As seen from panel (c) of
"Fig. 7, most of the systems with super-solar metallicity at high−I"
have # (H i) < 1014 cm−2. Such systems are not represented in the
low−I sample due to the # (H i) cutoff used for the sample selection.
"When restricting to the same # (H i) range for low−I and high−I,"
we find the scatter at high−I is reduced considerably.

sub−DLAs from Quiret et al. (2016) and pLLSs + LLSs from Lehner et al.
"(2013, 2016); Wotta et al. (2019), respectively."
Fig. 9 suggests a strong evolution in metallicity between I ≃
2.5 and I ≃ 1.0 (the age of the universe between ≃ 2.5 to 5.8
Gyr). The evolution becomes relatively slower in later times as seen
from the median [C/H] values in Fig. 9 (thick stars). We find a
strong anti-correlation between I and [�/�] with dB = −0.44 at a
"significance level of 5.40f. The LRF to [�/�] vs. I gives a slope,"
"−0.41 ± 0.05 with intercept, −0.25 ± 0.08."
We compare the redshift evolution of [�/�] of the C iii
absorbers with the cosmic metallicity (/) evolution of DLAs
"(Rafelski et al. 2012; Quiret et al. 2016), sub−DLAs (Quiret et al."
"2016) and pLLSs + LLSs (Lehner et al. 2013, 2016; Wotta et al."
2019). The redshift evolution of cosmic metallicity of DLAs
measured by Rafelski et al. (2012) shows a shallower slope [< / >
= (−0.22 ± 0.03)I − (0.65 ± 0.09)] upto I ≃ 5 (denoted by red line
"in Fig. 9). Similarly, a LRF to < / > vs. I for DLAs measured"
"by Quiret et al. (2016) in the redshift, 0 < I < 4 shows a slope"
"of −0.15 ± 0.03 with a higher intercept, −(0.6 ± 0.13) (denoted by"
cyan line) whereas the LLSs in their data show a more elevated slope
"with redshift, < / >= (−0.3 ± 0.07)I − (0.15 ± 0.31) (denoted by"

+ LLSs are selected from Lehner et al. (2013); Wotta et al. (2019)
"and Lehner et al. (2016), respectively. The LRF to the combined"
"pLLSs + LLSs sample across redshift range, 0.2 < I < 3.4 gives"
"a slope, −0.36 ± 0.10 with an intercept, −0.95 ± 0.12 (denoted by"
"orange line in Fig. 9). As seen from Fig. 9, the slope we measure for"
the combined low−I and high−I C iii samples are higher than that
measured for DLAs but consistent within the error range measured
for sub−DLAs for high−[�/�] branch and pLLSs + LLSs for
low−[�/�] branch of the C iii absorbers.

5 SUMMARY
We have constructed a sample of C iii absorption systems in optically
thin H i clouds using the COS CGM compendium (CCC) sample
"of L18 at low−I i.e., in the range, 0.2 6 I 6 0.9. We find a total"
of 99 C iii absorption systems from the CCC sample with # (H i)
"(cm−2) in the range, 15.0 6 log N(H i) 6 16.2. The observed"
"N(H i), N(C ii), N(C iii) and column densities of other available"
metal ions along with their associated errors in the measured values
have been adapted from the L18 measurements. We performed
photoionization models for each of these individual C iii systems
using CLOUDY with the updated KS19 UVB (U = −1.8) as the
incident radiation field. We have discussed the implications of the
observed and derived properties of the C iii absorbers systematically.
We have also combined the low−I systems with the high−I C iii
absorption systems from M19 to study the various correlation
between the physical and chemical properties of the optically thin
C iii absorption systems. We have also shown the redshift evolution
of the inferred properties of the C iii absorbers for a wide redshift
range from 0 − 3.3 in compliment with our PI models. Our main
results are as follows:
"• Under the single-phase PI models, the derived hydrogen"
density (=H) of the low−I optically thin C iii absorption systems
ranges from 10−3.4 - 10−1.6 cm−3 with a median value of 10−2.5
cm−3. The median =H of the low−I C iii systems is 0.6 dex higher
than the high−I systems analysed in M19. When we use four
"sub-samples divided in redshift bins, the redshift evolution of =H is"
not monotonous.
"• Metallicity, denoted as [C/H], for the low−I absorbers show"
"a unimodal distribution ranged from -1.6 to 0.4, with a median"
value of -0.46. The distribution of [�/�] for the low and high
redshift C iii systems show a large spread which indicates that the
absorbers are originating from the CGM of host galaxies having
significantly different physical and chemical properties. We found
a strong redshift evolution of [�/�] between low−I and high−I
"absorbers. For the C iii absorbers with # (H i) (cm−2) > 1015, we"
found that the low−I systems have ≈14% absorbers with super
solar metallicity and are more metal enriched than the high−I
counterparts which have only ≈3% super solar systems.
• The over-density of the low−I C iii systems show a range from
3−4.5 with a median value of 3.74 which suggests that the absorbers
are indeed originating from the high over-dense regions like CGM.
The large difference in the median Δ between low−I and high−I
C iii absorbers (≈1.6 dex) is mainly due to the redshift evolution of
"the mean density, =� ."
• The derived line-of-sight thickness (!) of the low−I C iii
systems are ranging from 1.3 pc to 10 kpc with a median value
of 0.6 kpc which is ∼10 times lower than the high−I counterparts.
"The difference in physical parameters (like =H, [C/H], Δ and !) of"
the absorbers suggest a strong redshift evolution of these quantities
between low−I and high−I C iii systems. The distribution of ! is
also significantly different between high−I and low−I C iii systems.
While there are significant numbers of sub-kpc size absorbers (78%)
"present at low−I, only 6% of the absorbers at high−I show such"
sub-kpc scale line-of-sight thickness. This clearly indicates that the
"low−I C iii absorbers are metal enriched, dense and compact clouds"
compared to the high−I counterparts.
• We find a statistically significant anti-correlation between !
"vs. [�/�] for the combined C iii sample, which suggests that the"
"highest metallicity systems are the tiniest in size. However, unlike"
"high−I C iii absorbers, the low−I absorbers are typically smaller"
in size for a given [�/�] as predicted by the toy model used in
M19. This may be due to the slight enhancement in =H at low−I
"and existence of moderate level (i.e., 2f) correlation between =H
and [�/�] in which case the clouds will have a shorter cooling"
time scale (or cooling length). Another possibility of the existence
of such small scale absorbers could be the fragmentation of a larger
high metallicity cloud where the parent cloud is fragmented to
tiny cloudlets to reach pressure equilibrium with its surroundings
efficiently at a final cooling time scale (McCourt et al. 2018).
• We see a clear segregation of the high [�/�] and low
[�/�] branch absorbers occupied in distinct regions of ! vs.
# (C iii) plane consistent with the two populations idea suggested by
Kim et al. (2016). We find that the high−[�/�] branch absorbers
([�/�] > −1.2) with ! < 0.25 kpc show a strong correlation
"with # (C iii), whereas, the low−[�/�] branch absorbers do not"
"exhibit such correlation with # (C iii). However, the high−[�/�]"
branch absorbers are mostly contributed by low−I systems and
"low−[�/�] by high−I systems. Hence, an increased number of C iii"
absorbers spanning in the ! vs. # (C iii) plane uniformly is required
to confirm the existence of a statistically significant bimodality in
metallicity. The results will have implications in understanding the
metal enrichment of the CGM gas and its evolution.
"• Finally, we compare the redshift evolution of [C/H] with the"
"different class of absorption systems (DLAs, s−DLAs, pLLLs and"
"LLSs). As seen in Fig. 9, the metallicity of the C iii absorbers show"
a strong evolution between I ≈ 2.5 and I ≈ 1 while the age of
the Universe was between ≈ 2.5 Gyr to 5.8 Gyr. The evolution
is relatively slower at a later stage of the Universe. The linear
regression fit to the I vs. [�/�] gives a slope −0.41 ± 0.05 with
"intercept, −0.25±0.08. This is steeper than that measured for DLAs"
"(Rafelski et al. 2012; Quiret et al. 2016). Interestingly, the elevated"
slope of the C iii absorbers are within the error range of the measured
slope of s−DLAs from Quiret et al. (2016) and pLLSs + LLSs
"sample across redshift from Lehner et al. (2013, 2016); Wotta et al."
"(2019). However, we reiterate the fact that our results may be illusive"
owing to the lack of the low−=H absorbers at low−I as well as lack
of C iii absorbers in the intermediate redshift (0.9 6 I 6 2.1).
"To make further progress in this field, it will be important to"
search for such C iii absorbers in the intermediate redshift ranges
"(i.e., 1.0 6 I 6 2.0) and at higher redshift (i.e., I > 3) with uniform"
coverage in # (H i). This will allow to create a homogeneous C iii
sample across a large redshift ranges.

APPENDIX A: CORRELATIONS AMONG VARIOUS
MODEL PREDICTED PARAMETERS OF THE LOW−/
C iii SAMPLE
"In this appendix, we show the correlation between derived"
parameters of the low−I absorbers that are discussed in §4.2
"(indicated by circles in Fig. 7). In panel (a) of Fig. A1, we present"
the anti-correlation between ! and [�/�]. The symbols are colour
coded with log =H values as shown in the side colour bar. We show
the correlation between ! vs. # (C iii) and ! vs. # (H i) in panel
"(b) and panel (c) of Fig. A1, respectively. In addition to the colour"
"coding of =H as used in panel (a), we colour code [�/�] values"
(thick rings) as shown in the side colour bars of these panels. In panel
"(d) and panel (e) of Fig. A1, we plot the correlation between [�/�]"
"vs. # (C iii) and [�/�] vs. # (H i), respectively. The symbol sizes"
increase with the increasing of redshifts for the figures in all panels.
The correlation coefficient with significance level as indicated in
the legends of each panels of Fig. A1 are discussed in §4.2.

Figure A1. The plots show correlations among various model predicted parameters of the low−I C iii sample. We show the Spearman rank correlation
coefficients (dB ) and significance levels (dB /f) in the legends. Panel (a): ! vs. [�/� ] and the symbols are colour coded with log =H values as shown in the
side colour bar. The solid line shows the LRF to the data and the dashed solid lines indicate the 1f deviation around the LRF. Middle panels: ! vs. # (C iii)
(panel (b)) and ! vs. # (H i) (panel (c)) with additional colour codings of [�/� ] values (thick rings) as shown in the side colour bars. Bottom panels: [�/� ]
vs. # (C iii) (panel (d)) and [�/� ] vs. # (H i) (panel (e)) with the same colour coding of =H as used in the top panel. The symbol sizes increase with the
increasing of redshifts for all the figures.
APPENDIX B: DETAILS OF THE LOW−/ SAMPLE AND
PHOTOIONIZATION (PI) MODEL OUTPUTS
"In this appendix, we provide the details of the low−I absorbers"
which are analysed in this work along with the results of PI models.
"In Table B1, we give the details of the observed column densities"
of C iii and C ii ions along with the flags in the measurements. We
also provide the results of PI models for each on these absorbers. In
"Table B2 and B3, we provide the details of the absorbers for which"
"there are associations of other metal ion combinations (i.e., sample"
SA2 of the low−I absorbers).
