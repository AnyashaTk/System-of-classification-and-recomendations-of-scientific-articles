"We investigate the impact of the nonzero neutrino splitting and elastic neutrino-nucleon collisions
on fast neutrino oscillations. Our calculations confirm that a small neutrino mass splitting and
the neutrino mass hierarchy have very little effect on fast oscillation waves. We also demonstrate
explicitly that fast oscillations remain largely unaffected for the time/distance scales that are much
smaller than the neutrino mean free path but are damped on larger scales. This damping originates
from both the direct modification of the dispersion relation of the oscillation waves in the neutrino
medium and the flattening of the neutrino angular distributions over time. Our work suggests
that fast neutrino oscillation waves produced near the neutrino sphere can propagate essentially
unimpeded which may have ramifications in various aspects of the supernova physics."
I. INTRODUCTION
"Neutrino flavor oscillation is a quantum phenomenon
caused by the misalignment of the weak-interaction
states of the neutrinos in which they are produced and
the eigenstates of their Hamiltonians (see, e.g., Ref. [1] for
a review). This phenomenon becomes very rich and in-
teresting in, e.g., a core-collapse supernova or a neutron
star merger, where a large portion of a dense neutrino
medium can experience flavor oscillations collectively be-
cause of the coupling among the neutrinos themselves
(see, e.g., Ref. [2] for a review). Because of its nonlinear
nature, collective flavor oscillations in dense neutrino me-
dia pose a great challenge to both numerical and analytic
approaches and have yet to be fully understood. Never-
theless, important progress has been made in recent years
which has shed light on this intriguing phenomenon."
"Early studies of collective neutrino oscillations have
employed stringent symmetric conditions such as the ho-
mogeneity and isotropy in the early universe (see, e.g.,
Refs. [3, 4]), and the time invariance, spherical symmetry,
and axial symmetry in supernovae (see, e.g., Refs. [5, 6]).
However, these symmetries are likely to be broken spon-
taneously by neutrino oscillations because of the flavor in-
stabilities in the neutrino media even if these symmetries
are present initially [7–11] (see Ref. [12] for a review).
The breaking of these symmetries have been confirmed
by numerical calculations with simplified models [13–17]."
"Collective oscillations occur on time or distance scales
of (ωµ)−1/2 when neutrinos of different species have the
same angular distribution [18], where ω and µ are the
vacuum oscillation frequency of the neutrino and the
strength of the neutrino-neutrino coupling, respectively.
Much attention has been paid recently to the fast oscil-
lations that occur on the scales of µ−1 when the neutrino
species have different angular distributions (see, e.g.,
Refs. [19–21]; see also Ref. [22] for a review). These fast
oscillations can occur in the region where neutrinos de-"

"couple from the matter and, therefore, may have a great
impact on the supernova physics (see, e.g., Refs. [23, 24])."
"Since its introduction by Ref. [25], the stability anal-
ysis of the linearized equations of motion has been used
extensively to predict the prospect of flavor oscillations
in static or homogeneous neutrino gases. For dynamic
inhomogeneous oscillations, one can study the analyti-
cal structures of the dispersion relations of the neutrino
media which distinguish various kinds flavor instabilities
[26–29]. The validity of this approach has been verified
in numerical simulations in both the linear and nonlinear
regimes [30, 31]."
"In an earlier study we have demonstrated that fast
oscillation waves can spontaneously appear in collision-
less dense neutrino media under suitable conditions and
redistribute the electron lepton number (ELN) as the fla-
vor waves propagate in space [31]. (The calculations in
Ref. [32] obtained flavor-depolarized steady states instead
of wave-like solutions. However, it appears that the simu-
lation tools used in Ref. [32] have difficulty in maintaining
the causality over a long time scale.) It has been shown
that neutrino collisions, although rare outside the neu-
trino sphere of a supernova, can influence the results of
collective oscillations [33, 34]. Inside the supernova core,
collisions may even trigger fast oscillations [35, 36] which
in turn will affect the supernova dynamics, nucleosynthe-
sis, and neutrino signals."
"In this work we investigate the impacts of neutrino
collisions on the formation and propagation of the fast
oscillation waves. As the first step, we include only the
neutrino-nucleon scattering as in Ref. [37]. We will also
investigate the validity of the zero mass-splitting ap-
proximation for fast oscillations which has been widely
adopted in the literature but was questioned in Ref. [38].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. After es-
tablishing the mathematical formalism and the physi-
cal model (Sec. II), we demonstrate the impacts of the
collisions on fast neutrino oscillations both analytically
(Sec. III) and numerically (Sec. IV). We conclude by
summarizing our main results and discussing their im-
plications (Sec. V)."

II. FORMALISM AND MODEL
A. General description
"We use the flavor density matrix ρ~p(t, ~r) to describe
the flavor content of the momentum mode ~p of a neu-
trino medium at the spacetime point (t, ~r), where its di-
agonal elements are the occupation numbers in the cor-
responding weak-interaction states, and the off-diagonal
elements are the coherences between these states [39]. In
this work we employ the two-flavor mixing between νe
and ντ , where ντ represents a linear combination of the
physical µ and τ flavor neutrinos. (See, however, Ref. [40]
for a possible limitation of the two-flavor mixing approx-
imation.) The flavor density matrix obeys the following
quantum kinetic equation in the mean field limit [39, 41]"
"(∂t + v̂ · ~∇)ρ~p = −i[H~p, ρ~p] + C~p, (1)"
"where the Hamiltonian H~p(t, ~r) dictates the coherent fla-
vor evolution of the neutrino medium, and C~p(t, ~r) de-
termines the incoherent evolution due to the collisions,
absorptions and emissions of the neutrinos. Here we have
adopted the natural units with ~ = c = 1, and we have
assumed that the neutrinos are ultra-relativistic so that
they have velocities v̂ = ~p/|~p|. We have ignored the grav-
itational effect and the possible oscillations between the
neutrino and the antineutrino or the sterile neutrino. The
flavor density matrix ρ̄~p(t, ~r) for the antineutrino is de-
fined in a similar way and obeys a similar equation of
motion."
The Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) has three components:
H~p = Ωε + Λ + Vv̂. (2)
"The first component of the Hamiltonian, Ωε = M
2/2ε,"
"describes the vacuum oscillation of the neutrino, where
M2 and ε = |~p| are the mass-squared matrix and the
energy of the neutrino, respectively. The second com-
ponent of the Hamiltonian is the matter potential Λ =√"
"2GFdiag[ne, 0], where GF is the Fermi constant, and ne
the net number density of the electron [42]. Here we have
assumed that the matter does not have a (significant)
overall motion and the number densities of the heavy
leptons are negligible. The last component of the Hamil-
tonian is due to the neutrino-neutrino coupling [43–45]
and takes the form of"
"Vv̂ =

"∫
(1− v̂ · v̂′)(ρ~p − ρ̄~p)"
"(2π)3
. (3)"
"The Hamiltonian for the antineutrino is similar except
with Ωε replaced by −Ωε."
"For the incoherent evolution we consider only the elas-
tic collisions of the neutrinos and antineutrinos off non-
relativistic nucleons in this work:"
"ν +N → ν +N,"
"where ν represents a neutrino or antineutrino of any fla-
vor, and N can be either a neutron (n) or proton (p).

B. Homogeneous axial neutrino gas
"We investigate the fast neutrino oscillations on very
short time and distance scales over which the matter dis-
tribution can be considered as both constant and uni-
form. As in Ref. [31], we simplify the problem by impos-
ing the translation symmetries along both the x and y
directions and the axial symmetry about the z axis. We
further assume that the neutrino field is nearly uniform
along z at t = 0 but can change later on. Because the
isoenergetic collisions do not change the energies of the"
"neutrinos, we adopt the single-energy approximation by
assuming that the evolution of the neutrino gas is repre-
sented by monochromatic neutrinos and antineutrinos of
a characteristic energy ε. This single-energy approxima-
tion can be removed in future works to study the impact
of inelastic collisions."

III. COLLISIONAL DAMPING
"The scattering of the neutrinos off a homogeneous ther-
malized matter tend to make the neutrino gas more ho-
mogeneous and isotropic, and thus damps the neutrino
oscillations. This effect can be understood analytically
in our model."

dashed lines in both panels are the asymptotic limits when the
distributions are fully isotropic. A necessary condition for fast
flavor instabilities to exist is that the ELN distribution in the
bottom panel crosses the dotted line along Gu = 0."
"We first consider the effect of the collisions on the evo-
lution of the total density distributions Pu,0 and P̄u,0 of
a homogeneous neutrino gas. It is obvious from Eq.(18)
that these total distributions are decoupled from the evo-
lution of the flavor polarization vectors. We expand the

nomials,"

we obtain
"ḟ0 = 0, (23a)"

"where we have dropped the spatial derivative for the ho-
mogeneous gas. The above equations have the simple
solutions"
"f0(t) = const., (24a)"
"f1(t) ∝ e−(κ0+κ1)t, (24b)
f`(t) ∝ e−κ0t (` ≥ 2). (24c)"
"Because both κ0 and κ1 are positive, all the multipoles
decay away on the time scale of κ−10 except for the
monopole (` = 0) which remains constant. The over-
all distribution of the antineutrino behaves in a similar
way."
"As a concrete example, we consider the following ho-
mogeneous distribution at t = 0:"
"Pu,0(0) = g(u, 0.6) (25)"
"g(u,w) ∝ e−(u−1)

"the upper panel of Fig. 1 we show a few snapshots of
Pu,0(t) for the scenario with κ0/µ = 2× 10−3. Following
many other works on fast oscillations, we measure all
energies in terms of µ and distance/time in µ−1 by setting"
µ = 1. (27)
"Fig. 1 clearly shows that the collisions make the neutrino
gas more isotropic over the timescale of κ−10 ."
B. Flavor instabilities
"A dense, collisionless neutrino gas can support collec-
tive oscillation modes or normal modes with Su, S̄u ∝
ei(Kz−Ωt), where"
"Su = Pu,1 − iPu,2 and S̄u = P̄u,1 − iP̄u,2, (28)"

tively. Using Eq. (18) we obtain"

oscillation wave in the linear regime when Su and S̄u

branches of the dispersion relation that have real wave
numbers. For these branches, a positive (negative) value
of the imaginary component of the collective oscillation
frequency Im(Ω) gives the exponential growth (decay)
rate of the corresponding normal mode."
"The impact of neutrino collisions are manifested in
Eq. (29) both directly and indirectly. The direct im-
pact is the presence of κ0 and κ1 in this equation which
tends to decrease the overall value of Im(Ω). The indirect
impact is on the ELN distribution Gu(t) which changes
over time because of the collisions."

"Because this equation is similar to Eq. (18a) without the

ten out on the timescale of κ−10 as Pu,0 does. As an
example, we consider a homogeneous neutrino gas with"
"Pu(t = 0, z) = g(u, 0.6) e3, (32a)"
"P̄u(t = 0, z) = g(u, 0.53) e3, (32b)"
"and α = 0.92. We chose this initial condition because it
produces the G4b spectrum in Ref. [31] against the calcu-
lations of which we will make comparisons. We computed
the evolution of Gu(t) with κ0 = 2×10−3, and the results
are shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1. As expected, the
ELN distribution becomes isotropic over time."
"To further investigate the impact of neutrino collisions
on the flavor instabilities of the neutrino gas, we com-
puted Pu(t) and P̄u(t) in both a strong collision scenario
with κ0 = 2 × 10−3 and a weak collision scenario with
κ0 = 2 × 10−4. Both Pu(t) and P̄u(t) obey the same
equation of motion as Gu(t) in Eq. (31). We then com-
puted the dispersion relation Ω(K) from Eq. (29) as a
function of time in both collision scenarios. In these cal-
culations, we assume an effective vacuum oscillation fre-
quency ω = ±10−5, where the plus and minus signs are
for the NH and IH, respectively. The maximum expo-
nential growth rates Im(Ω) of the normal modes for all
scenarios are shown in Fig. 2. We have employed both
256 and 64 angle bins in these calculations. These num-
bers of angle bins are much smaller than those needed in
the static models because the spurious instabilities are
negligible in dynamic fast oscillations [31]."
"Fig. 2 shows that a nonzero mass splitting and the neu-
trino mass hierarchy have a very small effect on the dis-
persion relation when |ω|/µ � 1. It also shows that the
presence of the collisions does reduce the instabilities. In
fact, a wide range of the normal modes which are stable
in the absence of collisions now have a decay rate of order
κ−10 at t = 0. As time progresses, the maximum growth"
"rates of the unstable modes also decrease as the ELN
distribution flattens. In the strong collision scenario, the
flavor instabilities virtually disappear at t & κ−10 when
the ELN crossing vanishes (see the lower panel Fig. 1)."
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
"To verify the damping effects of the collisions that are
presented in the previous section, we carried out a suite
of calculations using the numerical schemes similar to
Ref. [31] but with collisions. We assume that the neutrino
gas is confined within a periodic box of length L. We
employ the same parameters as in Sec. III B except for
small initial perturbations to initial polarization vectors:"

"�(z) = �0e
−(z−z0)2/50 (34)"
"with z0 = L/2 and �0 � 1 being a small positive con-
stant. We employed 64 angle bins in all the calculations
which reproduce the instabilities quite well (see Fig. 2).
Because the results with the NH and IH are very similar,
the calculations presented in this section assume the NH,
i.e. ω = 10−5, unless otherwise noted."
A. Linear regime
"We first consider the impact of the neutrino collisions
in the linear regime where the transverse components of
the polarization vectors,"
"P⊥,u = |Su| and P̄⊥,u = |S̄u|, (35)"
"are always small. For this purpose we took �0 = 10
−7 and"
"performed the calculations on 48000 discrete spatial bins
equally spaced within a periodic box of size L = 1200
which is about 1 m for a typical value of µ ∼ 105 km−1
on the surface of the proto-neutron star. In Fig. 3 we
show the development of both P⊥ and P̄⊥ of the ve-
locity mode u ≈ −0.5 in the weak and strong collision
scenarios, respectively. The neutrinos and antineutrinos
behave similarly in both scenarios, although there are
small quantitative differences between P⊥ and P̄⊥."
"The results in the weak collision scenario is similar to
the earlier result without the neutrino collisions. (See
the right panel of Fig. 2 in Ref. [31].) In this scenario,
the initial localized perturbation splits into two peaks.
One peak is transported to the left because of a (largely)
real branch of the dispersion relation. The other peak
grows exponentially while moving to the right because
of a temporal instability. This instability is absolute be-

"later times always enclose the earlier regions [48]. This
can be seen, for example, by noting that the right peaks
of the dashed curves in the left panels of Fig. 3 are fully
enclosed by the dot-dashed curves which in turn are en-
closed by the dotted curves."
"In the strong collision scenario, however, the left mov-
ing peaks are buried in extended envelopes which are
caused by the scattering from other velocity modes. The
right moving peaks grow fast initially because of the ab-
solute instability, but the growth slows down as time
progresses. We note that, unlike the weak collision sce-
nario, the dot-dashed curves (at t = 400) in the right
panels of Fig. 3 do not fully enclose the dashed curves
(t = 300). In other words, the wave amplitude decreases
in the previously perturbed region after the instability
has swept through it. This is a well-known feature of the
convective instability [48]. It has been shown in Ref. [28]
that an absolute instability can be weakened into a con-
vective instability when the ELN crossing becomes shal-
lower. As the ELN distribution is further flattened, the
crossing eventually disappears and the instability van-
ishes. As a result, the exponential growth of the wave
amplitude stops, which is indicated by the similar heights
of the right peaks of the dot-dashed and dotted curves
(t = 500)."
B. Nonlinear regime
"To investigate the impact of the collisions on fast os-
cillations in the nonlinear regime, we took �0 = 0.1 and
performed the calculations again on 48000 equal spaced"
"lattice points but in a larger box of size L = 2400.
In Fig. 4 we show several snapshots of the polarization"
"vectors of the velocity mode u ≈ 1 in the whole box in
both the weak and strong collision scenarios, respectively.
We also show the ELN densities"
"Le =
∫ 1
−1
Gu(t, z) du (36)"
"in the same figure. The results in the weak collision
scenario are again very similar to their counterparts in
the calculation without collisions (see the right panels
of Fig. 3 in Ref. [31]). The initial perturbation quickly
grows into the nonlinear regime and spawns a flavor oscil-
lation wave the range of which expands over time. These
results also demonstrate the features of an absolute in-
stability because the flavor conversion regions at earlier
times are fully enclosed by those at later times. The
results for the strong collision scenario are initially like
those of a convective instability because the flavor conver-
sion regions of later times are larger than but do not fully
enclose those at earlier times. Because the ELN crossing
has vanished at t & 500 in this scenario (see the lower
panel of Fig. 1), the flavor oscillation wave is dispersed
according to the dispersion relation while propagating."
"As in the neutrino gas without collisions, the ELN in
the weak collision scenario is redistributed through the
propagation of the neutrino oscillation wave. In contrast,
the ELN density remains mostly homogeneous in the
strong collision scenario for the reason to be explained
below."

"sion scenarios. The results in the weak collision scenario
are again very similar to those in the previous calcula-
tion without collisions (see the right panel of Fig. 5 in
Ref. [31]). The oscillation wave involves all the veloc-
ity modes, but the flavor conversion concentrates in the
forward velocity modes where the ELN crossing occurs.
In contrast to the extended flavor conversion region in
the weak collision scenario, the flavor conversion in the
strong collision scenario exists only in a small region away
from where the oscillation wave was originally spawned
and is even more concentrated in the forward direction.
Because most of the neutrino modes do not experience
significant flavor conversion, the overall ELN density re-
mains largely homogeneous in the strong collision sce-
nario."
"In this work we have adopted a convention different
from that in Ref. [31] by normalizing the integral of ini-
tial P3 at z = 0 instead of individual polarization vectors
(see Eq. 10). Because of the setup of the calculation,
|Pu(t, z)| is approximately described by the solid curve
in the upper panel of Fig. 1 at t = 0 and for all z. In"
"the lower panels of Fig. 5 we show the magnitudes of the
polarization vectors at t = 900. In the weak collision
scenario, |Pu| remains approximately homogeneous even
at t = 900, although there is some minor changes due to
the collisions. In the strong collision scenario, however,
|Pu| is not only homogeneous but also nearly isotropic.
It has the smallest magnitude for the neutrino field that
has the largest flavor conversion, which is yet another
reason why the neutrino flavor conversion in the strong
collision scenario does not change the ELN density very
much. Because the collision term included in our cal-
culations changes the direction but not the flavor of the
neutrino, and because most of the neutrinos and antineu-
trinos remain in the initial weak-interaction states in the
strong collision scenario, the collisions do not result in a
significant flavor depolarization except for the neutrinos
and antineutrinos with notable flavor conversions."
"In Fig. 6 we show P̄3 at t = 900 in the calculations
that employ the NH and IH calculations, respectively.
Because an antineutrino oscillates in the same way as
a neutrino with the negative energy [49], the similarity"

"between these plots and those for P3 in Fig. 5 shows
the insensitiveness of fast oscillation waves to the neu-
trino energies. Fig. 6 also demonstrates that the neutrino
mass hierarchy has very little impact on fast oscillation
waves which confirms the validity of neglecting the vac-
uum term in most of the literature."
V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
"We have performed numerical calculations of fast os-
cillations in dense neutrino media using mono-energetic
neutrinos and antineutrinos with |ω|/µ = 10−5, a typ-
ical value on the neutrino sphere inside a core-collapse
supernova and for the atmospheric mass-splitting, where
ω and µ are the effective vacuum oscillation frequency of
the neutrinos and the strength of the coherent neutrino-
neutrino forward scattering, respectively. We found that
the mass splitting and the mass ordering of the neutrino
have very little effect on fast oscillations in our calcula-
tions. This result seems to contradict that of Ref. [38]
which suggests that the neutrino energy plays a promi-"
"nent role in fast flavor conversions. We also did not ob-
serve the fine angular structures in neutrino flavor con-
versions as in Ref. [38]. This discrepancy may be because
Ref. [38] studied homogeneous neutrino gases which can
oscillate only in the K = 0 modes instead of producing a
propagating oscillation wave. The stability analysis also
shows that the homogeneous modes have small instabil-
ities in our models (see Fig. 2). In any case, it seems
unlikely that the neutrino mass splitting can have a big
impact on fast oscillation waves where the neutrino vac-
uum oscillation frequencies are much smaller than the
exponential growth rates of their flavor instabilities."
"We have also investigated the effects of the elastic
neutrino-nucleon collisions on fast oscillation waves. Al-
though collisions may trigger fast oscillations [35], we
found that they damp the flavor oscillation waves on the
scale of the neutrino mean free path κ−10 . We have shown
analytically that the collisions make the neutrino angu-
lar distributions significantly more isotropic and thus di-
minish or even kill the ELN crossing completely after
the neutrinos have traveled for one mean free path. In
addition, the collisions also damp of the neutrino oscilla-"

"tion waves by adding imaginary components to the col-
lective oscillation frequencies. Because collisions mix the
flavor contents of different neutrino momentum modes,
they tend to reduce the magnitude of the polarization
vectors and cause flavor depolarization when the neutri-
nos of different momenta have flavor evolution histories.
Our findings contradict the results of Ref. [36] which sug-
gest that collisions can enhance fast flavor conversions in
homogeneous neutrino gases on time scales much larger
than κ−10 ."
"In the strong collision scenario, we have found that the
neutrino oscillation wave continues to propagate even af-
ter the ELN crossing has faded away. This finding should
not come as a surprise because the dispersion relation still
exists for the neutrino oscillation wave even without the
ELN crossing. It is, therefore, entirely possible that fast
neutrino oscillation waves that are produced inside the
proto-neutron star where ELN crossings exist (see, e.g.,
Ref. [24]) can propagate through the regions without the
ELN crossing and influence various aspects of the super-
nova physics."
"Although we have assumed that the neutrinos are
mono-energetic and that the collisions only change the
directions of the neutrinos, we do not expect our results
will be significantly modified when these constraints are
relaxed. This is because, as explained above, the neu-
trino mass splitting does not have a big impact on fast
oscillation waves, and neutrinos and antineutrinos of dif-
ferent energies will have the same flavor evolution in the
limit of a vanishing neutrino mass splitting."
We have used unrealistically large neutrino collision
"rates in this work to illustrate their impacts. The typical
mean free path on the surface of the proto-neutron star
is about κ−10 ∼ 10 km, which gives κ0/µ ∼ 10"
"−6. This is
orders of magnitude smaller than the value we used even
in the weak collision scenario. Our calculations suggest
that fast neutrino oscillation waves, once produced near
or inside the surface of the proto-neutron star, can propa-
gate almost unimpeded outward as the neutrinos become
essentially free streaming outside the neutrino sphere."
"In this work we have limited the time ranges of the
calculations to avoid the unphysical consequences of the
periodic boundary condition. It is possible that small
angular structures may develop on longer time scales as
they do in homogeneous models (see, e.g., Ref. [50]). We
have also assumed an arbitrary ELN distribution which
favors the production of fast oscillation waves. It remains
to be seen how the absorptions, emissions, and collisions
of neutrinos that produce the ELN crossing in the first
place may interplay with the production and propagation
of the fast neutrino oscillation waves."
