ABSTRACT
The enrichment of coronal loops and the slow solar wind with elements that have low First Ionisation
"Potential, known as the FIP effect, has often been interpreted as the tracer of a common origin. A"
current explanation for this FIP fractionation rests on the influence of ponderomotive forces and
turbulent mixing acting at the top of the chromosphere. The implied wave transport and turbulence
mechanisms are also key to wave-driven coronal heating and solar wind acceleration models. This work
makes use of a shell turbulence model run on open and closed magnetic field lines of the solar corona
"to investigate with a unified approach the influence of magnetic topology, turbulence amplitude and"
dissipation on the FIP fractionation. We try in particular to assess whether there is a clear distinction
between the FIP effect on closed and open field regions.

1. INTRODUCTION
The First Ionization Potential (FIP) effect is an en-
"richment of heavy elements with low-FIP such as Fe,"
Si and Mg compared with photospheric abundances. It
was initially measured in the solar wind and Solar En-
ergetic Particles (SEPs) and later inferred from spectro-
"scopic observations of the corona (see Meyer 1985a,b;"
Bochsler et al. 1986; Gloeckler & Geiss 1989; Feldman
"1992, and references therein). The FIP bias, i.e. the ra-"
"tio of coronal to photospheric abundances, is moreover"
mass independent. This means that processes below the
transition region are strongly affecting the hydrostatic
"balance of the partially ionized chromosphere. Early on,"
"explanations of the FIP effect involved diffusion, flows"
or some sort of turbulent mixing in the chromosphere to
"prevent any gravitational settling (see, e.g. Marsch et al."
1995; Schwadron et al. 1999).
Schwadron et al. (1999) favored the hypothesis of tur-
bulent wave heating in the chromosphere as a way to
both prevent a mass-dependant fractionation and to
"obtain a low-FIP bias. Later on, Laming (2004) pro-"
"posed the ponderomotive acceleration, i.e. the time av-"
"eraged gradient of magnetic fluctuations, as the origin"
of the FIP effect. The ponderomotive acceleration has
this advantage that it may change sign and could ex-
plain the inverse FIP effect observed in low-mass stars
(Wood & Linsky 2010; Laming 2015). Both processes
rely on Alfvén waves propagating parallel and anti-
"parallel to the magnetic field, to trigger a turbulent cas-"
cade through non-linear interactions and heating. These
"wave populations naturally arise in coronal loops, where"
"footpoints motions excite the loop on both ends, but"
they are also expected in the open solar wind where re-
flection on large scale gradients (Velli et al. 1989; Zhou &
Matthaeus 1989) or compressible instabilities (Tenerani
& Velli 2013; Shoda et al. 2018b; Réville et al. 2018) cre-
ate an sunward component from a purely anti-sunward
wave packet.
The Ulysses spacecraft have shown clear composition
differences between the fast and the slow wind compo-
"nents, the slow wind showing FIP biases close to the"
one observed in coronal loops (Geiss et al. 1995). Af-
"ter all, decades of observations (Belcher & Davis 1971;"
Tu & Marsch 1995; Bruno & Carbone 2013) and mod-
eling of fluctuations in the solar wind have now brought
compelling evidence that turbulence is likely to be a
fundamental ingredient of coronal heating and solar
"wind acceleration (see, e.g., Verdini & Velli 2007; Perez"
& Chandran 2013; Shoda et al. 2018b; Réville et al.

"2020b). Perturbations, or waves are also essential to pro-"
vide the additional acceleration giving birth to the fast
"wind (≥ 600 km/s), through the ponderomotive force
(Alazraki & Couturier 1971; Belcher 1971; Jacques 1977;"
Leer et al. 1982). The low-FIP bias of the slow wind is
often understood as the proof that the it originates in
"coronal loops, through exchange and magnetic reconfig-"
"uration (or reconnection) in the low corona (see, e.g.,"
"Antiochos et al. 2012). Yet, if turbulence is both re-"
sponsible for the solar wind acceleration and the FIP
"effect, can we rule out a scenario where FIP fractiona-"
tion occurs in purely open regions?
We investigate this question using a coupled modelling
"approach. First, we extract unidimensional profiles of"
open solar wind flux tubes and coronal loops using a
multi-dimensional MHD code (Réville et al. 2020b). We
then use the Shell-Atm code (Buchlin & Velli 2007;
"Verdini et al. 2009) to compute the propagation, cas-"
cade and dissipation of purely transverse perturbations
of velocity and magnetic field along these profiles. We
perform a parameter study where we vary the geom-
"etry, the initial perturbation amplitude and the initial"
"injection scale, and discuss their effect on the turbulence"
properties in the chromosphere and transition region.
We estimate the resulting FIP biases with an analytical
fractionation model.
2. BACKGROUND WIND AND TRANSITION
REGION PROFILES
"In this section, we describe the global MHD simulation"
used to extract the different wind profiles later input
in our turbulence model. The code itself is a global
MHD solver based on PLUTO (Mignone et al. 2007)
and our current implementation is described in details
in Réville et al. (2020b) and Réville et al. (2020a). The
main purpose of the global simulation is to provide a
"realistic structure of the transition region, which plays"
an essential part in the present work. We rely on a single
"run, of a dipolar solar field of 5 G, which is typical of"
"solar minimum configurations (see, e.g., DeRosa et al."
"2012), and a uniform coronal heating prescribed with"
the following function:
Qh = Fh/H
"(
R�
r"
")2
exp"
"(
−
r −R�
H"
")
, (1)"
"where H = 1R�, and Fh = 10
5 erg.cm−2s−1. The value"
of Fh corresponds to the global energy output of the
solar wind.
The result of the simulation is shown in Figure 1. The
left panel is a zoom on the transition region as a func-
tion of height and latitude. Contrarily with previous
"studies (Réville et al. 2020b,a), whose inner boundary"
"Figure 1. Plasma temperature obtained with the global
MHD model. On the left panel, we show the temperature
profile as a function of latitude and height. The white line
shows the contour T = 105 K, characterizing the location of
the transition region. Blue lines and orange lines are open
field lines (referred as CH for coronal holes), green and red
lines are coronal loops (referred as LO). They are almost
perfectly radial at this scale. On the right panel, we show
an extended view of the solution and integrated field lines in
the meridional plane up to 5R�. The black line on the right
is the Alfvén surface."
"was located at the base of the corona, we start the sim-"
ulation at the photosphere with a temperature of 6000
K. We initialize the simulation from a one dimensional
profile of the solar atmosphere obtained with the 1D ver-
sion of the code described in Réville et al. (2018) and
the boundary conditions are identical to Réville et al.
(2020b). We use a spherical grid with a radial reso-
"lution that goes from 3 × 10−5R� to 0.3R� from the
photosphere to 20 R�. There are 544 points in the ra-"
dial and 512 in the latitudinal direction. The location
of the transition region (TR) varies with the latitude
and the temperature profiles. It is relatively constant
"in coronal holes at around 1.003R�, i.e. 2000 km above"
the photosphere. The minimum height corresponds to
the highest coronal temperatures at the very edge of the
helmet streamer. The height of the TR then increases
"within the core of the streamer up to 1.007R�, accord-"
ingly with lower coronal temperatures. These lower tem-
peratures are likely due to increased density that result
in increased cooling inside the loop (radiative losses are
"proportional to the squared density in the model, see"
Réville et al. 2020b). This structure has already been
described in the work of Lionello et al. (2001) using a
similar heating function.
"The shock capturing ability of PLUTO, based on Rie-"
"mann solvers, is essential to describe strong density and"
FIP effect and turbulence in open and closed field region 3
temperature gradients defining the transition region.
Réville et al. (2020b) have developed an additional mod-
"ule to propagate Alfvén waves in the corona. Yet, since"
this module is based on a Wentzel-Krimers-Brillouin ap-
"proximation, it is not suited for a precise description of"
the transition region. To further study the role of turbu-
"lence in the composition of the solar wind, we thus rely"
"on the Shell-Atm code, which solves the non-linear"
incompressible Alfvén wave equations on given profiles
"along magnetic fields lines, neglecting magneto-acoustic"
modes. We extracted four different solar wind profiles
"from our 2.5D simulation, shown in Figure 1. In the fol-"
"lowing section, we describe the Shell-Atm simulations"
made from these profiles.
3. SHELL TURBULENCE MODEL
Shell-Atm is a low dimension fluid turbulence code
based on the shell technique (see Giuliani & Carbone
"1998; Nigro et al. 2004), that can model coronal loops"
(Nigro et al. 2004; Buchlin & Velli 2007) and open so-
lar wind solutions (Verdini et al. 2009). As fixed back-
"ground profiles of flow speed, density and temperature,"
we use the four profiles extracted from our global MHD
simulation. They are shown in Figure 2. Cases identified
with CH correspond to open field regions in Figure 1.
The CH1 profile is well in the coronal hole of the north-
ern hemisphere in the fast wind region. CH2 is located
close to the streamer and thus in the slow wind region
"of the simulation. LO cases are coronal loops, the LO1"
case being at the open/close boundary with the mini-
mum height of the transition region and LO2 being the
"smallest loop, well inside the helmet streamer."
Shell-Atm solves the reduced (incompressible) evo-
"lution of Alfvénic fluctuations, i.e. two coupled equa-"
tions for the evolution of the parallel and anti-parallel
wave populations. The transverse components of the
"fluctuations are discretized in the spectral space, start-"
"ing from a scale k0, and then into 21 other shells at"
"scales kn = 2
nk0. We define z"
"±
n = δvn ∓ δbn/"
"√
µ0ρ the"
"Elsässer perturbations at scale λn = λ02
−n. The equa-"
tions controlling the transport and dissipation of the z±
fields are described in details in Buchlin & Velli (2007);
Verdini et al. (2009). Non-linear interactions are oper-
ated in triads following the model of Giuliani & Car-
bone (1998). Dissipation in Shell-Atm is obtained via
explicit resistivity and viscosity. We set the magnetic
Prandtl number ν/η to unity and the Lundquist num-
"ber S = LvA/η lies between 10
6 in the chromosphere"
and 108 in the corona. We write the heating per unit
mass created by the cascade :
"Qν/ρ =
1"
"νk2n(|z

n |"
"2 + |z−n |
2). (2)"
"Figure 2. Profiles of the Alfvén speed, flow speed (in dashed
lines) and temperature for the four field lines extracted from
the simulation, along the curvilinear abscissa s. For loops,
we only show one side up to the apex. These profiles will be
the source of the amplification and reflection (particularly
in open regions) of perturbations, the latter leading to the
creation of counter-propagating perturbations. Non-linear
interactions between counter-propagating waves create the
cascade and the dissipation at small scales."
Transverse motions’ amplitude δv� is forced at the
"base of the domain in the chromosphere over three shells,"
"starting at the scale k3 = 8k0. The forcing uses random
fluctuation phases that are reset over a correlation time"
T∗ (see Buchlin & Velli 2007). This is akin to setting
"a parallel frequency for the Alfvénic perturbations. T∗
is chosen around a few hundreds seconds to follow ob-"
servations of transverse motions in the corona (see the
review of Nakariakov & Verwichte 2005).
We chose to maintain the amplitude δv� at the lower
"boundary, around 100 km above the photosphere, and on"
"both boundaries for coronal loops configurations, using"
the following condition:
"z±n (t) = 2δv� − z
∓
n (t). (3)"
This makes the inner boundary condition partially re-
"flective, with a reflection coefficient being a function of"
time and of the balance of inward and outward wave
populations. Imposing a fully reflecting inner bound-

ary conditions leads indeed to an increase of the base
velocity perturbations up to unrealistic values.

the energy flux of the perturbations at any given location

"where 〈δE〉 is the time averaged electric field due to the

"quency, which easily verified in the inner heliosphere for"
typical Alfvén wave spectra and makes the force mass

"cases A, B and C. In general, we chose the input pa-"
rameters to create a turbulent heating close to what is
observed in the (open) solar wind and as such used in the
MHD described in section 2. We find that a transverse
perturbation of δv� = 7 km/s yields heating rate close
to 105 erg.cm−2.s−1 — the minimum value to power the
"solar wind — in both coronal holes, which defines our"
reference set of turbulent inputs: cases A. Cases B use a
"higher forcing amplitude δv = 10 km/s, which logically"
results in a higher heating rate. Both cases A and B
"have the same injection scale L0inj = 35000 km, which"
is the largest scale introduced in the system and cor-
responds to the size of supergranules. Cases C are set
"with a injection scale ten times lower, close to the size of"
granules. To get the heating in the coronal holes at the
"right order of magnitude, we had to decrease the input"
"velocity perturbations to δv� = 3 km/s. All cases have
the same correlation time T∗ = 600 s."
"In Figure 3, we show some properties of the solutions"
"of the shell model runs A for δv� = 7 km/s, T? = 600 s,"
and L0inj = 2π/(8k0) = 35000 km. As the transverse
"perturbations are forced over three shells, the actual"
"rms amplitude of the forcing is δv∗ =
√"
"3× δv2� ∼ 12
km/s. These parameters are close to the one used in"
Verdini et al. (2019) for a typical coronal hole solu-
tion. The results shown in Figure 3 and in Table 1 are
obtained with a time average of the solution between
"150000 and 200000 seconds, which represents around ten"
Alfvén crossing times for the coronal holes profiles and
more for the coronal loops. All simulations have reached
a pseudo-steady state during the period. The top panel
shows the outward and inward rms fluctuations z± as a
function of the curvilinear abscissa s along the profile.

"Figure 3. Overview of shell simulations A with the same input parameters on the four geometries of coronal holes and loops.
The top panel shows the time averaged rms fluctuations z±. For coronal loop cases, the curvilinear abscissa s is normalized
by L the length of the loop and both boundaries are shown in log scale. The middle panel shows the heating obtained by
dissipation at small scales Qν in black and compares it with a phenomenological form Qp. The last panel gives the spectra of
the fluctuations (+ in plain lines, − in dashed lines) at various distances of the Sun. For open regions simulations, the blue,
orange, green and red lines corresponds to r = 1.001, 1.01, 2.5 and 10R� respectively. For coronal loops, the blue and orange
remain the same, while the green lines are the spectra at the apex of the loop."
"For coronal loops, we show s/L in a logit scale, where"
"L is the total length of the loop, to emphasize the be-"
haviour in the chromosphere and the transition region
at both boundaries.
"In coronal holes simulations, one striking feature is the"
regime difference between a mostly balanced turbulence
"(z+ ∼ z−) below the transition region and an imbal-
anced turbulence beyond. This can be seen also in the"
"bottom panel of Figure 3, where the inward and out-"
"ward spectra E±(kn) = (z
±
n )"
2 are very comparable at
"s = 1.001R� (in blue), with a cascade covering four or-"
ders of magnitude and a spectral slope close to the usual
"Kolmogorov index −5/3. Higher in the corona, the out-
ward wave dominates clearly while keeping a−5/3 slope,
while the inward component has a flatter spectrum with"
"slope close to −1. In coronal loops, both populations
are everywhere well represented and spectra seems per-"
"haps closer to −1 slopes. In the middle panel of Figure
3, we show the dissipation profile computed by the shell"
"model. The plain black line is the true heating, while"
the grey line corresponds to the so-called phenomeno-
"logical heating, a proxy often used in large scale fluid"
"models (see, e.g. Dmitruk et al. 2002; Verdini & Velli"
2007; Chandran & Hollweg 2009; Shoda et al. 2018a;

"As said earlier, the total heating obtained in coronal"
holes solution Hν is close to the input energy of the
"global MHD simulations, itself chosen to provide enough"
"power in the solar wind (see Table 1). Nevertheless, the"
total heating increases as we go from a typical polar
"coronal hole, to a slow denser wind around the streamer"
"and to coronal loops. This is expected, and increased"
heating in the low corona is one explanation for the
"denser slower wind, which originates somewhere close"
"to the loops. Interestingly, we see that the phenomeno-"

logical heating is in general an overestimation of the
true heating in the shell model (as already noted in Ver-
"dini et al. 2019), except around the transition region."
"It does, however, seems to be a reasonable estimate in"
"imbalanced turbulence region, i.e. in the open coronal"
wind regions.
The properties of cases B are very similar to the one
"of cases A, only with larger wave amplitudes and larger"
"heating rates. For cases C, the wave amplitude is logi-"
"cally smaller, and the cascade extent is also shorter as"
we remain with a fixed value of the viscosity/resistivity

4. PONDEROMOTIVE FORCE AND FIP
FRACTIONATION
The main objective of this work is to compare the
effect of the turbulence properties on the FIP fraction-
ation for different background configurations. Among
the key parameter of the current FIP models is the pon-
"deromotive force, or the wave pressure exerted by the"
perturbations on the background flow. Figure 4 shows
"the ponderomotive force obtained in all Table 1 cases,"
"close to the inner boundary, in the chromosphere and"
transition region. Let us first study the cases A of Ta-
"ble 1, shown in Figure 4 in the top panel. The profile of"
"aw,s has in all cases a similar shape, with a slow decrease"
and a peak located around the transition region. The
"TR peak, which is responsible for most of the FIP frac-"
"tionation in the model that follows, has an interesting"
"ordering. The LO2 profile, has usually the highest aver-"
"aged ponderomotive acceleration and a higher peak, but"
the maximum of the LO1 is usually of the order of the
"coronal holes configuration peaks. Moreover, it seems"
that the amplitude of the peak is a growing function of
the height of the TR.
"For cases B, we observe for the ponderomotive accel-"
"eration essentially a shift up of all the curves, conserving"
the hierarchy of the previous cases as a function of the
"geometry. For most cases A and B, the strength of the"
ponderomotive force is higher than the opposing gravity
"of the Sun, around ∼ 2× 104 cm.s−2, shown in black in
Figure 4. The amplitude of the ponderomotive force is"
"thus significant, especially at the transition region and"
Alfvén waves can have an influence on the coronal abun-
"dances. For cases C, however, the first striking feature is"
the net decrease of the ponderomotive acceleration be-
low the Sun’s gravity pull. This means that although the
turbulent heating is perfectly compatible with what is
necessary to power the solar wind (compare especially
"case CH1 A with CH1 C), this set of parameter will"
likely not create a low-FIP bias through the pondero-
"motive acceleration. In these last cases, the turbulence"
"injection scale is 10 times smaller, i.e. the size of large"
granules. The initial amplitude is logically lower as the
"injection is made later in the cascade, which can explain"
the lower gradient of magnetic fluctuations.
We now compute the FIP fractionation created by the
ponderomotive force in our models. We use for this the
"derivation of Laming (2009), that read:"

"where νj,i and νj,n are the collision frequencies of the"

"CH2 configuration. Finally, as intuited, cases C do not"
show any clear FIP biases. This is a direct result of the
much weaker ponderomotive force obtained with these
"simulation parameters, and the heavy ion densities are"
the same in coronal holes and coronal loops.
"In Figure 6, we repeat the same exercise, but choosing"
a turbulent velocity
"√ ∑
kn>kν"
δv2n. (14)
We only sum the shell components for kn > kν =
"104R−1� , where dissipation is significant. The average"
"amplitude of vT is around 8 km/s for cases A, 12 km/s"
"for cases B, and 5 km/s for cases C. The choice of vT is"
crucial to get FIP bias comparable with observations. It
needs to be large enough to avoid the gravitational set-
"tling, and thus the mass dependence of the abundances"
"in the corona. However, if vT is too large, it will kill"
8 Réville et al.
the low-FIP bias. The low-FIP bias of cases A is thus
"slightly enhanced, because the average turbulent veloc-"
ity given by equation (14) is lower than the value used
in Figure 5. The FIP bias of case B is quenched and
cases C start to show enrichment in low-FIP elements.
"Moreover, the hierarchy between the different magnetic"
configurations is much less visible in Figure 6. CH2 cases
"have for instance, properties very similar to LO1 cases."
This shows that a very careful treatment of the turbu-
lence is important to build FIP fractionation models.
5. DISCUSSION
"In this work, we have combined several models and"
tools to assess the efficiency of the Alfvénic turbulence
in enriching abundances of low-FIP elements in the low
"corona. First, we used a global MHD model to get real-"
istic profiles of the Alfvén speed and velocity gradients
"in both coronal holes and coronal loops, starting from"
the low chromosphere. They are indeed fundamental in
"the amplification, reflection and non linear interaction"
"of propagating Alfvén waves. Then, we took advantage"
of the Shell-Atm code to compute the interaction be-
"tween counter-propagating Alfvén waves, the turbulent"
cascade and the dissipation. Our approach certainly
"lacks self-consistency, as, for instance, the heating ob-"
tained with the shell model is significantly larger in coro-
nal loops than in coronal holes (at least for cases A and
"B), while the MHD simulation has a much more ho-"
"mogeneous heating. It is, however, the first time that"
both coronal loops and coronal holes are treated with a
shell turbulence model. This model solves the fully non-
"linear incompressible Alfvén wave equations, including"
the cascading process and the frequency dependant re-
flections and interactions of Alfvén wave populations.
This is an improvement in comparison with analytical
"non-WKB approach of previous works (see Laming 2004,"
"2009, 2012). Moreover, the dissipation is treated phys-"
"ically at very high Lundquist numbers, which cannot"
"be achieved in direct numerical simulations (see, e.g.,"
Dahlburg et al. 2016).
A few comments on the applicability of incompress-
ible MHD to this problem are in order. Reduced MHD
equations are derived assuming small gradients in the
"guide field (or even constant B0, see Strauss 1976; Zank"
"& Matthaeus 1992, 1993; Oughton et al. 2017) as well"
"as in the density, conditions that are not verified in the"
upper chromosphere and the transition region. The ex-
cluded nonlinear couplings in the parallel and perpen-
dicular directions (essentially compressible interactions)
are responsible for the coupling of Alfvén waves to slow
"and fast magneto-acoustic modes, leading to steepen-"
"ing, shock formation and dissipation of slow magneto-"
"acoustic modes and fast modes, and the refraction of"
the latter downwards back to the chromosphere for large
perpendicular wavenumbers. The parametric decay in-
"stability (PDI), involving compressible processes, is also"
excluded. The latter plays a role in the formation of
the turbulent spectrum and the balance of inward and
"outward Alfvén wave population, but is effective most"
in the lower beta regions higher up in the corona (see
Tenerani & Velli 2013; Shoda et al. 2018b; Réville et al.
2018). As noted in Verdini et al. (2019); Shoda et al.
"(2019), density fluctuations created by the PDI increase"
the inward Alfvén waves amplitude and eventually in-
crease the turbulent heating in the open wind regions.
"Wave steepening, shocks and mode conversion, which"
do create a cascade in the direction parallel to the mag-
"netic field, have typical spectra ∝ k−2 and are thus likely
to be a secondary dissipation channel in comparison with"
"the dissipation in the perpendicular plane, with spectra"
close to the Kolmogorov and Iroshnikov-Kraichnan phe-
nomenology (see Figure 3). Alfvén wave coupling with
magneto-acoustic modes may accelerate the perpendic-
"ular cascade, but because we run the simulation until a"
"pseudo steady-state is reached, this is likely not a strong"
limitation of our approach. Numerous other modelers
"have made similar approximations to our own, as for"
example the studies by van Ballegooijen et al. (2011);
Perez & Chandran (2013); van Ballegooijen & Asgari-
"Targhi (2016, 2017); Chandran & Perez (2019). This"
"study has no intention to be exhaustive, but we do ex-"
amine a significant input parameter space in order to
extract meaningful insights on the problem.
"Our study shows that, assuming that turbulence is"
the dominant factor in the coronal heating and solar
"wind acceleration, a ponderomotive force can appear in"
"the chromosphere and the transition region, and can be"
strong enough to create a low-FIP bias. This depends
however on the turbulence parameters. Injecting energy
at the scales of super granules provide the wave am-
plitude necessary for a low-FIP bias comparable with
"observations (see, e.g. Feldman 1992). The force is re-"
lated to the a amplification of the waves in the corona
and the strong gradient that appears at the transition
"region. Nevertheless, if the energy is injected at the"
"scale of granules, the resulting ponderomotive accelera-"
tion seems too weak to explain the observations. Recent
works have debated of the right injection scale parame-
ters (van Ballegooijen & Asgari-Targhi 2017; Chandran
"& Perez 2019), and the amplitude of the ponderomotive"
force could be a way of constraining solar wind turbu-
lence models.
A second result of this study is that the low-FIP bias
"is not exclusive to coronal loops. Interestingly, we ob-"
FIP effect and turbulence in open and closed field region 9
tain significant low-FIP bias for open field configurations
along the streamer (CH2). We also have usually little
"FIP bias for the LO1 loop, i.e. the loop at the very edge"
of the helmet streamer. This result might seem in op-
"position with previous works, such as the one of Laming"
"(2004, 2015). Their result is indeed the consequence of"
"resonant Alfvén waves in the loops, likely triggered by"
"reconnection, which amplify significantly the pondero-"
motive acceleration. Injecting transverse motions from
"the inner boundary, we do not observe such resonances,"
and further studies are needed to compare the relative
importance of different triggers. We do show however
that resonances are not needed to obtain a low-FIP bias
in coronal loops and open slow wind regions. This study
"thus questions, anyhow, the necessity of interchange re-"
connection to explain the composition of the slow solar
"Finally, it is important to stress that our modelling of"
"the solar chromosphere is very simple. We assume, fol-"
"lowing Laming (2004, 2009) and writing equation (12),"
"that proton drag, collisions and turbulent mixing, are"
exactly compensating for the Sun’s gravity pull in the
chromosphere. The actual balance of all these processes
remains very hard to estimate. Shocks and compress-
ible fluctuations are also believed to be significant in
the chromosphere and even in the transition region (see
"Carlsson et al. 2019, for a recent review) and are not ac-"
counted for in the shell simulations. Ongoing works are
"dedicated to build a compressible kinetic-fluid model, in-"
cluding heavy ions populations with various charge state
and their interactions with protons and waves.
