ABSTRACT
"Context. Radio halos are synchrotron diffuse sources at the centre of a fraction of galaxy clusters. The study of large samples of
clusters with adequate radio and X-ray data is necessary to investigate the origin of radio halos and their connection with the cluster
dynamics and formation history.
Aims. The aim of this paper is to compile a well-selected sample of galaxy clusters with deep radio observations to perform an
unbiased statistical study of the properties of radio halos.
Methods. We selected 75 clusters with M ≥ 6 × 1014 M� at z = 0.08 − 0.33 from the Planck Sunyaev-Zel’dovich catalogue. Clusters
without suitable radio data were observed with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and/or the Jansky Very Large Array
(JVLA) to complete the information about the possible presence of diffuse emission. We used archival Chandra X-ray data to derive
information on the clusters’ dynamical states.
Results. This observational campaign led to the detection of several cluster-scale diffuse radio sources and candidates that deserve
future follow-up observations. Here we summarise their properties and add information resulting from our new observations. For the
clusters where we did not detect any hint of diffuse emission, we derived new upper limits to their diffuse flux.
Conclusions. We have built the largest mass-selected (> 80% complete in mass) sample of galaxy clusters with deep radio observa-
tions available to date. The statistical analysis of the sample, which includes the connection between radio halos and cluster mergers,
the radio power – mass correlation, and the occurrence of radio halos as a function of the cluster mass, will be presented in paper II."

1. Introduction
"Clusters of galaxies occupy an exclusive position in the cos-
mic hierarchy since they are the most massive gravitationally
bound structures in the Universe. They form and grow at the in-
tersection of cosmic filaments, where smaller systems are chan-
nelled by the gravitational field that is dominated by dark matter.
Mergers between clusters are the most energetic events in the
Universe. Most of this energy contributes to heat the intraclus-
ter medium (ICM) up to the observed temperature (107 − 108
K). At the same time, a fraction of this energy, is channelled
into the acceleration of particles and amplification of magnetic
fields in the ICM by complex mechanisms, presumably invoking
turbulence and shocks operating in plasma with unique proper-
ties (Brunetti & Jones 2014). This creates diffuse cluster-scale
synchrotron emission, which has been observed in a growing
number of clusters. Depending on their size and location, these
sources are classified as radio relics or radio halos (see van"
"Weeren et al. 2019, for a review). Radio relics are elongated, of-
ten arc-shaped, sources located at the periphery of dynamically
disturbed clusters. They are considered as tracers of merger-
driven shocks propagating through the ICM (e.g. Ensslin et al.
1998; Markevitch et al. 2005; Kang et al. 2012; Pinzke et al.
2013). Moreover, some relaxed clusters host mini halos, con-
fined within the core, generally on scales < 0.2 × R500 (Giacin-
tucci et al. 2008, 2017, 2019). The mechanisms responsible for
the formation of mini halos are still a matter of debate, possibili-
ties include electrons re-acceleration by turbulence generated in
the core by several mechanisms (Gitti et al. 2002; ZuHone et al.
2013) and secondary particles generated by hadronic collisions
in the ICM (e.g. ZuHone et al. 2015; Pfrommer & Enßlin 2004;
Jacob & Pfrommer 2017)."
"This work is mainly focused on radio halos, which are cen-
trally located sources whose emission is roughly coincident with
the X-ray emission of the host clusters. In the current theoret-
ical scenario, radio halos form via the turbulent re-acceleration"

"of electrons in the ICM (Brunetti et al. 2001; Petrosian 2001;
Brunetti & Lazarian 2007, 2011, 2016; Pinzke et al. 2017). The
basic idea is that such turbulence is injected into the ICM during
merging events. As a consequence, a strong connection between
the properties of radio halos and the cluster mass and dynami-
cal state is expected. Radio halos should be preferentially found
in massive, merging clusters, should be rare in small and less
disturbed systems, and should absent in relaxed clusters. Less
energetic merger events are expected to form radio halos with
very steep spectra (α < −1.5, with S (ν) ∝ να), the so-called ultra
steep spectrum radio halos (USSRHs, e.g. Brunetti et al. 2008)."
"The study of the statistical properties of radio halos in galaxy
clusters is a powerful tool to investigate the connection and evo-
lution of these sources with the cluster dynamics and formation
history and to test theoretical models for their formation. Pio-
neering studies using Arecibo, the NVSS and the WENNS sur-
veys (Hanisch 1982; Andernach et al. 1986; Giovannini et al.
1999; Kempner & Sarazin 2001) revealed that radio halos are
not ubiquitous in galaxy clusters and that their occurrence in-
creases with increasing the X-ray luminosity of the host clusters
(Liang et al. 2000), although the role of selection biases due to
the sensitivity limit of the used surveys was unclear (Kempner
& Sarazin 2001; Rudnick et al. 2006). In this respect, an impor-
tant step forwards has been achieved with the Giant Meterwave
Radio Telescope (GMRT) radio halo survey (Venturi et al. 2007,
2008) and its extension (Kale et al. 2013, 2015). That work led
to the discovery of the so-called radio ‘bimodality’ of galaxy
clusters. Indeed radio halos are found in merging systems and
follow the correlation between the radio power and the X-ray lu-
minosity of the host cluster, while relaxed clusters without radio
halos lie well below that correlation (Brunetti et al. 2009; Cas-
sano et al. 2010). All these studies were based on the selection
of the most X-ray luminous clusters, while the key parameter
for the formation of radio halos is the cluster mass. The advent
of clusters surveys via the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ) effect of-
fers the opportunity to compile nearly mass selected samples of
clusters with high levels of completeness (Basu 2012; Cassano
et al. 2013; Cuciti et al. 2015; Knowles et al. 2019), owing to
the tight correlation between the SZ effect and the cluster mass
(Motl et al. 2005; Nagai 2006). The first results based on SZ
selected samples of clusters suggested that the fraction of radio
halos is larger with respect to X-ray selected samples (Sommer
& Basu 2014). Cassano et al. (2013) showed that clusters are
bimodal behaviour also in the radio luminosity–mass diagram."
"With the aim of performing the first unbiased census of ra-
dio halos in a mass-selected sample of galaxy clusters, we se-
lected 75 massive clusters from the Planck SZ catalogue (Planck
Collaboration et al. 2014). The first results on the occurrence
of radio halos, based on a sub-sample of clusters that had avail-
able radio information, were presented in Cuciti et al. (2015). We
showed that the fraction of radio halos drops in low mass clus-
ters, in line with turbulent re-acceleration models. However, that
result could be affected by the incompleteness of the radio infor-
mation for the total sample. Therefore, we carried out an obser-
vational campaign with the GMRT and the Jansky Very Large
Array (JVLA) to complete the information about the possible
presence of diffuse emission for all the clusters of the sample. In
this paper we present the results of these new observations and
we summarise the properties of the total sample, both from the
radio and the X-ray points of view."
"In Section 2 we present the selection of the sample, in Sec-
tion 3 we describe the procedures adopted to reduce the radio
data and in Section 4 we show the results of the radio data analy-
sis. We derive upper limits to the radio emission of clusters with-"
"out radio halos in Section 5. In Section 6, we derive the surface
brightness radial profile of radio halos. The analysis of the X-ray
data is described in Section 7 and the dynamical properties of the
clusters are discussed in Section 8. In Section 9 we summarise
the work and give our conclusions. We perform the statistical
analysis of the radio and X-ray properties of the cluster of this
sample in Paper II."
"Throughout this paper we assume a ΛCDM cosmology with
H0 = 70 km s−1Mpc−1, ΩΛ = 0.7 and Ωm = 0.3."
2. Sample selection
"In Cuciti et al. (2015), we selected a sample of massive objects
from the Planck SZ cluster catalogue (Planck Collaboration et al.
2014). The selection criteria are discussed in Cuciti et al. (2015)
and are summarised below."
"At redshift 0.08 < z < 0.2 we adopted M5001 ≥ 5.7×1014M�
and we selected clusters observed in the NVSS (δ > −40◦, Con-
don et al. 1998). The lower redshift limit (z > 0.08) is driven
by the fact that radio interferometers suffer from the lack of
sampling at short baselines, resulting in decreased sensitivity to
emission on large spatial scales, such as the typical scales of ra-
dio halos. Moveover, the largest angular scale detectable with the
JVLA at 1.5GHz (C and D configuration) is 970 arcsec, meaning
that at redshift z < 0.08 only scales smaller than 1.5 Mpc can be
recovered."
"At redshift 0.2 < z < 0.33 we selected clusters with M500 ≥
6 × 1014 M� and we adopted a declination limit δ > −31◦ and
|b| ≥ 20◦ (|b| is the galactic latitude), which coincides with that
of the GMRT radio halo Survey (Venturi et al. 2007, 2008; Kale
et al. 2013, 2015), in order to maximise the availability of in-
formation in the literature. The upper redshift limit (z < 0.33)
is mainly related to the insufficient completeness of the PSZ1
catalogue at higher redshift for these masses."
"We adopted a slightly different cut in mass in the two red-
shift bins to increase the statistics and, at the same time, assure
about the same mass completeness of the sample in both redshift
ranges (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014; Cuciti et al. 2015). In-
deed, in the selected mass ranges, the completeness of the Planck
catalogue is ∼ 90% at z < 0.2 and ∼ 80% at z > 0.2, thus we
estimated a completeness of our sample of ∼ 83%2. Our sample
consists of 75 clusters (21 at z < 0.2 and 54 at z > 0.2), whose
properties are listed in Table 1 and the mass and redshift distri-
butions are shown in Fig. 1. The median redshift of the sample
is 0.23. The redshift distribution is rather uniform, except for the
very low-redshift tail, where the volume of the Universe is too
small to host such massive objects. As expected, the mass dis-
tribution is peaked around the mass cut of the sample and then
it declines with increasing mass (e.g. Press & Schechter 1974).
The median value for the mass is ∼ 7 × 1014 M�. Only a few
clusters with M500 & 9 × 1014M� are present in the Universe at
the redshifts considered here."
3. Radio data analysis
"The presence of diffuse radio emission has been already studied
with deep radio observations in the literature for 55, out of the
75 clusters of the sample. For three of them, which are known
to host diffuse emission, we obtained observations at different
1 M500 is the mass enclosed in a sphere with radius R500, which is de-
fined as the radius within which the mean mass over-density of the clus-
ter is 500 times the cosmic critical density at the cluster redshift

"frequencies. Overall, in this paper we present new radio obser-
vations of the 23 galaxy clusters listed in Table 2. These observa-
tions were carried out with the GMRT and/or the JVLA. In par-
ticular, we analysed GMRT 610 MHz observations of 11 clus-
ters, GMRT 330 MHz observations of eight clusters and JVLA
1.5 GHz observations of 15 clusters. The details about the radio
data analysed here are given in Table 2. The frequency cover-
age of the sample is heterogeneous, however, this is currently a
necessary compromise in order to build a complete sample that
is large enough to perform a solid statistical analysis. This limit
will be overcome thanks to ongoing surveys with, for example,
LOFAR (Shimwell et al. 2019) and MeerKAT (Knowles et al.
2017). We describe the main steps of the data reduction in the
following subsections."
3.1. GMRT data analysis
"The GMRT observations listed in Table 2 were carried out using
an observing bandwidth of 32 MHz subdivided into 256 chan-
nels3. We reduced these observations with the Astronomical Im-
age Processing System (AIPS) or with the Common Astronomy
Software Applications (CASA). Regardless of the software we
used, the calibration procedure is essentially the same and it is
outlined in the following. The flux density scale was set accord-
ing to Scaife & Heald (2012). The bandpass was corrected using
the flux density calibrators. As a first step we obtained amplitude
and gain corrections for the primary calibrators in few central
channels free of radio-frequency interference (RFI); these solu-
tions were applied before determining the bandpass in order to
remove possible time variations of the gains during the obser-
vation. Once we applied the bandpass, gain solutions for all the
calibrator sources on the full range of channel were determined"
"3 Only A2104 was observed with the old GMRT setup, namely with
the simultaneous observation in two bands, the upper side band and the
lower side band, each 16 MHz wide."
"and transferred to the target source. Automatic removal of RFI
was performed either with the CASA task flagdata or with the
AIPS task RFLAG. Further manual editing of the data was per-
formed. The central channels were averaged to a smaller number
of channels each 1−2 MHz wide to reduce the size of the dataset
without introducing significant bandwidth smearing within the
primary beam. A number of phase-only self-calibration rounds
were carried out on the target field to reduce residual phase vari-
ations. A final amplitude and phase self-calibration was applied.
Wide field imaging was implemented to account for the non-
coplanarity of the baselines. In particular, we used the wpro-
jection algorithm (Cornwell et al. 2005, 2008) in CASA, while
in AIPS we subdivided the field of view in tens of facets (the
exact number of facets depending on the frequency, the reso-
lution and the presence of bright sources). Facets were imaged
separately, with a different phase centre, and then recombined.
In CASA, wide band imaging (mode=mfs, nterms=2) was also
used to consider the combination of the sources spectral index
and the frequency dependency of the primary beam attenuation.
To deal with the bright sources in the field of view that typi-
cally reduce the dynamic range of the image we adopted the so
called ‘peeling’ technique. Specifically, we obtained direction-
dependent amplitude and phase solutions for those sources and
then subtracted them out from the uv-data. We did not add the
‘peeled’ sources back into the final data, however, being typi-
cally far from the pointing centre, they are outside the portions
of images shown in the paper."
"We used the ‘Briggs’ weighting scheme (Briggs 1995) with
robust=0 throughout the self-calibration4 and we produced fi-
nal high-resolution images whose properties are listed in Table 2.
The images of the three clusters marked with an asterisks in the
column ‘telescope’ in Table 2, were severely affected by arte-"
"4 we used robust=0 both in AIPS and CASA, although we are aware
that the definition of the robust parameter is slightly different in the two
softwares."

"facts due to bright sources in the field or residual RFI. To im-
prove their quality, we processed those datasets with the Source
Peeling and Atmospheric Modelling (SPAM) pipeline, which is
extensively described in Intema et al. (2009), Intema (2014), and
Intema et al. (2017)."
"We subtracted all the compact sources from the uv-data. First
we made high-resolution images excluding the baselines sensi-
tive to the emission on scales larger than ∼ 250 kpc (uvrange<
2 − 3 klambda depending on the cluster redshift). We sub-
tracted the clean components of the sources detected in the high-
resolution images and we used the new dataset to produced low-
resolution images. These low-resolution images are more sensi-
tive to the extended low surface brightness emission and thus are"
"suitable to evaluate the presence of sources such as radio halos
or relics. Images were corrected for the primary beam response.
The uncertainty on the flux scale is estimated to be 10% (e.g.
Chandra et al. 2004)."
3.2. JVLA data analysis
"We performed the data reduction, both calibration and imaging,
of the JVLA datasets with CASA. The total bandwidth, from
1 to 2 GHz, is divided into 16 spectral windows, each with 64
channels of 2 MHz in width. In this paper we use 1.5 GHz as the
reference frequency for JVLA observations."
"Article number, page 4 of 35"

"As a first step, the data were Hanning smoothed. We ap-
plied the pre-determined antenna position offset and elevation-
dependent gain tables. The flux density scale was set according
to Perley & Butler (2013). We determined amplitude and phase
solutions for the flux calibrators in the ten central channels of
each spectral window in order to remove possible time vari-
ations during the calibrator observation. These solutions were
pre-applied to find the delay terms and to correct for the band-
pass response. We obtained the complex gain solutions for the
calibrator sources on the full bandwidth pre-applying the band-
pass and delay solutions. Finally, we applied all the calibration
tables to the target fields. Automatic RFI flagging was applied to
the target fields using the CASA task flagdata. To reduce the
size of the dataset, we averaged the 48 central channels of each
spectral window to six channels and we averaged in time with a
time bin of 15 sec.
We ran several rounds of phase-only self-calibration on each tar-
get field and a final amplitude and phase self-calibration to end
up the process. The wprojection algorithm was used to take into
account the non-coplanar nature of the array. Wide band imaging
is crucial when dealing with the 1 GHz bandwidth of the JVLA;
therefore, we used three Taylor terms (nterms=3) to take the fre-
quency dependence of the brightness distribution into consider-
ation. The imaging process involves the use of clean masks that
have been made with the PyBDSF package (Mohan & Rafferty
2015). For the self-calibration we used the ‘Briggs’ weighting
scheme with robust=0 and we made final high-resolution im-
ages whose properties are reported reported in Table 2. Then, in
order to highlight the possible diffuse emission, we subtracted all
the discrete sources with the same technique described in Sec-
tion 3.1 and we produced low-resolution images, using higher
values for the robust parameter and/or tapering down the long
baselines."
"Images were corrected for the primary beam attenuation. The
absolute flux scale uncertainties are assumed to be within 2.5%
(Perley & Butler 2013)."
4. Detection of diffuse emission
"In the next Sections, we present the three clusters hosting dif-
fuse emission whose discovery has been already reported in ded-
icated papers. We summarise the properties of these sources and
add complementary information that we obtained with our new
data. In Section 4.4 we discuss clusters hosting candidate dif-
fuse emission. In the following, the errors reported for the dif-
fuse sources take into account the uncertainty associated with
the source subtraction, when applicable (see e.g. Cassano et al.
2013)."
4.1. Abell 3888
"A3888 has a mass M500 = 6.67 × 1014M� and it is at z = 0.151.
The dynamical state of A3888 has been debated in the litera-
ture (Pratt et al. 2009; Böhringer et al. 2010; Chon et al. 2012;
Weißmann et al. 2013; Haarsma et al. 2010). Spectroscopic ob-
servations of the member galaxies reveal that they are distributed
in two subgroups, suggesting that a merger is ongoing (Shak-
ouri et al. 2016a). Our dynamical analysis, based on the mor-
phological parameters, confirms that A3888 is a merging cluster
(Section 8). A radio halo in A3888 was discovered with ATCA
observations in the frequency range 1.25 − 2.55 GHz (Shakouri
et al. 2016b). The bright radio halo is also detected in our GMRT
330 MHz image (Fig. 2) and its morphology resembles the one
described by Shakouri et al. (2016b). The radio emission of the"
"cluster is complex and characterised by the presence of many
bright sources embedded in the radio halo emission. As Shakouri
et al. (2016b) pointed out, source A5 and B are head tail mem-
ber galaxies, while source C is a background radio galaxy. Being
diffuse themselves, the subtraction of the head tail galaxies from
the visibilities is very difficult. In addition to the compact sources
detected in Shakouri et al. (2016b), we detect another patch of
emission (labelled E in Fig. 2, right panel) located north-east
of source A. The superposition between the radio contours of
A3888 and the optical DSS image in shown in Fig. 2. While
source A, B and D have clear optical counterparts, the brightest
part of E does not have a corresponding galaxy, thus it could be
a peak of the radio halo emission. We measured a total flux den-
sity of ∼ 1.29 Jy inside the contours shown in Fig.2. In order to
derive the radio halo flux density we estimated the contribution
of the sources embedded in the diffuse emission (except for the
patch E) and we subtracted their flux density from the total emis-
sion. We obtained a radio halo flux density S 330MHz = 380 ± 60
mJy. The LAS of the radio halo, measured from the 3−σ con-
tours, is 190′′ × 160′′ corresponding to a LLS of 500 kpc × 420
kpc."
"We note that the comparison between the radio halo flux den-
sity at 330 and 1400 MHz would give a very steep spectrum
(α < −1.8). However, the contribution of the sources embedded
in the radio halo is not properly addressed at either frequency and
further analysis is necessary to investigate the spectral properties
of this radio halo."
4.2. Abell 1443
"A1443 is a massive (M500 = 7.74 × 1014M�) cluster at red-
shift z = 0.27. A radio halo in A1443 has been discovered
with GMRT 330 MHz (Bonafede et al. 2015). In addition, the
authors detected a peculiar extended source, named ‘Γ-shaped’
source, and a candidate radio relic on the western side of the
cluster. While the ‘Γ-shaped’ source and the candidate relic are
well detected in our GMRT 610 MHz image (not shown here),
the radio halo is only marginally visible. We reduced archival
JVLA 1.5 GHz observations of A1443, the contours are shown
in Fig. 3 (white) and are overlaid on the X-ray Chandra im-
age of the cluster. Also at 1.5 GHz, the radio halo is only vis-
ible as patches of diffuse emission. We subtracted the compact
sources from the uv-data and we re-imaged this field at very
low-resolution (∼1 arcmin) to increase the possibility of imag-
ing the diffuse emission. The low-resolution contours are shown
in cyan in Fig. 3. Although the western part is most likely asso-
ciated with the residuals of the two extended sources that are
particularly challenging to subtract, we are confident that the
central part of the diffuse emission belongs to the radio halo.
We estimated the flux density of the halo in a region that does
not include the two extended sources on the west. The radio
halo flux density is S 1.5GHz = 3.5 ± 0.10 mJy, corresponding
to P1.4GHz = (9.1 ± 0.25) × 1023 W/Hz. A1443 has been recently
observed with LOFAR at 144 MHz as part of LoTSS (Shimwell
et al. 2019). A multi-frequency study including the reanalysis of
the 330 MHz GMRT data and the combination with LOFAR data
is ongoing and will be presented in a future paper (Cuciti et al.,
in prep.)."

4.3. PSZG139.61+2420
"PSZG139.61+2420 (PSZG139, hereafter) is a low-entropy cool
core cluster (Giacintucci et al. 2017) with some trace of dynam-
ical disturbance. Indeed, the X-ray morphology is slightly elon-
gated and the centroid shift parameter has intermediate value be-
tween merging and non-merging systems. The mass of PSZG139"
"is M500 = 7.09×1014M� and the redshift is z = 0.27. Two GMRT
610 MHz observations are available for this cluster. Their com-
bination has been presented in Savini et al. (2018) and Giacin-
tucci et al. (2019). We detected three faint discrete sources at the
cluster centre, which blend with a diffuse component in the low-
resolution image. We classified such a diffuse component as a
mini halo (Giacintucci et al. 2019)."
"PSZG139 has been also observed with LOFAR at 144 MHz.
In the LOFAR image the mini halo is surrounded by a larger-
scale diffuse component with an estimated spectral index steeper
than α = −1.7 (Savini et al. 2018). The coexistence of a mini
halo in the cool-core with a larger scale, steep spectrum emis-
sion, may be the consequence of a minor merger. Diffuse emis-
sion with similar properties has bee recently found also in the
galaxy cluster RXC J1720.1+2638 (Savini et al. 2019)."
"In Fig. 4 we present the JVLA 1.5 GHz C array high-
resolution image of the central region of PSZG139 compared to
the low-resolution GMRT 610 MHz contours (from Giacintucci
et al. 2019). At a similar resolution, the mini halo appears less
extended towards the west at high frequencies. We subtracted
the discrete sources from the uv-data and we estimated the flux
density of the mini halo in the same region used for the GMRT
image (3−σ contours shown in Fig. 4). We obtained a flux den-
sity of the mini halo S 1.5GHz = 0.60 ± 0.05 mJy, in agreement
with the value measured with GMRT 1.28 GHz observations by
Giacintucci et al. (2019)."

"this cluster is rather sparse. According to the morphological
analysis of the X-ray surface brightness distribution (Section
8), we find that Z2120 sits in the intermediate region between
merging and relaxed clusters. In fact, the X-ray emission of this
cluster is fairly peaked at the centre, but there is a low-surface
brightness ‘tail’ extending to the south-west, suggestive ongoing
dynamical activity (Fig. 5, right panel)."
"The JVLA D array image of Z2120 is shown in Fig. 5
(left panel). In addition to the three compact sources (labelled
A, B and C) in the cluster central region, we detected some
faint diffuse emission extending towards south-west. The source-
subtracted low-resolution image (Fig. 5, right panel) shows some
faint residual emission elongated in the NE-SW direction which,
interestingly, follows the X-ray emission of the cluster, espe-
cially in the southern area. We note that, while the radio emission
on top of the peak of the X-ray emission may be partly due to
some residuals from the subtracted sources, the emission coin-
cident with the low-surface brightness south-west X-ray tail is
not affected by subtraction. The residual flux density measured
within the 3−σ contours of Fig. 5 (right panel), considering also
the emission in the central region of the cluster, is S 1.5GHz ∼ 7.7
mJy. We classify this emission as a candidate radio halo."
"We reduced an archival GMRT 330 MHz observation of
Z2120 (P.I. C. Jones) with the SPAM pipeline and then we im-
aged the processed data with CASA. Only some patches of dif-
fuse emission are visible in the cluster central region on the
high-resolution image (∼ 10′′, Fig. 6, left panel). In the source-
subtracted low-resolution image (Fig. 6, right panel) a residual
emission of ∼ 46 mJy is detected at low significance level. Re-
markably, this emission is spatially coincident with the one de-
tected at higher frequency, thus supporting the idea of a low
surface brightness emission associated with the perturbed ICM.
Given the low signal to noise ratio of the detection at both fre-
quencies it is difficult to obtain a solid spectral information."
4.4.2. Abell 3041
"Abell 3041 is at redshift z = 0.23 with mass M500 = 6.12 ×
1014M�. An X-ray Chandra observation of A3041 is available
in the archive. Although it is very shallow (exposure time 9 ks),
we processed and used it to derive the morphological parame-
ters, which place A3041 in the merging region of the morpho-
logical diagrams (Section 8). In Fig. 7 (left panel) we show a
deeper XMM-Newton observation that better highlights the dis-
turbed morphology of the cluster."
"The cluster hosts two central radio sources, which are
blended at the resolution of our C array observation (∼ 10′′).
Their overall flux density is 105±3 mJy. Both have optical coun-
terparts in the DSS optical image (Fig. 7, left panel). There is no
available redshift for the brightest one, while the fainter one is
associated with a member galaxy (Colless et al. 2003). On the
eastern side of the cluster there is an FRII radio galaxy extend-
ing over ∼ 5.8 arcmin. The nucleus is located ∼ 5.5 arcmin from
the centre of A3041, and no spectroscopic redshift is available
for this source. The host galaxy is detected in the 2 MASS cata-
logue (Skrutskie et al. 2006), with a K magnitude of 15.62. Us-
ing the K − z relation by Willott et al. (2003) we estimated that
the redshift of the FRII galaxy is z = 0.42±0.16, suggesting that
it may be a background giant radio galaxy extending over almost
2 Mpc."
"We subtracted all the discrete sources from the dataset, ex-
cept for the FRII galaxy. We paid special attention to the subtrac-
tion of the two central sources. In particular, we did not adopt
the usual approach described in Section 3.1, but we subtracted
a model made using the whole uv-range. In this way, we made
sure that, if there is some faint extended radio emission associ-
ated with the central sources, it is subtracted from the data that
we then use to produce the low-resolution image, shown in Fig.
7 (right panel). A residual emission of ∼ 4 mJy is present at
the cluster X-ray peak, mostly detected at the 2−σ level only.
The spatial coincidence between the thermal and non-thermal
emission may suggest that these residuals belong to a cluster dif-
fuse radio source. However, the detection is marginal and we are
aware that even a small calibration error around the bright cen-
tral source might leave some residuals showing up in the low-
resolution image. We thus consider A3041 as a case of candidate
diffuse emission."
4.4.3. Abell 402
"Abell 402 is a massive (M500 = 7.21× 1014M�) cluster of galax-
ies at z = 0.32. Its temperature within R2500 measured on the
[0.7–7] keV band excluding the central 70 kpc region is 8.0+1.1"
"−0.9
keV (Cavagnolo et al. 2008; Giacintucci et al. 2017). Although
the X-ray morphology of the cluster is fairly regular and peaked
at the center, the central entropy floor of A402 is relatively high
(K0 = 156 ± 25 keV/cm2, Cavagnolo et al. 2009; Giacintucci
et al. 2017) suggesting that it does not possess a cool core and
some sort of dynamical activity may be taking place in this clus-
ter."
"There are two archival GMRT 330 MHz observations avail-
able for this cluster (Obs No: 6153, P.I.: G. Macario and Obs
No: 6837, P.I.:A. Bonafede). Both have been processed with the
SPAM pipeline and both show evidence of diffuse emission at
the cluster center. From the combination of the two images, Gi-
acintucci et al. (2017) classified the diffuse emission in A402 as
a candidate radio halo. The images of A402 are shown in Fig. 8.
On the left panel we show the GMRT 330 MHz high-resolution
contours from Obs No 6153. There are several diffuse sources"

4.5. Radio diffuse emission in the full sample
"The observational campaign carried out during this work has en-
abled the completion of the radio information of our sample. In
summary, among the 75 clusters presented in Table 1, there are:
28 (∼ 37%) radio halos, ten of which are USSRHs or candi-
date USSRHs; seven (∼ 10%) radio relics, five of which in clus-
ters with radio halos (already counted above); 11 (∼ 15%) mini
halos, two of which show steep spectrum emission on a larger
scale; five candidate radio halos and one candidate mini halo
(∼ 8%); 31 (∼ 41%) clusters without central diffuse emission
(two of which host relics, already counted above)."
5. Non-detections and upper limits
"Among the 31 clusters of the sample without radio halos, 17 have
been analysed in this paper (Table 4). High-resolution images of
fields of ∼ 10′ × 10′ centred on the cluster centre are shown in
Appendix A. To extract quantitative information from the non-
detection of radio halos in it is crucial to derive meaningful upper
limits to the diffuse flux density of those clusters. Due to the bad
quality of four of the datasets listed in Table 4, in the following,
we will derive upper limits for 13 clusters. The issues related
to these four clusters will be briefly discussed at the end of this
section. We adopted the method of injecting mock radio halos
6 While this paper was in preparation, Giovannini et al. (2020) classi-
fied the diffuse emission in A402 as a radio halo, using a short JVLA
observation (25 minutes in C array and 10 minutes in D array), however
the concerns about the possible contamination from the discrete sources
apply also in this case."
"in the uv-datasets. The injection technique was introduced in the
GMRT Radio Halo Survey (Brunetti et al. 2007; Venturi et al.
2007, 2008; Kale et al. 2013, 2015) and it has been used in the
literature since then (Dallacasa et al. 2009; Russell et al. 2011;
Bonafede et al. 2017; Johnston-Hollitt & Pratley 2017; Cuciti
et al. 2018)."
"In this work, following Bonafede et al. (2017), we modelled
the radio halo brightness profile with an exponential law in the
form:"
"I(r) = I0e
−"
"r
re , (1)"
"where I0 is the central surface brightness and re is the e-folding
radius (Orrú et al. 2007; Murgia et al. 2009). In order to in-
ject Megaparsec scale radio halos, as reference we used re =
500 kpc/2.6 = 192 kpc, where 2.6 is the median value of
the quantity RH/re for the radio halos studied by both Mur-
gia et al. (2009) and Cassano et al. (2007) (Bonafede et al.
2017). In particular, RH is calculated, in Cassano et al. (2007), as

"√
Rmin × Rmax, where Rmin and Rmax are the minimum and"
"maximum radii of the 3−σ surface brightness isocontours.
For each cluster, we chose a region in the image, close to"
"the pointing center and void of sources and clear noise pattern
and we created a set of mock radio halos with different inte-
grated flux densities, centred on that region. We added the mod-
elled radio halos to the datasets and, for each modified dataset,
we followed the same procedures described in the previous sec-
tions to produce images optimised for the detection of the ex-
tended emission. For a given cluster mass, we started injecting
a mock radio halo that would lie on the radio power–mass cor-
relation from Cassano et al. (2013) and we reduced the injected
flux density until the injected radio halo appeared just as some
positive residuals leading to the ‘suspect’ of diffuse emission.
More quantitatively, we stop when the largest linear scale (2−σ
contours) of the recovered halo is ∼ 2 × re, implying that only"

"∼ 30% of the injected flux has been recovered, in line with the
approach used in Bonafede et al. (2017) and Cuciti et al. (2018).
The injected flux density corresponding to this marginal detec-
tion can be considered as the upper limit for that particular clus-
ter. We did not inject the mock radio halo at the cluster cen-
tre because the possible presence of some weak residual emis-
sion in the cluster field may favour the detection of the mock
radio halo, biasing our upper limit towards lower values. Fur-
thermore, faint cluster radio galaxies below the detection limit
of our observations may contribute to a positive plateau in the
cluster field (e.g. Farnsworth et al. 2013; Cuciti et al. 2015). An
example of the injection procedure is shown in Fig. 9 for the
cluster A220: the original image is in the upper left panel and
a series of fake radio halos with decreasing flux densities is in
the other panels. As a sanity check, we fitted the surface bright-
ness radial profile, with the technique described in Section 6, of
an injected mock halo. In particular, we focused on A2104 and
we injected a mock halo with flux density 70 mJy and re = 150
kpc (I0 = 4.3 µJy/arcsec2). We obtained re = 147 ± 15 kpc and
I0 = 3.4 ± 0.4 µJy/arcsec2 as best fit parameters. We repeated
this test with flux densities in the range 50-70 mJy and re in the
range 100-192 kpc, obtaining a discrepancy of ∼ 15% at most
with respect to the injected values."
"We applied this procedure to the 17 clusters listed in Table 4.
We scaled the upper limit to 1.4 GHz, assuming a spectral index
α = −1.3, for clusters with GMRT 330 or 610 MHz data only
(Table 4). In general, the possibility to place deep upper limits is
related to the quality of the images in terms of sensitivity, den-
sity of the inner uv-coverage and presence of bright sources with
residual calibration errors. In line with the results from Venturi
et al. (2008), we found that the presence of radio halos with flux
densities & 10 mJy can be safely established with GMRT 610
MHz observations, while injected radio halos of 5-10 mJy ap-"
"pear in the images as positive residuals that would lead to the
suspect of diffuse emission and can be thus considered as upper
limits. The values of the upper limits obtained with the JVLA
range from 2 to 5 mJy."
"Unfortunately, we were not able to derive reliable upper lim-
its for four clusters: RXC J0510.7-0801, RXC J1322.8+3138,
A1437 and Zwcl1028.8+1419. The GMRT 610 MHz and 240
MHz images of RXC J0510.7-0801 are affected by the presence
of a strong radio source in the field, whose sidelobes cross the
cluster field even after several runs of self-calibration and peel-
ing (Kale et al. 2015, see also Fig. A.15). The field of RXC
J1322.8+3138 is dominated by an FRII radio galaxy extending
over ∼ 11.5′ close to the cluster region (Fig. A.11). This source
limited the possibility of producing sensitive low-resolution im-
ages. A lot of editing was needed for the datasets of A1437
and Zwcl1028.8+1419, especially at the short baselines; this,
combined with the relatively high noise level of the images,
did not allow a useful upper limit to be derived. We observed
Zwcl1028.8+1419 with LOFAR and RXC J1322.8+3138 has
been observed with LOFAR as part of LoTSS. We carried out
a preliminary analysis of these observations and we anticipate
that they do not suggest the presence of clear diffuse emission
on the cluster scale."
6. Surface brightness radial profile
"Following the approach described in Murgia et al. (2009), we
derived the azimuthally averaged surface brightness radial pro-
file for the confirmed radio halos in our sample, and we fitted
them with an exponential law in the form (1) in order to derive
the central surface brightness, I0, and the e-folding radius, re. To
do that, we used low-resolution source-subtracted images, con-
volved with a Gaussian circular beam. In case the image contains"

"diffuse sources that cannot be properly subtracted we masked
them (see e.g. the case of A2744 in Fig. B.5, where the radio
relic has been masked) and we did not consider the masked pix-
els when calculating the surface brightness. We averaged the ra-
dio brightness in concentric annuli, centred on the peak of the
image (Fig. 10, right panel). The width of the annuli was chosen
to be half of the FWHM of the beam of the image. We con-
sidered only annuli with an average surface brightness profile
higher than two times the rms noise of the image. We note that
the estimated fitting parameters differs only marginally (< 5%)
if we consider only annuli with an average surface brightness
profile higher than three times the rms noise of the image. We
first generated a two–dimensional model using eq. (1) with the
same size and pixel size of the radio image and we convolved it
with a Gaussian with the FWHM equal to the beam of the image.
Then, we azimuthally averaged the exponential model with the
same set of annuli used for the radio halo. The one-dimensional
surface brightness profile of the two-dimensional exponential"
"model (convolved with the beam) is our fitting model (see e.g.
the black line in Fig. 10), which takes into account the resolution
of the image and the uncertainties associated with the sampling
of the radial profile. We show the radial profile of the radio halo
in A2163 with the best fit model in Fig. 10, the others are shown
in Appendix B."
"This method is based on the assumption that radio halos
have a central peak and then the brightness decreases with in-
creasing distance from the centre. This assumption is valid for
most of the radio halos in our sample, however, ten radio ha-
los (Z0104, R2003, A520 and A1351, A3411, R1514, A1300,
A1132, A2142, A1443) clearly have multiple peaks, We did not
include these radio halos in the analysis of the radial profiles.
Moreover, we excluded four radio halos for which we do not
have suitable source subtracted images (A1451, A3888, A2261,
A1689). Thus, we derived and fitted the radial surface brightness
profile of the 14 radio halos listed in Table 3. These radial pro-
files, together with the set of annuli used to derive them and the"

7. X-ray data analysis
"In this Section we describe the analysis of the dynamical prop-
erties of the clusters of our sample. Among the 75 clusters of
the sample, 63 have archival X-ray Chandra data. 54 of them al-
ready have literature information on their dynamical status (Cas-
sano et al. 2010, 2013, 2016; Cuciti et al. 2015). We produced"
"and analysed the Chandra images of the remaining nine clusters
(marked with"
"√
in Tab.5). Chandra X-ray data were processed"
"with CIAO 4.5 using calibration files from CALDB 4.5.8. Stan-
dard techniques to correct time-dependent issues were applied7,
the screening of the events file was applied to filter out strong
background flares, cosmic rays and soft protons. We identified
point sources with an automatic algorithm and we removed them
from the images. Images were normalised for the exposure map
of the observation."
"Following Cassano et al. (2010, 2013) and Cuciti et al.
(2015), we produced Chandra images in the 0.5-2 keV band and
we analysed the X-ray surface brightness inside an aperture ra-
dius Rap = 500 kpc, centred on the cluster X-ray peak. 500 kpc is
the typical radius of radio halos, in this way we evaluate the mor-
phological properties of clusters within the region where energy
is most likely dissipated and generates synchrotron emission. To
provide a quantitative measure of the level of dynamical distur-
bance of the clusters, we used three methods, widely used in the
literature to investigate the dynamics of cluster: the power ratios,
P3/P0 (e.g. Buote & Tsai 1995; Jeltema et al. 2005; Ventimiglia
et al. 2008; Böhringer et al. 2010; Cassano et al. 2016; Lovisari
et al. 2017), the centroid shift, w (e.g. Mohr et al. 1993; Poole
et al. 2006; O’Hara et al. 2006; Ventimiglia et al. 2008; Maughan
et al. 2008; Böhringer et al. 2010; Cassano et al. 2016; Lovisari
et al. 2017) and the concentration parameter, c (e.g. Santos et al.
2008; Parekh et al. 2015; Cassano et al. 2016; Rossetti et al.
2017). The power ratios represent the multipole decomposition
of the mass distribution within the aperture radius. We only used
the third moment, P3/P0, which is sensitive to the presence of
substructures indicating ongoing dynamical activity (Böhringer
et al. 2010). The centroid shift, w, is defined as the standard devi-
ation of the projected separation between peak and the centroid
of the X-ray emission. The concentration parameter is the ratio
between the surface brightness inside the central region (100 kpc
radius) and the ‘ambient’ surface brightness (inside a radius of
500 kpc)."
"We refer to Cassano et al. (2010) (and references therein), for
a detailed description of the morphological parameters. Here we
just mention that, in general, relaxed clusters have high values
of c and low values of w and P3/P0. Conversely, dynamically
disturbed clusters have low values of c and high values of w and
P3/P0."
8. Dynamical properties
"In this section we characterise the dynamical properties of the
clusters of our sample on the basis of their X-ray emission. The
distributions of the morphological parameters are shown in Fig
11, both for all the clusters (black) and for two mass bins con-
taining the same number of objects (the mass separating the two
bins is M500 = 7 × 1014M�). We do not find a significant depen-
dence of the morphological parameters on the cluster mass, in
line with other recent results (Rossetti et al. 2017; Lovisari et al.
2017)."
"The most efficient way to characterise the dynamical proper-
ties of clusters is the combination of two morphological param-
eters, at least. In this Section we focus on the combination be-
tween c and w, which has been shown to be a robust approach to
distinguish between merger and relaxed clusters (Lovisari et al.
2017). Fig. 12 shows the distribution of the 63 clusters of our
sample with available X-ray Chandra data in the c − w morpho-
logical diagram. As expected, c and w are anti-correlated and the"

power ratios (bottom) distribution of the clusters with available X-ray
Chandra data. The red histogram refers to high mass clusters(M500 ≥
7 × 1014 M�), while the blue histogram refers to low mass (M500 <
7 × 1014 M�) clusters."
"level of dynamical disturbance increases going from the top left
to the bottom right corner of the diagram."
"Defining a meaningful threshold between relaxed and merg-
ing clusters in the c − w morphological diagram is not trivial
since projection effects also play a role, in particular for unre-
laxed clusters. Lovisari et al. (2017) has recently established the
dynamical status of 150 galaxy clusters from the ESZ Planck
catalogue (Planck Collaboration et al. 2011) by visually inspect-
ing their XMM-Newton images. The results of the visual inspec-
tion have been then combined with a number of morphological
parameters, including c, w and P3/P0, to determine the thresh-
old values between merging and relaxed clusters. They found
that among the clusters with a clear dynamical classification (ex-
cluding ‘intermediate’ cases) ∼ 40% are relaxed and ∼ 60% are
merging. Similar fractions have been obtained for mass-selected
samples using cool core versus non-cool core clusters as in-
dication of relaxed systems and non relaxed systems (Rossetti"
"Fig. 12. c−w morphological diagram. Filled dots are clusters classified
as merging from the visual inspection, empty dots are visually classified
as relaxed and asterisks are visually classified as intermediate. Black
lines are adapted from Cassano et al. (2010) and are c = 0.2 and w =
0.012."
"et al. 2017; Andrade-Santos et al. 2017). Unfortunately, we can-
not simply adopt the threshold found in Lovisari et al. (2017)
because the parameters are measured within different apertures.
Still, we note that the classification of merging and relaxed clus-
ters based on the lines derived by Cassano et al. (2010) to sep-
arate radio halo and non-radio halo clusters provides similar re-
sults. Indeed ∼40% of our clusters lie on the upper left panel
of Fig. 12. This suggests that, although those lines were not de-
rived to distinguish merging from relaxed clusters, they still give
reasonable statistical information on the dynamical status of the
clusters. Such classification of all the clusters of our sample,
based on these lines is reported in Table 5."
"In addition, following Lovisari et al. (2017), we visually clas-
sified each cluster on the basis of the X-ray Chandra image (Ta-
ble 5, column 6). In particular, we identified three classes of
clusters marked with ‘M’, ‘int’ or ‘R’ in Table 5. ‘M’ represents
clusters where the distribution of the X-ray surface brightness
and the presence of pronounced substructures clearly indicates
merging activity, ‘R’ represents relaxed clusters with circular X-
ray morphology and peaked cores, while ‘int’ indicates interme-
diate cases, where the morphology is fairly regular, sometimes
with a peaked core, but with substructures or features in the X-
ray distribution indicating a more complex situation. The two
methods of classification are consistent for clusters lying at the
opposite corners of the c − w morphological diagram. Although
the visual classification is subjective, we noted that, among fairly
relaxed clusters, there are some systems showing minor distur-
bances that may not be caught by morphological parameters.
These might be minor mergers, to which the cool core survives,
but the X-ray distribution shows edges or irregularities. Alter-
natively, there may be signatures of disturbance on larger scales
with respect to the radius adopted to measure the parameters,
such as sub-clumps in the cluster outskirts."

"Among the 12 clusters of our sample without available Chan-
dra data, ten have archival XMM-Newton data. We did not derive
morphological parameters for the clusters observed only with
XMM-Newton, to avoid introducing biases due to the different
PSF and effective area compared to Chandra. We classified the
dynamical status of these clusters by visually inspecting their
XMM-Newton images and we report these classifications in the
bottom panel of Table 5. We could not infer the dynamical status
of the two clusters without pointed X-ray observations."
9. The full sample: Summary and conclusions
"In this paper we built the largest mass-selected sample of galaxy
clusters with deep radio observations available to date. It is made
of 75 clusters with z = 0.08 − 0.33 and M500 & 6 × 1014 M� se-
lected from the Planck SZ catalogue (Planck Collaboration et al.
2014). Thanks to the radio data analysis described in Sections
3, now each cluster of the sample has at least one pointed ob-
servation from which we have information about the possible
presence of radio diffuse emission."
"Beyond the statistical value of this work, the large amount
of radio data analysed led to the discovery of new radio halos,
mini halos and candidate diffuse sources in clusters (Section 4).
In particular, A1451 and Z0634 host radio halos (Cuciti et al.
2018) and PSZG139 host a mini halo surrounded by steep spec-
trum large scale emission (Savini et al. 2018). We found candi-
date radio halos in Z2120, A3041 and a conservatively claimed
a candidate mini halo in A402. Furthermore, we followed up the
known radio halos in A3888 and A1443 at different frequencies."
"For clusters without any hint of diffuse emission in our ob-
servations we used the injection technique to derive upper limits
to their diffuse flux (Section 5)."
"The great majority of the clusters of this sample have X-
ray Chandra data. We analysed those data to derive informa-
tion about the dynamical state of clusters (Section 7). According
to the morphological classification based on the combination of
centroid shift and concentration parameter, ∼ 40% of the clusters
of our sample are relaxed and ∼ 60% are merging, in line with
other recent results (Lovisari et al. 2017; Rossetti et al. 2017;
Andrade-Santos et al. 2017). In addition, we visually inspected
all the Chandra images and the XMM-newton images of clus-
ters without Chandra data to give an independent classification
of the dynamical status of clusters."
"The properties (coordinates, redshift, M500, R500, radio clas-
sification and radio power at 1.4 GHz) of the clusters of the sam-
ple are listed in Table 1. Radio powers in Table 1 are calculated
at 1.4 GHz and are k-corrected. When α is unknown, we assume
α = −1.3."
"We summarise below the diffuse sources present in our sam-
ple (references are given in Table 1):"
"– 28 (∼37%) clusters host radio halos, ten of which are USS-
RHs or candidate USSRHs"
"– seven (∼10%) clusters have radio relics, five of which also
have radio halos (and have been also counted among radio
halos above), and two of which are without radio halos"
"– 11 (∼15%) clusters have mini halos
– 31 (∼41%) clusters do not show any hint of central diffuse"
emission at the sensitivity of current observations 8
"Moreover, we found candidate diffuse emission in six clus-
ters, one is a candidate mini halo and five are candidate radio
8 The two cluster with radio relics but without radio halos (A115 and
A2345) are among these 31 clusters."
"halos. Combining our results (Section 5) with the work done by
Venturi et al. (2008), Kale et al. (2013) and Kale et al. (2015)
for the GMRT Radio Halo Survey and Bonafede et al. (2017) we
have upper limits for 22 clusters. Being obtained with similar
techniques (Section 5), the upper limits from the literature are
comparable with those derived in this work. The statistical anal-
ysis of the properties of radio halos in this sample, including the
radio power-mass diagram, the radio emissivity-mass diagram,
the radio halo-merger connection, and the occurrence of radio
halos will be presented in paper II.

Appendix B: Radio halo surface brightness radial profiles
"The properties of the radio images used to derive the surface brightness radial profiles shown in Fig. B.1–B.12 are listed in Table
B.1. We analysed 1.4 GHz data from the VLA archive for the clusters marked with an asterisk in the column ’Reference’ of Table
B.1, that is to say, A773 (project AF349), A665 (AG690, AF304), A209 (AG639), A2218 (AG344), A2744 (AF349) and A2219
(AF367, AF372). Each field was observed with both the C-array and D-array configurations. We calibrated each configuration
dataset separately using AIPS, following the standard calibration scheme, with amplitude and phase calibration carried out using
the primary and secondary calibration sources. The flux density scale was set using the Perley & Butler (2013) coefficients. We
applied phase-only self-calibration to each dataset and produced the final images using the multi-scale CLEAN algorithm in the
IMAGR task. After self-calibration, we combined the C- and D-configuration data into a single dataset for each cluster. A final cycle
of phase-only self-calibration was applied to the combined datasets to improve the quality of the final images."
"For each cluster, we first identified the discrete radio sources in (or projected onto) and around the cluster region using the higher-
resolution images from the C-array datasets alone. We subtracted the discrete sources from the uv-data using the same procedure
outlined in Section 3.1 and used the resulting datasets to obtain images of the diffuse radio emission at low-resolution using the
multi-scale CLEAN. The angular resolution and noise levels of our final radio halo images are listed in Table B.1."
