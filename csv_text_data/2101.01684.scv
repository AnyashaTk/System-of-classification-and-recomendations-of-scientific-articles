"We present measurements of the E-mode (EE) polarization power spectrum and temperature-
E-mode (TE) cross-power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background using data collected by
SPT-3G, the latest instrument installed on the South Pole Telescope. This analysis uses observations
of a 1500 deg2 region at 95, 150, and 220 GHz taken over a four month period in 2018. We report
binned values of the EE and TE power spectra over the angular multipole range 300 ≤ ` < 3000,
using the multifrequency data to construct six semi-independent estimates of each power spectrum
and their minimum-variance combination. These measurements improve upon the previous results
of SPTpol across the multipole ranges 300 ≤ ` ≤ 1400 for EE and 300 ≤ ` ≤ 1700 for TE, resulting
in constraints on cosmological parameters comparable to those from other current leading ground-
based experiments. We find that the SPT-3G dataset is well-fit by a ΛCDM cosmological model
with parameter constraints consistent with those from Planck and SPTpol data. From SPT-3G
data alone, we find H0 = 68.8 ± 1.5 km s−1 Mpc−1 and σ8 = 0.789 ± 0.016, with a gravitational
lensing amplitude consistent with the ΛCDM prediction (AL = 0.98 ± 0.12). We combine the
SPT-3G and the Planck datasets and obtain joint constraints on the ΛCDM model. The volume
of the 68% confidence region in six-dimensional ΛCDM parameter space is reduced by a factor of
1.5 compared to Planck -only constraints, with only slight shifts in central values. We note that
the results presented here are obtained from data collected during just half of a typical observing
season with only part of the focal plane operable, and that the active detector count has since nearly
doubled for observations made with SPT-3G after 2018."
I. INTRODUCTION
"The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a rich
source of information about the early universe and
its evolution over cosmic time. Density fluctuations
present during the epoch of baryon-photon decoupling
at z ∼ 1100 imprint a faint temperature anisotropy
on the CMB, and measurements of the angular power
spectrum of these anisotropies are a pillar of the standard
six-parameter ΛCDM cosmological model. Satellite
measurements of the CMB temperature power spectrum
are now cosmic variance-limited from the largest angular
scales down to roughly seven arcminutes [1] (correspond-
ing to angular multipoles ` . 1600), and ground-based
observations extend these measurements to arcminute
scales, at which point foregrounds begin to dominate over
the primary CMB temperature signal [2, 3]."
"The CMB anisotropies are linearly polarized at the
10% level as a result of local quadrupole fluctuations at
the surface of last scattering [4]. The linear polarization
map can be decomposed into two components: even-
parity, curl-free “E-modes” and odd-parity, divergence-
free “B-modes.” To first order, density fluctuations in
the early universe only source E-modes, while B-modes
are created by tensor perturbations, such as primordial
gravitational waves, or gravitational lensing of the CMB
by intervening large-scale structure [5–7]. In this paper
we focus on the brighter E-mode component of this"
"polarization. The E-mode (EE) polarization power
spectrum and the temperature-E-mode (TE) cross-power
spectrum can provide tighter constraints on cosmological
parameters than temperature data alone [8], and they
can be measured out to smaller angular scales on
account of the low fractional polarization of extragalactic
foregrounds [9–11], providing a powerful consistency
check of ΛCDM."
"The CMB temperature and polarization power spectra
have been measured over a wide range of angular scales
by the Planck satellite [1] and ground-based telescopes
including the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) [12],
BICEP/Keck [13], polarbear [14, 15], and the South
Pole Telescope (SPT) [16, hereafter H18] [17]. Several
current and upcoming experiments aim to improve
existing power spectrum constraints, including Advanced
ACT [18], BICEP3/BICEP Array [19, 20], polarbear-
2/Simons Array[21], the Simons Observatory [22], and
SPT-3G [23]."
"While the data are generally well-described by ΛCDM,
there are mild tensions in parameter constraints between
small and large angular scales [H18, 24, 25] and signifi-
cant tensions between CMB measurements and late-time
cosmological probes, most notably in the value of the
Hubble constant H0 [26, 27]. Upcoming measurements
of the high-` CMB power spectra may shed light on the
origin of these tensions."
"In this paper, we present the first science results from
SPT-3G, the latest survey instrument installed on the"
"South Pole Telescope [28]. We report measurements of
the EE and TE power spectra over the angular multipole
range 300 ≤ ` < 3000 from observations of a ∼1500 deg2
region undertaken during a four-month period of 2018,
and we present the resulting constraints on cosmological
parameters."
"The shortened 2018 observing season is the result of
telescope downtime at the beginning of the year due to
an issue with the telescope drive system, which caused
damage to detector readout and rendered approximately
half the focal plane inoperable. We addressed the
issue at the close of 2018 and have since seen normal
performance during the 2019 and 2020 observing seasons.
Nevertheless, the data collected during 2018 is already
sufficient to provide the most sensitive measurements
made to date with SPT over the multipole ranges
300 ≤ ` ≤ 1400 for EE and 300 ≤ ` ≤ 1700 for TE. The
resulting constraints on cosmological parameters from
the SPT-3G 2018 power spectra improve upon those set
by SPTpol [H18] and are competitive with those from
other current leading ground-based experiments [29]."
"This paper is organized as follows. We begin with an
overview of the SPT-3G instrument in §II. In §III we
discuss the scanning strategy of the telescope, low-level
data processing, and the coadded maps. In §IV we detail
the absolute calibration of the maps and the procedure
used for obtaining unbiased measurements of power
spectra. Tests for systematic error in the data collection
or processing steps are discussed in §V. The method
for obtaining constraints on cosmological parameters
from the power spectra measurements is detailed in
§VI. We present final bandpower measurements in §VII
and discuss the resulting constraints on cosmological
parameters in §VIII."
II. THE SPT-3G INSTRUMENT
"Deployed in early 2017, SPT-3G is the third survey
camera to be installed on SPT. SPT-3G is a signifi-
cant upgrade over the previous instruments, utilizing
redesigned wide-field optics to increase the field of view
from ∼1 deg2 to 2.8 deg2 and populating the 3.5× larger
focal plane area with multichroic pixels. Light rays
from the 10 m primary mirror are redirected by a 2 m
ellipsoidal secondary mirror and 1 m flat tertiary mirror
into the receiver cryostat [30], in which three 0.72 m
diameter anti-reflection-coated alumina lenses [31] re-
image the Gregorian focus onto the detectors. The
SPT-3G receiver can be divided functionally into two
cryostats that share a common vacuum: an optics
cryostat that contains the cold optical elements, and a
detector cryostat that contains the detectors and associ-
ated readout electronics. Each cryostat is cooled to 4 K
by its own dedicated pulse tube cooler, and the detectors
are further cooled to their operating temperature of
300 mK by a custom closed-cycle three-stage helium
sorption refrigerator manufactured by Chase Research"
"Cryogenics.1 With the cooling power required by the
SPT-3G instrument, the refrigerator can provide a stable
base temperature of 300 mK for approximately 17 hours
before it must be raised to 4 K for a 4.5 hour recharge
cycle."
"The 0.43 m diameter focal plane is populated with
∼16,000 transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers fab-
ricated on ten monolithic 150 mm silicon wafers. Each
detector wafer contains an array of 269 trichroic dual
linearly polarized pixels, with each pixel consisting
of a broadband sinuous antenna coupled to six TES
bolometers via superconducting microstrip and in-line
filters, which define the three observing frequency bands
centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. This pixel architecture
was originally developed for polarbear-2 and is also
used by the Simons Observatory and LiteBIRD exper-
iments [32–34]. Details of the SPT-3G detector wafer
fabrication can be found in [35, 36] and characterization
of the 2018 deployed array in [37]. The detectors are read
out using a 68× frequency-domain multiplexing system
jointly developed by the SPT-3G and polarbear-2
collaborations [38, 39]."
III. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION
A. Observations
"The main SPT-3G survey field is a ∼1500 deg2 region
extending from −42◦ to −70◦ declination and from
20h40m0s to 3h20m0s right ascension, illustrated in
Figure 1. This survey footprint also overlaps the regions
observed by the BICEP/Keck series of experiments
[13, 20]. We observe the full 1500 deg2 via four 7.5◦-
tall subfields centered at −44.75◦, −52.25◦, −59.75◦,
and −67.25◦ declination, respectively, with each subfield
covering the full RA range. These subfields are chosen
so as to maximize telescope scanning efficiency while
minimizing fluctuations in detector gain due to changes
in atmospheric loading over the course of an observation."
"As a result of the telescope’s unique location at
the geographic South Pole, there is nearly a direct
correspondence between the local coordinates of azimuth
and elevation and the celestial coordinates of right
ascension and (negative) declination, respectively. The
telescope observes each subfield in a raster pattern,
performing constant-elevation sweeps in azimuth before
making a small step in elevation and repeating. Each
sweep of the telescope across the field, referred to as a
scan, takes approximately 100 seconds to cover the full
azimuth range. The telescope performs one right-going
scan and one left-going scan at each elevation step. A full
subfield observation requires approximately 2.5 hours to
complete, and two subfields are each observed three times"

"during one observing day, defined by the combined fridge
hold and cycle time. As the survey field is constantly
above the horizon at the South Pole, the start of the
observing day is allowed to drift with respect to sidereal
time with no penalty to observing efficiency."
B. Relative Calibration
"We regularly conduct a series of calibration observa-
tions in order to relate the input power on each detector
to CMB fluctuation temperature. This conversion is
derived from observations of two Galactic HII regions
that serve as relatively compact sources of mm-wave flux,
RCW38 and MAT5a (NGC 3576). RCW38 is located
at RA: 8h59m5s Dec: −47◦30′36′′ and is used for the
two higher-declination fields, while MAT5a is located at
RA: 11h11m53s Dec: −61◦18′47′′ and is used for the two
lower-declination fields. Dense scans are taken such that
each pixel in the focal plane can form a complete map of
the source; these per-detector maps are then compared to
calibrated maps of RCW38 or MAT5a made by the SPT-
SZ experiment. During 2018, such observations of either
RCW38 or MAT5a were nominally performed once per
observing day, depending on the pair of subfields to be
observed, though in later seasons the cadence has been
relaxed to one dense observation per HII region per week."
"Temporal calibration shifts on shorter timescales are
tracked using detector response to an internal calibration
source (“the calibrator”) and much shorter (∼10-minute)
observations of the HII regions conducted before and
after each CMB subfield observation. The short HII
region observations also serve to monitor changes in
atmospheric opacity. This procedure yields a conversion"
"from input power to CMB fluctuation temperature
for every detector and every observation, subject to
statistical variations in the calibration observations and
differences in beam shapes and passbands between
SPT-3G and SPT-SZ. We expect these differences to bias
the absolute calibration by less than 10%, and we correct
for this bias by comparing fully coadded maps to Planck
(see §IV F)."
C. TOD Processing
"We apply a series of linear processing steps to the
detector time-ordered data (TOD) to decrease and
flatten the noise in the signal range, which in this
analysis corresponds to approximately 0.3–6 Hz. To
reduce computing requirements, SPT-3G data is stored
in a custom streaming file format2 that enables the
data from only one scan of the telescope to be loaded
into memory at once, and all TOD processing steps are
performed on a scan-by-scan basis. Only data taken
during the constant-velocity portion of each scan is
used, and the data taken while the telescope is changing
direction is discarded."
"To prevent high-frequency noise from aliasing down
into the signal band when binning data into map pixels,
we apply a Fourier-space filter with functional form"
"e(−`x/`0)
6"
"and low-pass cutoff `0 = 6600. The relation
between `x and temporal frequency is determined by
on-sky scanning speed and is recomputed for each scan
of the telescope. We also high-pass-filter the data to
remove the effects of slow signals, such as those caused
by atmospheric noise or thermal drifts of the detector
cold stage. To do this, we fit and subtract up to a 19th-
order Legendre polynomial from the TOD and project
out Fourier modes corresponding to angular scales below
`x = 300. During this step, TOD samples in which a
detector was pointed within 5′ of a point source brighter
than 50 mJy at 150 GHz are masked in that detector’s
TOD to prevent filter-induced ringing artifacts in the
output map."
"We apply one additional filtering step, referred to as
the common-mode (CM) filter, in which the signals from
detectors in a specified group are averaged together, and
the result is then subtracted from each of those detectors’
TOD, thereby removing any common signal. Here we use
all detectors in the same frequency band on the same
detector wafer to form the common mode, effectively
imposing a high-pass filter that removes most of the
temperature signal on scales larger than the angular
extent of a wafer (` ∼ 500) while largely preserving the
polarization signal. The TOD samples corresponding
to point sources brighter than 50 mJy at 150 GHz are
interpolated over during the CM filter to avoid creating
spurious decrements in the map."

https://github.com/CMB-S4/spt3g_software
D. Data Quality Cuts
"To prevent low-quality data from degrading a map,
detectors with abnormal behavior or properties are
flagged on a per-scan basis during TOD processing.
If a detector is flagged, its data is dropped from the
corresponding scan. Some of the lower-level reasons
to flag a detector include a failure to properly bias or
entering a fully superconducting state during an obser-
vation, poor calibration data due to noise fluctuations
or detector operational issues, and readout errors during
data acquisition. An average of 448 detectors are flagged
in each scan for such reasons. We also flag detectors
for irregular TOD features, on average removing an
additional 342 detectors per scan due to (1) abrupt, large
deviations from a rolling average, or “glitches”, with
causes including cosmic ray hits and vibrations within the
cryostat, or (2) excess line power in the 8–10 Hz range,
thought to originate from instability in the detector or
readout circuit."
"In addition to the cuts above, we do not include one
of the detector wafers in this analysis, as its TOD are
contaminated by a series of noise lines at multiples of
1.0 Hz and 1.4 Hz, the latter of which corresponds to the
frequency of the pulse-tube cooler used in the cryostat.
This wafer has been replaced for subsequent observing
seasons."
"After filtering, an inverse-variance weight wi is com-
puted for each detector based on the noise in its TOD
from 1–4 Hz. The distribution of weights is examined for
outliers, and detectors with weights three sigma above
or below the mean are flagged, removing on average
another 33 detectors from each scan. The map for a
given observation is constructed as a weighted average of
the data from all detectors (after filtering and cuts) using
this weight distribution."
"Beyond cuts on individual detectors, whole scans are
dropped from the observation data if there are errors in
the telescope pointing information or if fewer than ∼ 50%
of active bolometers pass cuts. Entire observations are
cut if there was an error with data acquisition, if all
detectors were flagged (e.g., due to a failed calibration
observation), or if the helium in the sorption refrigerator
ran out during the observation. After cutting 17
such observations, there are 562 subfield observations
remaining, with an approximate average of 6600 active
detectors equally distributed among the three frequency
bands per observation."
E. Maps
"We use the same mapmaking methodology as imple-
mented for SPTpol analyses [16, 17, 42, 43] and described
in [44], here binning the TOD into 2′ square pixels using
the Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection."
"The full-season coadded maps of temperature, Stokes
Q, and Stokes U for 150 GHz are shown in Figure 2."
"The cross-hatched patterns in the Q and U polarization
maps are indicative of measuring E-modes at high signal-
to-noise. The E-mode polarization map itself is shown
in Figure 3. The noise levels in the coadded maps are
measured by differencing two half-depth coadded maps
and calculating the power spectrum of the result, correct-
ing for the transfer function effects of the TOD filtering
described above. The map depths as a function of `
for both temperature and polarization data are shown
in Figure 4; averaged over the range 1000 < ` < 2000,
the polarized map depths at 95, 150, and 220 GHz are
29.6, 21.2, and 75µK-arcmin, respectively."
"From the 562 subfield observations, we construct
subsets of partial-depth full-field maps, or “bundles”,
that are then used as the basic inputs to the rest of the
analysis. The bundles are constructed by chronologically
coadding observations within each subfield until the
combined unpolarized weight approaches 1/(Nbundles)"
"of the unpolarized weight in the full-season coadd,
typically requiring 3–5 observations. The coadds from
each of the four subfields are then combined to create
one full-field bundle. This approach assures each bundle
has approximately equal weight and even coverage of the
field, to the extent allowed by the relatively small number
of observations. We chose Nbundles = 30 to balance total
number with uniformity across the bundles."
IV. POWER SPECTRUM
"We calculate power spectra from the maps in the flat-
sky approximation, in which we relate the Fourier wave
numbers (kx, ky) to angular multipole via |k| = `. We
rotate curved-sky Q and U , defined along the longitudes
and latitudes on a sphere, to flat-sky Q′ and U ′, defined
along the vertical and horizontal axis of a flat map, by"
Q′ = Q cos(2ψα) + U sin(2ψα)
"U ′ = −Q sin(2ψα) + U cos(2ψα) ,
(1)"
"where ψα is the angle measured from the vertical axis to
North for pixel α as defined by the map projection. The
Fourier transforms of the rotated Q′ and U ′ maps are
then used to construct the Fourier-space E-mode map
via [45]"
"E` = Q
′
` cos 2φ` + U"
"′
` sin 2φ` , (2)"
"where ` = (`x, `y) and φ` = arctan(−`x/`y)."
A. Cross-spectra
"Following prior SPT analyses, we use the pseudo-C`
method to compute binned power spectrum estimates, or
“bandpowers”, and use a cross-spectrum approach [46,
47] to eliminate noise bias. We compute cross-spectra
between pairs of bundles by first multiplying each map
by an apodization mask W, with the product denoted"

"To obtain unbiased estimates of power spectra, we
follow the MASTER algorithm [48, hereafter H02],
briefly summarized here. The power spectra of maps"

the mixing of power that results from incomplete sky
coverage."
"Following H02, we introduce the binning operator
Pb` and its inverse operation Q`b: if we write the
binned equivalent of Eq. 5 utilizing the shorthand
K``′ ≡M``′F`′B2`′ and Kbb′ ≡ Pb`K``′Q`′b′ , then an

C. Mask and Mode-Coupling
"Prior to computing their Fourier transforms, we
multiply the maps by an apodization mask W to
smoothly roll-off the map edges to zero and remove
excess power from bright point sources. The apodization
mask is generated in much the same manner as in H18,
using the same mask for all map bundles across all
frequency bands. First, a binary mask is created for
each bundle by smoothing the coadded bundle weights
with a 5′ Gaussian, then setting to zero any pixels
with a weight below 30% of the median map weight.
The intersection of all the bundle masks is then edge-
smoothed with a 30′ cosine taper. Point sources detected
above 50 mJy at 150 GHz are masked with a 5′ radius
disk (the same size mask used during TOD processing),
and the cutouts edge-smoothed with a 10′ cosine taper.
The effective area of the final mask, defined as"
"∑
W2Aα"
"where Aα = 4 arcmin
2 is the area of each pixel, is equal"
"to 1614 deg2. This area is larger than the stated survey
size as a result of the inclusion of lower-weight regions
along the map boundaries."
"Applying a real-space apodization mask, or imposing
any survey boundary, convolves the Fourier transform of
the effective mask with that of the on-sky signal, coupling
power between formerly independent `-modes. This
effect is encapsulated in the mode-coupling matrix M``′ .
Previous SPT analyses have used an analytic calculation"
"of the mode-coupling matrix in the flat-sky regime, as
derived in H02 for temperature and the Appendix of [42,
hereafter C15] for polarization (for notational simplicity
we omit the XY superscript on M``′ , though separate
matrices for TE and EE are used in the analysis). In
H18 this calculation was further verified for the input
range 0 < ` < 500 with the use of curved-sky HEALPix3"
"[49, 50] simulations.
Here we employ an alternate means of simulating"
"M``′ that additionally captures distortions due to the
map projection. A set of HEALPix skies are generated
in a similar manner as in H18, with each realization
formed from an input spectrum set to zero outside of a
selected ∆` = 5 bin; however, here the curved-sky maps
are then reprojected to our flat map projection before
applying the apodization mask. The power spectrum is
then computed in the usual manner, revealing to which
multipoles the ∆` = 5 input power has been mixed. One
full realization of the mode-coupling matrix requires 640
individual simulations to cover the range 0 < ` < 3200
in increments of ∆` = 5, and 150 such realizations are
averaged to obtain the final mode-coupling matrix M``′ ."
D. Transfer Function
"The filter transfer function F` captures the effects of
the filtering steps discussed in §III C. F` is obtained
through simulations, discussed further in §IV D 1. In
brief, a known input spectrum Cth` is used to generate
O(100s) of sky realizations and simulated TOD, to which
are then applied the same filtering steps as on the real
data. The output spectra are then compared to the input
spectra to obtain the effects of TOD filtering."
"Solving Eq. 5 for F` directly would necessitate invert-
ing M``′ , which may be ill-conditioned. Instead, we
iteratively solve for F` using the method prescribed in
H02:"

"The iterative approach is unstable for the TE power
spectrum due to zero crossings, so instead we use the
geometric mean of the TT and EE transfer functions
in the same manner as C15 and H18. For cross-
frequency power spectra, a transfer function is computed
directly for each νi × νj spectrum. The TE and EE
transfer functions for 150 GHz are shown in Figure 5,"

"with similar results found for 95 GHz and 220 GHz. The
difference between the TE and EE transfer functions
primarily arises from the CM filter, which removes large-
scale power from temperature while preserving it in
polarization. This also causes 10% differences in F`
between the three frequency bands for ` < 1000, which
diminishes to < 1% at higher multipoles."
1. Simulations
"To create the simulations used for recovering the
effect of TOD- and map-level processing on the
data, we first generate 250 Gaussian realizations of
the CMB described by the best-fit ΛCDM model
to the base plikHM TTTEEE lowl lowE lensing
Planck data set [26]. To these we add foreground
contributions using two methods. For foreground
components expected to be roughly Gaussian-distributed
(such as the thermal and kinetic SZ effects), we create
Gaussian realizations of power spectra from [51]. These
realizations are correlated between frequencies. We also
add Poisson-distributed foregrounds according to source
population models from [52] for radio galaxies and from
[53] for dusty star-forming galaxies, with polarization
fractions from [9] and flux-frequency scaling relations
from [54]. We neglect Galactic foregrounds for these
simulations, as the expected polarized power from dust
within our survey region is 1–2 orders of magnitude
smaller than the E-mode signal over the multipoles and
observing frequencies considered here (Galactic dust is
accounted for in the likelihood; see §VI). The TE power
for all simulated foregrounds is set to zero. These
simulated components are then combined in multipole
space and multiplied by a Gaussian approximation"
"of the SPT-3G beam (see §IV E), with FWHMs of
1.7′, 1.4′, 1.2′ at 95, 150, 220 GHz, respectively, before
generating real-space HEALPix sky realizations. These
noiseless mock skies are then used along with recorded
telescope pointing information from every 2018 subfield
observation to generate simulated detector TOD, which
are then processed using the same detector cuts and
filtering as applied to the real data. The resulting “mock
observations” are then bundled and analyzed in exactly
the same manner as the real data."
E. Beam
"The beam describes the instrument response to a point
source. The maps produced are a convolution of the
beam with the underlying sky, equivalently described as
a multiplication in Fourier space by the beam window
function B`. B` is estimated in a similar manner to
the composite beam analyses in [41, 42, 55], using point
sources in the 1500 deg2 field and five dedicated Mars
observations taken during 2018."
"The Mars data are convolved with a Gaussian estimate
of the telescope pointing jitter (approximately 12” rms)
derived from the fitted locations of point sources in
individual observations. The brightness of Mars produces
a high signal-to-noise beam template out to tens of
arcminutes away from the peak response; however, we
observe significant evidence for detector nonlinearity at
the peak response in the planet scans. To avoid this,
the Mars maps are first produced individually for left-
going and right-going scans, and any data taken in a scan
after Mars passes within ∼ 1 beam FWHM is masked,
as the falling edge of the beam response is most prone to
contamination from detector nonlinearity."
"The hole at the location of the peak planet response
is filled in by stitching a coadd of point sources that
has been convolved with the Mars disk. The stitching
operation simultaneously fits a relative scale and offset
between the two beam observations using an annular
region where both measurements have high signal-to-
noise. B` is then taken to be the square-root of the
azimuthal average of the 2D power spectrum of the
composite map, after correcting for the planet disk and
pixel window functions. The normalization of the beam
response is defined by the map calibration procedure
described in §IV F 1.
B` and uncertainties for the three frequencies are"
"shown in Figure 6. Over the range of multipoles relevant
for this analysis, the fractional beam uncertainty is less
than 1.5%. The beam covariance is derived from a set
of alternate B` curves produced by varying the subfield
from which the field sources are drawn, varying which of
the five planet observations is used, and sampling from
the nominal covariance of the stitching scaling and offset
parameters. The beam covariance is then added to the
bandpower covariance matrix, discussed in §IV H."

F. Absolute Calibration
1. Subfield calibration
"As this work references separate HII regions for
calibrating different halves of the survey field, we
calculate and apply a temperature calibration factor for
each subfield individually before coadding observations
from the four subfields into a single map. To set the
individual temperature calibrations, we compute cross-
spectra between our subfield temperature maps and the
Planck PR3 maps4 of the nearest frequency channel,
using 100 GHz, 143 GHz, and 217 GHz for our 95 GHz,
150 GHz, and 220 GHz bands, respectively."
"The Planck maps are mock-observed with TOD
filtering identical to the real data, though with larger
masked regions around point sources to account for the
larger Planck beam. An apodization mask with larger
point source cut-outs is applied to both the mock-Planck
and SPT maps, and the corresponding mode-coupling
matrix M"
"ps
`,`′ is used. We compute the Planck -only"
"and SPT-only power spectra using cross-spectra between
half-depth maps from the respective experiments, and we
compute the cross-spectra between the two experiments
using full-depth maps. We divide out the binned mode-
mixing matrix to account for the cut sky and source
masking, and compute the binned ratio of the power
spectra"

"The average of this ratio over 400 ≤ ` ≤ 1500 is
used to set the relative temperature calibration between
subfields. All subfield calibration factors are within . 7%
of unity, consistent with the expected accuracy of the
calibration procedure described in §III B."
"We establish uncertainties on the above ratio by com-
bining a single ΛCDM sky realization with FFP10 noise
simulations for Planck and sign-flip noise realizations for
SPT, generated by coadding real SPT-3G data maps
with random signs. We compute several similar ratios
using other combinations of Planck and SPT data to
form the cross-spectra as a data systematics and pipeline
consistency check. We find agreement to . 1% in
the ratios across different data spectra inputs over the
multipole range considered. The beam measured in this
manner also serves as cross-check of our low-` beams;
while the results are consistent with the position-space
measurement, they are less sensitive as a result of the
Planck beam size and map noise, and are therefore not
used to constrain the shape of the beam response."
2. Full-field calibration
"We determine the final calibration of the SPT-3G
temperature and E-mode maps by comparing the mea-
sured SPT-3G TT and EE power spectra to the full-sky,
foreground-corrected Planck power spectra. Note that
while the map calibration described above is expected
to be accurate at the percent level, that procedure
does not address the absolute amplitude of the Q and
U polarization maps. This motivates the EE power
spectrum comparison. While not strictly necessary, we
also adjust the temperature calibration to be based on
the power spectrum comparison for symmetry."
"We calculate calibration factors for each frequency
band for the temperature (e.g., T 95 GHzcal ) and E-mode
(e.g., E 95 GHzcal ) maps. The cross-spectra calibration fac-
tors are then TE ∝ (TcalEcal) and EE ∝ (EcalEcal). The
calibration factors are constructed based on comparing
the Planck combined CMB-only power spectra to the
SPT-3G 95×95, 150×150, and 220×220 bandpowers over
the angular multipole range 300 ≤ ` ≤ 1500 using the
Planck bin-width of ∆` = 30. We apply the SPT-3G
bandpower window functions to the unbinned Planck
spectra for this comparison. For temperature, we also
account for foreground contamination by subtracting
from the SPT-3G bandpowers the best-fit foreground
model from [3] with additional radio galaxy power from
the different point source mask threshold calculated
according to the model in [52]. The foreground
corrections are negligible for the EE spectra. We account
for the uncertainties on the bandpower measurements
in this comparison using the covariance described in
§IV H as well as the uncertainties on the Planck spectra.
We also include the correlated uncertainties in the
calibration factors due to the overall Planck absolute
calibration uncertainty (taken to be 0.25% at the map"
https://pla.esac.esa.int/
"level) and the common sample variance and Planck noise
uncertainty across the three frequencies for the EE and
TT comparisons."
"The adjustments to the Tcal factors recomputed in
this manner are all within ∼1% of unity, while the Ecal
factors, which may be thought of as the inverse of the
effective polarization efficiencies, are 1.028, 1.057, and
1.136 for 95, 150, and 220 GHz, respectively. That Ecal
is a larger correction than Tcal is to be expected, as we
do not have per-detector measurements of polarization
properties, and instead rely on the as-designed values.
We note that despite this, the polarization calibration
factors found here are of roughly the same size as those
required for SPTpol in C15 and H18, which did make use
of such per-detector polarization information."
"The calibration factors are applied to the maps before
calculation of the final bandpowers, and we include
all six calibration parameters as nuisance parameters
in the likelihood when fitting for cosmology, using
priors centered on unity and with widths based on the
calculated covariance matrix. The uncertainties on the
six calibration parameters are given alongside those of
other nuisance parameters in §VI."
G. T-to-P Leakage
1. Monopole deprojection
"Polarization data can be contaminated by leaked tem-
perature signal caused by a variety of factors, including
mismatched gain between detectors in a polarization pair
and differential beam shapes. As in C15 and H18, we
perform a monopole deprojection, in which a scaled copy
of the T map is removed from the Q and U maps.
We neglect higher-order leakage terms, as they typically
become relevant near the beam scale (` ∼ 11000), while
this analysis extends only to ` = 3000."
"In both C15 and H18, the monopole leakage coefficients
�P , where P ∈ {Q,U}, were calculated by directly
comparing the respective CTP` to C"
"TT
` over some range of"
"`, and the deprojected maps obtained via P ′ = P − �PT .
The same method used in this analysis would be biased
by the high-pass TOD filter, due to the following effect.
In the 2D Fourier plane, QQ power is oriented along the
`x and `y axes while UU power is oriented at 45"
"◦. As
the temperature signal is uncorrelated with Q and U
across the sky, the azimuthal average of the TQ and
TU correlations should be zero (i.e., at each `, the
orthogonal lobes of power in the 2D Fourier plane are
of equal magnitude but opposite sign). However, as
the telescope scanning direction is along `x, the high-
pass filter removes power from low-`x modes, leaving a
residual signal in the TQ azimuthal average that is highly
correlated with TE. As TU modes are oriented primarily
at 45◦ in the 2D Fourier plane, the loss of `x < 300 power
does not change their net-zero azimuthal average."
"To account for the correlation with TE, we fit each"
"of TQ and TU to a linear combination of TE and TT
according to:"
"CTP` = �
P,TTCTT` + �"
"P,TECTE` . (10)"
"The �P,TT coefficients are then used for monopole
deprojection in the usual fashion, while the �P,TE values
are discarded."
"Two tests of this deprojection method are performed
before application to data. First we check that the �P,TT"
"coefficients are consistent with zero in noiseless mock
observations. Then, a known amount of T -to-P leakage
is injected in the simulations to verify it can be recovered.
After passing both of these checks, we calculate the
leakage coefficients from real data, obtaining the values
in Table I. We perform the deprojection on the data,
though the resulting shift in bandpowers is entirely
negligible given the reported bandpower uncertainties.
We accordingly neglect the error on the monopole leakage
terms."

2. Leakage from the common-mode filter
"Another form of T -to-P leakage results from the
CM filter. As the polarized power is measured using
the difference in signal between orthogonally polarized
detectors, subtracting the same common mode from all
detectors should not affect the measured polarization.
However, here we have not enforced explicit pair-
differencing when making polarized maps, allowing the
polarized signal in a given map pixel to be formed from
detectors in physically distant focal plane pixels. The CM
filter generally removes a different amount of power from
two such detectors, thereby affecting the polarization
signal. While the CM filter is empirically seen to reduce
polarization noise, it also directly injects some fraction
of the ` ∼ 500 (corresponding to the angular extent of a
detector wafer) temperature power into the polarization
maps. To quantify this leakage, we mock-observe a set of
T -only simulations and measure the power leaked into
EE and TE. We find the leakage to depend on the
particular configuration of detectors used to form the
CM, differing in both sign and magnitude across the three
frequency bands, with maximum amplitudes near ` = 500
of 0.20µK2 for EE and 10µK2 for TE."
"This CM filter-induced T -to-P leakage is also present
in the simulations used to obtain the filter transfer
function. Although F` is a multiplicative correction, and
this T -to-P leakage is an additive bias, to first order F`"
"already removes this leakage; when reconstructing the
input DEE`,th from simulated D̃"
"EE
` using Eq. 5, no residual"
"bias is seen. As will be discussed in §V, realistic changes
to the input spectra used for the simulations do not
significantly affect F`, so this bias will already be reduced
to a negligible level for EE data."
"The leakage in TE is not handled so easily, however,
as FTE` is not constructed specifically from TE spectra,
but rather as the geometric mean of FTT` and F"
"EE

the data:"

"In addition to the check against varying input sim-
ulation spectra discussed below, T -only Planck maps
corresponding to the SPT-3G coverage region are mock-
observed to verify the leakage bias in TE to be expected
from the real sky, with excellent agreement found
between those results and those from the standard set
of simulations."
H. Bandpower Covariance Matrix
"The bandpower covariance matrix captures the uncer-
tainty in individual bandpowers and their correlations
as well as the correlations between different spectra
and different frequency bands. This covariance matrix
includes contributions from noise and sample variance.
We estimate the noise variance from the set of measured
cross-spectra and the sample variance from the set of 250
signal-only simulations. In a final step, the uncertainty
from the beam measurement is added."
"The calculation of the covariance matrix follows the
general procedure outlined in the Appendix of [56]. The
three frequency bands are used to form three auto-
frequency spectra and three cross-frequency spectra for
both EE and TE, giving the covariance matrix a 12×12
block structure. The estimate of the covariance is noisy
given the finite number of simulations and observations;
we therefore “condition” the covariance matrix to reduce
noise in both the diagonal and off-diagonal elements."
"For the diagonal elements, we expect a fractional
uncertainty of"
"√
2/nobs; for the 30 data bundles in this"
"analysis, this is 26%. To mitigate this, we extract the
effective number of modes in each `-bin from the signal-
only simulations detailed in §IV D 1, which allows us
to compare the poor noise variance estimates to their
expectation values. This comparison yields an estimate
of the noise spectra, which we smooth with a Gaussian
kernel and use to assemble an improved estimate of the
noise variance. We add the sample variance contribution
to the noise variance to obtain conditioned diagonals for
all covariance blocks."
"To ameliorate the noise of off-diagonal elements, we
condition the underlying correlation matrices. We
average the estimated correlation matrices of all 12 on-
diagonal blocks and inspect band-diagonal slices (i.e.,
elements the same distance away from the diagonal).
To account for the widening of the mode-coupling
matrix over the multipole range, we fit second-order
polynomials to these elements. We replace off-diagonal
elements with these fits and set elements further than
∆` > 100 from the main diagonal to zero as correlations
become negligible. The correlation matrix conditioned
in this way is then combined with the previously
calculated diagonal elements of each block to construct
the conditioned covariance matrix."
"The uncertainty from the beam measurement is added
to the bandpower covariance matrix described above
using the same procedure as in [41, 55, C15]. First, we
construct a “beam correlation matrix”"

V. TESTS FOR SYSTEMATIC ERRORS
"We perform two primary tests on the data and
analysis pipeline; the first using null tests to probe for
systematic effects in the data, and the second verifying
the robustness of the pseudo-spectrum debiasing pipeline
against changes to the input power spectrum."
A. Null Tests
"To check that the data are free of systematics above the
noise level, we perform a series of null tests, in which the
data are divided based on a possible source of systematic
error, and the groups of data are then differenced to form
a collection of null maps. The cross-spectra of the null
maps are then compared to the expected null spectrum
if that systematic were absent. The expectation spectra
are calculated using the same noiseless mock observations

sidelobe pickup by dividing the data based on
whether the Moon was above or below the horizon."
"Saturation: We test for effects of decreased array
responsivity by ordering the data based on the
average number of detectors flagged as saturated
during an observation."
"Wafer: We test for effects due to differing detector
properties by dividing the wafers into two groups
based on optical response to the calibrator and
bolometer saturation power. Separate maps for
each observation are made from the two sets of
wafers."
"With the exception of the Azimuth test, the null
tests use the same chronological bundles as used in the
cross-spectrum calculation. For the Left-Right test, each
bundle is separated into left-going and right-going scans,
and these are differenced to create the null maps. An
analogous procedure is used for the Wafer null test. For"
"the First-Second, Moon Up-Moon Down, and Saturation
tests, each observation is assigned a value based on
the susceptibility of that observation to the potential
source of systematic error, and the bundles are then
rank-ordered by the average of this value across their
constituent observations. The halves of the rank-ordered
list are then subtracted (i.e., bundle 1 from bundle 16,
bundle 2 from bundle 17, ..., bundle 15 from bundle 30)
to form the null maps. For the Azimuth test, the normal
chronological bundles would average down any potential
systematic, as the observing cadence of the telescope
effectively randomizes the azimuthal range over which
the field is observed. The observations are therefore re-
bundled according to the separation between their mean
azimuth and the azimuth corresponding to the Dark
Sector Laboratory."
"For each null test, we use the average and distribution
of all null cross-spectra to compute the chi-square
compared to the null expectation spectrum, and we then
compute the probability to exceed (PTE) this chi-square
value given the degrees of freedom. An exceedingly
low PTE or a preponderance of low PTEs indicate
the data are in larger disagreement with expectation
than random chance would allow. We perform three
checks on the collection of PTEs: (1) the entire table
of PTE values is consistent with a uniform distribution
between 0 and 1 with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test
p-value > 0.05, (2) individual PTE values are larger
than 0.05/Ntests, and (3) the combination of PTEs
in each row using Fisher’s method has a PTE above
0.05/Nrows. We neglect correlations between PTE values
when performing these tests, which has the effect of
strengthening the KS and Fisher tests while weakening
the multiple-comparisons-corrected individual PTE test.
These tests and significance thresholds were agreed upon
before looking at the collection of final PTEs to avoid
confirmation bias."
"The null test PTEs are collected in Table II. The
distribution of PTEs is consistent with a uniform
distribution with a KS test p-value of 0.76. With 36 tests
and six rows, the individual PTE threshold is 0.0014,
and the row threshold is 0.0083; although the Azimuth
test for 150 GHz EE and Wafer test for 95 GHz EE are
marginal, all of the tests pass the agreed-upon criteria,
and we conclude the listed systematics do not affect the
data in a statistically significant way."
B. Sensitivity to Cosmological Model
"Any corrections to the data based on simulations,
such as F` or additive bias corrections, should be robust
against the chosen input cosmology to the simulations.
The simulations in §IV D 1 were constructed to match the
true sky as closely as possible, so we can be confident that
the resulting simulations will yield valid results; however,
we still want to test that the pipeline is stable against
small variations to the input power spectra."
"We create an additional set of simulations with a
contrived cosmology chosen to be ∼ 5σ discrepant
with the results found in H18, with parameter values
Ωbh"
"2 = 0.02, Ωch
2 = 0.14, H0 = 61 km s"
"−1Mpc−1,
ln(1010As) = 3.12, ns = 0.9, and τ = 0.06. Additionally,
the foreground power is doubled in comparison to the
standard set of simulations. Fifty noiseless realizations
of this cosmology are supplied to the mock-observing
pipeline, and the resulting C̃` are debiased using the
transfer function and TE bias corrections derived from
the standard set of simulations. The input spectra are
recovered to well within the uncertainties on the reported
data bandpowers, and we therefore find no measurable
bias due to F` or the TEbias correction."
VI. PARAMETER FITTING AND MODELING
"We obtain cosmological parameter constraints using
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) package
CosmoMC [57].5 The theoretical CMB spectra are
calculated using camb [58]6, and are modified to account
for the effects of instrumental calibration, aberration due
to relative motion with respect to the CMB rest frame
[59], and super-sample lensing [60]. We also add terms
representing Galactic dust emission and polarized dusty
and radio galaxies."
"We parameterize the ΛCDM model as follows: the
density of cold dark matter Ωch"
"2; the baryon density
Ωbh"
"2; the amplitude of primordial density perturbations,
As, and the tilt of their power spectrum, ns, defined
at a pivot scale of 0.05Mpc−1; the optical depth to
reionization τ ; and CosmoMC’s internal proxy for
the angular scale of the sound horizon at decoupling,
θMC . For the range of angular multipoles considered
here, τ is degenerate with As. We therefore use large-
scale polarization information from Planck to inform a
Gaussian prior of τ = 0.0543 ± 0.0073 [26], and we
report constraints on the combined amplitude parameter

at 150 GHz, and αXY is the angular power dust spectral

We estimate the properties of polarized Galactic dust on
the SPT-3G 1500 deg2 field using Planck observations in
the frequency bands 100 GHz, 143 GHz, 217 GHz, and
353 GHz. We assume the aforementioned spectral energy
distribution and fit to the amplitude using the ten cross-
frequency spectra obtained from an optimal combination
of all possible half-mission map cross-spectra. Taking
into account Planck color corrections [63], pessimistic
calibration errors and assuming the Planck best fit
cosmology, we constrain the amplitude of polarized
Galactic dust to be AEE80 = 0.095 ± 0.012 and ATE80 =
0.184± 0.072, which we adopt as Gaussian priors in our
MCMC analysis. We further check that the constraints
remain stable when also fitting for βdust and αEE , the fit
values of which are in good agreement with our chosen
values."

zero, as the polarization angles are uncorrelated between
galaxies. In the baseline case, we apply Gaussian priors"

"values from [3], which we adjust for our flux cut following
the model of [52] and scale by the polarization fractions
reported by [9]. The prior width is dominated by
uncertainty in the mean squared polarization fraction,
which we conservatively double to yield 30%."
"We find that our cosmological parameter constraints
are insensitive to the details of the foreground priors,
with no significant shifts in the results when the Poisson
terms or the polarized Galactic dust amplitudes are
doubled or set to zero. We conclude that over our
multipole range the bandpowers are largely insensitive to
both of these foreground sources. The priors discussed
in this section are summarized in Table III."
"We verify that our likelihood is unbiased by analyzing
a set of 100 simulated spectra. Mock bandpowers are
created by adding random noise realizations based on
our data covariance matrix to the latest Planck best-fit
model. We use the likelihood to obtain the best-fit model
for each realization, and we find that for all cosmological
parameters, the mean of the ensemble of simulations lies
within one standard error of the input value."

multipole `eff for each `-range. The bandpowers and errors
are quoted in units of µK2. The reported uncertainties are the
square root of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix
and do not include beam or calibration uncertainties."
"We present bandpowers and uncertainties for the six
EE and TE cross-frequency power spectra, plotted in
Figure 7 and listed in full in the Appendix. The"
"bandpowers span the multipole range 300 ≤ ` < 3000,
with bin widths of ∆` = 50 for ` < 2000 and ∆` = 100
for ` > 2000. The 44 bandpowers for each spectrum are
measured with each of the six frequency combinations of
95, 150, and 220 GHz data, resulting in 528 bandpower
values in total."
"With 150 × 150 GHz alone, we measure the first
seven acoustic peaks of the EE spectrum with 3–4
bandpowers per peak and signal-to-noise ≥ 6.4 on
each bandpower. The bandpowers are sample variance-
dominated at ` < 1275 for EE and ` < 1425 for TE."
"We also construct a set of minimum-variance bandpow-
ers. Following [64], the minimum-variance bandpowers
DMV can be expressed as:"
DMV = (XᵀC−1X)−1XᵀC−1D . (19)
"Here, D and C are the multifrequency bandpowers and
covariance matrix, and X is a 528×88 design matrix,
in which each column is equal to 1 in the six elements
corresponding to a power spectrum measurement in that
`-space bin and zero elsewhere. In this construction, we
have made the simplifying assumption that the polarized
foreground power is negligible within the bandpower
uncertainties. Relative to the most-sensitive single-
frequency band, the 150 × 150 GHz bandpowers, the
minimum-variance bandpowers have uncertainties 5%–
10% smaller at ` < 1000 and 20%–30% smaller at
` > 2000."
"The minimum-variance EE and TE bandpowers and
associated errors are summarized in Table IV and plotted
in Figure 8 along with measurements from several recent
experiments. These minimum-variance bandpowers,
measured using only four months of SPT-3G data with
slightly over half the number of detectors relative to
subsequent observing seasons, are already the most con-
straining measurements made to date by an instrument
on SPT over the multipole ranges 300 ≤ ` ≤ 1400 for EE
and 300 ≤ ` ≤ 1700 for TE, and are competitive with
other current leading measurements."
B. Internal Consistency
"The minimum-variance construction above assumes
the multifrequency bandpowers are measuring the same
underlying signal and that polarized foregrounds are
negligible. We test this assumption by examining the
chi-square of the multifrequency bandpowers to the
minimum-variance bandpowers,"
"χ2 = (D −M)ᵀC−1(D −M) , (20)"
"where M = XDMV. We find a χ2 of 438.1 for 440
degrees of freedom (528 multifrequency bandpowers −
88 minimum-variance bandpowers). The PTE for this
χ2 is 0.52. If the EE and TE bandpowers are evaluated
separately, the PTEs are 0.18 and 0.71, respectively. This
indicates that the measurements from different frequency"
"bands and their cross-correlations are consistent with a
common signal, with no evidence for significant contam-
ination due to foregrounds or unmodeled systematics."
"We further investigate the internal consistency of the
SPT-3G 2018 EE/TE dataset by subdividing it and
examining the parameter constraints from each of the
seven data splits: the 95, 150, and 220 GHz auto-
frequency spectra, the ` < 1000 and ` > 1000 data, and
the EE and TE spectra individually. We quantify the
consistency of each subset with respect to the full model
by calculating the parameter-level χ2 and associated
PTEs in Table V, following the methodology of [24]:"
"χ2 = ∆pᵀC−1p ∆p, (21)"
"where ∆p is the vector of parameter differences be-
tween the full dataset and a given subset. Following
[65], Cp is the difference of the associated parame-
ter covariance matrices, whereby we account for the
correlation between the full dataset and the subset.

"findings of [72] based on SZ-clusters, we find the values

"Adding information from baryon acoustic oscillation
(BAO) measurements [73, 74] does not shift the best-
fit values of ΛCDM parameters appreciably. However,
it tightens the constraint on the density of cold dark
matter by a factor of 2.4. This translates into a refined
measurement of the Hubble constant of H0 = 68.27 ±
0.63 km/s/Mpc, which is comparable to the precision
of Planck and disfavors an expansion rate at present
day greater than 70 km/s/Mpc at 2.8σ. The constraints
on matter clustering are similarly improved through the
inclusion of BAO data by a factor of 1.6 to 0.794± 0.010
for σ8 and by a factor of 2.2 for S8 to 0.792 ± 0.018.

"From SPT-3G data alone, we constrain ns = 0.999 ±
0.019. While this is slightly higher than the Planck
result, a 1.8σ offset is not statistically anomalous,
especially when analyzed in the context of the full five-
dimensional parameter space. Nevertheless, we point
out that other ground-based CMB experiments have
observed similar trends: the constraints from SPTpol
500 deg2 and ACT DR4 lie 1.3σ and 1.1σ above the"
"Planck value, respectively [16, 29]. We explore this facet
of the data further in §VIII C."
"More generally, our results match those of other
contemporary CMB experiments. Given the small shared
sky area between SPT-3G 2018 and Planck , we neglect
correlations and quantify the difference across the five
independent ΛCDM model parameters. We obtain χ2 =
8.8, which corresponds to a PTE of 0.12 and indicates
that the two datasets are consistent."
We confirm that the SPT-3G 2018 dataset is consistent
"with the ΛCDM model by comparing the full set of
multifrequency EE and TE bandpowers to the best-
fit ΛCDM model. We quantify the goodness of fit by
calculating the associated χ2 over the 528 bandpowers,
finding χ2 = 513.0. Since nuisance parameters are
dominated by their priors, we account for the five free
ΛCDM parameters in translating this to the PTE of
0.61. Comparing the best-fit model to the EE (TE)
bandpowers individually we find χ2 = 273.2 (224.2). We
conclude that the ΛCDM model provides a good fit to
the SPT-3G 2018 dataset. The EE and TE minimum-
variance bandpowers and residuals to the best-fit model
are shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11, respectively."
B. Gravitational Lensing and AL
"Our view of the z = 1100 universe is distorted by the
gravitational lensing of CMB photons due to intervening
matter between us and the surface of last scattering. This
adds information about the low-redshift universe and
results in a smoothing of the acoustic peaks of the CMB
power spectra. The magnitude of this effect is determined
by the power spectrum of the lensing potential, which is
derived from the six ΛCDM parameters in the standard
cosmological model. When allowing for a free scaling
of the lensing power spectrum, represented by the
parameter AL [75], CMB power spectra from Planck
have shown a preference for lensing 2.8σ beyond the
ΛCDM prediction of unity with AL = 1.180 ± 0.065
[26]. H18 report an AL value below unity at 1.4σ with
AL = 0.81± 0.14."
"Introducing the lensing amplitude as a free parameter
in our analysis, the SPT-3G 2018 EE/TE dataset
produces the constraints summarized in Table VII. The
core ΛCDM model parameters do not shift appreciably,
and we report a lensing amplitude of"
AL = 0.98± 0.12. (24)
"We conclude that the SPT-3G 2018 EE/TE dataset is
consistent with the level of gravitational lensing expected
by the standard model. The reported lensing amplitude
falls within 1.5σ and 0.9σ of the aforementioned Planck
and H18 results, respectively."
C. Interpretation of Data Split Preferences
"One motivation for studying the CMB polarization
anisotropies is that comparing results from the temper-
ature and polarization power spectra yields a stringent
test of the ΛCDM cosmological model. Thus while we
did not find the parameter differences between subsets of
the SPT-3G data to be statistically significant in §VII B,
it is still interesting to examine these parameter shifts
for possible hints of physics beyond the standard cosmo-
logical model. We show the parameter constraints from"

"each data split in Figure 12. We continue to quantify the
significance of parameter shifts as introduced in §VII B,
by using the difference of the parameter covariances of
the full dataset and the given data split."
"Examining the best-fit ΛCDM parameters of the
different subsets of the SPT-3G 2018 EE/TE dataset
reveals two interesting features. First, the high-` dataset
prefers a scalar spectral index above unity, ns = 1.048±
0.031, which corresponds to a 2.0σ shift from the full
dataset. With ns = 1.053± 0.052, the EE spectra prefer
a higher scalar spectral index than the high-` dataset.
However, due to their comparatively poor constraining
power for this parameter, the EE constraint is only offset
by 1.1σ from the full dataset. The higher value of ns
lowers the combined amplitude parameter, as the two are
mildly degenerate over the limited `-range: the high-`
data prefers 109Ase"
"−2τ = 1.750 ± 0.055. These values
lie 2.0σ and 1.8σ away from the baseline constraints,
respectively. Focusing on the scalar spectral index
and the combined amplitude parameter individually, the
probability of a shift of the observed size or larger from
the full dataset constraint is 2.4% and 3.7%, respectively.
We repeat that fluctuations of this size are statistically
not uncommon, especially when viewed in the context of
the full five-dimensional parameter space."
"A raised scalar spectral index corresponds to a power
increase in the damping tail compared to intermediate
angular scales. The damping tail is sensitive to an array
of interesting physics beyond the standard model, such
as extra energy injection in the early universe. This
can be explored by allowing the number of relativistic
species at recombination, Neff , to vary from the standard
model prediction, breaking big-bang nucleosynthesis con-
sistency by changing the primordial helium abundance,
YP, or both. We explore the constraints the SPT-3G 2018
EE/TE dataset places on these ΛCDM model extensions
in a forthcoming paper."

"2 = 0.1259 ± 0.0063. These values are
2.2σ and 2.1σ away from the full dataset constraints,
respectively. Consequently, different constraints of the
Hubble constant are obtained: H0 = 76.4±4.1 km/s/Mpc"
"from the EE spectra and H0 = 65.0±2.1 km/s/Mpc from
the TE spectra. Adding BAO information regularizes
the matter density fluctuations and consequently the
Hubble constant values: EE spectra then prefer H0 =
68.7 ± 1.0 km/s/Mpc and TE spectra H0 = 67.82 ±
0.66 km/s/Mpc. While this signals that solutions to the"
"Hubble tension are difficult to achieve within the ΛCDM
model, model extensions may reconcile the discrepancy
between high- and low-redshift probes [76]."
"A different way of reconciling the matter content
inferred by EE and TE spectra, and through this their
constraints on the Hubble constant, is by allowing
for a free amplitude of the lensing power spectrum.
The matter content implies the strength of lensing-
induced acoustic-peak smoothing, which results in a mild
degeneracy between the matter density and AL. This
effect was seen in H18, where differences in constraints
on cosmological parameters to Planck were alleviated
through this model extension. Indeed, we find for
SPT-3G 2018 that the EE spectra prefer AL = 0.71"
"+0.31
−0.30"
"and the TE spectra AL = 0.99 ± 0.29, while constraints
on Ωch"
"2 are brought closer together. This is mirrored
by the Hubble constant, which is constrained to H0 =
68.1± 9.3 km/s/Mpc and H0 = 64.6± 3.9 km/s/Mpc by
the EE and TE spectra, respectively."
"Similar trends for low- and high-multipole data as well
as EE and TE spectra were reported by H18 and [29].
We compile the different Hubble constant measurements
in Figure 13. While the statistical evidence is currently
too low, if future polarization measurements amplify this
potential tension with cosmological parameters inferred
from the temperature anisotropies, these trends may
be signs for physics beyond the standard model of
cosmology."
D. SPT-3G + Planck
"The Planck dataset provides the most precise measure-
ment of the temperature and polarization anisotropies
of the CMB on large angular scales, while the SPT-3G
2018 EE/TE dataset provides sensitive information on
intermediate and small angular scales. The two datasets
thus naturally complement each other, and we may
obtain joint constraints by combining them at the
likelihood level. Given the small area shared by the two
surveys, we expect correlations to be negligible."
"We report joint constraints on ΛCDM parameters from
the base plikHM TTTEEE lowl lowE Planck and
SPT-3G 2018 EE/TE datasets in Table VI. We present
associated the 1D and 2D marginalized posteriors in
Figure 14. The inclusion of SPT-3G data does not alter
the Planck best-fit values significantly."
"We use the determinants of the ΛCDM parameter
covariance matrices as a measure of the marginalized
parameter-space volume. The ratio of the matrix
determinants for SPT-3G 2018 EE/TE combined with
Planck to Planck -alone is 0.46. This corresponds to a
reduction of the 68% confidence region in six-dimensional
ΛCDM parameter space by a factor of 1.5."
IX. CONCLUSION
"In this work we have presented the first results from
SPT-3G data. Analyzing 2018 data alone, we have pro-
duced high-precision measurements of the CMB E-mode
angular auto-power and temperature-E-mode cross-
power spectra over the multipole range 300 ≤ ` < 3000.
The reported bandpowers are the first multifrequency
EE and TE measurements produced by an instrument
on SPT, and they improve upon previous SPT mea-
surements across the multipole ranges 300 ≤ ` ≤ 1400
for EE and 300 ≤ ` ≤ 1700 for TE, resulting in tighter
constraints on cosmological parameters."
"The SPT-3G 2018 EE/TE dataset is consistent with
the ΛCDM model. Analyzing constraints from the 95,
150, and 220 GHz auto-frequency spectra, the ` < 1000
versus ` > 1000 data, and the EE and TE spectra
individually, we find no signs of significant internal
tension."
"The constraints on ΛCDM model parameters gen-
erally agree with other contemporary CMB experi-
ments. We report a value of the Hubble constant
of H0 = 68.8± 1.5 km/s/Mpc, in line with the CMB-
based measurements of Planck and ACT, as well as
TRGB-calibrated local distance ladder data. This is
in contrast with the higher values found by Cepheid-
calibrated distance ladder data and time-delay measure-
ments from gravitationally lensed quasars. However,
we note an interesting trend in CMB-based constraints
from several experiments, including our own, which have
consistently found high values of the Hubble constant
when analyzing EE polarization spectra. The current
level of tension between polarization- and temperature-
based constraints is not statistically significant, but
presents an interesting direction for further investigation.
The SPT-3G 2018 dataset constrains matter-clustering
to σ8 = 0.789± 0.016, S8 = 0.779± 0.041, which is con-
sistent with other CMB-based measurements and low-
redshift probes."
"Expanding the ΛCDM model to allow for a mod-
ified amplitude of the lensing power spectrum does
not shift parameter constraints appreciably. With
AL = 0.98± 0.12, the SPT-3G 2018 dataset is consistent
with the standard model prediction."
"By combining the SPT-3G 2018 EE/TE and Planck
datasets at the likelihood level, we mildly improve the
marginalized 1D constraints over Planck data alone. The
volume of the 68% confidence region is reduced by a
factor of 1.5 in six-dimensional ΛCDM parameter space."
"Lastly, we note that the high-precision measurements
presented in this work use only one half of one observing
season of data, which was taken with nearly half the
number of currently operating detectors not contributing.
With SPT-3G operating at its full capacity since the start
of 2019, we now have data from two full observing seasons
on disk, with combined map depths 3–4× deeper than"
