ABSTRACT
We perform consistent reductions and measurements for three ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs):
"Boötes I, Leo IV and Leo V. Using the public archival data from the GIRAFFE spectrograph on the"
"Very Large Telescope (VLT), we locate new members and provide refined measurements of physical"
parameters for these dwarf galaxies. We identify nine new Leo IV members and four new Leo V
"members, and perform a comparative analysis of previously discovered members. Additionally, we"
"identify one new binary star in both Leo IV and Leo V. After removing binary stars, we recalculate"
"the velocity dispersions of Boötes I and Leo IV to be 5.1+0.7−0.8 and 3.4
+1.3
−0.9 km s"
"−1, respectively; We"
do not resolve the Leo V velocity dispersion. We identify a weak velocity gradient in Leo V that
"is ∼4× smaller than the previously calculated gradient and that has a corresponding position angle
which differs from the literature value by ∼120 deg. Combining the VLT data with previous literature,
we re-analyze the Boötes I metallicity distribution function and find that a model including infall of"
"pristine gas while Boötes I was forming stars best fits the data. Our analysis of Leo IV, Leo V and"
other UFDs will enhance our understanding of these enigmatic stellar populations and contribute to
"future dark matter studies. This is the first in a series of papers examining thirteen UDFs observed
with VLT/GIRAFFE between 2009 and 2017. Similar analyses of the remaining ten UFDs will be"
presented in forthcoming papers.
1. INTRODUCTION
The population of known Local Group galaxies has
grown steadily in the past two decades with the dis-
covery of many new ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies
"(e.g., Belokurov et al. 2006, 2007, 2008; Bechtol et al."
2015; Koposov et al. 2015a; Mau et al. 2020). Charac-
"terized by an older stellar population, low metallicity,"
"and low surface brightness, UFDs are the most dark-"
matter dominated systems known (Simon & Geha 2007;
"Corresponding author: Sydney Jenkins, Ting S. Li"

∗ NHFP Einstein Fellow
Gilmore et al. 2007; Simon 2019) and may play a key
"role in characterizing dark matter. For instance, UFD"
central densities can be used to test dark matter mod-
"els (e.g., Calabrese & Spergel 2016) and the number of"
Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites can be used to con-
strain the mass of warm dark matter particles (Kennedy
"et al. 2014; Nadler et al. 2020). Additionally, their com-"
pactness and proximity make them ideal sites for indi-
"rect dark matter detection (e.g., Ahnen et al. 2018; Hoof"
et al. 2020).
The characteristics of individual stars within a UFD
can be used to understand the global properties of
"the galaxy (e.g., Simon & Geha 2007). For example,"
the velocities of member stars can constrain dynami-

"cal mass and dark matter content. However, due to"
"their low luminosity, many UFDs have few known mem-"
"ber stars, making it difficult to provide robust mea-"
surements of the galaxies’ key features. To better con-
"strain UFDs’ kinematic and metallicity parameters, we"
uniformly reduce and analyze archived data from the
FLAMES/GIRAFFE spectrograph on the Very Large
"Telescopes (VLT) for thirteen UFDs. In this study, we"
present our membership selection process and results
"for three UFDs: Boötes I, Leo IV and Leo V. Boötes I"
data from VLT has been previously published (Koposov
et al. 2011) and is used here to validate our data reduc-
tion and membership selection processes. Our member-
ship analysis of the remaining ten UFDs observed with
VLT/GIRAFFE will be presented in a follow-up study.
"Boötes I, Leo IV and Leo V were discovered as stellar"
overdensities in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data
"(Belokurov et al. 2006, 2007, 2008). Boötes I is one of the"
"more luminous UFDs (MV = −6.0, Muñoz et al. 2018).
Photometric studies show that Boötes I is dominated"
"by ancient metal-poor populations (Brown et al. 2014),"
and spectroscopic studies have provided insight into the
stellar kinematics and chemical abundances of Boötes I
(Muñoz et al. 2006; Martin et al. 2007; Wolf et al. 2010;
Norris et al. 2010; Koposov et al. 2011; Lai et al. 2011).
"Additionally, Koposov et al. (2011) presented evidence"
"for a two-population kinematic model, with the higher"
dispersion component concentrated closer to the center
of the dwarf galaxy. The authors suggest that this may
"reflect the UFD’s formation, which potentially involved"
the merging of several smaller populations.
Simon & Geha (2007) used medium-resolution spec-
troscopy to identify 18 members stars in Leo IV and
"found a velocity dispersion of 3.3±1.7 km s−1. A follow-
up analysis by Kirby et al. (2013) found that Leo IV has"
"a metallicity of −2.29+0.19−0.22 dex and an internal metal-
licity spread of 0.56+0.19−0.14 dex. Muñoz et al. (2018) have"
"refined calculations of Leo IV’s size (rh = 114±13 pc)
and magnitude (MV = −4.99+0.26−0.26)."
Leo V is close to Leo IV in both location and radial
"velocity, with separations of 0.3 degrees and 50 km s−1,"
respectively. These similarities have motivated inves-
"tigations into their possible relationship (e.g., de Jong"
"et al. 2010; Blaña et al. 2012)). Additionally, several"
spectroscopic studies have targeted Leo V. Walker et al.
"(2009) identified seven likely members, two of which are"
more than ten half-light radii away from Leo V’s center.
"Collins et al. (2017) found an additional five members,"
and also presented tentative evidence of a velocity gradi-
"ent (-4.1+2.8−2.6 km s
−1 per arcmin). They argue that this"
"gradient, angled toward the Milky Way center, might"
suggest that Leo V is on the verge of dissolution follow-
ing a close encounter with the Milky Way. Using their
"membership catalogue, they calculated a velocity dis-"
"persion of 2.3+3.2−1.6 km s
−1. Mutlu-Pakdil et al. (2019)"
assessed both spectroscopic studies using high-precision
"photometry, spectra, and Gaia measurements. They"
concluded that the debris stream identified by Sand
et al. (2012) is composed of background galaxies and
foreground stars and that the velocity gradient found
by Collins et al. (2017) may be due to small number
statistics.
"We locate member stars in Boötes I, Leo IV and Leo"
V using public spectroscopic data from the Very Large
Telescope (VLT). The archive data were collected with
the GIRAFFE spectrograph and FLAMES fiber posi-
"tioner. We describe the data and data reduction in §2
and perform velocity and metallicity measurements in"
"§3. The analyses in both §2 and §3 are applied to all
thirteen UFDs listed in Table 1, which were observed"
"by GIRAFFE/FLAMES between 2009 and 2017. In §4,
we identify members stars in Boötes I, Leo IV and Leo"
V. We then discuss our membership results and present
"our updated physical parameter values in §5 before con-
cluding in §6."
2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION
2.1. VLT Data
We use the publicly available data from the ESO sci-
ence archive facility1. Table 1 lists the thirteen UFDs
that were observed by FLAMES/GIRAFFE (Pasquini
et al. 2000) between 2009 and 2017 using the LR8
grating and covering the wavelength range from 8206
"- 9400 Å at a spectral resolution of R ∼ 6, 000. Most of
these data were unpublished at the start of this project."
"Notably, Boötes I spectroscopy was presented by Ko-"
"posov et al. (2011), and we use it here to validate our
results.2 For most UFDs, one field was observed repeat-"
edly to obtain the desired signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)
and detect binaries.
We uniformly reduce the data and calculate radial ve-
locity and metallicity measurements for all UFDs listed
"in Table 1. In this paper, we only perform membership"
"selection for Boötes I, Leo IV and Leo V. We use 21 ex-"
"posures of Boötes I, with 20 exposure times between 45"
and 58 minutes and one exposure time of 27 minutes.
Boötes I observations took place between February and
March 2009. We use 17 exposures of Leo IV of approxi-
mately 45 minutes each. These observations took place
"1 https://archive.eso.org/eso/eso archive main.html
2 Fritz et al. (2019) also used the archived VLT data to study"
"several UFDs. A comparison with their measurements will be
discussed in a future paper."

in two groups approximately eight months apart (May

"larly use 17 exposures of Leo V, all of approximately 45"
minutes. These observations took place in two groups
approximately seven months apart (July 2011 and Jan-
uary to March 2012).
2.2. Data Reduction
We reduce the raw science data associated with the
studies listed in Table 1 using the GIRAFFE Gasgano
"pipeline3, which provides bias subtraction, flat-fielding,"
wavelength calibration and 1D spectral extraction. To
minimize the fiber-dependent radial velocity offsets ob-
"served in Koposov et al. (2011), the resulting spectra"
from each exposure are re-calibrated using sky emission
lines from Hanuschik (2003). A total of 12 relatively
strong and isolated sky lines between 8340 Å and 8950
Å are used in this re-calibration. We fit a linear relation
between the measured wavelength λ′ and the literature
value of the sky emission lines λ:
"λ′ − λ
λ"
"c = a1 ×
λ− 8600Å"
"200Å
+ a0 (1)"
"where c is the speed of light, a0 is the shift in km s
−1 at"
"8600 Å (zero-order shift), and a1 is the shift for every"
200 Å from 8600 Å (the first-order shift). We then
fit a six-degree polynomial to the zero and first-order
shifts as a function of fiber number and apply the shift
from the polynomial fit to each spectra. Examples of the
"shifts are given in Figure 1, where we show the zero and"
first order shifts for two exposures of Leo IV and Leo
V. Trends in the zero and first order shifts vary between
exposures and UFDs.
We perform sky subtraction by selecting the sky fibers
in each observation and averaging them to produce a
master sky spectrum. The master sky spectrum is then
3 http://www.eso.org/sci/software/gasgano.html
"scaled to match the amplitude of the bright, isolated"
sky lines of each fiber before being subtracted from the
science spectrum. We combine the individual exposures
"using inverse-variance weighting, creating a combined"
spectrum for each star. Example spectra ranging from
low to high S/N are provided in Figure 2.
"To obtain parallax and proper motion data, we cross-"
match the VLT stars with Gaia EDR3 (Gaia Collabo-
ration et al. 2016; Collaboration et al. 2020) by identi-
fying the nearest neighbor for each VLT source with
separation < 1”. We similarly cross-match the VLT
stars with the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DE-
CaLS) DR8 (Dey et al. 2019) to obtain photometric
data. All photometric data reported in this paper are
reddening corrected using extinction map from Schlegel
et al. (1998). The proper motion and photometric data
are then combined with the VLT data to form a joint
"catalogue of stars. In this paper, we use the IDs in the"
"raw science data to distinguish stars, with the exception"
"of stars in Boötes I; for Boötes I, we label stars by ap-"
pending the ID from Koposov et al. (2011) to the prefix
“Boo1.”
3. VELOCITY AND METALLICITY
MEASUREMENTS
3.1. Radial Velocity Measurements
To determine the heliocentric radial velocities vhel of
"each star, we use the template-fitting code described"
in Li et al. (2017). Because no velocity standard stars
"were observed with VLT, and the Keck/DEIMOS spec-"
tra have a much wider wavelength coverage and a similar
"resolution (R ∼ 6, 000) as the VLT spectra, we use a list
of Keck/DEIMOS templates from Kirby et al. (2015)"
that are shifted to zero velocity based on their known
velocities. These stellar templates have various effective
"temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities, and"
are fit to the observed spectra using a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler (Foreman-Mackey et al.
2013). We adopt a uniform radial velocity prior be-

"Figure 1. Examples of the shifts in wavelength recalibration using sky emission lines as a function of fiber ID for each GIRAFFE
exposure. The green and blue curves represent sixth degree polynomial fits to the zero and first-order shifts, respectively. We
apply the shift corresponding to the polynomial fit to each spectra. Top: Two observations of Leo IV. Bottom: Two observations
of Leo V."
"tween ±800 km s−1 and use a 100-iteration burn-in to
initialize our sampler. The radial velocity posterior dis-"
tribution is sampled using the ensemble sampler emcee
with 20 walkers and 900 iterations. We then use the
median and standard deviation of the posterior chain
"to compute the radial velocity and radial velocity error,"
"respectively, for each template. We select the radial ve-"
locity and error values corresponding to the template fit
with the lowest chi-squared value. The radial velocity
uncertainties are underestimated and adjusted accord-
"ingly (see §3.2).
We apply several quality checks to our radial velocity"
"results. We use a Random Forest classifier (RFC), as"
"in Li et al. (2019), to identify spectra that do not corre-"
spond to stars or good fits. Because the calculated radial
velocity of non-stellar or low quality spectra are often
"large−near the upper and lower limits of the allowed
±800 km s−1 range−we classify any star with an abso-
lute radial velocity greater than 500 km s−1 as a poor fit."
"We then train the RFC using the reduced chi-squared,"
"S/N, absolute deviation, velocity skew, kurtosis and un-"
certainty of each velocity measurement as features. We
"apply our trained RFC to the VLT data, providing us"
with the probability that each star is a good stellar spec-
trum. We classify all observations with a probability less
than 0.6 as bad fits and create a corresponding binary
good star flag that is set to one for good fits and zero
for bad fits.
Stellar Spectroscopy of Three Ultra-Faint Dwarfs 5
"Figure 2. Reduced 1D spectra of four Leo V member stars
with varying S/N at wavelength range 8480–8680 Å. The
best-fit stellar templates, used to measure radial velocity,
are overlaid in red. The resulting velocity measurement (in
km s−1) is provided for each spectrum, in addition to its ID
and S/N."
While the RFC identifies some poor-fitting stellar
"templates, it does not find all of them. For this reason,"
we also discard objects with S/N < 4 or radial veloc-
ity uncertainty greater than 20 km s−1. After applying
"these criteria, we have >1,000 combined stellar observa-"
"tions, including 113 for Boötes I, 95 for Leo IV and 90"
for Leo V. Measurements on these stars are reported in
Appendix B.
We apply the aforementioned measurements to both
the combined spectra as well as the spectra from indi-
vidual exposures. The former are used for membership
"determination (§4) as well as the velocity dispersion cal-
culation (§5.2); the latter are used for velocity error cor-
rection (§3.2) and binary search (§5.1)."
3.2. Error Correction
The weighted standard deviation of individual epoch
velocities is larger than the corresponding combined ra-
"dial velocity uncertainty. Therefore, we use the repeat"
observations to assess the accuracy of our determined
"radial velocity uncertainties. Following Li et al. (2019),"
we use a Gaussian mixture model to model the pair-
"wise radial velocity differences δi,j = vi − vj of stars in
the eight UFDs (listed in Table 1) with more than five"
"Figure 3. Two-dimensional posterior probability distribu-
tion from a MCMC sampler using a five-parameter likelihood
for radial velocity uncertainty correction. We use the follow-
ing parameters: the mean pair-wise radial velocity difference
µ, the systematic uncertainty floor σfloor, the uncertainty
multiplicative constant s, the fraction of non-outliers f and
the outlier standard deviation of pair-wise radial velocity dif-
ferences σout."
"Figure 4. Distribution of 40,165 pairwise radial velocity dif-
ferences divided by the corresponding corrected uncertainties
added in quadrature. The red curve depicts a Gaussian fit
to the data and the blue curve depicts a standard normal
distribution N (0, 1). The means and standard deviations of
the data (computed after applying a five sigma clip) are pro-
vided in the top left. Left: Pairwise observations from eight
UFDs (with more than five observations each) before correc-
tion. Right: Pairwise observations after correction, which

observations. We have
"P (δi,j) = fN(δi,j |0,
√
F (σi)2 + F (σj)2)+(1−f)N(0, σout)"
"where N is the Gaussian distribution, σi and σj are the"
"radial velocity uncertainties corresponding to vi and vj ,"
and F corresponds to the uncertainty correction func-
"tion F (σ) =
√
σ2floor + (s× σ)2. We only include spec-"
tra with S/N > 4 and stars with a radial velocity stan-
dard deviation < 20 km s−1. These quality cuts mini-
mize the effect of poor-quality spectra.
"We find the scaling factor s and systematic floor σfloor
by fitting the model to 3905 radial velocity pairs. We"
"find s = 1.71 and σfloor = 0.65 km s
−1, resulting in a"
final uncertainty correction function:
"F (σ) =
√"
0.652 + (1.71× σ)2 (3)
The posterior probability distributions from the MCMC
sampler are displayed in Figure 3. The systematic floor
is likely due to the limited accuracy of the wavelength
"calibration, while the multiplicative constant is likely"
due to the covariance between pixels in the reduced
"spectra, as the default GIRAFFE pipeline interpolates"
the extracted wavelengths to a fixed grid. We compare
the original and recalibrated uncertainties in Figure 4
by plotting the distribution of pairwise radial velocity
differences divided by the combined uncertainty. The
distribution for the recalibrated uncertainties is close to
"a unit normal distribution, validating our error model."
We also apply a similar fit to individual UFDs with more
than five observations and obtain similar scaling factors.
3.3. CaT Metallicity Measurements
We determine the metallicities using the calcium
"triplet (CaT) lines at 8400-8700 Å. Following the
method described by Li et al. (2019), we fit each CaT"
line with a Gaussian plus Lorentzian function. The re-
sulting sum provides us with an equivalent width (EW).
The EW uncertainty is found from the uncertainty of the
"fit. In addition, we added a systematic floor of 0.1 Åin"
quadrature. This was found using the method described
"in §3.2. The EW is then converted to [Fe/H] using the
calibration relation described by Carrera et al. (2013)."
The metallicity uncertainties are propagated from the
"CaT EW uncertainties, the photometric uncertainties,"
distance uncertainties and the uncertainties on the cali-
bration parameters from Carrera et al. (2013).
The calibration relation only applies to red giant stars.
"Additionally, this approach requires an absolute mag-"
"nitude measurement, which in turn requires that the"
distance to the star is known. [Fe/H] calculations are
therefore only reliable for UFD member stars. For this
"reason, we do not provide a metallicity literature com-"
"parison for all stars. Instead, we compare the literature"
"and measured metallicity values for Boötes I, Leo IV and"
"Leo V member stars in §5.4, §5.5 and §5.6. All metal-
licities for stars with S/N less than seven are discarded."
4. MEMBER SELECTION
Although the data processing and measurements de-
"scribed in §2 and §3 are applied to all UFDs in Ta-
ble 1, we only perform membership selection for Boötes"
"I, Leo IV and Leo V. We will present membership re-"
sults for the remaining UFDs in a forthcoming paper.
We perform membership classification using both sub-
jective evaluation and a mixture model. The subjective
classification is used for subsequent velocity and metal-
licity calculations in §5.
4.1. Subjective Membership Classification
"We use radial velocity, position, proper motion, metal-"
licity and color-magnitude diagram (CMD) data to eval-
uate each star’s membership subjectively. Location data
"for each UFD is shown in Figure 6, where we highlight"
"the half-light radii rh and ×3 half-light radii in black,
and mark new and previously identified member stars in"
"green and blue, respectively. We expect member stars to"
lie close to the center of the galaxies. CMDs using dered-
dened photometry from DECaLS DR8 are presented in
"Figure 7. We use a metal-poor ( [Fe/H] = −2.3) Dart-
mouth isochrone for identifying red giant branch (RGB)"
candidates and the M92 blue horizontal branch (BHB)
ridgeline for identifying BHB candidates.
Radial velocity and metallicity data are shown in Fig-
ure 8. We expect member stars to have a radial ve-
"locity within ±30 km s−1 of the UFD’s velocity and to
have a lower metallicity characteristic of older stars. We"
therefore classify all stars with inconsistent radial ve-
locities as non-members and refer to non-member stars
that have velocities consistent with the UFD as velocity-
consistent non-members (VCNMs). We cross-match the
VLT observations with the Gaia EDR3 catalogue to
"obtain proper motion and parallax measurements, pre-"
sented in Figure 9. We expect member stars to have
proper motions consistent with the UFD’s motion within
"three standard deviations. Additionally, we exclude"
"foreground stars using a parallax $ cut: $ − 3σ$ > 0.
For stars with uncertain membership, we visually in-"
spect the Mg I line at 8806.8 Å to determine if the star
is a foreground star (Battaglia et al. 2011). This is dis-
cussed in Appendix A.
"Using these criteria, we identify member stars and"
"VCNMs in the three UFDs, listed in Tables 2, 3 and"
"4. Finally, we visually inspect the spectra and confirm"
Stellar Spectroscopy of Three Ultra-Faint Dwarfs 7
that all member stars have qualified measurements on
velocity and metallicity fit.
4.2. Membership Classification via Mixture Model
We primarily use the above subjective membership
"selection in §5. In addition, we also compute a member-
ship probability to consider how the Milky Way (MW)"
foreground properties compare to the UFD and whether
the exclusion of this affects our results. This probability
is calculated by applying a mixture model to each data
set. The mixture model can help justify including or
excluding stars on the boundary between the UFD and
"MW. We use the spatial position, proper motions from"
"Gaia EDR3, line-of-sight velocities and metallicities to"
compute the membership probability.
We model the likelihood with a conditional likelihood
to account for the unknown spectroscopic selection func-
"tion (e.g., Martinez et al. 2011; Horigome et al. 2020):"
P(D|R) = f(R)PUFD(D|r)+(1−f(R))PMW(D|R) (4)
"with D = {vhel, µα?, µδ, [Fe/H]} and f(R) =
ΣUFD(R)/(ΣUFD(R)+ΣMW(R)). Σ is a 2D density pro-"
"file. Here vhel is the radial velocity, and µα? and µδ are"
the proper motions. The radial density profile is mod-
"eled as a Plummer distribution (Plummer 1911), with"
best-fit parameters being the projected half-light radii
"rh, ellipticity �, and position angle θ. For the spatial"
"parameters (rh, �, θ) we assume Gaussian priors based"
on the deeper photometric results from Muñoz et al.
(2018). We fix the center to the values in Muñoz et al.
(2018). The MW spatial profile is assumed to be con-
stant within the field-of-view of the UFD. We model the
velocity and metallicity distributions as Gaussian dis-
tributions and the proper motion with a multi-variate
Gaussian distribution to account for the correlation be-
tween the proper motion terms. As the expected veloc-
"ity dispersion for a UFD is of order ∼ 5 km s−1, which is
much smaller than the precision of Gaia EDR3 proper"
"motions, we only consider a proper motion dispersion"
"for the MW component. Overall, there are nine param-"
"eters to describe the UFD component: vhel, σv, [Fe/H],"
"σ[Fe/H], µα?, µδ, rh, �, θ. There are eight parameters to"
"describe the MW component: vhel, σv, [Fe/H], σ[Fe/H],"
"µα?, σµα? , µδ, and σµδ . There is one additional param-"
eter: the relative normalization between the UFD and
MW spatial distribution. For the dispersion parameters
"(e.g., σv, σ[Fe/H]) we assume log uniform priors (also"
known as Jeffreys priors). The UFD spatial parameters
have Gaussian priors and the remaining parameters have
"uniform priors. To compute membership, we compare"
"Figure 5. Distribution of Boötes I, Leo IV and Leo V
membership probabilities (described in §4), color-coded ac-
cording to subjective classification. The membership prob-
abilities and subjective classification are largely consistent
with each other."
the ratio of the UFD likelihood to total likelihood:
"P (UFD|D) =
f(R)P (D|UFD)"
"f(R)P (D|UFD) + (1− f(R))P (D|MW)
(5)"
To compute the posterior distribution we use the
MultiNest algorithm (Feroz & Hobson 2008; Feroz et al.
2009). The membership probability (Pm) distributions
"for each UFD are provided in Figure 5, color coded for"
"different subjectively classified groups: members, non-"
members and VCNMs. Most members have Pm > 0.8
and non-members have Pm < 0.1; VCNMs have both
high and low membership probabilities. In the follow-
"ing subsections, we discuss in more detail the member-"
ship in each UFD and the classification of VCNMs. All
"measurements, membership probabilities, and subjec-"
tive membership classifications are given in Appendix
"B. Mean velocities and metallicities, velocity and metal-"
"licity dispersions, and proper motions calculated using"
the mixture model are listed in Table 5.
4.3. Boötes I Members
"Using subjective vetting, we identify 69 member stars."
Two member stars are assigned a membership probabil-
ity less than 0.1: Boo1 3 and Boo1 44. Boo1 3’s low
probability can likely be attributed to its low radial ve-
"locity (77.6 ± 6.0 km s−1) while Boo1 44’s low proba-
bility can be attributed to its high metallicity (−1.22 ±
0.08 dex). Both stars are highlighted in Figures 6, 7, 8"
and 9. Because their characteristics are otherwise con-
"sistent with being member stars, we subjectively classify"
them as members. All remaining members have a mem-
"bership probability greater than 0.8. Additionally, all"
high-probability stars (Pm > 0.5) are classified as mem-
"bers or VCNMs. Two members, Boo1 30 and Boo1 111,"
8 Jenkins et al.
"are located high on the RGB. One member, Boo1 32,"
was previously identified as a c-type RR Lyrae star with
"a period of 0.3119 days by Dall’Ora et al. (2006), and is"
therefore excluded from velocity and metallicity disper-
sions calculations in Section 5.2.
We observe a lack of member stars between g of 17.5
"and 19, as seen in Figure 7. This is likely because"
Boötes I was simulatneously observed with both the
GIRAFFE spectrograph and Ultraviolet Visual Echelle
Spectrograph (UVES) (Koposov et al. 2011). The bright
"members at 17.5 < g < 19 were targeted by UVES,"
while here we only present the targets observed with
GIRAFFE. The lack of bright member stars in the VLT
data likely contributes to the proper motion discrepancy
"discussed in §5.4.
A velocity histogram of all available radial velocities,"
"shown in Figure 10, has a peak at v ≈ 100 km s−1. The
Leo IV and Leo V velocity distributions are also shown"
"in Figure 10, and metallicity distributions are provided"
in Figure 11.
4.4. Leo IV Members
"We identify twenty Leo IV member stars, including"
nine new members and eleven members previously iden-
tified by Simon & Geha (2007). Our subjective member-
ship selection is largely consistent with our membership
"probabilities. Only one star, Leo4 1069, is subjectively"
classified as a member star but assigned membership
probability less than 0.5. This is likely due to its lower
"radial velocity (120.1 ± 2.8 km s−1). Another member,
Leo4 1048, is assigned a membership probability of 1.00,"
but with large uncertainties. This can be attributed to
"Leo4 1048 having a high metallicity (−1.30±0.15 dex)
while having a location and proper motion consistent"
"with being a member star. Additionally, Leo4 1055 is"
assigned a membership probability of 0.99 but is not
classified as a member star because its color-magnitude
information is inconsistent with being a Leo IV mem-
ber.4 As CMD information is not considered when cal-
"culating the membership probability, this inconsistency"
was not accounted for. Two additional stars with con-
"sistent velocities and low metallicities, Leo4 1087 and"
"Leo4 1184, are considered as VCNMs due to inconsis-"
tent proper motions and location on the CMD. Simon
& Geha (2007) had previously classified Leo4 1087 as a
member star.
"4 However, Koposov et al. (2018) found a highly carbon-enhanced
extremely metal-poor star in Hydrus I that appears to be much
redder than the rest Hydrus I members. Therefore, it could pos-
sibly be a member star of Leo IV with an unusual chemical abun-
dance pattern."
We measure the velocity of a previously identified
RR Lyrae star: Leo4 1041. Moretti et al. (2009) iden-
tify Leo4 1041 (called V2 by Moretti et al. (2009) and
HiTS113256-003329 by Medina et al. (2018)) as an ab-
type RR Lyrae with a period of 0.7096 days.
A velocity histogram of all available velocities (Fig-
"ure 10) has a peak at v ≈ 130 km s−1. The charac-
teristics of all member stars and VCNMs are given in"
Table 3.
4.5. Leo V Members
"We identify eleven Leo V member stars, including"
"four new members, five members previously identified"
"by Walker et al. (2009) and Collins et al. (2017), one"
RR Lyrae star identified by Medina et al. (2017) and
one tentative member identified by Mutlu-Pakdil et al.
"(2019). One new member star, Leo5 1014, is a BHB"
star. The remaining three new members are RGB stars.
Two of the previously identified members (Leo5 1153
and Leo5 1158) are assigned a membership probability
less than 0.2. Leo5 1153 and Leo5 1158 were observed
by Walker et al. (2009) and have low membership prob-
"abilities because they are far away (∼13 arcmin, >10
rh) from the center of the galaxy. Mutlu-Pakdil et al."
"(2019) do not consider these two stars to be members,"
as the spectra did not pass their quality control cuts and
there was no additional information identifying them as
"members. In this study, we successfully recover their"
radial velocities and find that they are consistent with
"Leo V’s velocity, suggesting that they could be member"
"stars. If true, this would indicate that Leo V has an ex-"
tended stellar distribution and support the argument for
"tidal disruption. However, their metallicity, location and"
distance from the isochrone are inconsistent with mem-
"bership, and we therefore do not consider them member
stars for subsequent kinematic measurements."
"Additionally, one star with a consistent radial velocity"
"and low metallicity, Leo5 1074, is not considered a mem-"
ber due to its distance from the Leo V center. Leo5 1064
"similarly has a consistent radial velocity, and is consid-"
"ered a VCNM due to its distance from the Leo V center,"
"distance from the isochrone, and relatively high metal-"
"licity. Another star, Leo5 1011, is a BHB star based on"
its location on the CMD. We classify it as a non-member
"because we measure its velocity to be 25.1±11.0 km s−1
below Leo V’s systemic velocity, and no metallicity or"
"proper motion information is available. Furthermore,"
"it is ∼ 0.2 mag brighter than the other BHB member
star. Follow-up observations are needed to determine"
its membership.
We measure a previously identified RR Lyrae star:
Leo5 1051. Medina et al. (2017) identify a total of

"three RR Lyrae stars in Leo V, including Leo5 1051"
"(called HiTS113057+021330 by Medina et al. (2017)),"
which they classify as an ab-type RR Lyrae with a
"period of 0.6453 days. Additionally, we identify three"
stars that Mutlu-Pakdil et al. (2019) listed as plausible
"Leo V members requiring further follow-up: Leo5 1046,"
"Leo5 1043 and Leo5 1095 (stars 2p, 4p and 3p in Mutlu-"
"Pakdil et al. (2019) Table 10, respectively). Leo5 1046"
was previously observed by Walker et al. (2009) but did
not pass the quality cuts used by Mutlu-Pakdil et al.
"(2019). Leo5 1046’s radial velocity, proper motion, lo-"
"cation, metallicity and color-magnitudes are all consis-"
"tent with Leo V’s characteristics, and we classify it as"
a member star. Leo5 1043 was identified as a plausible
member star because its proper motion and Megacam
color-magnitudes were consistent with Leo V. With our
"spectroscopic data, we confirm that its radial velocity"
"is also consistent, making it another new member star."
"We find that the final plausible member, Leo5 1095, is"
"not a member, as its radial velocity differs from that of"
Leo V by almost 200 km s−1.

"ure 10) has a peak at v ≈ 170 km s−1. The charac-
teristics of all possible members are given in Table 4."
5. DISCUSSION
5.1. Binarity
The measured velocity dispersions could be inflated
by the presence of binary systems. To investigate this
"Figure 11. Distributions of all available metallicity mea-
surements for Boötes I, Leo IV and Leo V member stars.
Metallicity measurements are described in §3.3 and used in
determining membership, as described in §4. Red curves de-
pict a re-scaled Gaussian distribution centered at the derived
mean metallicity with a standard deviation of the metallic-
ity dispersion and median uncertainty added in quadrature.
Metallicity calculations are described in §5.2."
"effect, we measure velocity variation by implementing"
a χ2 test on single exposures of the three UFDs. For
"each star, we measure the single exposure radial veloci-"
ties using the best-fit stellar template for the combined
"spectrum. We use 21 exposures for Boötes I, 17 expo-"
"sures for Leo IV and 17 exposures for Leo V (see §2.1).
We perform velocity measurements for single exposures"
"following the same method described in §3.1. Using the
null hypothesis that the stellar radial velocity is con-"
"stant, we calculate a p-value for each member star that"
has a minimum of two exposures with S/N > 4 and ra-
dial velocity uncertainty < 20 km s−1. For stars with
"a p-value < 0.1, we visually inspect each exposure to"
verify the quality of our template-fitting radial velocity
measurement. This check allows us to discard outliers
that are due to noise rather than variability. We then
re-calculate the p-value for such stars.
"Additionally, both Leo IV and Leo V observations"
were taken in two groups several months apart. We
leverage this to identify potential binary stars by co-
adding the spectra taken within each time frame and re-
calculating the p-value. This method is especially useful
for faint stars that have low S/N from single-exposure
spectra.
We can confidently reject the null hypothesis (p<0.01)
"for one star in Boötes I: Boo1 26. Additionally, we find"
"weak evidence (0.01≤p≤0.1) that three Boötes I mem-
ber stars exhibit variability: Boo1 61, Boo1 111 and"
"Boo1 114. Three of the four potential binaries (Boo1 26,"
Boo1 61 and Boo1 111) were assigned a variability prob-
ability greater than 0.9 by Koposov et al. (2011) and
12 Jenkins et al.

were thus considered too variable to include in kinematic
"measurements. In contrast, Koposov et al. (2011) as-"
signed a variability probability of 0.61 to Boo1 114 and
therefore did not classify it as a binary. We visually in-
spect the single-exposure spectra and confirm that there
is distinct velocity variation. It is not used in subse-
quent kinematics calculations. We do not find evidence
of variability for two stars that Koposov et al. (2011)
identified as potential binaries: Boo1 30 and Boo1 32.
"However, Boo1 32 is a previously identified RR Lyrae"
star and we therefore do not include it in any kinematic
calculations. Boo1 30 exhibits a peak-to-peak radial ve-
"locity variation of just 2.5±1.7 km s−1 and is included
in kinematic calculations."
We do not identify any potential binary stars in Leo
"IV when using single-exposure spectra. However, when"
"we use the two combined spectra, we find that Leo4 1039"
"exhibits weak evidence of variability, with a p-value of"
"0.06. We calculate velocities of 141.84±5.46 km s−1 and
129.20±4.04 km s−1 for the first and second combined
observing periods, respectively. This star is too faint"
to obtain reliable velocity measurements from single-
exposure spectra.
We identify one star in Leo V with evidence of vari-
ability in velocity (p=0.06) using the combined mea-
surements: Leo5 1034. After investigating the quality
"of each exposure, we conclude that Leo5 1034’s vari-"
ability appears to be due to true fluctuations in veloc-
"ity. Additionally, Mutlu-Pakdil et al. (2019) identified"
Leo5 1038 as a possible binary. Though we calculate a
p-value of 0.57 (single exposures) and 0.11 (combined ex-
"posures) for this member, our results are consistent with"
"this claim. As seen in Figure 12, where we compare our"
"measurement to all previous measurements, Leo5 1038’s"
radial velocity appears to change with time. We calcu-
"late a weighted standard deviation of 3.22 km s−1, 2.2"
times larger than the mean uncertainty of 1.45 km s−1.
We note that although we identify RR Lyrae members
"in both Leo IV and Leo V, the S/N from single-exposure"
spectra are too low to derive reliable velocity measure-
ments for velocity variation studies. All potential bina-
ries are displayed in Figure 12.
5.2. Velocity and Metallicity Dispersions
"Using our expanded membership catalogues, we re-"
calculate the mean velocities vhel and velocity disper-
sions σv for each UFD. We use the two-parameter log-
likelihood function from Walker et al. (2009). vi and
σi are the measured radial velocity and internal uncer-
"tainty, respectively, for the ith of N stars. While σi
captures the random internal measurement uncertainty,"
σV captures the intrinsic radial velocity dispersion. We
assume that the measured radial velocities have a Gaus-
14 Jenkins et al.
"Figure 12. Radial velocities of potential binary stars. We present our single-exposure measurements (blue) and literature
radial velocities. Because the Leo IV and Leo V single exposures can be clustered into two groups observed approximately
eight and seven months apart, respectively, we separately combine exposures within each observing cluster. The resulting
combined radial velocities are shown in orange. Aside from Leo5 1038, all stars show evidence of velocity variation using the
VLT measurements alone. Leo5 1038 is a binary found in Mutlu-Pakdil et al. (2019) and our radial velocity measurements
support this claim. For Leo4 1039, we are only able to measure its radial velocity from the combined exposures due to the low
S/N of single-exposure spectra."

sian distribution centered on vhel. A uniform prior is
used for vhel. Both a log uniform prior and uniform
prior are used for σv; we report the former as M1 in Ta-
ble 5 and the latter as M2. M1 is considered the default
value.

"ln(σ2i + σ

"N∑

(vi − vhel)2
"(σ2i + σ

"We restrict σv to be greater than 0 km s
−1 and vhel to"
be within the range of member star velocities. We run
"an MCMC sampler for 5,000 iterations, with a burn-in"
period of 50 iterations and priors chosen randomly from
a normal distribution centered at the member stars’
mean velocity. We use a similar approach to determine
the mean metallicities [Fe/H] and metallicity dispersion
σ[Fe/H] from our CaT metallicity measurements.
"We calculate the mean velocities vhel, velocity disper-"
"sions σv, mean metallicities [Fe/H] and metallicity dis-"
persions σ[Fe/H] of the three dwarf galaxies using the
subjectively identified member stars listed in Tables 2-
"4. For kinematic calculations, we remove potential bi-"
"nary stars and RR Lyrae stars identified in §4 and §5.1,
which may potentially inflate the velocity dispersion"
"if included. For metallicity calculations, only bright"
RGB members are included as we do not have reliable
"[Fe/H] measurements for horizontal branch stars, nor"
RGB members with S/N < 7. This results in a total
"of 64, 18 and 8 members in Boötes I, Leo IV, Leo V"
"in the velocity dispersion calculations and 51, 15 and 7"
members in the metallicity dispersion calculations.
The velocity and metallicity dispersions calculated us-
ing a log uniform and uniform prior are largely consis-
"tent. We do, however, observe a discrepancy in the Leo
V velocity dispersion; using a log uniform prior we calcu-"
"late a dispersion of 0.1+1.5−0.1 km s
−1 and using a uniform"
"prior we calculate a dispersion of 2.4+2.2−1.6 km s
−1. Due"
"to the small number of stars included in the calculation,"
the prior does have an impact to the results. In both
"cases, we conclude that the Leo V velocity dispersion is"
"not fully resolved. However, when we include the binary"
"stars Leo5 1034 and Leo5 1038, we resolve the velocity"
"dispersion, calculating a value of 3.0+1.3−1.0 km s
−1."
"As discussed in §4.3, Boo1 3 has a low membership
probability of 0.14 due to its low velocity (more than 20"
km s−1 below the systemic velocity of Boötes I). Due to
"its faintness, the proper motion of this star is unavail-"
"able; moreover, we are unable to reliably measure its"
metallicity using the spectrum with S/N = 4. Despite
"these limitations, we classify it as a member star in the"
subjective membership classification based on its spatial
location and location on the CMD. We recalculate the
velocity dispersion excluding this star and find a slightly
"lower velocity dispersion of 4.8+0.6−0.5 km s
−1. This is still"
consistent with the dispersion when the star is included
"(5.1+0.7−0.8 km s
−1)."
We identify a high metallicity member star in both
Boötes I and Leo IV (Boo1 44 and Leo4 1048 with
"metallicities of −1.22 ± 0.08 and −1.30 ± 0.15 dex, re-
spectively). To evaluate their impact on the metallicity"
"calculations, we re-calculate the mean metallicities and"
metallicity dispersions without these stars. When ex-
"cluding Boo1 44, we find no significant difference in the"
"Boötes I mean metallicity, but calculate a lower metal-"
"licity dispersion (0.18+0.04−0.03 dex, compared to 0.28
+0.04
−0.03"
"dex when including Boo1 44). Additionally, when we ex-"
"clude Leo4 1048, we calculate a mean Leo IV metallicity"
"of −2.66+0.07−0.07 dex (compared to −2.48
+0.16
−0.13 dex when in-"
"cluding Leo4 1048). Furthermore, we are no longer able"
"to resolve the Leo IV metallicity dispersion (0.02+0.06−0.01
dex) after excluding this star."
"For comparison, we also list the velocity and metal-"
licity parameters from the membership probability cal-
"culation discussed in §4. This approach uses all stars
with good radial velocity and metallicity measurements,"
as no prior membership or binary information is avail-
able before the mixture model analysis is performed.
Given the minimal difference in the subjective mem-
bership classification and membership probability (Fig-
"ure 5), these two membership classifications provide sim-"
"ilar kinematic and metallicity parameters. However,"
"as stated previously, we obtain different values for the"
Boötes I metallicity dispersion depending on our treat-
"ment of Boo1 44, and we find that our value is only con-"
sistent with the dispersion from the membership prob-
ability calculation when we exclude this star. This is
because the star is assigned a membership probability
of zero and so is not considered in the dispersion calcu-
lation in the mixture model.
"Additionally, while the Leo IV metallicity disper-"
"sions are consistent, the mixture model calculates a"
large uncertainty. This reflects the large uncertainty
in Leo4 1048’s membership probability (1.00+0.00−1.00). Be-
cause Leo4 1048 is a member star with a metallicity of
"−1.30±0.16 dex, its inclusion in metallicity calculations
has a large effect on the calculated metallicity disper-"
sion. Just as we are unable to resolve Leo IV’s metal-
licity dispersion when we exclude Leo4 1048 from our
"member catalogue, the mixture model is unable to re-"
solve the metallicity dispersion when Leo4 1048 is as-
signed a membership probability of zero.
"While we do not resolve the Leo V velocity dispersion,"
"the mixture model calculates a value of 3.2+1.7−1.4 km s
−1."
Stellar Spectroscopy of Three Ultra-Faint Dwarfs 17
This is consistent with our value when we include the
two binary member stars and is a consequence of the
mixture model not excluding binary stars from velocity
calculations.
In Figures 10 and 11 we show the velocity and metal-
licity distribution of all member stars in these three
"UFDs, overplotted with a Gaussian function centered"
at the derived mean velocity/metallicity with a stan-

5.4. Boötes I Literature Comparison
Koposov et al. (2011) used an enhanced data reduction
pipeline to calculate radial velocities from VLT spectra.
"They targeted stars that are likely to be members, in-"
cluding nine member stars identified by Muñoz et al.
(2006) and 27 member stars identified by Martin et al.
(2007). Koposov et al. (2011) observed a total of 118
"stars, 100 of which were used for kinematic calculations."
Though they consider most of the observed stars to be
"Boötes I members, they classified 37 of them as highly"
probable members using the following criteria: low ve-
"locity variability, log(g) < 3.5, [Fe/H] < −1.5 and radial
velocity error dv < 2.5 km s−1."
Because we use the data from the same observations
"analyzed by Koposov et al. (2011), we expect to measure"
"similar velocities, metallicities and dispersions. Koposov"
et al. (2011) used 100 stars to calculate the velocity dis-
"persion, and identified a subset of 37 stars as highly"
probable Boötes I members. We assign a membership
probability greater than 0.8 to all Koposov et al. (2011)
highly probable members. Of the remaining 36 stars
"Table 5. UFD properties from literature are given in the
top panel. In the bottom panel, the toal number of mem-
ber stars identified, used in velocity calculations and used in
metallicity calculations are reported, in addition to the up-
dated mean velocities (vhel), velocity dispersions (σV ), mean
metallicities ([Fe/H]), metallicity dispersions (σ[Fe/H]) and
proper motion (µαcos(δ), µδ). Results are reported for the
complete membership catalogue using both log uniform pri-
ors (M1) and uniform priors (M2) for dispersion parameters.
We consider M1 to be the default values used throughout
the study. Additionally, we provide velocity and metallic-
ity values found using the membership probability mixture
described in §4.2 (M3)."

Mutlu-Pakdil et al. (2019). We do not observe a significant offset for either Boötes I or Leo IV. However, for Leo V, we observe

velocity error cuts in particular may be broadened to
capture more members.
We calculate a mean velocity and velocity dispersion
"of 102.6+0.7−0.8 and 5.1
+0.7
−0.8 km s"
"−1, respectively. These val-"
ues are consistent with the Koposov et al. (2011) values

et al. (2011) and Martin et al. (2007), respectively. We"
compare member stars’ velocity measurements to previ-
ous literature in the left panel of Figure 13.
Koposov et al. (2011) also fitted a two-component ve-
locity distribution and found a cold component with
"σv ∼ 2.4 km s−1 and a hot component with σv ∼
9 km s−1. We fit a similar two component model us-"
ing a seven parameter likelihood that includes a MW
component:
"P (v) = (1− fMW )× (fN(v|µ, σ1)+
(1− f)N(µ, σ2)) + fMWN(µMW , σMW )"
µ and µMW are the mean velocities of Boötes I and MW
"stars, respectively; σ1, σ2, and σMW are the velocity"
"dispersions of the first Boötes I velocity component, the"
"second Boötes I velocity component, and the MW stars,"
respectively; and f and fMW are the fraction of Boötes
I stars in the first velocity component and the fraction
"of stars in the foreground, respectively. Using this likeli-"
"hood, we calculate velocity dispersions (σv ∼ 2.2 km s−1
and σv ∼ 9.6 km s−1) consistent with those found by
Koposov et al. (2011). The posterior probability distri-"
bution is shown in Figure 15. We also fit a corresponding
one component model using a five parameter likelihood
(i.e no σ2 and f).

We compare the models using the corrected Akaike
"Information Criterion (AICc), which is a likelihood ra-"
tio with an additional penalty for the number of model
parameters (see Kirby et al. 2013 for details). A smaller
AICc value usually corresponds to a more favored model.
Our calculated AICc value for the two-component model
"is lower than one-component model by 3.5, indicating"
"the two-component model is preferred, but with weak"
evidence.
We calculate a mean metallicity and metallicity dis-
"persion of −2.34+0.05−0.05 and 0.28
+0.04
−0.03 dex, respectively."
The mean metallicity is consistent with the most recent
"calculation given by Simon (2019). However, our metal-"
licity dispersion is smaller than that from Simon (2019)
(0.44+0.07−0.06 dex). Koposov et al. (2011) use the best-fit
template for each star’s co-added spectrum to calculate
metallicities. Though their fitting procedure is primar-
"ily intended to calculate radial velocities, they find that"
"their resulting values for Teff , log(g) and [Fe/H] are rea-"
sonable. We compare our metallicity results with theirs
"in Figure 14, noting that they do not provide uncertain-"
ties for their measurements because of the discreteness
of the Munari atmosphere grid (Munari et al. 2005). As-
"signing their values a uniform uncertainty of 0.3 dex, we"
"find an offset of −0.03 ± 0.06 dex. There is no obvious
correlation between our measurements. We also provide"
a comparison of our results with Martin et al. (2007)
and Lai et al. (2011). Measurements from both stud-
"ies are known to within ±0.2 dex. We find an offset of
−0.47±0.11 and 0.35±0.11 dex relative to the measure-
ments from Martin et al. (2007) and Lai et al. (2011),"
respectively. This could be attributed in part to the
different CaT calibrations used; while we use the cali-
"bration relation from Carrera et al. (2013), Martin et al."
(2007) use the relation from Rutledge et al. (1997). The
comparison results are shown in the left panel of Fig-
ure 14.
Using the membership mixture model described in
"§4.2, we calculate the systematic proper motion in
right ascension and declination to be −0.45+0.04−0.04 and
−1.13+0.03−0.03 mas yr"
"−1, respectively. McConnachie &"
Venn (2020) similarly use the Gaia EDR3 catalogue to
"measure the systematic proper motion of Boötes I, cal-"
culating the right ascension and declination components
"to be −0.39 ± 0.01 and −1.06 ± 0.01 mas yr−1, respec-
tively. The discrepancy between these measurements is"
likely due to the lack of bright member stars in the VLT
data. This is discussed in more detail in §4.3.
5.5. Leo IV Literature Comparison
Simon & Geha (2007) used Keck/DEIMOS spec-
troscopy to identify eighteen Leo IV members. We re-
cover eleven of these stars and identify nine additional
members. We calculate a mean velocity and velocity
"dispersion of 131.6+1.0−1.2 and 3.4
+1.3
−0.9 km s"
"−1, respectively."
Simon & Geha (2007) calculated the mean velocity and
velocity dispersion using a maximum-likelihood method
"that assumes a Gaussian velocity distribution, as in"
"Walker et al. (2006). They found values of 132.3 ± 1.4
km s−1 and 3.3 ± 1.7 km s−1, respectively. These are
consistent with the values calculated using our member"
catalogue. The Simon & Geha (2007) dispersion is con-
sistent with zero within two standard deviations. Our
measurement is therefore the first to resolve the Leo IV
velocity dispersion at the 95% confidence level.
The VLT data includes member stars that have previ-
"ously been identified, providing a source of direct com-"
parison for member velocities. We compare the radial
velocity measurements of eleven member stars to pre-
viously published findings in the middle panel of Fig-
ure 13. We observe that our VLT data for member stars
"is on average 0.8 ± 2.0 km s−1 lower than the litera-
ture values. All previously identified members are listed"
"in Table 7 in Appendix C, along with all corresponding"
velocity measurements.
We calculate a mean metallicity and metallicity dis-
"persion of −2.48+0.16−0.13 and 0.42
+0.12
−0.10 dex, respectively."
These values are consistent with those calculated by
Kirby et al. (2013). We compare our calculated metal-
licities to those measured by Simon & Geha (2007) and
Kirby et al. (2013) in the middle panel of Figure 14. We
"find a mean offset of −0.22 ± 0.17 and −0.17 ± 0.21
dex from Simon & Geha (2007) and Kirby et al. (2013),"
respectively. The offset from Simon & Geha (2007) is
consistent with the difference between the mean metal-
licities calculated here and by Simon & Geha (2007)
"(0.16±0.17 dex). This discrepancy can be attributed
in part to the different CaT calibrations used. As dis-"
"cussed in §5.4, we use the calibration relation from Car-
rera et al. (2013), while measurements prior to 2013 use"
the relation from Rutledge et al. (1997).
"Using the membership mixture model, we calculate"
the systematic proper motion in right ascension and dec-
"lination to be −0.11+0.24−0.24 and −0.45
+0.19
−0.19 mas yr"
"−1, re-"
spectively. This is consistent with the values found by
McConnachie & Venn (2020).
5.6. Leo V Literature Comparison
Walker et al. (2009) identified a total of seven
Leo V members observed with MMT/Hectochelle
and Collins et al. (2017) performed follow-up with
"Keck/DEIMOS spectra, finding an additional five mem-"
bers. Mutlu-Pakdil et al. (2019) used photometric
data and two epochs of stellar spectra observed with
20 Jenkins et al.
"Figure 15. Two-dimensional posterior probability distribution from a MCMC sampler using a seven-parameter likelihood.
We use the following parameters: the mean velocity of Boötes I µ, the mean velocity of the foreground MW stars µMW , the
velocity dispersion of the first Boötes I velocity component σ1, the velocity dispersion of the second Boötes I velocity component
σ2, the velocity dispersion of the MW stars σMW , the fraction of Boötes I stars in the first velocity component f , and the
fraction of MW stars fMW ."
MMT/Hectochelle to find three new possible member
stars. One of the epochs of spectroscopic data was first
reported by Walker et al. (2009). We identify eleven
"member stars, including four new members, two mem-"
"bers previously observed in all three studies, three mem-"
bers observed by Walker et al. (2009) and two mem-
bers observed by Collins et al. (2017). Walker et al.
(2009) classified two stars (Leo5 1153 and Leo5 1158)
"located far (∼13 arcmin, >10 rh) from the center of Leo
V as members. These stars are highlighted in Figures 6"
through 9. We classify them as VCNMs due to their dis-
tance from the Leo V center and their high metallicities.
"We calculate a mean velocity of 173.1+1.0−0.8 km s
−1 and"
are unable to resolve the velocity dispersion. Walker
Stellar Spectroscopy of Three Ultra-Faint Dwarfs 21
et al. (2009) used a two-dimensional likelihood function
weighted by membership probabilities to perform kine-
"matic calculations. Using only the five central members,"
"they found a velocity dispersion of 2.4+2.4−1.4 km s
−1. This"
value is not conclusively resolved. Including the two dis-
"tant candidate members increases this value to 3.7+2.3−1.4
km s−1. Collins et al. (2017) estimated Leo V’s kine-"
matics using two models: one that assumes the system
is dispersion supported and one that allows for a veloc-
"ity gradient. For the former, they calculated the mean"
"velocity to be 172.1+2.3−2.1 km s
−1 and the velocity disper-"
"sion to be 4.0+3.3−2.3 km s
−1; for the latter, they calculated"
"the mean velocity to be 170.9+2.1−1.9 km s
−1 and the veloc-"
"ity dispersion to be 2.3+3.2−1.6 km s
−1. Our mean velocity"
is consistent with the values found by both Walker et al.
(2009) and Collins et al. (2017).
We compare the radial velocity measurements of the
seven previously identified member stars to published
findings in the right panel of Figure 13. Our VLT ve-
locity measurements for member stars are on average
"4.8 ± 2.9 km s−1 higher than the measurements from
Collins et al. (2017) and 1.4 ± 2.1 km s−1 higher than
the measurements from Walker et al. (2009). Our results"
for all common stars (members and non-members) are
"more consistent; we observe 3.4 ± 3.4 km s−1 and 0.7 ±
0.9 km s−1 offsets from Collins et al. (2017) and Walker"
"et al. (2009), respectively, excluding four common stars"
with a difference > 100 km s−1 from our comparison
with Walker et al. (2009). We visually verify the spec-
tra quality for all stars with difference > 100 km s−1
and do not identify any poor-quality velocity template
fits. All large differences are observed relative to Walker
et al. (2009) and could be attributed to Walker et al.
(2009) using an older MMT/Hectochelle pipeline that
is improved in Mutlu-Pakdil et al. (2019). We measure
"an offset of 6.6 ± 1.8 km s−1 from Mutlu-Pakdil et al.
(2019) based on the common binary member star. All"
previously identified members are listed in Table 8 in
"Appendix C, along with all corresponding velocity mea-"
surements.
We calculate a mean metallicity and metallicity dis-
"persion of −2.29+0.14−0.17 and 0.30
+0.14
−0.09 dex, respectively."
These values are consistent with Collins et al. (2017).
We compare our metallicity results to previous literature
(Collins et al. (2017) and Mutlu-Pakdil et al. (2019)) in
the right panel of Figure 14. The two metallicities from
Mutlu-Pakdil et al. (2019) in Figure 14 are calculated
from different spectra for the same star. The variabil-
ity in their results may suggest that their uncertainty is
underestimated. The average offset from Collins et al.
(2017) is 0.19 ± 0.14 dex.
"Using the membership mixture model, we calculate"
the systematic proper motion in right ascension and dec-
"lination to be −0.02+0.29−0.29 and −0.40
+0.21
−0.21 mas yr"
"−1, re-"
spectively. This is consistent with the values found by
McConnachie & Venn (2020).
5.7. Metallicity Distribution Function of Boötes I
The VLT data roughly doubles the number of metal-
licities available in Boötes I compared to the most re-
"cent analysis by Lai et al. (2011), bringing it to a total"
"of ∼70 stars: 51 in the VLT/GIRAFFE data (29 new
stars), and 19 stars in the literature not in our dataset"
(Norris et al. 2010; Lai et al. 2011). We calibrate the
literature measurements to our metallicities using the
"offset calculated in §5.4.
We re-analyze the metallicity distribution function"
using three analytic metallicity distribution functions
"(MDFs) considered by Lai et al. (2011): the leaky box,"
"the pre-enriched leaky box, and the extra gas model"
(Kirby et al. 2011). The leaky box is the classic analytic
model characterized by the effective yield p. The pre-
enriched box model adds a minimum metallicity floor
[Fe/H]0. The extra gas model (Lynden-Bell 1975) adds
"pristine gas to a leaky box parameterized by M , where"
M = 1 reproduces the leaky box and M > 1 adds extra
"pristine gas to the leaky box, creating a more peaked"
MDF with a lighter metal-poor tail. We note that with
"41 stars, Lai et al. (2011) found all three models fit the"
"data about equally well, with a slight preference for the"
extra gas model.
We use dynamic nested sampling with dynesty (Spea-
gle 2020) to determine the model parameters and pos-
teriors. The priors are log uniform for p from 10−3 to
"10−1 for all three models; uniform in [Fe/H]0 from −5 to
−2 for the pre-enriched model; and uniform in M from
1 to 30 for the extra gas model. The resulting posteri-"
"ors are all well-behaved. We find log p = −2.27 ± 0.07
for the leaky box model, log p = −2.33 ± 0.07 and
[Fe/H]0 = −3.74± 0.18 for the pre-enriched box model,
and log p = −2.32± 0.05 and M = 4.5+3.2−1.8 for the extra
gas model. To be consistent with previous similar analy-"
"ses (Lai et al. 2011; Kirby et al. 2013, 2020) we compare"
the models using the AICc. Compared to the leaky box
"model, the pre-enriched model’s AICc is 2.9 lower, and"
the extra gas model’s AICc is 6.4 lower. 5 The leaky
"box model is clearly disfavored, and the extra gas model"
is slightly preferred over the pre-enriched model. Given
"that we have the full posterior, a Bayes factor could be"
"5 Note that in Figure 16 we follow the convention used in Kirby
et al. (2013) that a positive ∆AICc corresponds to a lower AICc
value compared to the reference AICc."
22 Jenkins et al.
"more appropriate metric to compare these models, but"
doing so does not change these conclusions.
The new MDF and the results of our fit are shown
in Figure 16. The model PDFs have been convolved
with the median metallicity uncertainty of 0.22 dex. It
is visually apparent that the extra gas model fits the
"histogram the best. However, the strength of this con-"
clusion relies on including all the literature data. Our
VLT/GIRAFFE data alone rule out the pristine leaky
box but cannot distinguish between the pre-enriched and
extra gas models. This is because the literature data are
"overall at slightly lower metallicities than the VLT data,"
increasing the size of the metal-poor tail compared to
the peak of the MDF. While we have shifted the mean
metallicity of the literature data to match our measure-
"ments, it is possible a residual metallicity offset remains,"
in which case the difference would not be significant. A
homogeneous metallicity analysis of Boötes I is needed
to be certain.
"Taking this result at face value, the MDF suggests"
"that Boötes I was accreting gas, with M = 4.5+3.2−1.8
times as much gas being accreted as stars being formed."
A similar suggestion has been made by examination
"of detailed chemical abundances (Frebel et al. 2016),"
though in that case discrete merging events were respon-
sible rather than continuous gas accretion as modeled
"here. Regardless, this interpretation is consistent with"
Boötes I having formed in a similar way to the lowest
mass classical dwarf galaxies (Kirby et al. 2011; Yan
"et al. 2020), emphasizing that relatively massive UFDs"
like Boötes I are an extension of ordinary galaxy forma-
tion to lower stellar masses (Tolstoy et al. 2009; Simon
2019). It remains to be seen if more populated MDFs
in lower mass UFDs will continue this trend.
5.8. Leo V Velocity Gradient
"Collins et al. (2017) identified a velocity gradient with
dv
dx"
"= −4.1+2.8−2.6 km s
−1 per arcmin and a preferred axis"
of φ = 123.6+15.5−29.6 deg. They argue that this is consis-
tent with disruption caused by tidal interaction with the
Milky Way.
We test whether there is a convincing velocity gradient
"present in the VLT data using a four-parameter model,"
as in Collins et al. (2017) and Li et al. (2017):

"We find dv

−1 per arcmin, which is"
"consistent with zero within 2σ uncertainty and is ∼4×
smaller than the gradient calculated by Collins et al."
"(2017). Additionally, we find φ = 2.4+43.7−32.3 deg, which is"
inconsistent with the preferred axis calculated by Collins
et al. (2017) (φ = 123.6+15.5−29.7 deg). The weak velocity
gradient from the VLT data at a very different preferred
axis does not support the significant velocity gradient as
"seen in Collins et al. (2017); instead, it shows that the"
inferred gradient from our work is likely due to the small
sample used. The discrepancy may also arise in part be-
cause Collins et al. (2017) observed a star (StarID-25 in
"their terminology) at a projected distance of −1.31 ar-
cmin from the center of Leo V and with a radial velocity"
"of 177.8 ± 2.3 km s−1. This star contributed to their
observed velocity gradient and was not observed with"
"the VLT. We demonstrate that, along the axis where"
"Collins et al. (2017) find a gradient, the velocities of the"
VLT members from this work are relatively stable as
a function of projected distance in the middle panel of
"Figure 17. Similarly, along the preferred axis from the"
"VLT data (right panel of Figure 17), we do not observe"
an obvious trends in the Collins et al. (2017) data.
Stellar Spectroscopy of Three Ultra-Faint Dwarfs 23
The weak velocity gradient from the VLT data does
not strongly indicate that Leo V is likely on the brink
"of dissolution, as suggested by Collins et al. (2017)."
We also note that Leo V’s orbit has a large pericen-
"ter (168+12−104 kpc) (Fritz et al. 2018), which is consistent"
with there being no tidal disruption. Gaia EDR3 will
"provide updated Leo V orbital information. However,"
we identify additional nine stars greater than three half-
light radii from the center of Leo V that we classify as
VCNMs since they are far from the center of the galaxy.
Though they exhibit other characteristics inconsistent
"with membership (e.g. high/low radial velocity, high"
"metallicity, far from isochrone, etc.), if one were to be a"
member it may be evidence of tidal disruption. A ded-
icated observation including all known Leo V members
"from previous literature (16 in total, including three RR"
Lyrae stars reported by Medina et al. (2017)) and this
work is required to further examine the velocity gradient
and possible tidal disruption feature in Leo V.
"Finally, we caution that such a gradient study is per-"
formed on eight member stars which are selected within
30 km s−1 of the systematic velocity; this could in prin-
ciple bias the inferred gradient if the gradient is larger
"than 10 km s−1 per arcmin. However, there is no ob-"
vious evidence that such a large velocity gradient exists
within the current member catalogue.
6. CONCLUSIONS
"Using archived VLT spectroscopic data, we present"
updated membership catalogues for three UFDs. We
summarize our key results for each UFD below:
"• Boötes I: We identify 69 member stars in Boötes I.
Using this membership catalogue, we calculate a"
"systematic velocity of 102.6+0.7−0.8 km s
−1, velocity"
"dispersion of 5.1+0.7−0.8 km s
−1, systematic metallic-"
"ity of −2.34+0.05−0.05 dex and metallicity dispersion
of 0.28+0.04−0.03 dex. Potential binary stars were ex-"
cluded from all kinematic calculations for Boötes
"I, Leo IV and Leo V. We measure one member"
"star with a metallicity of −1.22 ± 0.08 dex. When
this star is excluded from metallicity calculations,"
"we calculate a metallicity dispersion of 0.18+0.04−0.03
dex. We find weak evidence in support of the"
two-component kinematic model used by Koposov
"et al. (2011), consistent with previous findings."
Combining the VLT/GIRAFFE data with data
"from Norris et al. (2010) and Lai et al. (2011),"
we re-analyze the Boötes I MDF. We use three
"distributions from Lai et al. (2011) (leaky box,"
pre-enriched leaky box and extra gas model) and
find that the extra gas model (i.e. a model in-
cluding infall of pristine gas while the galaxy was
"forming stars) best describes the MDF, suggest-"
ing that Boötes I formed in a similar way to low
"mass classical dwarf galaxies. In addition, we find"
strong evidence that one star (Boo1 26) is a bi-
nary and find weak evidence indicating that three
"stars (Boo1 61, Boo1 111 and Boo1 114) are bi-"
nary. Koposov et al. (2011) had previously iden-
"tified three of these stars (Boo1 26, Boo1 61 and"
Boo1 111) as possible binaries.
"• Leo IV: We identify 20 member stars in Leo IV, in-
cluding nine new members. Using this member-"
"ship catalogue, we calculate a systematic velocity"
"of 131.6+1.0−1.2 km s
−1, velocity dispersion of 3.4+1.3−0.9"
"km s−1, systematic metallicity of −2.48+0.16−0.13 dex
and metallicity dispersion of 0.42+0.12−0.10 dex. This"
is the first time the velocity dispersion of Leo IV
has been resolved at the 95% confidence level. We
measure one member star with a metallicity of
"−1.30 ± 0.15 dex. When this star is excluded from
metallicity calculations, we are unable to resolve"
"the Leo IV metallicity dispersion. In addition, we"
identify one new possible binary star (Leo4 1039)
in Leo IV.
"• Leo V: We identify eleven member stars in Leo V,
including four new members. Using this mem-"
"bership catalogue, we calculate a systematic ve-"
"locity of 173.1+1.0−0.8 km s
−1, systematic metallic-"
"ity of −2.29+0.14−0.17 dex and metallicity dispersion
of 0.30+0.14−0.09 dex. We also provide further evi-"
dence that one Leo V member star (Leo5 1038)
"is a binary, as suggested by Mutlu-Pakdil et al."
"(2019), and identify a new possible binary star"
(Leo5 1034). We do not resolve the velocity dis-
persion when the two binaries are excluded. We
"identify a Leo V velocity gradient of −0.98+0.48−0.50
km s−1 per arcmin, ∼4× smaller than the gradi-
ent calculated by Collins et al. (2017). The gradi-"
ent is consistent with zero within 2σ uncertainty
and is likely caused by the small sample size. This
indicates that Leo V is not tidally disrupted. Ad-
"ditionally, we calculate a preferred kinematic axis"
that differs from Collins et al. (2017) value by
∼120 deg.
Because Boötes I contains many (>50) known member
"stars, including or excluding a small number of plausible"
members or binary stars does not have a significant ef-
"fect on the velocity or metallicity dispersion. However,"
for Leo IV and Leo V (in which only 10-20 members
"are identified), this could impact the final results. For"
"example, the metallicity dispersion of Leo IV changes"

"The velocities as a function of projected distance along the gradient axis found by Collins et al. (2017). Stars found in both
the VLT and Collins et al. (2017) data are located at the same projected distance and are identified by a thick gray line. Our
VLT velocity measurements for member stars are on average 4.8 ± 2.6 km s−1 higher than the measurements from Collins et al.
(2017). The dashed line indicates the velocity gradient found by Collins et al. (2017). The preferred kinematic axis is given
in the top left. Right: The velocities as a function of projected distance along the gradient axis found in §5.8. We use the
same symbols as used in the middle panel. The dashed line indicates the velocity gradient calculated from the VLT data. The

from 0.42+0.12−0.09 dex to unresolved when one plausible
"high metallicity member star is excluded, and the veloc-"
ity dispersion of Leo V becomes unresolved when two
binaries are removed from the calculation. For these
"faint UFDs, more comprehensive observations including"
all possible bright members are required to better con-
strain their kinematic and chemical properties.
We provide all spectroscopic measurements and mem-
"bership results for Boötes I, Leo IV and Leo V in Table 6,"
with more details on the member stars of each galaxy in
Tables 2–4.
This is the first in a series of papers providing consis-
"tent, refined measurements of thirteen UFDs using pub-"
lic archival data from VLT/GIRAFFE. Similar spectro-
scopic analyses for the remaining ten UFDs listed in Ta-
ble 1 will be presented in forthcoming papers. This series
of work will largely improve the sample size of the known
UFD member stars for refined kinematic and metallicity
"property studies on UFDs, provide multi-epoch observa-"
"tions to improve our understanding on the binary stars,"
and constrain the mass-metallicity relationship in these
faintest galaxies.

APPENDIX
A. EQUIVALENT WIDTHS OF Mg I LINE AT 8806.8 Å
"As shown in Battaglia et al. (2011) and Battaglia & Starkenburg (2012), the Mg I line at 8806.8 Å is gravity sensitive"
and can be used to discriminate foreground dwarf stars from the giant stars in the dwarf galaxies. We therefore compute
the EWs of the Mg I line for all observed stars by integrating the flux over 6 Å around the central wavelength of the
"line, as was done in Battaglia et al. (2011), and report our measurements in Table 6. Due to the weakness of the Mg"
"I line, it is only visible for bright stars with high S/N. For this reason, we do not use the line for general membership"
"classification. However, the Mg I line is useful for stars with uncertain membership, such as stars with high metallicity"
"but consistent velocity and proper motion, e.g. Boo1 44 ( [Fe/H] = −1.22±0.08) in Boötes I and Leo4 1048 ( [Fe/H]
= −1.30±0.15) in Leo IV. In Figure 18, we show the spectra of these two stars centered at the Mg I line, along with
several member and non-member stars for comparison. Although Boo1 44 presents a weak Mg I line with an EW"
"of 0.26 ± 0.02, the strength still places it in the “giant” star region as defined by Battaglia & Starkenburg (2012).
Leo4 1048 does not show any obvious Mg I line. We therefore conclude that both stars are likely to be giant member"
stars rather than foreground dwarf stars.
B. ALL OBSERVED STARS
"We present radial velocity and metallicity measurements (see §3) for all observed stars in Table 6, in addition to
membership probabilities and subjective membership classification (see §4). A portion of the table is shown here to
demonstrate its content."
C. MUTUAL STARS
We identify several previously identified member stars in Leo IV and Leo V. Leo IV was previously observed by
Simon & Geha (2007). We compare the radial velocities of eleven common member stars in Figure 13 and Table 7. Leo
"V was previously observed by Walker et al. (2009), Collins et al. (2017) and Mutlu-Pakdil et al. (2019). We compare"
the radial velocities of seven common member stars in Figure 13 and Table 8.

"Table 6. Measurements of all observed stars in Boötes I, Leo IV and Leo V. Only the first four lines are shown. The complete
table is available online in a machine readable format. Column (1) is the star ID. Columns (2) and (3) correspond the coordinates
and column (4) is the signal-to-noise ratio. Columns (5) and (6) present the radial velocity and CaT equivalent widths described
in §3, while column (7) provides the Mg equivalent widths. Column (8) corresponds to the probability calculated using a random
forest classifier of the spectrum being good-quality (see §3.1). Column (9) presents the probability of the star being a member
(see §4) and column (10) provides the results of our subjective membership classification, with ‘-1’ corresponding to non-member
stars and ‘1’ corresponding to member stars."
