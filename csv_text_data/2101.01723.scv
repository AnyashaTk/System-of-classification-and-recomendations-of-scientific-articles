"ABSTRACT
Gaia DR2 published positions, parallaxes and proper motions for an unprecedented
1,331,909,727 sources, revolutionising the field of Galactic dynamics. We complement this
data with the Astrometry Spread Function (ASF), the expected uncertainty in the measured
positions, proper motions and parallax for a non-accelerating point source. The ASF is a Gaus-
sian function for which we construct the 5D astrometric covariance matrix as a function of
position on the sky and apparent magnitude using theGaiaDR2 scanning law and demonstrate
excellent agreement with the observed data. This can be used to answer the question ‚ÄòWhat
astrometric covariance would Gaia have published if my star was a non-accelerating point
source?‚Äô.

1 INTRODUCTION
"Gaia has initiated an era of large scale Milky Way dynamical mod-
elling by providing 5D astrometry (position, proper motion and
parallax) for more than 1.3 billion stars (Gaia Collaboration et al.
2016, 2018; Lindegren et al. 2018). The Gaia satellite measures
source positions at multiple epochs over the mission lifetime. These
epoch astrometry measurements are the inputs of the Astrometric
Global Iterative Solution (AGIS Lindegren et al. 2012) which itera-
tively solves for the spacecraft attitude, geometric calibration of the
instrument, global parameters, and 5D astrometry of each source:
the right ascension and declination (ùõº0, ùõø0), the proper motions
(`ùõº, `ùõø) and the parallax (ùúõ). Alongside the source astrometry,"
‚òÖ E-mail: asfe2@cam.ac.uk
"Gaia also publishes the 5D astrometricmeasurement covariance and
various statistics of the astrometric solution for all sources which
meet the quality cuts. The 5-parameter astrometric model of AGIS
assumes sources are point-like with apparent non-accelerating uni-
form motion relative to the solar system barycenter which we will
refer to as ‚Äòsimple point sources‚Äô."
"Both resolved and unresolved binary stars accelerate due to
their orbits around the common center of mass which shifts the
centroid off a uniform motion trajectory. For example, given the full
epoch astrometry, it is expected thatGaia can characterise the orbits
of stars with brown dwarf companions out to 10 pc and black hole
companions out to more than 1 kpc when considering tight con-
straints of the uncertainty on the mass function ùëÄ32ùëÄ"

"gering 20 k brown dwarfs around FGK-stars out to many tens up
to a few hundreds of pc for the longer period objects (100-3000 d),
which could reach even 50 k out to several hundred pc when one is
only interested in the detection of BD candidates (e.g. for follow-
up studies) (Holl et al. subm), with black hole companions being
detectable out to several kpc."
"Similarly exoplanet orbits pull their host stars away from uni-
form motion although with a much smaller amplitude due to the
lower companion mass. From simulations it is expected that Gaia
is capable of detecting 21,000 long-period, 1-15 Jupiter mass plan-
ets during the 5 year mission (Perryman et al. 2014), more than
4 times the number of currently known exoplanets. Ranalli et al.
(2018) have further demonstrated that the 5 year Gaia mission will
be able to find Jupiter-mass planets on 3 au orbits around 1ùëÄÔøΩ stars
out to 39 pc and Neptune-mass planets out to 1.9 pc. Not only will
the presence of planets be detectable but it is expected that ‚àº 500
planets around M-dwarfs will receive mass constraints purely from
Gaia astrometry (Casertano et al. 2008; Sozzetti et al. 2014)."
"Microlensing occurs when the light from a background source
is gravitationally lensed by a foreground lensing star causing a shift
in the apparent position of the source, detectable by high precision
astrometric surveys (Miralda-Escude 1996). The deflection can be
used as a direct measurement of the lens mass as demonstrated by
Kains et al. (2017) using HST observations. A signficant amount
of work has gone towards predicting microlensing events in using
Gaia proper motions (Kl√ºter et al. 2018; Bramich 2018; McGill
et al. 2019) with 528 events expected in the extended Gaia mission
‚àº 39% of which pass astrometry quality cuts (McGill et al. 2020).
For a small number of these events Gaia will be able to determine
the lens mass to < 30% uncertainty (Kl√ºter et al. 2020)."
"Extended sources such as galaxies will have a reduced astro-
metric precision from each Gaia observation due to the increased
spread of flux.Gaia scans a source in many different directions over
the mission lifetime from which the source shape can be recon-
structed (Harrison 2011). With the Gaia epoch astrometry for the
5 year mission, Gaia will be able to distinguish between elliptical
and spiral/irregular galaxies with ‚àº 83% accuracy (Krone-Martins
et al. 2013). These classifications would be incredibly valuable for
galaxy morphology studies."
"The Gaia epoch astrometry will be first released in DR4, sev-
eral years from now. However, a (very) condensed form of this large
amount of information is stored in the summary statistics of the
astrometric solution currently published in Gaia DR2 and updated
in EDR3. Binary stars, exoplanet hosts, microlensing events and
extended sources will induce an excess noise in the astrometric
solution as they are not well described by simple point sources.
This excess noise has been modelled for binaries (Wielen 1997;
Penoyre et al. 2020) and already Belokurov et al. (2020) has found
many binaries inGaiaDR2 using the renormalised unit weight error
statistic, RUWE, that is the re-normalised square root of the reduced
ùúí2 statistic of the astrometric solution."
"RUWE is a 1D summary statistic of the residuals of the 5-
parameter astrometric solution of a source relative to the Gaia
inertial rest frame. But we can glean even more information on
the excess noise from the 5D uncertainty of the astrometric solu-
tion. The uncertainty in the 5D astrometric solution for a source
in Gaia can be expressed as the convolution of Gaia‚Äôs astrometric
measurement uncertainty expected for a simple point source and
excess noise. We term Gaia‚Äôs expected astrometric measurement
uncertainty the Astrometry Spread Function (ASF) defined as the
probability of measuring a simple point source to have astrometry
r‚Ä≤ ‚àà R5 given the true source astrometry r ‚àà R5 and apparent"
magnitude ùê∫
"ASF(r‚Ä≤) = P(r‚Ä≤ | r, ùê∫). (1)"
"The excess noise will be driven by un-modelled source character-
istics such as binary motion, exoplanet host motion, microlensing
or extended source flux as well as any calibration noise which is
not accounted for in the ASF. In this work, we‚Äôll assume that all
significant calibration effects are included in the ASF such that the
excess noise is dominated by un-modelled source characteristics.
However this assumption breaks down in some regimes, particu-
larly for bright sources in crowded regions where CCD saturation
becomes a significant issue. Possible un-accounted calibration ef-
fects should be considered when using Gaia astrometry to search
for excess noise due to genuine un-modelled source characteristics."
"Since the astrometric solution is evaluated using least squares
regression, the ASF will be Gaussian distributed"
"ASF(r‚Ä≤) = N(r‚Ä≤ ; r,Œ£(ùëô, ùëè, ùê∫)) (2)"
"where Œ£(ùëô, ùëè, ùê∫) ‚àà R5√ó5 is the expected covariance for a sim-
ple point source with position ùëô, ùëè and apparent magnitude ùê∫ as
measured by Gaia. The astrometric calibration is also a function
of source colour which was either estimated from ùê∫BP ‚àí ùê∫RP or
added as a sixth parameter of the astrometric solution, astromet-
ric_pseudo_colour. As colours are only published for a subset
of the Gaia catalogue and the astrometric correlation coefficients
for pseudo-colour are not published in DR2, we neglect colour de-
pendence of the astrometric solution in this work. For EDR3, all
pseudo-colour correlation coefficients are published and it will be
worth considering how this impacts the ASF."
"Given the ASF and published astrometric 5-parameter model
uncertainties we can reconstruct the 5D excess noise and use it to
characterise binary systems, exoplanet orbits, microlensing events
and extended sources in Gaia without requiring the epoch astrom-
etry. The focus of this paper is to construct the ASF for Gaia DR2."
"This builds on analysis of the scanning law from Boubert et al.
(2020a) and Boubert et al. (2020b) and will be used, in conjunction
with the results of Boubert & Everall (2020) to determine the se-
lection function for the subsample of Gaia DR2 with published 5D
astrometry."
"In Section 2 we provide a whistle-stop tour of the Gaia space-
craft, scanning law and how this translates to constraints on the
position, proper motion and parallax of sources. This paper is fo-
cused on Gaia DR2 for which we estimate the ASF, although we
note that the method will be directly applicable to Gaia EDR3. The
method for constructing the ASF of Gaia is derived in Section 3
and the results compared with the astrometry sample are shown in
Section 4. We will also use the ASF for an alternative derivation of
the UnitWeight Error demonstrating the applicability of the method
in Section 5."
"As a secondary motivation, theGaiaDR2 5D astrometry sam-
ple is selected from the full catalogue with a cut on the parameter
astrometric_sigma5d_max which is a function of the astromet-
ric covariance matrix. In predicting the astrometric covariance for
simple point sources, we can also estimate the contribution from
this cut to the astrometric selection function which we will present
in Section 6."
"Finally we will discuss applications of the ASF in Section 7
and provide instructions for accessing the data in Section 8 before
concluding."

2 ASTROMETRY WITH GAIA
2.1 The Scanning Law
"The Gaia spacecraft is in orbit around the Lagrange point 2 (L2),
orbiting the Sun in phase with the Earth. The spacecraft spins with
a 6 hour period around a central axis which precesses with an aspect
angle of 45 deg around the pointing connecting the satellite and the
Sun, with a 63 day period. This is similar to a spinning top which
has been left long enough to wobble. The orbit of the spacecraft
around the sun adds a third axis of rotation."
"Perpendicular to the spin axis, two fields of view (FoV) observe
in directions separated by 106.5 deg. The direction in which each
FoV is pointing at any point in time throughout Gaia‚Äôs observing
period is the scanning law."
"TheGaiaDR2 observing period runs from July 25 2014 (10:30
UTC) until May 23 2016 (11:35 UTC). The scanning law for DR2 is
published by DPAC and refined by Boubert et al. (2020a) and Bou-
bert et al. (2020b, hereafter Paper III). Whilst this tells us where
Gaia was pointing, it doesn‚Äôt tell us whether Gaia was obtaining
useful scientific measurements that contributed to the published
data products. Many time periods in the DR2 window did not re-
sult in measurements which contributed to the Gaia astrometry as
discussed in Paper III."
"In this paper we only include the scanning law in the OBMT1
interval 1192.13‚Äì3750.56 rev (Lindegren et al. 2018, hereafter L18)
which removes the Ecliptic Polar Scanning Law, an initial calibra-
tion phase of Gaia which contributed to the published photometry
but not astrometry. DPAC have published a series of additional
gaps in astrometry data taking2. We remove any time spans of the
scanning law for which the gap is flagged as ‚Äòpersistent‚Äô. Using the
published Epoch Photometry for 550,737 variable sources (Riello
et al. 2018; Evans et al. 2018; Holl et al. 2018), Paper III con-
strained additional gaps which are persistent across all data prod-
ucts of Gaia DR2 which we also remove from the scanning law.
Finally, Paper III determines the probability of an observation be-
ing recorded and used in Gaia DR2 in 19 magnitude bins. These
observation probabilities will be used to weight observations in the
ASF in Section 3.2."
2.2 Taking Observations
"Both FoVs project source images onto a single panel of CCDs
called the focal plane. On the focal plane there are 9 columns and
7 rows of CCDs, referred to as the astrometric field (AF), which
measure the position of a source although the middle row only has
8CCDs (because one of the 9CCDpositions is taken by awave front
sensor). As the spacecraft spins, stars track across the CCD panel in
the along-scan direction and are observed with up to 9 astrometric
CCDs during a single FoV transit (see e.g. Fig. 1 of Lindegren
et al. 2016). Individual CCD measurements will be referred to as
observations whilst a full track across the CCD panel is a scan
(also referred to as a FoV transit). Before the AF, sources pass over
the ‚ÄòSky Mapper‚Äô (SM) CCD which triggers the initial detection
and needs to be confirmed by the first AF CCD in order for any
observations within the scan to successfully provide ameasurement.
Each observation records the position and apparent brightness of"

"the source. If the source is recorded with ùê∫ < 13 by the SM, a 2D
observation window is assigned measuring position in the along-
scan (AL) direction and orthogonal across-scan (AC) direction. For
fainter stars with ùê∫ > 13, only the AL position is recorded."
"Observations are saved on-board Gaia in ‚ÄòStar Packets‚Äô
grouped by apparent magnitude in 19 bins(Table 1.10, Section 1.3.3
de Bruƒ≥ne et al. 2018). The majority of data is uploaded to Earth,
however some can be lost or deleted (see Section 3.3 Gaia Collab-
oration et al. 2016) changing the scanning law sampling for stars in
different Star Packet magnitude bins."
"After a first process of CCD signal level, background, and PS-
F/LSF calibration, the data is input to the AGIS pipeline (Lindegren
et al. 2012) which uses an iterative linear regression algorithm to
simultaneously fit the attitude of the spacecraft, a large number of
calibration parameters, and the position, proper motion and parallax
of all sources in Gaia DR2. We here provide a general description
of how position, proper motion and parallax can be understood to
depend on the nature of the observations a source receives, though
inGaia they are simultaneously solved from the offsets of all source
observations with respect to its (iteratively improved) internal ref-
erence system."
"The precision with which position, proper motion and parallax
of a source can be measured is heavily dependent on magnitude
(beyond ùê∫ > 13 the uncertainties will monotonically increase with
magnitude), the number of observations taken, the scan directions of
these observations and their distribution in time. More observations
will produce a greater precision therefore sources in regions of the
sky with the most scans as shown in Fig. 1a will have the best
constrained astrometry. Notably, the Galactic center in the middle
of the plot has received only ‚àº 10scans whilst the best observed
regions of the sky are scanned over 100 times."
"For the vast majority of sources, Gaia only measures position
in the AL direction and even for 2D observations, the AL position
constraint is much tighter than the AC measurement (Lindegren
et al. 2012). Therefore North-South scans in equatorial coordinates
will constrain declination, ùõø whilst East-West scans constrain right
ascension, ùõº. Fig. 1b gives the mean direction of Gaia DR2 scans
modulo ùúã such that a North-South and South-North scan appear
the same with „Äàùúô„Äâ = 0. The mean direction is estimated from the
argument of the mean vector"
"„Äàùúô„Äâ =
1
2
arg [„Äàexp(2ùëñùúô)„Äâ] . (3)"
"This statistic is published for sources in Gaia EDR3 as
scan_direction_mean_k2. Darker areas will have stronger ùõø con-
straints whilst lighter areas constrain ùõº more tightly. The difference
in accuracy in right ascension and declination depends on the clus-
tering of scan directions. The absolute value of themean scan vector,
|„Äàexp(2ùëñùúô)„Äâ| which will be ‚àº 1 for heavily clustered scans and ‚àº 0
for a spread of scan directions. This is shown in Fig. 1c where light
areas will strongly constrain position in the mean scan direction but
only provide a weak constraint in the perpendicular direction whilst
dark regions have a spread of scan directions and therefore won‚Äôt
show a strong direction preference. This statistic is also published
in Gaia EDR3 as scan_direction_strength_k2."
"Constraints on the source proper motion come frommeasuring
the position of a source at multiple different epochs and estimating
the rate of change. A larger spread of observation times will pro-
duce a tighter proper motion constraint. Fig. 1d shows the standard
deviation of observation times with light regions producing tighter
proper motion constraints whilst dark regions produce a weaker
constraint."
"Finally, source parallax is estimated from the apparent motion
of a source relative to the background of distant sources due to
Gaia‚Äôs motion around the sun on a one year period. A larger spread
of observations throughout the year will produce a tighter constraint
on the source parallax. The position of an observation in the yearly
solar orbit is described by the complex vector exp(2ùúãùëñùë°). As with
the scan direction, the clustering of observations in the year is
estimated from the absolute value of the mean vector |„Äàexp(2ùúãùëñùë°)„Äâ|.
If observations are heavily clustered at one time of year the absolute
mean will be close to 1, shown by lighter areas of Fig. 1e, and only a
weak constraint on parallax will be achieved. Values close to 0 have
well spread observations throughout the year and therefore provide
a stronger constraint on parallax."
2.3 Data
"The previous sections have provided a qualitative prediction of
Gaia‚Äôs expected performance as a function of position on the sky. In
the following sections we‚Äôll produce a quantitative estimate of the
predicted precision with whichGaia canmeasure source astrometry
as a function of position on the sky and apparent magnitude."
"Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016, 2018) provides 5D
astrometry for 1,331,909,727 of the 1,692,919,135 source in the full
DR2 catalogue. To test our predictions, we‚Äôll use the full Gaia DR2
source catalogue and 5D astrometry sample."
3 METHOD
"As input AGIS takes the 1D measurement of the position of each
source in the AL and, for bright sources, also AC direction. For
bright sources, Gaia produces a 2D observation however AGIS as-
sumes the constraints in the AL and AC directions are uncorrelated
treating them as independent 1D observations. We make the same
assumption in this work. This is a gross simplification of all the
steps which AGIS takes ‚Äì for instance, calibrating the satellite at-
titude noise ‚Äì however it allows for a very appealing and tractable
derivation of the ASF from the available data."
We will proceed with four key assumptions:
"‚Ä¢ The 1D position measurement uncertainty is Gaussian.
‚Ä¢ Individualmeasurements, includingAL andACmeasurements"
"from the same observation, are independent and uncorrelated. As
the AGIS pipeline uses the same assumption, this will not produce
any discrepancy between our predictions and the published Gaia
astrometry."
"‚Ä¢ The position measurement uncertainty is a function of source
apparentmagnitude at the time of observation only. Any dependence
of the observation precision of the satellite as a function of time
for a given apparent magnitude is neglected which we justify in
Appendix A. This also assumes that the measurement uncertainty
is colour independent."
"‚Ä¢ Astrometric parameters of different sources are assumed to be
independent. In reality measurements of different sources can be
considered independent, however due to the joint estimation of the
attitude and geometric calibration from the same set of observations,
the posterior astrometric parameters will be correlated. Pre-launch
estimates by Holl et al. (2010) predicted correlations of only a
fraction of a percent for sources separated by less than one degree
(in a fully calibrated AGIS solution dominated by photon noise).
DR1 (see Sec. D.3 of Lindegren et al. 2016) seems to be well above
that with correlation as high as perhaps 0.25 at separations up to"

and milder effects over larger spatial scales. With each successive
data release it is expected that these spatial correlations will shrink,
though they will never be zero, especially at small scales."
"Throughout this paper we also only consider sources with constant
magnitude to keep the results simple and tractable however the for-
malism is easily generalisable to variable sources. Over this section
we derive the ASF of Gaia DR2. As many different variables are
introduced, we refer the reader to Table 1 to clarify our notation."
3.1 Astrometry from linear regression
"Gaia‚Äôs goal for each source in the astrometry catalogue is to mea-
sure the five parameter astrometric solution, r ‚àà R5, consisting of
the positions, proper motions and parallax. The AGIS pipeline es-
timates the astrometry of sources through linear regression on all
observations of a single source in a step called source update (see
Sect. 5.1 of Lindegren et al. 2012). We will use the same technique
to determine the expected precision for a simple point source as a
function of apparent magnitude and position on the sky."
"Take ùëÅ observations of a source at times ùë°ùëñ with the scan
direction ùúôùëñ where ùëñ ‚àà {1, . . . , ùëÅ}. The on-sky positions of the
source at times ùë°ùëñ in ICRS coordinates are (ùõºùëñ , ùõøùëñ). The source
position relative to the solar systembarycenter at the reference epoch
(J2015.5 for Gaia DR2 L18) is ùõº0, ùõø0. The position at time ùë°ùëñ will
be a linear combination of the position at a reference epoch with
the proper motion and parallax motion. The offset due to parallax
motion is given by"
"Œîùõºùëñ cos ùõøùëñ = ‚àíùúõ (‚àíùëãùëñ sinùõº0 + ùëåùëñ cosùõº0) = ùúõŒ†ùõºùëñ (4)
Œîùõøùëñ = ‚àíùúõ (‚àíùëãùëñ cosùõº0 sin ùõø0 ‚àí ùëåùëñ sinùõº0 sin ùõø0 + ùëçùëñ cos ùõø0) = ùúõŒ†ùõøùëñ"
"where ùëãùëñ , ùëåùëñ , ùëçùëñ are the barycentric coordinates of Gaia at time ùë°ùëñ
and ùúõ is the parallax of the source. We have assumed the parallax
and proper motion are small enough such that the parallax ellipse is
only dependent on the source reference epoch position which keeps
the system of equations linear."
Therefore the position of the source at time ùë°ùëñ will be given by

3.2 Scan Weights
"As Gaia scans a source, up to 9 observations are taken with the
9 astrometric-field CCD columns. There are two ways in which
observations may not be propagated to the astrometric solution. If a
source is not detected and confirmed by the SM and first AF CCDs
and allocated a window, none of the CCDs in the scan will produce
a successful detection. Secondly, an individual CCD observation
may either not be taken or the measurement may be down-weighted
in the astrometric solution. There are many reasons why this might
happen such as stray background light, attitude calibration or the
source simply passing through the small gaps between CCD rows.
Accounting for these processes, the astrometric precision matrix
may be approximated as"
"ùëÅ‚àëÔ∏Å
ùëñ=1"
Aùëñ (13)
"where ùë¶ùëñ ‚àº Bernoulli(bùëñ) √óBinomial(9, \ùëñ) where bùëñ is the fraction
of scans used in the astrometric solution and \ùëñ is the probability of a
CCD producing a successful observation. The binomial distribution
assumes that a CCD observation is either successful or not therefore
only allowing a full weight or zero weight. The weight formula in
the AGIS pipeline (Eq. 66, Lindegren et al. 2012) does allow for
non-discrete weights however we anticipate that this will have a
small effect on our results. Assuming that the event of a successful
scan or observation are independent events, the expected value of
the weights is given by"

discuss in more detail in Section 6, the selection of the Gaia 5D
astrometry sample included a cut on astrometric_sigma5d_max.
Sources with large astrometric uncertainty would not receive 5D
astrometry and therefore, particularly at the dim end, ùúéAL would
be biased low. To mitigate this, we calculate ùúéAL (ùê∫) using all
stars in Gaia DR2 with at least 6 visibility_periods_used. For
sources without 5D astrometry we use the inverse of the published
2D astrometry covariance matrix as a proxy. This is a rough approx-
imation and therefore we suggest that our results are only trusted out

becomes significant (see Section 6)."
"The distribution of ùúéAL is shown in the top panel of Fig. 2
demonstrating a relatively flat behaviour for ùê∫ < 13 where 2D
observations are taken and time windows are truncated to avoid
saturation. For ùê∫ > 18 the variance grows with magnitude due to
photon shot noise. The red line gives themedian value in 0.1mag and
we linearly interpolate this as a function of magnitude to estimate
ùúéAL (ùê∫). For reference, the grey-scale histograms are the ùúéAL for
5D astrometry sources where the truncation for ùúéAL ‚àº 10 mas
is caused by the astrometric_sigma5d_max cut. The blue line
in the top panel of Fig. 2 is the blue line from L18. Across most
of the magnitude range, our estimate is lower than L18 by ‚àº 10%.
This is expected because we‚Äôre actually calculating slightly different
statistics. L18 used the residuals of all AL observations relative to
the best fit astrometric solution. In calculating the source astrometry,
observations are assigned weights as a function of their residuals
which disfavoured observationswith large residuals frombeing used
in the astrometric solution. Therefore the value of ùúéAL inferred by"

a spiralling apparent position observed by Gaia throughout DR2
given by the black-dashed line in the top panel of Fig. 3."
"Gaia scans this region of the sky 15 times in DR2 given by the
blue and red arrows for scans from FoV1 and FoV2 respectively.
Each scan improves the constraint on each of the five astrometry
parameters the uncertainties for which are given in the bottom panel
of Fig. 3.Gaia selects sources for the 5D astrometry cataloguewhich
have at least 6 visibility_periods_used where a visibility period
is a group of observations separated by less than four days. Where
fewer than 6 visibility periods have been observed theAGIS pipeline
places priors on the astrometry derived in Michalik et al. (2015)
and only the 2D position constraints are published. We replicate
this using the same priors and only providing uncertainties for the
ùõº‚àó0 (green solid) and ùõø0 (purple solid) parameters before the sixth
visibility period (9th scan)."
"After the sixth visibility period, the priors were dropped and
the uncertainties on `‚àóùõº (green dashed), `ùõø (purple dashed) and ùúõ
(red dotted) parameters are also shown. For simplicity, this demon-
stration assumes all observations were successful and equally likely
to contribute to the astrometry however as discussed in Section 3.2,
this is not always the case and this is corrected for by weighting
observations."
4 RESULTS
"To test that our method is producing reasonable covariance matri-
ces, we compare our predictions with the published 5D astrometry
covariances. From the Gaia DR2 astrometry sample we determine
themedian published covariance on a level 7 HEALPix grid (G√≥rski
et al. 2005) in the magnitude range ùê∫ ‚àà [18.1, 19.0] which repre-
sents a single Star Packet bin in which the scan fractions, ùëì are
unchanged."
"We estimate the predicted covariance using the formula in
Eq. 22 where ùê∫ is taken as the median apparent magnitude of stars
in the given magnitude bin and HEALPix pixel. The scan angles
and times are inferred at the central coordinates of the HEALPix
pixel. All figures are shown in Galactic coordinates."
The diagonal elements of both the median observed and pre-
"dicted covariance matrices are shown in Fig. 4 demonstrating ex-
cellent agreement down to degree scales in all components. In all
coordinates the variance is significantly enhanced in regions which
have been scanned less in DR2, most notably around the Galactic
bulge. Thin streaks of boosted variance on the sky correspond to
time periods in Gaia DR2 where data was not taken due to mirror
decontamination or other disruptive processes."
"In Fig. 5 we compare the correlation coefficients evaluated by
dividing the off-diagonal covariance elements by the square root of
the products of their respective variances. Correlation coefficients
are less dependent on the number of observations, which has largely
been divided out, and more on the scan directions and time variance
leading to a more complex and varied structure on the sky. Again,
the observed correlation (upper right triangle) and predicted cor-
relation (lower left) show excellent agreement down to small scale
variations."
"Fig. 6 provides amore direct comparison between the predicted
and observed covariances. Diagonal elements give the ratio of pre-
dicted to observed variance. Across the vast majority of the sky,
there is strong agreement with noise dominating in underscanned
regions. Two features stand out in the variance ratios where the
model has not fully captured the system. A streak of scans in the
South East and NorthWest show underestimated uncertainties from
the model. The scans in Gaia responsible for this are constrained
and discussed in Section 6. Secondly, the Galactic bulge also shows
a significant systematic underestimate against the observed vari-
ance. This is not unexpected as high source crowding can cause
single windows to be allocated to multiple sources generating spu-
rious centroid positions. The third panel of L18, Fig. B.4 shows
the same issue but manifested in the astrometric_excess_noise
of the source fits."
"We demonstrate this issue in Fig. 7 where we show the median
ùúéAL (ùê∫, ùëô, ùëè) evaluated using Eq. 21 with the median taken in ev-
ery 0.1 mag magnitude bin and HEALPix level 7 pixel divided by
ùúéAL (ùê∫) evaluated at themedianmagnitude of stars in the HEALPix
pixel. From Section 3.3, we expect ùúéAL to be independent of posi-
tion on the sky which is a key assumption in our model. Across the
sky ùúéAL shows only weak dependence on the scanning law at less
than‚àº 10%. However, particularly for brighter magnitude bins,ùúéAL
is not uniform over the sky as expected and is significantly higher in
regions of the disk and bulge with the highest source density. This
issue is further exacerbated for the bulge as it happens to reside in
a region of the sky which has been scanned very few times by Gaia
whereas the LMC and SMC which have been scanned more heavily
show no clear signal. In futureGaia data releases, the Galactic bulge
will likely receive significantly more scans reducing this issue."
"Fig. 7 also shows residual scanning law structurewhich is likely
caused by the‚àº 20% variation in the instrument precision discussed
in Appendix A. For example, the green strips in the North East and
SouthwhereùúéAL is systematically higher correspond to areaswhich
received many observations before the first decontamination when
the satellite measurement precision was at its worst as shown in
Fig. A2. Fig. 8 shows the percentage of observations which took
place before the first decontamination event in DR2 for which the
highest regions match exactly with regions of the sky in Fig. 7 with
enhanced ùúéAL. The diagonal elements of Fig. 6 show that these
features are comparable to the background noise level and so are
not of significant concern."
"The off-diagonal elements of Fig. 6 show the difference be-
tween predicted and observed correlation coefficients. The struc-
ture of the scanning law can be seen in white as the regions which
are most heavily scanned will have the lowest uncertainty. There is"

"distribution, UWE ‚àº Œì [a/2, a/2] such that the expected value
is 1 and the variance is inversely proportional to the degrees of
freedom. However any excess stellar motion or an extended flux
distribution will introduce an excess UWE above 1 as happens for
binary systems (Penoyre et al. 2020) or astrometric microlensing
events (McGill et al. 2020). Gaia publishes ùúí2 and the degrees
of freedom a = ùëÅ ‚àí 5 for all stars with 5D astrometry in DR2
from which UWE can be calculated. However, the published ùúí2 is
plagued by the DoF bug (L18) which makes values unreliable to
use for estimating the excess noise."
"This can be remedied by renormalising the published UWE
as a function of colour and apparent magnitude to produce a new
statistic, RUWE4. RUWE is normalised such that the 41st percentile
is 1 as this was found to represent well behaved sources where the
median showed significant contamination from sources with excess
error. This works well at face value and produces a usable statistic"
4 http://www.rssd.esa.int/doc_fetch.php?id=3757412
"however there are two limitations. Firstly RUWE does not follow
a well defined ùúí2 distribution as would be expected from UWE,
therefore estimating the significance of excess noise is challenging.
Secondly, in cases where excess noise is not equally likely in all
colours and apparentmagnitudes, the renormalisation can hide some
of the expected excess. Thiswould be problematicwhen establishing
the binary fraction as a function of colour and absolute magnitude
which is expected to vary considerably between stellar populations

6 ASTROMETRIC SELECTION
"In order to construct unbiased dynamical models of the Milky Way,
it is critically important that we have a strong understanding of the
completeness of our sample. Boubert & Everall (2020) produced
the selection function for the full Gaia DR2 catalogue however the
subset of DR2 with 5D astrometry constitutes a biased subsample
and therefore an astrometry selection function is required for studies
which rely on parallax or proper motion data. The Gaia DR2 5D
astrometry sample is the subset of the full sample that satisfies the
cuts (L18, Section 4.3):"
"‚Ä¢ ùê∫ < 21
‚Ä¢ visibility_periods_used > 5
‚Ä¢ astrometric_sigma5d_max > 1.2 √ó ùõæ(ùê∫)"
"where ùõæ(ùê∫) = max
[
1, 100.2(ùê∫‚àí18)"
"To construct the selection function for the 5D astrometry sam-
ple we can combine the effect of these cuts with the full sample
selection function"
P(S5Dast) = P(S5Dast |SDR2)P(SDR2) (31)
"where S5Dast is the event that a source is published with 5D astrom-
etry and SDR2 is the event that a source is included in DR2 with
or without 5D astrometry. P(SDR2) is the full Gaia DR2 selection
function estimated in Boubert & Everall (2020). The probability of
a star in DR2 receiving 5D astrometry, P(S5Dast |SDR2), is governed
by the three cuts outlined above."
"The second cut on visibility_periods_used (ùëòVP) is a com-
plex function of the scanning law and detection probability and
will be the subject of a future work. Here we will focus on the
astrometric_sigma5d_max (ùúé5Dmax) cut."

"there is also a small excess of sources at large ùúå. The precise cause
of this tail is unclear but since any cuts on ùúé5Dmax will be on the

selection function. Priors used for each of the parameters in the

nitude is modelled with a single Gaussian Process. For values of
the same parameter at different magnitudes, the GP uses a square
exponential kernel with variance ùë† and scale length ùëô. For different

of ùëô = 0.224, ùë† = 2.578. The posterior GP is shown in Fig. 15
where the blue solid and red dashed lines are the two components
for each parameter. Due to a lack of bright sources in Gaia DR2

7 DISCUSSION
7.1 Excess Covariance
"In this work we have derived and discussed the importance of the
ASF for analysing simple point sources in Gaia DR2. However
we haven‚Äôt established how to use the ASF to estimate the excess
covariance or precisely how this can be interpreted."
"Consider a source with true 5D astrometry, ùëü. However the
source is not a simple point source such that the apparent position
as a function of time is not well modelled by the 5D astrometric
solution. If the excess noise may be parameterised by a 5D covari-
ance, E, the probability of measuring the apparent 5D astrometry
as rùê∏ will be given by"
"P(rùê∏ ) = N(rùê∏ ; r,E). (40)"
"If one attempts to measure this source, the uncertainty with which
the 5D astrometry is measured is given by the ASF"
"P(r‚Ä≤) = N(r‚Ä≤ ; rùê∏ ,Œ£). (41)"
"Bymultiplying the two distributions together andmarginalising over
rùê∏ , we can determine the probability distribution of the measured
5D astrometry"
"P(r‚Ä≤) =
‚à´
d5rùê∏ N(r‚Ä≤ ; rùê∏ ,Œ£) N (rùê∏ ; r,E) (42)"
"= N
(
r‚Ä≤ ; r,"
"(
Œ£
‚àí1 + E‚àí1"
")‚àí1)
= N(r‚Ä≤ ; r,C)."
"Therefore, in this vastly oversimplified situation, the final mea-
surement uncertainty for the 5D astrometry is given by the convo-
lution of the excess noise and the ASF (providing the contribution
from the observation measurement uncertainty)."
"There are two significant issues with this interpretation when
considering the astrometry published by Gaia. Firstly, the AGIS
pipeline does not formally infer the measurement uncertainty in-
duced by excess noise. Residuals beyond simple point source as-
trometry are absorbed into a 1D excess noise parameter for each
source as well as impacting the weights used for the given ob-
servations. The second problem is that source excess noise can
disguise itself as a shift in the simple point source astrometry. As
shown in Penoyre et al. (2020), excess binary motion can have
complex effects on the posterior astrometry from Gaia including
a phenomenon called the proper motion anomaly (Kervella et al.
2019). Interpretation of the excess covariance will require simulat-
ing stellar populations and emulating the AGIS pipeline in order to
forward model how the intrinsic properties of the source relate to
the posterior excess."
7.2 Mock observations
"Whilst we have entirely focused on the implications of the ASF for
constraining excess source noise, it is also directly applicable to
simulations in order to generate mock Gaia catalogues for Milky
Way analogues."
"Recent simulations such as Auriga (Grand et al. 2017) and
VINTERGATAN (Agertz et al. 2020) have demonstrated the abil-
ity of the latest generation of cosmological simulations to produce
Milky Way analogues which are excellent tools for studying the
physical processes which govern the evolution of our galaxy. Per-
forming a direct comparison with Gaia observations requires the
Gaia selection functions and measurement uncertainty. The ASF
provides the expected uncertainty of 5D astrometry for a simple
point source. Given a simulated star with astrometry r as observed
from the sun, the astrometry that would be measured by Gaia, r‚Ä≤
can be inferred by sampling from the ASF"
"r‚Ä≤ ‚àº N(r,Œ£(ùê∫, ùëô, ùëè)). (43)"
8 ACCESSING THE ASF
"The ASF is a useful tool for inferring excess astrometric covariance
of Gaia 5D astrometry sources. To make this accessible, we‚Äôve"
"MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì18 ()"
"16 A. Everall, D. Boubert, S. E. Koposov, L. Smith and B. Holl"
"added a module to the Python package scanninglaw (https://
github.com/gaiaverse/scanninglaw) (Boubert et al. 2020b).
The user can ask the question ‚ÄòWhat astrometric covariance would
Gaia have published if my star was a simple point source?‚Äô."
"As always, this is demonstrated by determining the ASF co-
variance of the fastest main-sequence star in the Galaxy (S5-HVS1,
Koposov et al. 2020) for Gaia DR2. The diagonal elements of the
output covariance give the variance in ùõº‚àó0, ùõø0, ùúõ (mas"

9 CONCLUSION
"The Astrometry Spread Function is the astrometric uncertainty dis-
tribution which would be expected for a point source with linear
motion relative to the solar system barycenter (simple point source)
given the source apparent magnitude and position on the sky.Gaia‚Äôs
DPAC estimate the astrometric solution using an iterative linear re-
gression algorithm.Given the uncertainty of individual observations
and the scanning law, we have been able to reconstruct the astro-
metric covariance that would be expected for a simple point source
observed by Gaia DR2. The ASF is a 5D multivariate Gaussian
distribution with mean 0 and covariance Œ£ ‚àà R5√ó5 where we have
formally derived Œ£(ùê∫, ùëô, ùëè)."
"Assuming the bulk of stars in the Gaia DR2 5D astrometry
sample are simple point sources down to Gaia‚Äôs detection limit,
we compare our result with the published covariances and find ex-
tremely good agreement down to sub-degree scales on the sky. The
only region with marginal disagreement is the highest source den-
sity regions of the bulge where the combination of source crowding
and few scans in Gaia DR2 invalidate our assumptions. Therefore
we caution the use of the ASF in highly crowded regions with low
scan counts."
"We used the ASF in combination with the published covari-
ance to infer unit weight error for Gaia DR2 sources. The strong
agreement with the published UWE demonstrates that the ASF can
be used to find the excess error inGaia observations due to physical
source characteristics. The ASF will be a valuable tool for exploit-
ing Gaia data to model binary stars, astrometric microlens events
and extended sources."
"Finally we applied the ASF to predict the selection function
contribution from the cut on astrometric_sigma5d_max used to
generate the Gaia DR2 5D astrometry sample. This will be a key
component of the full astrometry selection function which is a vital"
"tool for unbiased modelling of Milky Way kinematics from Gaia‚Äôs
5D astrometry."

APPENDIX A: TIME DEPENDENCE
"To estimate the Gaia astrometric precision, we have assumed that
all observations at the same apparent magnitude have the same
precision. This assumption will break down if the precision ofGaia
is time dependent."
"Without any epoch astrometry, it is challenging to assess
the scale of the impact of this time dependence on the poste-
rior precision. We are however provided epoch photometry for
550,737 sources. The astrometric uncertainty should scale with
ùúéAL ‚àº ùúé ùëì / ùëì where ùëì is the observed flux of the source as both are
dominated by photon count noise. The centroid is actually mainly
sensitive to the slope of the wings of the LSF/PSF while the flux
measurement to the core (as there is the most signal), but to first
degree this relation should hold to understand how the centroid
uncertainty depends on magnitude and time."
"We take all 17,712,391 observations in the epoch photometry
and find the median ùúé ùëì / ùëì in 0.2mag bins shown in Fig. A1. We
subtract the median off all data leaving the residuals. The distribu-
tion of residual errors against observation time is given in Fig. A2"
"Figure A2. The relative flux error, recentered and renormalised by the
median as a function of magnitude from Fig. A1, varies as a function of
time throughout Gaia DR2 due to mirror contamination, micro-meteoroid
impacts and variations in background flux. Data taken during the Ecliptic
Polar Scanning Law (green) and decontamination events (pink) we not used
in the Gaia DR2 astrometry. The running median (blue solid) of the ob-
servations does not vary significantly from zero relative to the variance in
individual measurements. This justifies the assumption that the astrometric
measurement uncertainty is not a strong function of time."
"for eachGaia field-of-view (FoV). AsGaia operates, material from
the satellite condenses and accumulates on the mirrors scattering
light and reducing the precision of observations. To mitigate this,
the spacecraft was heated up to evaporate the condensation and
clean the mirrors (see Section 4.2.1 Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016).
These decontamination events (pink shaded regions) have taken
place twice in Gaia DR2 (L18). The impact of the first decontami-
nation event on the flux error is significant however at later times,
the measurement precision does not degrade appreciably. In fact,
any longer term trends are insignificant compared to the short term
fluctuations on short (‚àº 10 revolution) timescales."
"The epoch flux supports the conjecture that the measurement
precision of Gaia does not significantly change with time."
APPENDIX B: DOF BUG
"During the calibration of excess noise in Gaia DR2, the degrees
of freedom parameter was erroneously used as the total number
of AL and AC observations rather than only AL observations as
intended. For a full explanation we refer the interested reader to
L18, Appendix A."
"The result of this bugwas that sources brighter thanùê∫ = 13, for
which 2D observations were used, received overestimated measure-
ment uncertainties. Through the attitude calibration, this indirectly"
