"We present the first searches for gravitational waves from r-modes of the Crab pulsar, coherently
and separately integrating data from three stretches of the first two observing runs of Advanced
LIGO using the F-statistic. The second run was divided in two by a glitch of the pulsar roughly
halfway through. The frequencies and derivatives searched were based on radio measurements of
the pulsar’s spin-down parameters as described in Caride et al., Phys. Rev. D 100, 064013 (2019).
We did not find any evidence of gravitational waves. Our best 90% confidence upper limits on
gravitational wave intrinsic strain were 1.5× 10−25 for the first run, 1.3× 10−25 for the first stretch
of the second run, and 1.1×10−25 for the second stretch of the second run. These are the first upper
limits on gravitational waves from r-modes of a known pulsar to beat its spin-down limit, and they
do so by more than an order of magnitude in amplitude or two orders of magnitude in luminosity."
I. INTRODUCTION
"Rapidly rotating neutron stars might be detectable
emitters of long lived quasi-monochromatic radiation
known as continuous gravitational waves (GWs) [1]. The
emission mechanism for continuous waves could be a
nonaxisymmetric mass quadrupole (“mountain”) or a
current-quadrupolar r-mode. Hence the detection of con-
tinuous GWs might help reveal the underlying properties
of neutron star interiors. The GW frequencies of many
pulsars lie in the most sensitive band of the Laser In-
terferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), so
these rapidly rotating neutron stars are attractive targets
for continuous GW searches [2]."
"The r-modes, whose frequencies are mainly determined
by the Coriolis force, are unstable to GW emission [3, 4]
even allowing for various damping mechanisms [5]. Hence
they might amplify and sustain themselves, and might be
the most interesting possibility for continuous GWs. R-
modes might play an important role in the spin-downs of
the fastest young neutron stars [6] and in the regulation of
spin periods of some older accreting neutron stars [7, 8].
Comparison of the GW frequency to the spin frequency
determined from timing radio or x-ray pulses could mea-
sure the compactness of a pulsar [9], and the existence of
r-modes at certain frequencies could constrain the prop-
erties of the neutron superfluid [10]."
"Some GW searches, starting with Ref. [11], have set
upper limits on r-mode GW emission. However most of
these have been broad band searches for neutron stars not
previously known as pulsars. The searches themselves did
not take any extra steps to account for r-mode rather
than mass-quadrupole emission; rather the results could
be interpreted in terms of r-modes [12]."
"Caride et al. [13] showed that dedicated searches for
r-modes from known pulsars are feasible. The key is"

"to search the right range of frequencies and frequency
derivatives, which are significantly different from the
more often considered case of mass-quadrupole emission.
Not surprisingly, as with other GW searches for pul-
sars, the Crab is the first prospect to beat the spin-
down limit using LIGO data. The spin-down limit as-
sumes that all the rotational energy is lost in the form
of GWs, and represents a milestone a search must beat
to have a chance of detection. Recently Fesik and
Papa [14] first published an r-mode pulsar search sim-
ilar to that proposed by Caride et al. [13], for another
pulsar which is interesting for different reasons; but they
did not beat its spin-down limit. The Crab is a rela-
tively nearby pulsar with one of the fastest known spin-
down rates, and thus it has one of the highest spin-
down limits. Its rotational frequency changes at the rate
−3.69 × 10−10 Hz/s [15, 16]. The Crab’s pulse timing is
constantly measured by electromagnetic (EM) observa-
tions, so the spin frequency evolution of the Crab is well
known during the LIGO first observing run (O1) and
second observing run (O2)."
"For various reasons we know that the Crab is not emit-
ting GW at or near the spin-down limit. Alford and
Schwenzer [17] have argued that, if the r-mode instability
operates similarly in all neutron stars, the Crab is prob-
ably spinning to slowly to be unstable in the presence
of common damping mechanisms. Observations of the
Crab nebula indicate that most of the rotational energy
is lost powering the nebula via synchrotron and inverse
Compton radiation from the pulsar wind, and a few per-
cent is lost in the narrow light beam [18]. Recent GW
searches [19, 20] have concluded that less than 0.01%
of the Crab’s rotational energy loss is through mass-
quadrupole gravitational radiation. The braking index n
of the Crab (the logarithmic derivative of its spin-down
with respect to frequency) is 2.519. This is closer to the
n = 3 expected for magnetic dipole radiation [21] than
to the n = 7 expected for r-mode emission [6]. Such a
low braking index is another indicator that GW emission
is a small fraction of the spin-down limit. How small has
not been quantified in a model-independent way or for
r-modes. But Palomba [22] found that, for a class of rea-
sonable mass-quadrupole models, the measured braking"

"index of the Crab means it is emitting GW at least a
factor of a few below the spin-down limit. We take this
to suggest that any r-mode GW signal from the Crab
must be at least a factor of a few (in strain) below the
spin-down limit. Therefore a GW search must beat the
spin-down limit by a factor of a few in amplitude (an
order of magnitude in luminosity) to be interesting."
"Nevertheless, Caride et al. [13] showed that a search
of the Crab with interesting sensitivity is feasible, and
we confirm this. We performed searches for the Crab
in O1 and O2 data (the publicly available LIGO data
sets at the time of writing) using the matched filtering-
based technique known as the F-statistic. While we did
not find any evidence of a GW signal, we were able to set
upper limits beating the spin-down limit by an interesting
amount over a wide parameter space."
II. R-MODE SEARCH METHOD
"Our search is based on a matched filtering technique
known as the F-statistic. Developed by Jaranowski et al.
[23] for a single interferometer and by Cutler and Schutz
[24] for multiple interferometers, it is a statistical pro-
cedure for the detection of the continuous gravitational
waves. The F-statistic accounts for the amplitude mod-
ulation due to the daily rotation of Earth in a computa-
tionally efficient manner. In the presence of a signal, 2F
is a non-central chi squared distribution with four degrees
of freedom and the non-centrality parameter is approx-
imately the power signal-to-noise ratio. The F-statistic
is one half the log of the likelihood function maximized
over the unknown strain, phase constant, inclination an-
gle and polarization angle. The main issue when using
the F-statistic for this type of search, as described by
Caride et al. [13], is to find the ranges of frequencies and
frequency derivatives to search."
"Pulsars are slowly spinning down due to GW emission
and other losses of rotational energy. The evolution of the
rotational frequency ν of a spinning down neutron star in
the frame of the solar system barycenter is approximated
by"
"ν(t) = ν (t0) + ν̇ (t0) (t− t0) +
1"
"2
ν̈ (t0) (t− t0)"
"2
, (1)"
"where t0 is a reference time (often the start time of the
observation) and dots indicate time derivatives. Gener-
ally"
"...
ν is not needed for less than a year of integration"
"time [13]. The frequency evolution is precisely known
from electromagnetic observations. It might depart from
the above approximation due to timing noise or glitches.
Glitches are sudden increases in spin frequency followed
by exponential recovery to the pre-glitch frequency [25].
Since the Crab glitched during O2, we divided that search
into pre- and post-glitch stretches. More on the Crab pul-
sar timing for our searches will be discussed in Section III.
Timing noise is residual phase wandering of pulses rela-
tive to the normal spin down model. Timing noise will
deviate GW phases from Taylor series for time scales of
a year or longer [26]. Assuming the GW timing noise is
similar to the one observed in EM pulses, the mismatch of
the Crab ephemeris during LIGO S5 run from the model
with no timing noise is less than 1% [27]. So, for all our
searches (about four months of data each), timing noise
should not significantly mismatch the templates from sig-
nal."
"For a Newtonian star with spin frequency ν, the r-
mode GW frequency is approximately f = 4"
"3
ν [28]. The"
"frequency ratio deviates from 4/3 when corrections due to
general relativity, rapid rotation, superfluidity, magnetic
fields and core-crust coupling are considered [9]. For fast
rotating neutron stars, the elastic restoring force on the
crust couples with the Coriolis restoring r-modes result-
ing in avoided crossings [29]. These are small frequency
bands where the simple relation between f and ν is dras-
tically altered as modes change identities. Away from
avoided crossings, the r-mode frequency as a function of
spin frequency is approximately"
"f = Aν −B
(
ν"
")2
ν, (2)"
"where νK is the Kepler frequency. Here, as in Ref. [13],
we neglect effects other than slow rotation and general
relativity. The effect of rotation is to decrease the mode
frequency in an inertial frame, so A and B are positive."
"The ranges of A and B are chosen as in Ref. [13]: We
consider a range of compactness of neutron stars (0.11 ≤
M/R ≤ 0.31) [9] which comes from the uncertainty in the
equation of state. The range of compactness gives a range
1.39 ≤ A ≤ 1.57. The range of B is derived from the
relation of f/ν to the ratio of the rotational energy (T ) to
the gravitational potential energy (W ) [30]. For different
polytropic indices and compactnesses, the range is 1.23–
1.95 times the rotational parameter (T/W ). Caride et al.
[13] converted T/W into (ν/νk)"
2 using M/R = 0.1 which
"gives a maximum value of B = 0.195. The minimum
value of B is not well known, so it is taken to be zero."
"Our search covers the parameters (f , ḟ , f̈). The pa-
rameter ranges for our searches are given by Caride et al.

"where, f is spin frequency, ḟ and f̈ are the first and

Bmax = 0.195."
"We use the parameter space metric gij to control the
computational cost of our search. The proper distance
between two templates is given by the mismatch (µ),
which is the loss in signal-to-noise ratio when signal falls
exactly between two template waveforms [31]. Templates
used to filter the data are chosen with a spacing deter-
mined by this mismatch. The template number is given
by dividing the proper volume of the parameter space by
the proper volume per template [13]:"

, (7)"
"where i, j stand for parameters (f, ḟ , f̈) = (0, 1, 2) and
Tspan is the time spanned by the observation."
"We look at the highest values of the F-statistic (2F∗)
that survived the automated vetoes (described below).
The probability that a given value of 2F∗ will be observed
when no signal is present is given by [11]:"
"P (N ; 2F∗) = NP (χ24; 2F
∗)[P (χ24; 2F"
∗)]N−1 (8)
"where N is the number of templates (assuming statisti-
cally independence) and P (χ24; 2F∗) is the central χ2 cu-
mulative distribution function with four degrees of free-
dom. The above false alarm probability and correspond-
ing threshold F∗ assume gaussian noise, which is not
always the case. A high 2F is not enough to claim the
detection, as instrumental lines might act as a periodic
signal. We follow each search with the interferometer
consistency veto as in (e.g.) Ref. [33], which discards
candidates when the joint 2F value from the two inter-
ferometers is less than for either single interferometer."
III. THE CRAB PULSAR
"The Crab pulsar is the remnant of a supernova explo-
sion seen by Chinese astronomers in the year 1054 AD."

O2 (late) 29.64380 −3.688438× 10−10 2.5× 10−20
"TABLE II. Timing of the Crab pulsar at the beginning of our
three different searches. The timing is measured by Jodrell
Bank Observatory [16] and interpolated to the start time of
each LIGO run. The displayed ν̈ is the maximum monthly
value observed during each run."
"This is our first target due to its high spin down limit,
which is well above the LIGO O1 sensitivity curve [13].
The rotational energy loss of the pulsar is given by
Ė = 4π2Izzνν̇ ≈ 4.33×1031 W, where (Izz = 1038 kg m2)
is the principal moment of inertia [34]. The spin-down
power of the Crab is high enough that, even if r-mode
gravitational wave emission is only responsible for a small
fraction of it, the GWs could be detectable [13]."
"The sky location of the Crab pulsar in J2000 coordi-
nates is [16]"
"α = 05h34m31.94,s"
"δ = +22◦00′52.1.′′
(9)"
"The spin frequency and its derivative [16] were ob-
tained from the Jodrell Bank observatory monthly
ephemeris and interpolated to the start dates of the
LIGO run from the nearest dates of 09/16/2015 (O1),
11/23/2016 (early O2) and 04/16/2017 (late O2). There
were no glitches of the Crab during O1, so the whole run
was coherently integrated. The Crab glitched at 2017-
03-27 22:04:48.000 UTC [25] during the O2 run, approx-
imately halfway through. So we divided the O2 run into
two roughly equal stretches. The glitch was very small
by Crab standards (∆ν"
"ν
= 2.14×10−9) [25], so we started"
"the search of late O2 a few hours afterwards although the
post-glitch relaxation time could be days. Our code does
not yet have the ability to combine pre- and post-glitch
stretches, so we kept the searches separate and present
them as such."
"Fast spinning down pulsars are contaminated by timing
noise [35], especially when ν̈ appears negative. During
our observational time, the monthly ν̈ measurement was
fluctuating. This might be due to external torque from
the magnetosphere and might not affect the high density
interior which sources GWs. So we chose the maximum ν̈
of our search to be the maximum value observed during
the observational time and the minimum ν̈ to be zero.
The extra number of templates required by including ν̈ is
factor of a few. Thus the searches were not too expensive
due to our probably over-wide range of ν̈."
"FIG. 1. Upper limits (90% confidence) on intrinsic strain vs.
frequency, in 0.1 Hz bands, for our three searches are plotted
below the legend. The points arranged in straight lines above
the legend indicate “bad” bands (see text)."
IV. SEARCH IMPLEMENTATION
"We used data from the Gravitational Wave Open Sci-
ence Center (GWOSC) [36], starting with time-domain
strain data sampled at 4 kHz. We downloaded all such
O1 data for the official duration of the run (from GPS
times 1126051217 to 1137254417) from both interferom-
eters (H1 and L1), gating on only “CBC CAT1” vetoes.
These indicate disastrous conditions for the instruments,
such as loss of laser power. We ignored the other vetoes
used in searches for binary black holes and neutron stars
because they are aimed at short-duration disturbances
which are not significant for continuous wave searches.
We then used the code lalapps MakeSFTDAG from LAL-
Suite [37] to generate 1800 s long short Fourier trans-
forms (SFTs), version 2 format, high pass filtered with a
knee frequency of 7 Hz and windowed with the default
Tukey window. This produced 6,389 SFTs for O1 (3,474
from H1 and 2,915 from L1). A similar procedure for O2
produced 14,231 SFTs (7,242 from H1 and 6,989 from
L1). Our r-mode searches used a modified version of a
code usually used to search for supernova remnants, most
recently in Ref. [33], and was performed on the Texas
Tech University High Performance Computing Center’s
“Quanah” cluster."
"The frequency bands of the searches were 41.2–46.6 Hz
(O1) and 41.1–46.6 Hz (O2). The minimum and maxi-
mum frequencies were rounded down and up respectively
from the range in Eq. (3) because we used upper limit
bands of a uniform 0.1 Hz. We used a bank of templates
with minimal match µ = 0.2. The ideal template num-
bers for O1, early O2 and late O2 are 2.3×109, 9.7×108
and 4.0 × 109 respectively. The actual search produced
1.7 × 1010, 1.2 × 1010 and 3.6 × 1010 templates. The
number of templates of each search is around an order
of magnitude greater than the ideal number. This is be-"
"cause the code uses extra templates to cover the bound-
aries outside the parameter space [11]. The O1, early O2
and late O2 searches used computational times of 1584,
944 and 3892 core hours on Quanah respectively."
"Unlike in previous work such as Ref. [33], we did not
use the “Fscan veto,” based on spectrograms of the data,
to eliminate candidates caused by nonstationarity and
spectral lines. Applying that veto resulted in the elimi-
nation of almost 1/4 of the frequency band of each search.
This was due to the wide “wings” of the veto account-
ing for varying Doppler shifts, spin-down values, and the
width of the Dirichlet kernel (used in computing 2F).
However, the same factors mean that template waveforms
have less overlap with stationary instrumental lines than
in shorter searches done previously, and so eliminating
this veto did not produce an unmanageable number of
candidate signals (see below)."
"After using the interferometer consistency veto, we
considered as candidates batch jobs which produced 2F
values exceeding a threshold corresponding to a 5% false
alarm probability (95% detection confidence) in gaussian
noise. We found 29 search jobs with candidates: 16 in
O1, 7 in early O2, and 6 in late O2. For each such job we
inspected 2F histograms and plots of 2F vs. frequency
as in Ref. [38] and later works based on it. All candidate
jobs showed distorted histograms and wide band distur-
bances, indicating instrumental rather than astrophysical
origin. Many events just barely passed the interferome-
ter consistency veto, which is a lenient veto. Although
we did not use the known spectral lines (and combs) de-
scribed in Ref. [39] as a priori vetoes, we found that
many of our candidates were coincident with those lines
or with new lines in the combs extending beyond those
listed in Ref. [39]."
"Therefore we do not claim any detection of gravita-
tional waves."
V. UPPER LIMITS
"In the absence of a detection, we set upper limits on
gravitational wave emission. The method is similar to
Ref. Lindblom and Owen [33] among others. Upper limits
are the weakest signal that can be detected from our
search with a certain probability, in our case chosen to
be 90%. This means we set the false dismissal rate to
10%, and the loudest 2F observed (even if vetoed) will
set the false alarm rate [38]. Upper limit frequency bands
are chosen to be small enough for the interferometer noise
to stay reasonably constant. The upper limit band for all
the searches is 0.1 Hz."
"First, we use a computationally inexpensive Monte
Carlo integration to find the intrinsic strain amplitude
(h0) that exceeds the loudest observed 2F 90% of the
time. This includes marginalization over inclination and
polarization angles, which reduce the actual strain am-
plitude in the data compared to h0. Consistent with the
F-statistic (and with most other directed searches), we"
"FIG. 2. Upper limits (90% confidence) on r-mode amplitude
vs. frequency, in 0.1 Hz bands, for our three searches. “Bad”
bands (see text) have been dropped."
"used priors corresponding to an isotropic probability dis-
tribution of the pulsar’s rotation axis. In the case of the
Crab the axis is known fairly well [40] and this informa-
tion could be used to improve the sensitivity of a GW
search [41]. However the LALSuite code does not have
this capability."
"After the Monte Carlo, we use computationally expen-
sive (20–30% of the cost of search) [38] software injection
searches to validate the upper limit. In each upper limit
band we inject 1000 signals with various h0. For each h0
we use variable f, ḟ , f̈ and inclination and polarization
angles, and consider an injection “detected” if it pro-
duces F > F∗. Comparing this to the Monte Carlo is
another check for contaminated frequency bands."
"Our upper limits on intrinsic strain in 0.1 Hz bands for
our three searches are shown in Fig. 1. In some bands
injections indicated that the true false dismissal rate was
higher than 10%, typically due to many and/or strong
spectral lines. In Fig. 1, for the sake of visibility, these
bad bands are given constant values well above the upper
limits and thus appear along horizontal lines above the
figure legend. The data files are included in the supple-
mental material to this article [42]. The best 90% confi-
dence level upper limits on intrinsic strain amplitude are
1.5× 10−25 (O1), 1.3× 10−25 (early O2) and 1.1× 10−25
(late O2). O2 upper limits beat the spin-down limit by
more than an order of magnitude. Late O2 was the most
sensitive because it had the most data and the noise spec-
trum was better (lower) than the other searches. Upper
limits can also be characterized in terms of a statistical
factor Θ [32] of the form"
"h0 = Θ
√
Sh/Tdat, (10)"
"where Tdat is the data live time and Sh is the power
spectral density of strain noise. We achieved an average
Θ ' 36, typical for coherent directed searches. Another"
figure of merit is the “sensitivity depth” [43]
"D =
√
Sh/h0 ="
"√
Tdat/Θ. (11)"
"Our searches achieveD ' 100 Hz−1/2, comparable to nar-
row band searches for known pulsars (among the best
directed searches)."
"We can also set upper limits on r-mode amplitude.
The coversion of h0 to r-mode amplitude (α) is shown
by Owen [12], who took the fiducial value of moment of
inertia (Izz = 10"
"38 kg m2) and typical M = 1.4M�. We
convert the upper limit on intrinsic strain h0 to r-mode
amplitude α using"
α = 0.028
")(
100 Hz"
")3
. (12)"
"Upper limits on α are plotted (without the bad bands) in
Fig. 2. The best r-mode amplitude upper limits for our
different searches are 0.085 (O1), 0.075 (early O2) and
0.067 (late O2)."
VI. CONCLUSION
"Our searches of LIGO O1 and O2 data for the Crab
pulsar did not detect r-mode GWs. However, we set
the first upper limits on r-mode GW emission from this
pulsar. These upper limits beat the spin-down limit by an
order of magnitude in strain or two orders of magnitude
in luminosity, and are the first to do so for r-modes from a
known pulsar. The corresponding upper limits on r-mode
amplitude are not competitive with most predictions of r-
mode saturation in young neutron stars such as Ref. [44]."
"In the near future, with more and better data, we will
be able to extend this type of search to longer data sets
with lower noise, thereby increasing sensitivity. We will
also be able to beat the spin-down limits of more pulsars.
With improvements in our code, we will be able to take
advantage of the spin axis orientation for those pulsars
(such as the Crab) for which it is known and integrate
data sets with glitches in them."
