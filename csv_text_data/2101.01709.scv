tron star observations have begun to yield novel insights into the nature
of strongly interacting matter in the high-density regime where current

field theory has developed into a powerful framework to study nuclear
matter properties with quantified uncertainties in the moderate-density
"regime for modeling neutron stars. In this article, we review recent"
developments in chiral effective field theory and focus on many-body
perturbation theory as a computationally efficient tool for calculating
the properties of hot and dense nuclear matter. We also demonstrate
how effective field theory enables statistically meaningful comparisons

1. Introduction
Neutron stars are one of Nature’s most intriguing astronomical objects and provide a unique
"laboratory for studying strongly interacting, neutron-rich matter under extreme conditions."
"With masses of about 1 − 2 times that of the Sun and radii of only approximately 10 km,
neutron stars contain the densest form of matter in the observable Universe and lie just"
at the threshold for collapse to a black hole. Much has already been learned about neu-
"tron stars through mass and radius measurements, pulsar timing, x-ray observations, and"
gravitational-wave measurements of binary mergers in the new era of multimessenger as-
"tronomy (see, e.g., Refs. (1, 2, 3) for reviews). But many interesting questions remain to"
"be answered, especially regarding the nature of ultra-compressed matter located in the in-"
ner cores of heavy neutron stars where a variety of exotic new states of matter have been
theorized to exist.
"While neutron stars are bound together by gravity acting over macroscopic length scales,"
strong short-ranged nuclear interactions provide the essential pressure support to counteract
gravitational collapse. The central densities in the heaviest neutron stars may reach up to
"5−10n0, where n0 ≈ 0.16 fm−3 is the nucleon number density typical of heavy atomic nuclei
(the associated mass density is ρ0 ≈ 2.7× 1014 g cm−3). Although the strong interaction is
in principle described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) over all relevant energy scales,"
at present no systematic computational method is available to calculate the properties of
the high-density matter in the inner cores of heavy neutron stars.
"QCD: quantum
chromodynamics"
"ChEFT: chiral
effective field theory"
"With chiral effective field theory (ChEFT), however, a powerful tool has emerged to"
carry out microscopic calculations of nuclear matter properties at densities up to around
"2n0. Instead of QCD’s quarks and gluons, ChEFT is formulated in terms of nucleons and"
"pions (and delta isobars), which are the effective strong interaction degrees of freedom"
"present throughout most of the neutron star interior. In its range of validity, ChEFT"
provides a systematic expansion for two- and multi-nucleon interactions consistent with the
"2 Drischler, Holt, and Wellenhofer"
symmetries of low-energy QCD. The unresolved short-distance physics is parameterized in
terms of contact interactions whose low-energy couplings are fitted to experimental data.
An essential advantage over phenomenological approaches is that theoretical uncertainties
can be quantified by analyzing the order-by-order convergence of the ChEFT expansion. In
"the last few years, the combination of systematic nuclear matter predictions from ChEFT,"
"uncertainty quantification, and neutron star observations has developed into a new avenue"
for constraining the high-density regime of the nuclear equation of state (EOS).
"EOS: equation of
state"
"MBPT: many-body
perturbation theory"
In this review our aim is to describe recent advances in microscopic ChEFT calculations
of the nuclear EOS and their application to neutron stars. [For recent reviews of nuclear
"structure calculations with ChEFT see, e.g., Refs. (4, 5, 6, 7).] We highlight many-body"
perturbation theory (MBPT) as an efficient framework for nuclear matter calculations at
zero and finite temperature based on chiral two- and multi-nucleon interactions. We also
discuss Bayesian methods for quantifying and propagating statistically meaningful theo-
"retical uncertainties. Together with nuclear experiments, astrophysical simulations, and"
"neutron star observations, next-generation ChEFT calculations will be crucial to infer the"
nature of the extreme matter hidden deep beneath the surface of neutron stars.
The review is organized as follows. In Section 2 we focus on recent progress in deriving
nuclear forces from ChEFT and renormalization group (RG) methods to improve the many-
body convergence in nuclear matter calculations. We then dedicate Section 3 to recent
high-order MBPT calculations of the moderate-density nuclear EOS at zero temperature
and advances in the Bayesian quantification of EFT truncation errors. We also discuss
finite-temperature calculations and nuclear thermodynamics. In Section 4 we review the
"present status of the high-density nuclear EOS constrained by nuclear theory, experiment,"
"and observation in the era of multimessenger astronomy, emphasizing the importance of"
ChEFT. Section 5 ends the review with our summary and perspectives on future advances
in nuclear matter calculations and their applications to astrophysics.
"RG: renormalization
group"
2. From microscopic interactions to the nuclear equation of state
"In this section, we briefly review delta-less ChEFT and the construction of chiral nuclear"
interactions as microscopic input for many-body calculations. Applying RG methods allows
"one to systematically generate (perturbative) low-momentum interactions, for which the"
nuclear EOS and related observables can be efficiently calculated using MBPT. We discuss
"both zero- and finite-temperature MBPT, complementary many-body approaches, and the"
implementation of 3N interactions in nuclear matter calculations.
2.1. Chiral effective field theory for nuclear forces
"The interactions among nucleons arise as an effective low-energy phenomenon of QCD, the"
"theory of the strong interaction. At the momentum scales relevant for nuclear physics,"
"p ∼ mπ, QCD is strongly coupled and features nonperturbative effects such as sponta-
neous chiral symmetry breaking and the confinement of quarks and gluons into hadrons."
"Direct applications of QCD to hadronic physics at finite density, where lattice QCD faces a"
"formidable sign problem, are therefore extremely challenging and not feasible at present and"
"in the near future. However, one can construct a systematic description of nuclear physics"
in terms of the effective degrees of freedom at low energies: nucleons and pions (and delta
"isobars). This effective description is given by ChEFT (8, 9, 10, 11, 12)."
www.annualreviews.org • Chiral EFT and the High-Density Nuclear EOS 3
The starting point of ChEFT is to write down the most general Lagrangian consistent
"with the symmetries of low-energy QCD, in particular, the spontaneously broken chiral"
"symmetry, for which pions are the (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone bosons. This naturally sets a"
"limit for the applicability of ChEFT, i.e., the breakdown scale Λb will be of order of the chiral"
"symmetry breaking scale Λχ ∼ 1 GeV. [A Bayesian analysis of free-space NN scattering with
several (not-too-soft) chiral NN potentials in Weinberg power counting estimated Λb ≈
600 MeV (13).] A truncation scheme, known as power counting, is then needed to organize"
the infinite number of operators in the effective Lagrangian in a systematic expansion.
"This expansion is governed by the separation of scales inherent in ChEFT, i.e., the power"
counting is based on powers of a typical momentum p (or the pion mass) over the ChEFT
"breakdown scale, Q = max(p,mπ)/Λb."
"In perturbative EFT, both power counting and ultraviolet renormalization are essen-"
tially unambiguous and straightforward. The situation is different for applications of
"ChEFT in nuclear physics, where the calculational framework must be able to account"
for nonperturbative effects such as bound states (atomic nuclei) and large S-wave scatter-
ing lengths in NN scattering. While there has been some controversy in the literature as
"to how the ChEFT expansion should be set up precisely (see, e.g., Refs. (10, 12) and refer-"
"ences therein), the prevalent and most successful power counting for ChEFT (in particular"
"regarding many-body applications) is the one first suggested by Weinberg (14, 15, 16)"
NN: nucleon-nucleon
3N: three-nucleon
4N: four-nucleon
"Within Weinberg power counting, chiral nuclear interactions (and currents) are orga-"
"nized according to naive (i.e., perturbative) dimensional analysis. The nuclear potentials"
constructed at a given truncation order in the ChEFT expansion are then used for com-
"puting observables. Renormalization in this approach is approximative, and carried out by"
equipping the potentials with regulator functions that suppress contributions above a cutoff
"scale Λ . Λb, typically chosen in the range 450−600 MeV. That is, the cutoff independence
of the observables will be achieved only approximatively through Λ-dependent low-energy"
"constants (LECs), which are in practice optimized for a given Λ to reproduce low-energy"
"NN scattering data and few-nucleon observables; see, e.g., Refs. (12, 17). The residual"
"cutoff dependence can then be attributed to higher-order terms in the expansion, so results"
are expected to become less cutoff dependent with increasing truncation order.
"LEC: low-energy
constant"
Figure 1 depicts the hierarchy of nuclear interactions up to fifth order (or N4LO) in the
chiral expansion without delta isobars. [For recent work on the currently less developed
"delta-full ChEFT, see, e.g., Refs. (18, 19).] In this review, NkLO indicates (next-to)k-"
"leading order, where k is the number of orders beyond leading order (LO). At each order the"
interactions are composed of short-range contact interactions as well as one- and multi-pion
"exchanges at long- and intermediate distances, respectively. The LECs associated with pion"
exchanges have recently been determined with high precision through an analysis of pion-
nucleon scattering within the framework of Roy-Steiner equations (20). The short-range
LECs corresponding to NN couplings are generally fixed by matching to NN scattering data.
Figure 1 shows that ChEFT naturally predicts the observed hierarchy of two- and multi-
"nucleon interactions, i.e., VNN > V3N > V4N, etc. The first nonvanishing 3N forces appear at"
N2LO in three topologies; from left to right: the long-range two-pion exchange (involving the
"pion-nucleon LECs c1, c3, and c4), intermediate-range one-pion exchange-contact (∝ cD),
and short-range 3N contact interaction (∝ cE). At N3LO the 3N forces are significantly more
involved and operator-rich, and also 4N interactions start to contribute. Apart from the"
"two N2LO 3N LECs, cD and cE , chiral interactions up to N
3LO are completely determined"
"by the πN and NN system. While N4LO NN forces have already been worked out, partly"

The circled numbers give the number of short-range contact LECs.
"even at N5LO, the derivation of N4LO 3N interactions has not been finished yet. The"
"3N LECs cD and cE can be fit to (uncorrelated) few-body observables; for instance, the
3H binding energy combined with, e.g., the charge radius of 4He, the 3H β-decay half-life,"
or the nucleon-deuteron scattering cross section. Also heavier nuclei and even saturation
properties in infinite nuclear matter have been used to constrain 3N forces.
"NkLO:
(next-to)k-leading"
Although the residual regulator and cutoff dependence of obervables at a given chiral
"order is expected to decrease at higher orders, actual calculations show significant influence"
of these so-called regulator artifacts on the ChEFT convergence depending on the specific
regularization scheme and computational framework. These issues have resulted in the
"development of a flurry of chiral potentials with nonlocal, local as well as semilocal regulators"
"for a range of cutoff values; see, e.g., Table I of Ref. (21). Moreover, as discussed in"
"Section 2.2, RG methods allow one to modify a given set of two- and multi-nucleon potentials"
such that observables are left invariant (up to RG truncations) but the convergence of many-
body calculations is optimized. These RG transformations are most suitably formulated
"at the operator (i.e., Hamiltonian) level. The nuclear Hamiltonian constructed at a given"
"order in the ChEFT expansion reads H = Tkin +VNN(Λ, ci) +V3N(Λ, ci) +V4N(Λ, ci) + . . . ,"
"where Λ stands for the (initial) cutoff or resolution scale, and ci for the set of LECs inferred"
"from fits to experimental data. The nuclear Hamiltonian is not an observable, and the basic"
idea of the RG is to exploit this feature to generate more perturbative Hamiltonians.
2.2. Perturbative chiral nuclear interactions
The strong short-range repulsion (“hard core”) and tensor force found in nuclear potentials
constructed at cutoff scales Λ & 500 MeV raise questions regarding the applicability of
www.annualreviews.org • Chiral EFT and the High-Density Nuclear EOS 5
"perturbation theory for many-body calculations. In fact, nuclear many-body calculations"
were historically considered a nonperturbative problem (see also Section 2.3). Both features
"give rise to strong couplings between high- and low-momentum states, i.e., large off-diagonal"
"matrix elements, which enhance the intermediate-state summations in perturbation theory."
RG methods allow one to amend this feature while preserving nonperturbative few-body
results.
The initial application (22) of RG methods to study the scale dependence of nuclear
"forces was based on T -matrix equivalence, but in recent years the similarity renormalization"
group (SRG) has been the standard RG method for “softening” nuclear interactions. The
SRG decouples high- and low-momentum states through continuous infinitesimal unitary
"transformations, Hs = UsHU
†
s , described by a differential flow equation in the evolution"
"parameter s. As the SRG flow progresses, the matrix-elements of the NN potential are"
"driven toward a band-diagonal (or block-diagonal) form in momentum space, see Ref. (23)"
for illustrations. While NN observables are by construction invariant under any RG evo-
"lution of the NN potential, A-body observables will remain so only if one also consistently"
evolves the multi-nucleon part of the nuclear Hamiltonian. The SRG allows one to imple-
"ment this in principle exactly, in terms of so-called “induced” many-body forces. However,"
"for practical applications, a truncation of the consistent evolution of multi-nucleon inter-"
"actions is required, e.g., at the 3N level. Neutron matter calculations with SRG-evolved"
chiral interactions truncated at the 3N level indicate that induced 4N forces are (in that
"case) negligible within uncertainties for a wide range of SRG resolution scales (24, 25)."
"SRG: similarity
renormalization"
There have been many developments recently in the application of ChEFT and SRG
technology for the construction of high-precision nuclear potentials. Hebeler et al. (26)
explored a set of low-momentum N3LO NN potentials combined with unevolved N2LO 3N
forces where the two 3N LECs were fit to reproduce few-body data (assuming that the
3N contact interactions capture dominant contributions from induced 3N forces). For the
"softest of these potentials (with λ = 1.8 and Λ3N = 2.0 fm
−1), which was found to predict"
"nuclear saturation properties (26, 27) and ground-state energies of light- to medium-mass"
"nuclei in agreement with experiment (28), Stroberg et al. (29) have computed ground-state"
"and separation energies of nearly 700 isotopes up to iron. Moreover, Hüther et al. (30)"
"have constructed a family of SRG-evolved NN and 3N potentials up to N3LO. Also,"
Reinert et al. (17) have developed the first chiral NN potentials up to N4LO with semilocal
regulators in momentum space such that the long-range part of the pion exchanges remains
invariant in contrast to nonlocal regulators. They showed that several N3LO contact terms
present in previous generations of chiral NN potentials can be eliminated using unitary
"transformations, leading to considerably softer potentials (even without SRG evolution)."
"The Weinberg eigenvalue analysis (31, 21) is a powerful tool for quantifying and mon-"
itoring the perturbativeness of nuclear forces at different resolution scales. Given an NN
"potential, the Weinberg eigenvalues ην(W ) of the operator G0(W )VNN determine the (rate"
"of) convergence of the Born series for NN scattering. Here, G0(W ) is the (free-space or"
in-medium) propagator as a function of the complex energy W . The Born series converges
"if and only if all eigenvalues satisfy |ην(W )| < 1. Bound states of the potential (such as
the deuteron) correspond to ην(W ) = 1 at energies W < 0, so the free-space Born series"
"diverges even for soft potentials. In nuclear matter at sufficiently high densities, however,"
Pauli blocking suppresses the (in-medium) eigenvalues associated with bound (or nearly-
"bound) states. For potentials constructed at Λ . 550 MeV, other sources of nonperturbative
behavior (such as the hard core) are suppressed as well, both in free-space and in-medium"
"6 Drischler, Holt, and Wellenhofer"
"(see, e.g., Ref. (23) for details). This implies that a nonperturbative treatment of in-medium"
NN scattering in the particle-particle channel (see Section 2.3) is not mandatory for these
"interactions. Instead, order-by-order MBPT calculations can be used for systematically"
studying the many-body convergence of (low-momentum) chiral nuclear interactions.
2.3. Many-body perturbation theory at zero and finite temperature
MBPT starts with partitioning the nuclear Hamiltonian H into a reference one-body part
"H0 = Tkin + U and a perturbation H1 = V − U , where Tkin is the kinetic-energy operator
and U is an effective single-particle potential. We consider here NN-only potentials and"
discuss the implementation of 3N interactions in Section 2.5. The standard choice for U is

"d3kj /(2π)
3, and the zero-temperature distribution function"
"fj = θ(kF − kj). For simplicity, we assume here a single-species system and neglect spin-
isospin degrees of freedom. In zero-temperature MBPT, the ground-state energy density"
"E is obtained by expanding Hint about its reference value E0. Truncating the many-body
expansion at a finite order L then leads to the approximation E(kF) ' E0(kF)+"
"∑L

El(kF),2"
where the Fermi momentum kF is in one-to-one correspondence with the particle number
"density via n(kF) =

"The first-order correction is determined by the expectation value of U
(HF)
i (32). At"
"higher orders it is useful to represent the contributions diagrammatically, e.g., as Hugenholtz"
diagrams. The diagram and expression for the second-order contribution E2 are given by

denominator Dab,ij = εa + εb − εi − εj , and single-particle energies εi = k2i /(2M) + U (HF)i .
Writing down the expression associated with a diagram follows these simple rules:"
"• Each vertex gives a factor V ij,ab, with i and j are the lines directed toward the vertex,
and a and b are the lines directed away from the vertex."
"• Downwards lines give factors of fi while upwards lines give (1− fi), corresponding to
hole and particle excitations of the reference ground-state, respectively, and"
"• For adjacent vertices there is an energy denominator given by subtracting the energy
of the reference ground-state from the excited state corresponding to the particle and"
hole lines that are crossed by a virtual horizontal line between the two vertices.
Each diagram’s overall factor can be inferred from the diagrammatic structure as well (32).

"2The many-body expansion is in fact a divergent asymptotic series, but the divergent behavior
is expected to appear only for high truncation orders L & 20 (33)."
www.annualreviews.org • Chiral EFT and the High-Density Nuclear EOS 7
Finding all valid diagrams (and associated expressions) at a given MBPT order has
been formalized using graph-theory methods (34): in Hartree-Fock MBPT there are
"(1, 3, 39, 840, 27300) diagrams at order l = (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Together with the automated code"
generation for the efficient Monte Carlo integration of arbitrary MBPT diagrams developed
"in Ref. (27), this has led to a fully automated approach to MBPT calculations."
"In the traditional Brueckner (or G-matrix) approach (35), the pp ladder diagrams are"
"resummed to all orders, motivated by the large high-momentum components of traditional"
NN potentials to which the pp ladders are particularly sensitive. The pp bubbles in these
diagrams are even ultraviolet divergent if the potential is not sufficiently suppressed at high
"momenta. For modern low-momentum potentials, however, the pp ladders no longer play"
"a distinguished role in the many-body expansion, and explicit MBPT calculations at third"
and fourth order have shown that they are not enhanced compared to other diagrams at
"the same order (27). Nevertheless, partial diagrammatic resummations are still pertinent"
for consistent calculations of in-medium single-particle properties and response functions as
performed in the self-consistent Green’s functions method (for more details see Section 2.4).
The consistent generalization of MBPT to finite temperatures (T > 0) is a nontrivial
issue. From the standard finite-T perturbation series for the grand-canonical potential3

"the free energy density F(T, µ) is obtained via the thermodynamic relation F(T, µ) =
Ω(T, µ) + µn(T, µ). Here, the density is given by n(T, µ) = −∂Ω(T, µ)/∂µ. The issue is
now that the relations between (F , n) and (E , n) obtained in finite- and zero-T MBPT,
respectively, do not match in the limit T → 0 (as discussed further below)."

any zero of the denominator, i.e., there are no poles at finite T . In the T → 0 limit the
integration regions corresponding to the two terms in the numerator of G2 separate into two
equivalent parts (with integrable poles at the integral boundaries), i.e., G2 → 1/Dab,ij for
T → 0. These features pertain for higher-order diagrams (36).4 The second difference at
finite T compared to T = 0 is that the fi = fi(T, µ) are Fermi-Dirac distributions instead"
of step functions centered at the Fermi energy εkF .
"Similar to the free Fermi gas (i.e., MBPT with U = 0 and L = 0), for Hartree-Fock"

present in certain perturbative contributions to Ω, starting at fourth order for Hartree-Fock"
"MBPT (36). [For U = 0, they appear already at second order.] These contributions can be"
"associated with the presence of additional so-called anomalous diagrams in finite-T MBPT,"
"see Refs. (37, 36) for more details. As evident from the discussion above (i.e., below Eq. (4)),"
"the T → 0 limit of the finite-T expressions for normal (i.e., not anomalous) contributions Ωl
matches the corresponding zero-T contributions El, except that the reference Fermi energy

Hartree-Fock MBPT for L 6 3 would be given by

L∑

density via n(T, µ̃) ="
"∑

"In the U = 0 case, the method for constructing a finite-T perturbation series of the form"

according to µ = µ̃+"
"∑L

"µl(T, µ̃) while neglecting all terms beyond the truncation order L."
"[The terms µl are determined by the requirement that the truncated expansion of n(T, µ)"
"about µ̃ reproduces n(T, µ̃) =
∑
i
fi(T, µ̃).] This process can also be applied to Hartree-"
"Fock MBPT (25), with the caveat that the single-particle potential has to be evaluated at"
"µ̃, i.e., no derivatives of U
(HF)
i (T, µ̃) in µ̃ appear. In both cases, U = 0 and Hartree-Fock"
"MBPT, the resulting perturbation series for the free energy reproduces zero-T MBPT at"
"each truncation order L, even though the terms Fl contain anomalous contributions for
l > 4 (l > 2, for U = 0). The fact that Eq. (5) results from a truncated re-expansion shows
explicitly that the original grand-canonical series is not consistent with zero-T MBPT. For"
general arguments why the free-energy series is expected to give improved results compared
"to grand-canonical MBPT, see Refs. (36, 38)."
"Altogether, MBPT as formulated in the free-energy series [Eq. (5)] provides a consistent"
"framework for nuclear matter calculations at zero- and finite-temperature, where many-body"
uncertainties can be systematically assessed by increasing the truncation order L. Although
"the number of MBPT diagrams increases rapidly with L, the technologies recently developed"
"for automated diagram generation and evaluation (34, 27) enable calculations at high-"
enough orders to probe in detail the many-body convergence for chiral low-momentum NN
"and 3N interactions. Furthermore, exploring MBPT with single-particle potentials beyond"
"the Hartree-Fock level is an important task for future research. In particular, the single-"
particle potential U can be chosen at each truncation order such that the grand-canonical
"and free-energy series are also equivalent for L > 1 (36); for Hartree-Fock MBPT, they"
are only equivalent for L = 1. First investigations of this order-by-order renormalization
of the single-particle potential have shown that higher-order contributions to U can have a
significant effect on low-order MBPT results and the many-body convergence (39).
2.4. Other many-body methods
The advances in ChEFT and RG methods have established MBPT as a central approach
for studying the nuclear EOS at zero and finite temperature. While MBPT is the focus of
"5The true chemical potential is obtained from F(T, µ̃) via µ = ∂F/∂n."
www.annualreviews.org • Chiral EFT and the High-Density Nuclear EOS 9
"this review, various other many-body methods have been applied in initial nuclear matter"
"studies with chiral NN and 3N interactions. In particular, nonperturbative frameworks are"
important to benchmark the MBPT convergence and probe aspects of many-body physics
beyond the nuclear EOS. Below we will briefly discuss the self-consistent Green’s functions
(SCGF) approach and Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. Other methods not dis-
"cussed here for brevity are coupled-cluster (CC) theory (40), the in-medium SRG (4), and"
lattice EFT (41). Systematic comparisons between different many-body frameworks will
provide a coherent picture of microscopic interactions and nuclear many-body properties.
"The SCGF approach (42, 43) is based on the self-consistent computation of in-medium"
"propagators (or Green’s functions) in Fourier (Matsubara) space, corresponding to the to-"
all-orders resummation of some perturbative contributions to the propagators. SCGF calcu-
"lations of the nuclear EOS at zero and finite temperature (44, 45) have been implemented"
"using the in-medium T -matrix approximation, where the ladder diagrams are resummed"
"to all orders, providing a thermodynamically consistent generalization of Brueckner the-"
"ory (43). Furthermore, SCGF calculations have been used to benchmark the order-by-order"
convergence of MBPT (up to third order) in neutron matter (46). The energy per particle
obtained in SCGF and MBPT was found to agree well for a range of unevolved chiral NN
and 3N interactions up to N3LO. The SCGF approach allows for fully consistent compu-
"tations of response functions and transport properties, which will be vital for comparisons"
with MBPT calculations of these quantities.
QMC refers to a family of stochastic methods that solve the many-body Schrödinger
"equation through random sampling (6). As such, QMC methods are truly nonperturba-"
tive and provide important benchmarks for many-body methods with basis expansions.
"However, apart from the fermion sign problem a caveat is that most QMC methods require"
"local nuclear potentials to obtain low-variance results, restricting both the regularization"
scheme and the interaction operators that can be included in the ChEFT expansion. QMC
calculations with local chiral NN and 3N potentials up to N2LO have been carried out in
"neutron matter (47, 48) and recently also symmetric nuclear matter (49). Because of Fierz"
"invariance breaking, the regulator artifacts are significantly larger than in MBPT calcula-"
"tions with nonlocal potentials. On the other hand, since QMC methods are not restricted"
"to soft interactions, a much wider range of momentum cutoffs can be studied with QMC."
"Hence, QMC methods can provide important insights into the residual cutoff dependence"
of observables and the breakdown scale of ChEFT at high densities.
2.5. Implementing three-body forces
Three-nucleon forces are crucial for understanding properties of finite nuclei and nuclear
"matter (7), such as drip lines along isotopic chains and nuclear saturation in SNM. Even"
though partial-wave decomposed matrix elements of chiral 3N forces have become available
"recently up to N3LO (50), implementing 3N forces in many-body calculations remains com-"
putationally difficult and usually requires approximations (51). The large uncertainties due
"to 3N forces, e.g., in the nuclear EOS at densities n & n0, emphasize the need for improving
these approximations as well as developing novel chiral NN and 3N potentials in general."
Normal ordering allows one to include dominant 3N contributions in many-body frame-
works using density-dependent effective two-body potentials (52). Through Wick’s theorem
the general three-body Hamiltonian can be exactly normal ordered with respect to a finite-
"density reference state (e.g., the Fermi sea of noninteracting nucleons or the Hartree-Fock"
"10 Drischler, Holt, and Wellenhofer"
ground state) instead of the free-space vacuum (23). This shifts contributions from the
"three-body Hamiltonian operator to effective zero-body, one-body, and two-body operators"
plus a residual (reduced) three-body operator. A many-body framework built for NN inter-
actions can then incorporate a density-dependent effective interaction V medNN derived from
"V3N as VNN → VNN + ξ V medNN . The combinatorial factor ξ is determined by Wick’s theorem
and depends on the many-body calculation of interest. The matrix elements of V medNN are"
obtained by summing one particle over the occupied states in the reference state:
"〈
2
′
3
′
∣∣∣V medNN ∣∣∣23〉 = V̄3N = ∑"
"(2π)3
f1
〈
12
′
3
′ ∣∣ V̄3N ∣∣123〉 , (6)"
"with the shorthand notation |i〉 = |kiσiτi〉, antisymmetrized 3N interactions V̄3N, and
momentum distribution function of the reference state f1."
"In contrast to the (Galilean-invariant) NN potential, the effective two-body potential (6)"
"depends on the center-of-mass momentum P of the two remaining particles. Hence, both"
potentials cannot be straightforwardly combined in a partial-wave basis and different ap-
proximations for the P dependence have been used to enable applications to nuclear matter.
Under the assumption that P = 0 first implementations evaluated Eq. (6) semi-analytically
in symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter starting from the N2LO 3N interac-
"tions (53, 54, 26). Extensions to asymmetric nuclear matter and finite temperature have"
"followed (38, 55, 46, 56), and a new method that allows for the construction of an effective"
two-body potential from any partial-wave decomposed 3N interaction in an improved P
angle-averaging approximation has been developed (56). The latter approach is especially
"advantageous for studying 3N forces at N3LO (56), bare and SRG-evolved, and in different"
regularization schemes. Semi-analytic expressions along the lines of Ref. (53) have been
derived up to N3LO and also partially to N4LO (57).
The three-body term in the normal-ordered Hamiltonian cannot be implemented using
effective two-body potentials. In nuclear matter such residual 3N contributions have been
"studied in CC (58) and MBPT calculations (59, 60, 61, 27). Explicit calculations of the"
"residual 3N diagram in MBPT at second order,"
"Eres2 (kF) = = −
1"
"∑
ijkabc"
"V
ijk,abc"
"V
abc,ijk"
"fijkf̄abc

"Dabc,ijk
, (7)"
showed for a range of chiral interactions that its contribution is typically much smaller
than both the overall EFT truncation error and the individual contributions from the other
MBPT diagrams up to this order (27). While these findings give some justification for
"the commonly used approximation where residual 3N contributions are neglected, the au-"
"tomated approach introduced in Ref. (27) implements chiral NN, 3N, and 4N interactions"
exactly in nuclear matter calculations using a single-particle spin-isospin basis. Combined
"with high-performance computing, this method sets the stage for systematic studies of"
ChEFT interactions in MBPT up to high orders without the mentioned approximations.

"metry energy with experiment, and examine contributions beyond the standard quadratic"

3.1. Confronting nuclear forces with empirical constraints
Figure 2 (left) illustrates the nuclear EOS at zero temperature as a function of density n
"for a representative set of isospin asymmetries δ = (nn − np)/n, where nn (np) is the
neutron (proton) number density. Several general observations can be gleaned. Nuclear"
"interactions are much stronger in SNM compared to PNM, which is closer to the free Fermi"
"gas (FFG, solid lines). Consequently, the uncertainties are larger in SNM, especially for"
"densities n & n0. In PNM they are well controlled for n . n0, and a wide range of"
"12 Drischler, Holt, and Wellenhofer"
"chiral NN and 3N interactions lead to similar results for PNM (see, e.g., Refs. (66, 7, 67))."
Increasing uncertainties toward higher densities are predominantly due to 3N interactions.
"Although the complexity of 3N interactions is much reduced in PNM (54), they provide"
at all values of δ important repulsive contributions that grow stronger with the density
than those of NN interactions. The 3N interactions are therefore crucial for understanding
the high-density EOS and the structure of neutron stars. In PNM all chiral interactions
up to N3LO are completely determined by the πN and NN system. The intermediate-
"and short-range 3N interactions at N2LO that are proportional to the LECs cD and cE ,"
"respectively, vanish (for regulators symmetric in the particle labels) due to the coupling of"
"pions to spin and the Pauli principle, respectively. Also the long-range two-pion exchange"
3N forces at N2LO are simplified since the LEC c4 does not contribute. This allows for
tight low-density constraints on the neutron-rich matter EOS from PNM calculations and
systematic high-density extrapolations (see Section 4).

matter (δ = 1)"

Nuclear matter represents an ideal system for testing nuclear interactions at the densities
accessible to laboratory experiments and their implementation in many-body methods. As
"illustrated in Fig. 2 (left), the nuclear EOS in the vicinity of n0 is (to good approximation)"
"characterized by only a few experimentally accessible quantities. That is, the EOS of"
"SNM can be expanded about its minimum n0 as E(n, δ = 0)/A ≈ E0 + (K/2) η2, with
the saturation energy E0 = E(n0, 0)/A, incompressibility K, and η = (n − n0)/(3n0).
Further, explicit ANM calculations with chiral NN and 3N interactions (56, 68, 69) have"
shown that the asymmetry dependence of the nuclear EOS is reasonably well reproduced
"by the standard quadratic approximation E(n, δ)/A = E(n, 0)/A + Esym(n) δ
2, where the"
"symmetry energy expanded in density reads Esym(n) ≈ Sv + Lη. In this approximation
one finds E(n, 1)/A ≈ (E0 + Sv) + Lη for PNM. Microscopic predictions and empirical
constraints for (n0, E0,K) and (Sv, L) can then be confronted with one another."
Nuclear saturation emerges from a delicate cancellation between kinetic and interaction
"contributions to the EOS. Reproducing empirical constraints on (n0, E0,K) is therefore an"
"important benchmark of nuclear interactions, especially 3N forces (providing the necessary"
repulsion). Figure 2 (right) depicts the saturation points of numerous chiral potentials as
predicted by fourth- (circles) and third-order (squares) MBPT calculations. The saturation
"points are aligned along a Coester-like band (gray anticorrelation band), which overlaps with"
"the empirical saturation point (white boxes, see legend), determined from a set of energy"
"density functionals (71). Also shown are results from CC calculations with NNLOsat (▶)
and the new deltaful chiral potentials (18) “∆NLOGO Λ [ MeV]” and “∆NNLOGO Λ [ MeV]”"
"(▶, ▶, ▶), constructed by the Gothenburg-Oak-Ridge (GO) collaboration. Only the latter
fall into the empirical range for (n0, E0). However, judging the extent a nuclear potential"
reproduces empirical (saturation) properties can be quite misleading without taking mean-
"ingful uncertainties into account; especially, the truncation of the EFT expansion at a finite"
order can result in sizable EFT truncation errors (even at N3LO) that need to be quantified.
"Until a few years ago, the prevalent way of estimating theoretical uncertainties in nuclear"
"matter calculations was parameter variation within some (arbitrary) range; that is, probing"
"the observable’s sensitivity to, e.g., the 3N LECs or momentum cutoff. Recently, the"
"focus has been more on the systematic quantification of EFT truncation errors (72), which"
can be estimated by assuming that an observable’s EFT convergence pattern at order k
"6See Ref. (70) for a review of the link between the nuclear EOS and nuclear observables; e.g.,
from measurements of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance K ≈ 210− 230 MeV was inferred."

"reference scale, Q(n) is the dimensionless expansion parameter, and the cm(n) are the"
"dimensionless coefficients not to be confused with the LECs of the interaction (e.g., y4 ="
E/A at N3LO). Note that c1 = 0 in Weinberg power counting. For given choices of yref(n)
"and Q(n),7 the cm6k(n) are obtained from order-by-order calculations {y0, y1, . . . , yk} of
the observable. Since yref(n) and Q(n) factor in all physical scales, the cm(n) are expected"
"to be of order one (i.e., natural), unless the coefficients are fine-tuned. The standard EFT"
"uncertainty, which assumes that the truncation error is dominated by the first omitted term,"
has been implemented by Epelbaum et al. (74) and applied to a wide range of observables in
finite nuclei and infinite matter. This “EKM uncertainty” can be summarized at NjLO as
"δy(n) = yref Q
j+2 max(|c0|, |c1|, . . . , |cj+1|), whose point-wise estimates can be interpreted"
as Bayesian credibility regions under a particular choice of priors for cm (13).
The Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification: Errors in Your EFT (BUQEYE)
Collaboration has recently introduced a Bayesian framework for quantifying correlated
"EFT uncertainties in the nuclear EOS (75, 64).8 In contrast to the standard EFT un-"
"certainty, the new framework allows for the quantification and propagation of statistically"
"meaningful uncertainties to derived quantities (e.g., the pressure) while accounting for cor-"
"relations across densities and between observables. Without considering these correlations,"
uncertainties can be overestimated. The framework also includes Bayesian model checking
tools (76) for diagnosing and testing whether the in-medium ChEFT expansion works as
"assumed (e.g., inference for Λb). Gaussian Processes (GPs) with physics-based hyperpa-"
rameters are trained on the order-by-order calculations of the energy per particle under the
assumption that all cm(n) are random curves drawn from a single GP (73). The Gaussian
posterior for the cm(n) is then used to estimate the to-all-orders EFT truncation error

"Using this new framework, Drischler et al. (75, 64) studied the EFT convergence of the"
"first order-by-order calculations with NN and 3N interactions up to N3LO in PNM and SNM,"
"conducted in Refs. (27, 77) using a novel Monte Carlo integration framework for MBPT."
The associated N3LO 4N Hartree-Fock energies have been found negligible compared to the
overall uncertainties (see also Ref. (78)). To construct a set of order-by-order NN and 3N
"interactions up to N3LO, Ref. (27) adjusted the two 3N LECs to the triton and (n0, E0)"
"for two cutoffs. Several potentials with reasonable saturation properties were obtained,"
although generally underbound at N3LO. This holds also at the 2σ credibility level with
"EFT truncation errors quantified (64), as depicted by the ellipses “GP–B Λ [MeV]” in"
"Fig. 2 (right). Hoppe et al. (79) found that, in agreement with the expectations from SNM,"
predicted values for the corresponding binding energies of medium-mass nuclei are too small
"compared with experiment and, in contrast to the SNM expectations, predicted values for"
the corresponding charge radii are too large. Since both observables were also much more
"sensitive to the 3N LEC cD, SNM and medium-mass nuclei seem more intricately connected"
than one might naively expect (79).

"Q = kF/Λb, the inferred breakdown scale Λb ≈ 600 MeV is consistent with free-space
NN scattering and could be associated with n > 2n0. The EFT truncation errors are"
strongly correlated in density and to those in SNM. A correlated approach is therefore
"necessary to propagate uncertainties reliably to derived quantities, although the standard"
EFT uncertainty for the energy per particle is broadly similar to the 1σ confidence level (75).
3.2. Nuclear symmetry energy and the isospin-asymmetry expansion
The nuclear symmetry energy is a key quantity to understand the structure of neutron-
rich nuclei and neutron stars. Although masses of heavy nuclei constrain the value of the
"symmetry energy well at nuclear densities, its density dependence is much less known (94)."
"Studying the density-dependent symmetry energy from theory, experiment, and observation"
is therefore an important task in the era of multimessenger astronomy.

potentials. Different uncertainty estimates were used in these calculations. The uncertainty

respectively. Also many-body (or statistical Monte Carlo) uncertainties are included in
the bands. Lim & Holt performed a statistical analysis of MBPT calculations based on a
range of chiral potentials at different orders and two single-particle spectra to probe the
chiral and many-body convergence. Only the results by Lim & Holt and Drischler et al.
"(both MBPT) have a clear statistical interpretation, each at the 1σ and 2σ confidence level"
"(different shadings). Overall, the constraints from ChEFT are consistent with each other,"
"even at the highest densities shown, but the uncertainties in Esym(n) are generally sizable,"
"e.g., 20.7±1.1, 31.5±3.0, and 49.0±12.0 MeV at n0/2, n0, and 2n0, respectively, for Lim &
Holt at the 1σ confidence level. Drawing general conclusions from comparing the sizes of"
these bands can be misleading since the underlying methods for estimating uncertainties
"16 Drischler, Holt, and Wellenhofer"
are quite different. Order-by-order comparisons for a wider range of chiral NN and 3N
interactions with EFT truncation errors quantified are called for to provide more insights
in and stringent constraints on Esym(n). The Bayesian statistical tools introduced by the
BUQEYE Collaboration allow for such systematic studies.
"Despite the large uncertainties in the SNM EOS (see Sec. 3.1), predictions for Esym(n)"
[as an energy difference] can be made with significantly smaller uncertainties than those
"in E(n, 1)/A and E(n, 0)/A individually, if correlations are properly considered. The"
BUQEYE Collaboration (64) found that the EFT truncation errors associated with the
"PNM and SNM calculations in Ref. (27) are highly correlated, meaning that the uncertainty"
in Esym(n) is less than the usual in-quadrature sum of errors. Combined with order-by-order
calculations up to N3LO this led to the narrow constraints [see gray bands in Fig. 4 (left)]
"based on the interactions used with Λ = 500 MeV (e.g., Esym(2n0) = 45.0 ± 2.8 MeV).
Another set with Λ = 450 MeV is compatible at the 2σ confidence level. The bands agree"
with the constraints by Lim & Holt at the 1σ level (or even better) as well as the calcula-
"tions by Akmal et al. (80), Baldo et al. (81), and Muether et al. (82) with phenomenological"
"nuclear potentials. The latter, however, do not provide uncertainties that could be used"
to judge the level of agreement. These correlations need to be investigated further using
different many-body frameworks and interactions.

"lations and the empirical saturation point, agree well with each other and are consistent with"
"the range in Sv of the joint experimental constraint (white area), although L is predicted"
with somewhat lower values. The 1σ and 2σ ellipses of “GP–B 500” (as in Fig. 4 (left))
are in excellent agreement with the joint experimental constraint [“GP–B 450” is slightly
"shifted to higher (Sv, L)], indicating a stiffer neutron-rich matter EOS at n0 compared to the"
"other theoretical constraints. This is, however, consistent with joint theory-agnostic poste-"
"riors from pulsar, gravitational-wave, and NICER observations (e.g., compare with Figure 1"
in Ref. (95)). An important feature of the correlated GP approach is that the theoretical
uncertainties in n0 (including truncation errors) are accounted for through marginalization
"over the Gaussian posterior for the saturation density predicted from the SNM calculations,"
"pr(n0) ≈ 0.17± 0.01 fm−3. Apart from the calculations by Holt & Kaiser (“HK”) allowing
slightly lower (Sv, L), all shown theory calculations satisfy the constraint (solid black line)"
derived from the conjecture (84) that the unitary gas (UG) sets a lower bound for the PNM
EOS. [Note that Ref. (84) also made additional assumptions to derive an analytic bound

to zero in the limit T → 0 (with diverging S2l>2), as implied by the logarithmic terms at

"and logarithmic terms at T = 0 can be extracted up to O(δ6) from high-precision MBPT
calculations with chiral interactions. Such calculations allow for the improvement of ex-"
isting parametrizations in δ at T = 0 and help motivate the investigation of alternative
"schemes, such as an expansion in terms of the proton fraction x = np/n = (1 − δ)/2 for
neutron-rich matter."
3.3. Nuclear thermodynamics
"While thermal effects are negligible in isolated neutron stars, they become important in"
"neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernovae, where T . 100 MeV can be reached.
Dense matter at such high temperatures not only consists of nucleons and leptons but also of"
additional particles such as pions and hyperons. The consistent inclusion of these particles
"in medium is work in progress (102, 103). In the nascent field of multimessenger astronomy,"
"one of the immediate theoretical needs is consistent modeling of (i) cold neutron stars,"
"(ii) hot hypermassive neutron stars formed in the aftermath of compact object mergers,"
and (iii) core-collapse supernovae so that observations and simulations in any one of these
astrophysical regimes can be propagated to constrain the others. Finite-temperature MBPT
"with ChEFT interactions is a suitable framework for this purpose, and here we describe some"
"of the results on nuclear thermodynamics in recent years (for reviews, see Refs. (104, 105))."
"18 Drischler, Holt, and Wellenhofer"
The salient thermodynamic feature of homogeneous nuclear matter at sub-saturation
densities is the presence of a liquid-gas type instability toward the formation of clustered
"structures. In neutron stars, this instability corresponds to the crust-core transition, in-"
volving such intricate features as a variety of “pasta” shapes (106). The nuclear liquid-gas
instability is also connected to the observed multifragmentation events in intermediate-
"energy heavy-ion collisions. In the idealized case of (infinite) nuclear matter, there is a"
liquid-gas phase transition of van-der-Waals type. Nuclear matter calculations at finite
temperature with chiral interactions have provided predictions for the properties of this
"phase transition, in particular the location of the critical point. Figure 5 (left) shows the"
second-order MBPT results for the boundary of the liquid-gas coexistence region (so-called
binodal) of SNM obtained in Ref. (38). [The results for the binodal of SNM recently ob-
tained with the SCGF method (45) and lattice EFT (41) are similar to those in Fig. 5.]
"The predicted critical point, especially the associated temperature Tc ≈ 17 − 19 MeV, is
consistent with estimates (e.g., Tc ≈ 15−20 MeV (107)) extracted from multifragmentation,
nuclear fission, and compound nuclear decay experiments (107, 101)."
In the interior of the binodal a region where the homogeneous system is unstable with
respect to infinitesimal density fluctuations can be found. The boundary of this region is
called spinodal. Between the binodal and spinodal the uniform system is metastable. [The
"two boundaries coincide at the critical point.] For SNM, the unstable region is identified by"
"a negative inverse isothermal compressibility, κ−1T = n(∂P/∂n) < 0. An equivalent stability"
"criterion is ∂µ/∂n > 0, corresponding to a strictly convex free energy density F(T, n) as a
function of n. If charge-symmetry breaking effects are neglected, SNM can be treated as"
"a pure substance with one particle species (nucleons), whereas ANM is a binary mixture"
with two thermodynamically distinct particles (neutrons and protons). This implies that
"the stability criteria are different in the two cases, and for ANM the region with κ−1T < 0 is"
a subregion of the spinodal region. There are various equivalent stability criteria for binary
"mixtures (108). A useful criterion is that outside the spinodal the free energy F(T, nn, np)
is a strictly convex function of nn and np (see Ref. (55) for details). The MBPT results"
for the asymmetry dependence of the critical temperature Tc(δ) from Ref. (55) are shown
"in Fig. 5 (right). For comparison, we also show the trajectory of the temperature TκT (δ)"
where the subregion with negative κ−1T vanishes. The trajectory of Tc(δ) reaches its T = 0
"endpoint at a small proton fraction x; i.e., while PNM is stable at all densities, already"
"small x lead to a region where the system undergoes a phase separation (55, 109)."
A useful characteristic for the temperature dependence of the nuclear EOS is the ther-
"mal index Γth(T, n, δ) = 1 + Pth(T, n, δ)/Eth(T, n, δ), where Pth is the thermal part of the
pressure, and Eth is the thermal energy density. For a free gas of nucleons with effective
masses m∗n,p(n, δ) one obtains for Γth the following temperature-independent expression"

"[To be precise, for δ /∈ {0, 1} the above expression is valid only in the classical limit, but it
provides a good approximation to Γ?th(n, x) for intermediate values of δ as Ref. (67) showed.]"
"Recently, Refs. (25, 110) showed that Γ?th(n, δ) reproduces the exact Γth with high accuracy."
This implies that the temperature-dependence of the EOS can be characterized in terms of
"9The thermal index of a free Fermi gas is Γth,free = 5/3."
www.annualreviews.org • Chiral EFT and the High-Density Nuclear EOS 19
"a temperature-independent effective mass (see Ref. (67) for a recent implementation), which"
"is in particular useful for monitoring thermal effects in astrophysical applications (111, 112)."
4. Applications to neutron star physics
In this Section our goal is to emphasize the prominent role of nuclear theory in modeling
"neutron stars, core-collapse supernovae, and neutron star mergers. We begin by placing"
high-energy nuclear astrophysics in the more general context of the QCD phase diagram
and discuss under what ambient conditions ChEFT can serve as a tool to constrain the
properties of hot and dense matter. Specific applications include the neutron-star mass-
"radius relation, moment of inertia, and tidal deformability, as well as the nuclear EOS and"
neutrino opacity for astrophysical simulations.
4.1. Scales in hot and dense stellar matter
"The extreme astrophysical environments found in core-collapse supernovae, neutron star"
"interiors, and neutron-star mergers span baryon number densities nB ∼ 10−7 − 101 n0,
temperatures T ∼ 0 − 100 MeV, and isospin asymmetries δ ∼ 0 − 1 (corresponding to
electron fractions Ye ∼ 0 − 0.5) (113). In Sections 2 and 3 we have shown that ChEFT
provides a suitable framework to constrain the EOS, transport, and response properties of"
hadronic matter when the physical energy scale is well below the chiral symmetry breaking
"scale of Λχ ∼ 1 GeV. In practice, ChEFT descriptions of nuclear matter based on high-
precision NN and 3N forces begin to break down at densities n ≈ 2−3n0 and temperatures
T . 30 MeV. Therefore, additional modeling is needed at high densities and temperatures to
cover all regions of astrophysical interest. For this purpose, high-energy heavy-ion collisions"
"at RHIC, LHC, and especially FAIR aim to probe states of matter similar to those that"
"exist naturally in neutron stars, but reaching sufficiently large proton-neutron asymmetries"
remains a significant challenge that may be addressed with next-generation radioactive
"ion beam facilities, such as FRIB. The interplay of microscopic ChEFT, whose convergence"
"pattern is not especially sensitive to the isospin asymmetry, together with upcoming nuclear"
"experiments that create and study hot, dense, and neutron-rich matter, will provide a direct"
line of inquiry probing neutron-star physics from low to high densities.
"From the observational side, measurements of neutron star masses, radii, tidal deforma-"
"bilities, and moments of inertia are expected to place constraints on the pressure of beta-"
"equilibrium matter at n & 2n0 (114, 83, 115). In Fig. 6, we present a qualitative overview
of the QCD phase diagram and highlight regions probed by nuclear experiments (RHIC,"
"LHC, FAIR, and FRIB), theory (lattice QCD and ChEFT), and astrophysical simulations"
"of neutron stars, supernovae, and neutron star mergers. We see that ChEFT intersects"
"strongly with the region of FRIB experiments and nuclear astrophysics, providing a bridge"
between new discoveries in the laboratory and their implications for neutron stars. The
"next decade is expected to witness a strong interplay among all of these different fields,"
with nuclear theory predictions getting confronted with stringent empirical tests.

In recent years numerous works have studied constraints on the neutron star EOS from
ChEFT.10 In Ref. (92) the EOS of neutron-rich matter was calculated up to saturation

supplemented with a neutron-star crust model, e.g., the BPS crust model (121)."

"density with MBPT using chiral NN and 3N interactions. To extrapolate to higher densities,"
a series of piecewise polytropes was used to parameterize the EOS. It was found that ChEFT
generically gives rise to soft EOSs that lead to 1.4 M� neutron stars with radii in the range
"R1.4 = 10 − 14 km. Subsequent studies (e.g., Refs. (122, 123, 124, 67)) have employed a
wider range of chiral forces, increased the assumed range of validity for ChEFT calculations"
"to 2n0, and explored other high-density EOSs, including smooth extrapolations and speed"
of sound parameterizations. The choice of transition density at which ChEFT predictions
are replaced by model-dependent high-density parameterizations has a particularly large
"influence on neutron-star radius constraints. For instance, when the transition density"
"was raised to nt = 2n0, Ref. (125) obtained R1.4 = 9.4 − 12.3 km while Ref. (124) found
R1.4 = 10.3− 12.9 km, both calculations eliminating the stiffest EOSs that would give rise
to R1.4 > 13 km. To demonstrate how a precise neutron-star mass and radius measurement"
"can constrain the EOS of beta-equilibrium matter at n = 2n0, in Fig. 7 we show the"
correlated probability distribution (83) for the radius of a 1.4 M� neutron star and the
nuclear symmetry energy at twice saturation density Esym(2n0). In the inset we show
the conditional probability distribution for Esym(2n0) assuming a precise measurement of
"R1.4 = 12.38 km. For the specific EOS modeling used in Ref. (83), such a precise radius"
constraint determines Esym(2n0) with an uncertainty of approximately 10%.
"In addition to radius measurements, there has long been the possibility (126, 127) of"
obtaining a neutron-star moment of inertia measurement based on long-term radio timing
"of PSR J0737-3039, a binary pulsar system in which the periastron advance receives a small"
correction from relativistic spin-orbit coupling. A recent analysis (128) has shown that
by 2030 a moment of inertia measurement of PSR J0737-3039A to 11% precision at the
68% confidence level will be achievable. The moment of inertia for a uniformly rotating
neutron star of radius R and angular velocity Ω can be calculated in the slow-rotation

"1.338 M�, was calculated from EOSs based on ChEFT. In Ref. (129) it was found that at"
"the 95% credibility level, the moment of inertia of J0737-3039A lies in the range 0.98 ×
1045 g cm2 < I < 1.48×1045 g cm2, while Ref. (130) found a consistent but somewhat larger
range of 1.06 × 1045 g cm2 < I < 1.70 × 1045 g cm2. The moment of inertia is strongly
correlated with the neutron star radius, and it has been shown (131) that measurements of"
"the PSR J0737-3039A moment of inertia can constrain its radius to within ±1 km.
In the past ten years, several neutron stars (132, 133, 134) with well measured masses"
"of M & 2 M� have been observed. The maximum mass (M
TOV
max ) of a non-rotating neutron"
"star is a key quantity to probe the composition of the inner core, which must have a"
sufficiently stiff EOS to support the enormous pressure due to the outer layers.11 To date
"the strongest candidate for the heaviest measured neutron star is PSR J0740+6620, with"
"a mass of M = 2.14+0.20−0.18 M� at the 95% credibility level (134). As mentioned previously,"
ChEFT generically gives rise to relatively soft EOSs just above nuclear saturation density.
The existence of a very massive neutron star with M = 2.14 M� would require a stiff EOS
"at high densities, revealing a slight tension with ChEFT (136). However, even smooth"
"extrapolations (83, 67) of EOSs from ChEFT can produce maximum neutron star masses"
"in the range 2.0 M� . M
TOV
max . 2.4 M�, and therefore more precise radius measurements"
(or the observation of heavier neutron stars) are needed to make strong inferences about

4.3. Neutron star mergers
The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has opened a new window into the visible
Universe. Current gravitational wave detectors (LIGO and Virgo) are sensitive to fre-
"quencies 10 Hz < f < 10 kHz, which is the prime range for compact object mergers and"
supernovae. Gravitational wave astronomy therefore has major implications for the field
"of nuclear astrophysics (3). In particular, during the late-inspiral phase of binary neutron"
"star coalescence, a pre-merger neutron star will deform with induced quadrupole moment"
"Q under the large tidal gravitational field E : Qij = −λEij , where λ is the dimensionful tidal
deformability parameter. Tidal deformations enhance gravitational radiation and increase"
the rate of inspiral. Gravitational wave detectors are sensitive to such phase differences
"and hence the dense matter EOS, but such corrections enter formally at fifth order (137)"
in a post-Newtonian expansion of the waveform phase and are therefore difficult to extract.
"The tidal deformability is an important observable in its own right, but this quantity is also"
"strongly correlated with both the neutron star radius (138), since more compact stars expe-"
"rience a smaller deformation under a given tidal field, and especially the moment of inertia"
through the celebrated I-Love-Q relations (139). The post-merger gravitational wave signal
from binary neutron star coalescence can also carry important information on the nuclear
"11Beyond MTOVmax , additional stable branches (135), such as hybrid quark-hadron stars or pure
quark stars, may appear before the ultimate collapse to a black hole."

"predictions from ChEFT (83, 145) predating the analysis in Ref. (144) yielded similarly"
small tidal deformabilities 140 < Λ < 520 (83). Analogous constraints on the binary tidal
deformability parameter
"Λ̃ =
16"
"(m1 + 12m2)m

1Λ1 + (m2 + 12m1)m"
"(m1 +m2)5
(11)"
from gravitational-wave data [Λ̃ = 300+420−230 (146)] and ChEFT [80 < Λ̃ < 580 (145)] were
similarly consistent. From the strong correlation between neutron star radii and tidal de-
"formabilities, the LIGO/Virgo Scientific Collaboration reported (144) an inferred constraint"
of R = 11.9+1.4−1.4 km for both of the neutron stars involved in the merger under the assump-
tion that the shared EOS could support 2 M� neutron stars. Only the combined mass
"Mtot = 2.74
+0.04
−0.01 M� of the binary was very well measured from the gravitational wave-"
"form, but neither of the individual component masses 1.17 M� < M1,2 < 1.60 M� were"
"expected (142) to deviate more than 20% from the canonical value of M ' 1.4 M�, assum-
ing low neutron star spins. In summary, GW170817 data were found to strongly favor the"
"soft EOSs predicted from ChEFT, though many other models (147) with generically stiffer"
EOSs were consistent with the upper bounds on Λ and R1.4 from GW170817.
Current gravitational wave interferometers do not have large signal-to-noise ratios at the
high frequencies expected during the post-merger ringdown phase and therefore GW170817
"24 Drischler, Holt, and Wellenhofer"
"provided no clues about the fate of the merger remnant. Nevertheless, an analysis of the"
spectral and temporal properties of the kilonova (148) optical counterpart to GW170817
"have been used (149, 150, 151, 152, 153) to infer the lifetime of the merger remnant."
Depending on the component neutron star masses prior to merger (primarily the total
"mass Mtot) as well as the maximum mass for a nonrotating neutron star M
TOV
max , the merger"
"remnant can (i) undergo immediate collapse to a black hole, (ii) exist as a short-lived hy-"
"permassive neutron star supported against collapse by differential rotation, (iii) persist as"
"a longer-lived supramassive neutron star supported against collapse by rigid-body rotation,"
or (iv) form a stable massive neutron star. While there is still some uncertainty about what
"ranges of Mtot will lead to each of the above four scenarios, it has been suggested (150)"
"that prompt collapse will occur when Mtot & 1.3− 1.6MTOVmax , hypermassive neutron stars
will be created when 1.2MTOVmax .Mtot . 1.3− 1.6MTOVmax , and supramassive neutron stars
will result when Mtot . 1.2M"
"TOV
max . Each merger outcome is expected to have a qualita-"
"tively different optical counterpart and total mass ejection, since longer remnant lifetimes"
generically give rise to more and faster moving disk wind ejecta.
Observations of the GW170817 kilonova suggest that the most likely outcome of the
"neutron star merger was the formation of a hypermassive neutron star, which would imply a"
"value of MTOVmax = 2.15−2.35 M� (151, 150, 153). Eliminating the possibility of prompt black
hole formation in GW170817 also rules out compact neutron stars with small radii and tidal"
"deformabilities. In Ref. (149) such arguments were used to infer that the radius of a 1.6 M�
neutron star must be larger than R1.6 & 10.7 km, while in Ref. (152) it was found that the
binary tidal deformability parameter for the GW170817 event must satisfy Λ̃ & 400. Both of
these inferred constraints are compatible with predictions (83, 145, 124, 123) from ChEFT."
"However, the constraint on the binary tidal deformability Λ̃ > 400 can rule out a significant"
"set of soft EOSs (154), roughly half of those allowed in the analysis of Ref. (83). Combined"
gravitational wave and electromagnetic observations of binary neutron star mergers together
with more precise radius measurements therefore have the possibility to strongly constrain
the dense matter EOS and related neutron star properties in the regime of validity of
"ChEFT (154, 155, 156). As a demonstration, in Fig. 8 we show the joint probability"
distributions (83) for the pressure of nuclear matter at n = 2n0 with (i) the radius of a
"1.4 M� neutron star, (ii) the tidal deformability of a 1.4 M� neutron star, and (iii) the"
moment of inertia of PSR J0737-3039A with a mass of 1.338 M�.
4.4. Core-collapse supernovae
Neutron stars are born following the gravitational collapse and ensuing supernova explosion
"of massive stars (M & 8 M�). The core bounce probes densities only slightly above normal
nuclear saturation density (113) and leaves behind a hot (T ∼ 20− 50 MeV) nascent proto-
neutron star. During the subsequent Kelvin-Helmholtz phase that lasts tens of seconds, the"
"proto-neutron star emits neutrinos, cools to temperatures T < 5 MeV, de-leptonizes, and"
contracts to reach supra-saturation densities in the innermost core. The success or failure of
"the supernova itself (157), the thermal and chemical evolution during the Kelvin-Helmholtz"
"phase (158), and the possibility of novel nucleosynthesis in the neutrino-driven wind (159)"
depend on details of the nuclear EOS and weak reaction rates.
"Investigating the qualitative impact of specific EOS properties, such as the incompress-"
"ibility or the symmetry energy, on the fate of supernova explosions is often challenging due"
"to “Mazurek’s Law”, a colloquial observation that feedback effects tend to wash out any"
www.annualreviews.org • Chiral EFT and the High-Density Nuclear EOS 25
"fine tuning of parameters in core-collapse supernovae (160). Nevertheless, several recent"
"systematic investigations (161, 111) of EOS parameters have supported the idea that a"
"high density of states, linked to a large value of the in-medium nucleon effective mass M∗,"
reduces thermal pressure and leads to enhanced contraction of the initial proto-neutron star.
This results in the emission of higher-energy neutrinos that support the explosion through
the neutrino reheating mechanism (157). Since microscopic calculations based on ChEFT
"tend to predict larger values of the effective mass than many mean-field models (162, 110),"
"these observations help motivate recent efforts (163, 67) to include thermal constraints from"
ChEFT directly into supernova EOS tables.
Neutrino reactions also affect the nucleosynthesis outcome in neutrino-driven wind out-
flows and the late-time neutrino signal that will be measured with unprecedented de-
tail during the next galactic supernova. Charged-current neutrino-absorption reactions
"νe + n → p + e− and ν̄e + p → n + e+, which can be calculated from the imaginary
part of vector and axial vector response functions, are especially sensitive (164, 165) to"
"nuclear interactions and in particular the difference ∆U = Un − Up between proton and
neutron mean fields. The isovector mean field is especially important in the neutrinosphere,"
the region of warm and dense matter where neutrinos decouple from the exploding star.
"Recently, the calculation (166, 162) of nuclear response functions that include mean-field"
effects from ChEFT interactions have shown that terms beyond the Hartree-Fock approxi-
"mation are needed for accurate modeling. In particular, resummed particle-particle ladder"
"diagrams were shown (166) to produce larger isovector mean fields due to resonant, non-"
"perturbative effects in the NN interaction. Moreover, for neutral-current neutrino reactions,"
"such as neutrino pair bremsstrahlung and absorption, resonant NN interactions were shown"
to significantly enhance reaction rates at low densities compared to the traditional one-pion
exchange approximation (167).
5. Summary and outlook
"In this article, we have reviewed recent progress in ChEFT calculations of nuclear matter"
properties (with quantified uncertainties) and their implications in the field of nuclear as-
"trophysics. Combined with observational and experimental constraints, these microscopic"
"calculations provide the basis for improved modeling of supernovae, neutron stars, and neu-"
"tron star mergers. In particular, we have highlighted MBPT as an efficient framework for"
"studying the nuclear EOS and transport properties across a wide range of densities, isospin"
"asymmetries, and temperatures. We have also shown how advances in high-performance"
computing have enabled the implementation of two- and multi-nucleon forces in MBPT
"up to high orders in the chiral and many-body expansions. Finally, we have described"
new tools for quantifying theoretical uncertainties (especially EFT truncation errors) to
confront microscopic calculations of the nuclear EOS with empirical constraints. Such sys-
tematic studies are particularly important in view of EOS constraints anticipated in the
"new era of multimessenger astronomy; e.g., from gravitational wave detection, mass-radius"
"measurements of neutron stars, and experiments with neutron-rich nuclei."
In the following we briefly summarize several open research directions at the interface
of nuclear EFT and high-energy nuclear astrophysics. (i) EFT truncation errors and their
correlations in density and across observables need to be studied with different many-body
frameworks and nuclear interactions at arbitrary isospin asymmetry and finite temperature.
"(ii) Together with EFT truncation errors, the uncertainties in the LECs parametrizing the"
"26 Drischler, Holt, and Wellenhofer"
interactions need to be quantified and propagated to nuclear matter properties using a
comprehensive Bayesian statistical analysis. (iii) The full uncertainty quantification of the
nuclear EOS will be aided by the development of improved order-by-order chiral NN and
3N potentials and the study of different regularization schemes as well as delta-full chiral
interactions. (iv) Many-body calculations of nuclear matter properties beyond the nuclear
"EOS (e.g., linear response and transport coefficients) with chiral NN and 3N interactions are"
required for more accurate numerical simulations of supernovae and neutron star mergers.
(v) Future neutron star observations will provide stringent tests of nuclear forces and nuclear
many-body methods in a regime that is presently largely unconstrained. The interplay
"between observation, experiment, and theory in the next decade can be expected to result"
in many further advances in our understanding of strongly interacting matter.
