"Abstract. The recent gravitational wave transient GW190521 has been interpreted by the
LIGO-Virgo collaboration (LVC) as sourced by a binary black hole (BH) merger. According
to the LVC parameter estimation, at least one of these progenitors falls into the so-called
pair-instability supernova mass gap. This raises the important question of how and when
these progenitors formed. In this paper we use an accretion model with super-Eddington
mass accretion rate obtained from General Relativity hydrodynamics simulations to analyse
the scenario wherein the GW190521 original progenitors (OPs) formed at lower masses (and
spins) and grew to their estimated LVC parameters by relativistic accretion. We consider that
the environment wherein the binary is immersed has density gradients as well as a dependence
on the Mach number of the gas. Taking the LVC parameter estimation at z = 0.82 as the
endpoint of the accretion evolution, we estimate the initial masses and spins of the OPs at
three different red-shifts z = 100, 50, and 20. We found three distinct possible types of OPs:
(i) 10−4M� − 3M� almost non-rotating (with Kerr spin parameter a? < 10−2) primordial
BHs; (ii) 3M�−40M� slowly rotating (10−2 < a? < 0.5) stellar mass BHs; (iii) 40M�−70M�
BHs with a moderate spin parameter a? ∼ 0.5, which could originate from the collapse of high
mass Pop III stars. The mass spread is due to varying the density gradient and the relativistic
Mach number of the cosmic plasma; the variation of the masses due to the origin at different
red-shifts, on the other hand, is negligible, ∼ 2%. For high Mach number scenarios, the BHs
have low mass and spin accretion rates, leading to OPs with masses and spins close to the
GW190521 LVC estimated values. We have also compared our results with previous studies
where the Newtonian accretion model was used, finding relativistic corrections of ∼ 13% for
the OPs masses. In particular, the relativistic model leads to smaller initial masses."

1 Introduction
"The LIGO-Virgo scientific collaboration (LVC) has reported the detection of gravitational
wave transients since 2016 [1–8], opening up a new window towards highly relativistic systems,
such as neutron star (NS) and black hole (BH) binaries, and providing new information
about their populations in the Cosmos. The mass of the objects inferred from these events
spans a considerable range; for the final object, for instance, the LVC reported 2.74+0.04−0.01M�,
for GW170817, interpreted as a NS-NS binary coalescence and 62+0.04−0.01M� for GW150914,
interpreted as a BH-BH binary merger. Yet, the masses of the progenitors in all events
reported (until recently) correspond to the expected masses for NSs or stellar mass BHs
(sBHs). Recently, the LVC reported the transient GW190521 [9], interpreted as the merger of
two BHs with masses 85+21−14M� and 66"
"+17
−18M�, which implies at least one of these progenitors"
"is in the so called pair-instability supernova mass gap [10]. This led to a debate on how the
GW190521 progenitor BHs formed, and even on the nature of the event, see e.g. [11, 12]."
"A natural scenario is that the progenitors of GW190521 started off as lower mass BHs and
grew up to the LVC reported masses by accretion. A model to tackle gas dynamics around a
point mass was developed by Bondi, Hoyle and Lyttleton (BHL) [13–15]. This model assumes
accretion onto a central compact object moving in a homogeneously distributed gas and has
been widely used in different relativistic astrophysical scenarios, where the accreting object
corresponds to a BH or a NS. Several numerical works have been dedicated to studying the
morphological patterns in the vicinity of the BH as well as the mass accretion rates [16–
20]. Additionally, many numerical simulations of the BHL mechanism have been developed
in the context of relativistic astrophysics [21–24], which have been made evermore realistic
(and complex) by including magnetic fields [25], radiative terms [26], density and velocity
gradients [27, 28], small rigid bodies around the BH [29] and, more recently, by analyzing
the common envelope phase in the evolution of binary systems [30], where useful relativistic
expressions for the mass and angular momentum accretion rates, as well as luminosity, were
obtained in terms of the density gradient parameter and Mach number. These expressions
can be used to understand the behavior of the progenitors of the GW190521 event, at early
stages, and so establish constraints on the initial masses and luminosity of this binary system
in the relativistic regime."
"Other recent works have also attempted to understand the GW190521 progenitors at
early stages. For instance, Ref. [31] argues that GW190521 cannot have been sourced by
primordial BHs (PBHs) if PBHs do not accrete during their cosmological evolution. On the
other hand, Ref. [32] proposes that the GW190521 binary system formation is possible due
to gas accretion onto BH remnants from Population III (Pop III) stars, born in high red-shift"
"mini-halos. Moreover in Ref. [33] a gas accretion driven mechanism that can build up BH
masses rapidly in dense, gas-rich nuclear star clusters is presented. In Ref. [34], the authors
show how the growth of sBH, embedded in a dense molecular cloud, can be associated with
the GW190521 event. It is worth mentioning that in all these works the gas around the BH
is described by the Newtonian mass accretion formula. Another scenario is presented in Ref.
[35], where the GW190521 progenitors are proposed to be the result of the merger of the
central BHs from two ultra–dwarf galaxies. Furthermore, the possibility that the GW190521
binary system comes from the first generation of massive, metal-free, Pop III stars, is studied
in Ref. [36]."
"Another interesting aspect of GW190521 is that the total mass of the GW190521 remnant
is 142+28−16M�, which can be considered as an intermediate mass BH (IMBH). IMBHs are an
elusive class of BHs, albeit the logical intermediary between sBH and supermassive BHs
(SMBH), with a mass range from 102M� to 105M�. If IMBHs are produced by accretion
onto sBHs or mergers of massive stars or sBHs, then IMBHs should be abundant. On the
other hand, if IMBHs are only produced from core-collapse of Pop III stars, they may have
already grown into SMBHs and be rare; in this scenario, IMBHs are the potential seeds of
SMBHs [37, 38]. IMBHs are excellent candidates to explain the observed Ultra Luminous
X-ray (ULX) sources, even though many ULXs have been identified with low-mass X-ray
binaries [39] and high-mass X-ray binaries [40, 41]. There seems to be, however, a good
candidate for an IMBH in a ULX where using high-frequency QPOs (with 3:2 ratio), Pasham
et al. [42] used inverse-scaling of sBH as well as a relativistic precession model to determine
a mass of MBH ' 400M�."
"IMBHs impact on several fields of astrophysics and are likely to grow as a focus of
research attention [37]. A standard scenario is that these BHs result from accretion onto
BH seeds or PBHs. The growth of PBHs could explain the masses of IMBH since these can
grow up to 102 − 105M� during the radiation dominated era [43]. Moreover, in the early
time of BH formation, dark matter makes BHs grow and facilitates IMBHs formation [44].
Ref. [45] studied the dynamical evolution of IMBHs in the nearby Universe, in the context
of popular hierarchical structure formation theories. This computational analysis estimated
the number of BHs, their mass distribution and position within a galaxy. Additionally, Ref.
[46] discussed the capability of a third-generation ground-based detector, such as the Einstein
Telescope (ET), to enhance the astrophysical knowledge through detections of gravitational
waves emitted by IMBH binary systems."
"An important parameter associated with astrophysical BHs is their angular momen-
tum JBH , which is usually described by the dimensionless spin parameter a? ≡ a/MBH =
cJBH/GM"
"2
BH , where MBH corresponds to the BH mass. The spin is related to the way BHs"
"grow and explains the relativistic jets that emerge from the BH. To model the BH spin up
due to plasma accretion, the Bardeen model [47] is often used in the literature, which assumes
that the accretion follows from a thin cold disk rotating in the equatorial plane (constant ori-
entation) and that its inner edge always coincides with the ISCO (ballistic or geodesic model).
Bardeen found that this process achieves the maximal rotation a? = 1; however, this is an
artifact of the model. As Thorne [48] pointed out, the spin up all the way to an extreme Kerr
BH, using a finite amount of rest mass, violates the third law of BH thermodynamics. Thus,
some processes ignored in Bardeen’s simplistic model should keep a/MBH < 1. To tackle
this shortcoming, Thorne included in the accretion model the absorption of radiation by the
BH, observing that the absorption cross-section is greater for photons moving in the opposite
direction to the BH’s angular momentum than for “co-rotating” photons. The captured pho-"
"tons will lower the efficiency of the BH spin up and thus prevent the violation of the third
law; this effect prevents spin-up beyond a limiting value of a/MBH = 0.998. Still, one must
be aware that even the improved Thorne model is based on geodesic motion and on a thin
accretion disk, not taking into account more realistic physics, like the kinetic pressure tensor,
magnetic fields, viscosity, density and velocity gradients of the environment, radiation terms,
among others. As an illustration of the impact of these extra factors, it was recently shown
that the power extracted via fast magnetic re-connection can induce a significant decrease of
the rotational energy of the BH, reducing the dimensionless spin from a? = 0.999 to a? = 0.99
[49]."
"This article aims to explore the initial masses and spins as well as the luminosity of the
progenitors of the gravitational wave event GW190521, through a relativistic mass accretion
formula, which includes the effects of the density gradients associated with the environment
where the massive binary system is immersed. Concretely, we have computed the masses,
the bremsstrahlung bolometric luminosity and the spin as a function of the red-shift, for the
individual components of the GW190521 binary system estimated by the LVC collaboration.
Our results exhibit, depending on the initial Mach number and density gradient parameter,
a wide range of values for the initial masses, which consequently admit a variety of inter-
pretations, from seed BHs formed from Pop III stars collapse, to PBHs. We also perform a
comparison between the Newtonian and relativistic regimes, showing that relevant corrections
for the initial masses are introduced by the relativistic treatment. Finally, we provided an
evolution equation to compute the BH spin, which is written as function of the mass accretion
rate and the angular momentum rate. This formula was calculated from the definition of the
dimensionless BH spin and using semi-analytical accretion formulas from General Relativity
hydrodynamics simulations. It is worth mentioning that we explore self-consistent solutions
with very high mass accretion rates, where the accretion is not suppressed by any radiative
mechanism like Compton heating. Such accretion regime is referred to as the super-Eddington
regime. This high accretion process has been studied in spherically symmetric accretion flows
on to massive BHs embedded in dense metal-poor clouds, performing one-dimensional radi-
ation hydro-dynamical simulations [50, 51]. The accretion rate reached in [50, 51], in which
radiation mechanisms were included, are quite similar to the ones obtained in this work. Gen-
eral relativistic radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of accretion flows onto BHs show that
the radiation term can suppress the accretion rate up to two order of magnitude [26]. Still,
most of the aforementioned simulations show a super-Eddington accretion flows."
"This article is organized as follows: In section 2, we present the relativistic accretion
model as well as the general relativistic equations used in our calculations. In section 3, we
present the results. Finally, in section 4, we present our main conclusions and discussions."
2 General relativistic accretion model
"Plasma accretion rates. We consider that most of the gas is concentrated in a thin
disc and that most of the accretion occurs in the equatorial plane. Under this assumption,
the accretion rates have been computed by performing systematic relativistic hydrodynamics
simulations of BHL accretion [27, 52]. We have used the relativistic BHL accretion model for a
realistic astrophysical scenario, to describe, say, the common envelope phase of a binary. Such
a scenario could occur after the collapse of a neutron star to a black hole in a binary system
initially containing red supergiants. The effects of the common envelope are introduced by
the dimensionless density gradient parameter �ρ, which runs from �ρ = 0 for cosmological or"
"intergalactic gas before the common envelope phase, to � ≥ 1 for short orbits when the binary
is near the merger [52, 53]."
"Our accretion model differs from the one presented by Thorne [48] in the fact that it is
not geodesic and considers a pure baryonic gas accretion with density and velocity gradients,
where such a gas is described by an ideal gas equation of state p = ρ�(Γ− 1), which describes
the pressure as function of rest mass density ρ, specific internal energy � and the adiabatic
index Γ, neglecting the radiation accretion and magnetic fields 1. These simulations yield
a semi-analytical model for the evolution of the rest-mass M0, specific angular momentum

normalised by the Eddington luminosity LEdd = 1.26×1038 (MBH/M�) erg/s [56]. The coeffi-
cients in the accretion formulas are: for the mass accretion rate, µi = (0.18, 1.24,−1.54, 0.72);
for the angular momentum accretion rate, ℘i = (0.51, 6.69, 1.16); and for the bremsstrahlung
luminosity, `i = (−3.2837, 3.1742, 3.327). The dimensionless density gradient parameter range
considered is 0 6 �ρ 6 1 [27, 52]. In the strong gravity regime, i.e., the relativistic regime,
BHL studies reveal super-Eddington accretion rates, even in more realistic models where the
self-consistent radiation is considered [26, 57]; in the same scenarios luminosity can be sub-
Eddington. In our accretion model, � ≥ 0.5 leads to super-Eddington luminosities. However,
in early universe scenarios, i.e., with high red shifts z ≥ 103, radiation has an important
contribution to the accretion, and the Eddington-accretion limit should be monitored. Then,
the black hole size should be constrained to be smaller than the cosmological particle horizon
(size of the universe) [58]."

the plasma temperature decreases in an adiabatic way after z = 100, when the electron
temperature decouples from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) [31, 60]. The density
defined in (2.5) will be used in (2.1) and redefined as ρ∞; furthermore, for the model where a
density gradient is also considered, such density will be representing the density at the position

applied in the perpendicular direction to the BH motion) ρ(r) = ρ∞exp[−�ρ(r− r0)/racc], see

of the plasma surrounding the binary BHs through the relativistic Mach number definition

speed. The evolution of the plasma density, sound speed, and a few representative velocities

smaller than the age of the universe, the accretion can therefore play an important role in
the mass evolution of the BHs [60]; thus our calculation will starts at z = 100."

3 Results
"Comparison between the relativistic and Newtonian models. In Figure 2 we show
the evolution of: the BH masses, in solar masses units (top panel), BH spins, normalized
to the initial spins (middle panel) and bremsstrahlung bolometric luminosity (bottom panel)
of the individual BHs in the binary. To perform a comparison between the previous results"
"using the Newtonian model and our relativistic accretion model we proceeded as follows.
First, we have performed a forward integration (with our relativistic model) using the initial
BH masses (mi,1 = 22M� and mi,2 = 13M�) previously obtained using the Newtonian
model [63], that, according to the latter, lead to final masses at z = 10 coinciding with the
LVC parameter estimation. For a fair comparison, we have only considered red-shifts in the
range z ∈ [50, 10], gas Mach number M = 2 and no density gradients (�ρ = 0). The green
and orange lines (top panel) show such evolutions; the final masses are over 200% larger than
those estimated for GW190521. Second, we have performed a backward integration using the
final LVC parameters; the blue and red lines show such evolutions, from where we found the
initial masses mi,1 = 19.5M� and mi,2 = 11M�; these are ∼ 13% smaller than the Newtonian
estimations. Both models produce low luminosity emissions, less than 1039 erg/s."
"Small vs. large red-shift accretion. Figure 3 shows evolutions for three different scenarios
for the origin of the GW190521 progenitors, all obtained by backwards integration from the
LVC parameters at red-shift z = 0.82, and assuming that the gas is moving supersonic
velocity, M = 2. The first scenario traces the progenitors back to the early universe, at
z = 100, obtaining initial masses mi,1 = 2.32M� and mi,2 = 0.18M� (purple and grey
solid lines); the second scenario traces the progenitors only back to z = 50, still obtaining
similar initial masses (to the first scenario), mi,1 = 2.33M� and mi,2 = 0.18M� (orange
and green lines); the third scenario only evolves back to z = 20, but still obtains similar
masses, mi,1 = 2.37M� and mi,2 = 0.19M� red and blue lines). Thus, the BHs gain most of
their masses in the final stage of the evolution, for red-shifts z < 10, where an exponential
increment of their masses occurs. Mass (top), spin (middle) and luminosity (bottom) show
the same behavior. The putative different red-shift origin of the progenitors leads to only
to differences of ∼ 2% in the initial masses and spins for formation at z = 100, 50 or 20
red-shifts. This suggests three different possible origins for the GW190521 progenitors: as
primordial BHs at red-shift z = 100, from the collapse of dense clumps at red-shift z = 50,
or as core-collapse of Pop III stars at red-shift z = 20."
"Initial BHs mass and spin dependence on the gas velocity and density gradients.
The previous analysis established the insensitivity of the OPs parameters to the cosmological
epoch of formation, as long as such formation occurs for z & 10. Let us now consider the
dependence on the details of the accretion. In Figure 4, we show initial masses in solar
masses mi,1 (top left) and mi,2 (bottom left) in logarithmic scale integrating back from the
LVC estimated parameters at z = 0.82 back to red-shift z = 100. The right panels exhibit the
corresponding spins a?i,1 and a?i,2. The plots were obtained from 1.6× 105 accretion models,
varying the relativistic Mach number of the gas, considering supersonic relative motion with
Mach numbers in the range ofM∈ [1, 10], and density gradient in the plasma �ρ ∈ [0, 1]."
"The backward integration of the relativistic accretion equations reveals that some models
are self-constrained. Observe the white regions in the right bottom part of the plots; this
excluded region is delimited by small mass BHs, from a few to 10−3 solar masses (greater
than the maximum mass for which Hawking evaporation becomes relevant). Such BHs are
only allowed if formed in the early universe as PBHs. On the other hand, for low-density
gradients �ρ < 0.4 and high Mach numberM > 8 we have a family of high mass BHs; in such
models the progenitors keep an almost constant mass from their formation up to the merger
at z = 0.82, accreting only a very small fraction of their mass. The largest initial masses
found are mi,1 ∼ 71M� and mi,2 ∼ 54M� with spins ai,? ∼ 0.48 and ai,? ∼ 0.49, respectively,
around 80% of the final masses and around 68% of the final spins."

"In Table 1 we display nine representative models, varying the density gradient and Mach
number for each formation scenario. Our relativistic accretion model also allows sBHs as the
OPs, for some range of density gradients and Mach numbers. Such binary systems can
originate from the collapse of dense clumps and core-collapse of hyper-massive stars, gaining
their masses through accretion and reaching the observed masses. The bolometric luminosity
generated by the accretion process is of the order of 1039 erg/s in all cases, at the merger.
This low value is consistent with the LVC conclusion that no electromagnetic emission was
detected."

4 Discussion and Conclusions
"Motivated by the recently reported GW190521 gravitational wave transient, and the fact
that the estimated masses of the two BH progenitors for this event fall into the so-called pair
instability supernova gap, in this paper we have studied the role of accretion, in a relativistic
treatment, in the evolution of these progenitors. Thus, we have explored the possible initial
masses and spins for the progenitors, as well as the luminosity of the IMBH detected from the
gravitational wave event GW190521, by using a general relativistic mass and spin accretion"

the environment where the massive binary system is immersed. The properties of the accretion
flow and spacetime –horizon penetrating ingoing coordinates – also allows stable accretion
rates above the Eddington limit [22]. Furthermore, models with �ρ ≤ 0.5 and self-consistent
radiation evolution exhibit sub-Eddington luminosities, while mass accretion rates are always
super-Eddington [26, 52]. Such high accretion rates (super or hyper Eddington) Ṁ ∼ 5 ×
104ṀEdd can occur in scenarios where the intermediate BH is surrounded by dense metal-
poor clouds, also possible when the electron scattering produced by trapped photon close
to the BH becomes important [50]. The imprints on the dynamic gas-rich environments in
the stellar origin of the progenitor could be detectable in next-generation x-ray and radio"
– 11 –
"observations, by multiwavelength LISA detector [64]. Our semi-analytical formulas can be
improved by performing realistic general-relativistic radiation-hydrodynamic simulations at
radiation-pressure-dominated regime, where accretion rates can be reduced two orders of
magnitude smaller than in the purely hydrodynamic case [26]. However, we expect that the
radiation field will reduce, but not suppress, the super-Eddington accretion, and we anticipate
super-Eddington accretion of the order of Ṁ ∼ 102ṀEdd."
"Concretely, we have computed the masses, the spins and the bremsstrahlung bolometric
luminosity as a function of the red-shift of the epoch of formation of the progenitor BHs.
The results allow a wide range of values for the initial masses and spins, depending on the
initial Mach number and density gradient parameter, which can thus originated from different
astrophysical scenarios at different red-shifts. We have carried out a comparison between the
initial masses of the GW190521 binary system, predicted using the Newtonian and relativistic
expressions of the mass accretion rates. For this comparison, we assume that the BHs formed
at z = 50 and merged at z = 10 with final masses M1 = 85M� and M2 = 66M�. In the
Newtonian case, the initial masses found for the individual progenitors were mi,1 = 22M�
and mi,2 = 13M�, while using the relativistic formula the initial masses were mi,1 = 19.5M�
and mi,2 = 11M�, which are 13% smaller than in the Newtonian case. Moreover, if we use
the relativistic accretion formulas to evolve the initial masses previously estimated with the
Newtonian treatment, mi,1 = 22M� and mi,2 = 13M� [31], the final masses of the system are
200% larger than the LVC estimated ones. These calculations mean that important corrections
are introduced by considering the relativistic formula [52], as expected, since these are strong
gravity systems. It is worth mentioning that in order to perform this comparison we did not
include density gradients (�ρ = 0), since Newtonian mass accretion rate does not include this
kind of information about the environment wherein the massive binary system is immersed."
"The main features of our results have been quantified by analyzing the initial masses,
spins and the bremsstrahlung bolometric luminosity of the GW190521 OPs, as functions of
the relativistic Mach number and of the density gradients of the environment were the system
is immersed. Here we assume that the observed masses M1 = 85M� and M2 = 66M� with
spins a?,1 = 0.69 and a?,2 = 0.73 were measured at z = 0.82 consistently with the LVC
parameter estimation for GW190521. We have found from relativistic accretion calculations
that the BHs detected from GW190521 could originate at considerably different red-shifts,
say, z = 20, 50, and 100, with only small variations in their mass and their spin, of ∼ 2%.
Concerning to the bolometric luminosity, it showed an increment from z = 100 up to z = 0.82,
of around three orders of magnitudes (see Figure 5). Still, the maximum bolometric luminosity
generated by the relativistic accretion process is of the order of 1039erg/s, which correspond
to low energetic emission. This result is consistent with the LVC observation of GW190521
[9], where no electromagnetic emission was detected."
"We also found self-constrained models, corresponding to the white regions in Figure
4, where the backwards integration gives forbidden solutions, i.e., negative masses. Such
constrained region is correlated with the density gradient: increasing the density gradient
the constrained regions also increases, allowing only the models where the Mach numbers are
high. This region is bounded by OPs with small masses and spins, of mi,1 ∼ 10−1M� and
mi,2 ∼ 10−4M�, at z = 100, 50, and 20. Thus, PBHs that grow through accretion could
be the origin of the GW190521 progenitors. The growth of PBHs corresponds to a possible
scenario to explain the masses of IMBH since these can grow up to 102 − 105M� during
the radiation dominated era [43]. On the other hand, for low values of the density gradient
parameter, �ρ < 0.4 and high values of the Mach number, M > 8, we found a family of"
– 12 –
"massive initial BH seeds, with masses of mi,1 = 71M� and mi,2 = 54M� with dimensionless
spins a? = 0.48 and a? = 0.49. In this case, the accretion rates are small due to the high
Mach numbers. The early formation of BHs, with these initial masses, can be associated with
the collapse of Pop III stars that occurs at redshift 15 < z < 30 [38, 65]. Several solutions
found correspond to the slowly rotating sBHs seeds, mi ∼ 3 − 40M�, which could form at
early stages by direct collapse, and grow in mass due to accretion until reaching the final
values at the merger compatible with the LVC parameter estimates."
"In summary, the relativistic accretion model permits qualitatively different OPs: non-
rotating primordial BHs, with initial massesMi . 1M� originated at high red-shifts z . 100;
slowly rotating (a? < 0.5) stellar mass BHs with 3M� . Mi . 40M� originated from stellar
collapse; and moderately rotating (a? ∼ 0.5) intermediate-mass BHs 40M� . Mi . 70M�
from the collapse of Pop III stars."
