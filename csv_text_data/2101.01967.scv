"ABSTRACT
Jets are a commonly observed phenomenon in post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB)
binaries. Due to the orbitalmotion of the binary, the jet causes variable absorption in theBalmer
profiles. In previous work, we have developed spatio-kinematic and radiative transfer models to
reproduce the observed Balmer line variability and derive the spatio-kinematic structure of the
jet and its mass-loss rate. Here, we apply our jet model to five post-AGB binaries with distinct
H𝛼 line variability and diverse orbital properties. Our models fit the H𝛼 line variations very
well. We estimate jet mass-loss rates between 10−8M� yr−1and 10−4M� yr−1, from which
we deduce accretion rates onto the companion between 10−7M� yr−1and 10−3M� yr−1. These
accretion rates are somewhat higher than can be comfortably explainedwith reasonable sources
of accretion, but we argue that the circumbinary disc in these systems is most-likely the source
feeding the accretion, although accretion from the post-AGB star cannot be ruled out. The
diversity of the variability in the five objects is due to their wide ejection cones combined with
a range of viewing angles, rather than inherent differences between the objects. The nature of
the observations does not let us easily distinguish which jet launching model (stellar jet, disc
wind, or X-wind) should be favoured. In conclusion, we show that our jet model includes the
physical parameters to successfully reproduce the H𝛼 line variations and retrieve the structure
and mass-loss rates of the jet for all five objects that are representative of the diverse sample
of Galactic post-AGB binaries."

1 INTRODUCTION
"The post-AGB phase of low to intermediate mass stars is a
short-lived phase during which the star changes dramatically (Van
Winckel 2003). This evolutionary phase becomes more complex if
the post-AGB star is part of a binary system. Binary interactions dur-
ing the post-AGB and preceding phases can fundamentally change
the stellar properties and evolution of both stars."
"Many of these post-AGB binary systems are orbited by large,
circumbinaryKeplerian discs of gas and dust (Bujarrabal et al. 2013,
2018; van Aarle et al. 2011; De Ruyter et al. 2006; Van Winckel
et al. 2009; Kamath et al. 2014, 2015). These post-AGB binaries
with Keplerian discs have periods in the range ∼ 100 − 1200 days
(Van Winckel et al. 2009; Oomen et al. 2018). The discs around"

"these binary systems are likely created by a combination of high
mass-loss rate during the AGB phase and the focusing action of a
binary companion. This focusing action can concentrate the mass
loss on the orbital plane and donate angular momentum, thus cre-
ating a circumbinary, Keplerian disc (Shu et al. 1979; Pejcha et al.
2016; MacLeod et al. 2018; Hubová & Pejcha 2019; Bermúdez-
Bustamante et al. 2020). Their characteristics hold clues to a num-
ber of open questions in stellar astrophysics, such as the nature
of consequence of binary interactions between giants and compact
stars, something that gives rise to scores of evolved binaries such as
cataclysmic variables, or the progenitors of type Ia supernovae (De
Marco & Izzard 2017)."
"Strong binary interactions on the AGB almost invariably lead
to a common envelope in-spiral and merger, or to a close binary (De
Marco et al. 2015). As such, the existence of post-AGB binaries,
particularly those with periods∼100 days, is puzzling: these periods"

"aremuch larger than post-common envelope periods, but too short to
have avoided a common envelope interaction altogether. Neither do
we understand the non-zero eccentricities of these binaries, since the
tidal forces working on the binary system are expected to circularise
the orbit (Zahn 1977). Whether the period distribution of the post-
AGB binary population is due to their having mass ratios near unity
at the time of common envelope (Oomen et al. 2018; Iaconi & De
Marco 2019), or whether the period is widened after the binary
interaction on the AGB, is not clear. Neither is it clear whether
these wide binaries will ever form a visible planetary nebula, and
hence whether they will become the elusive, wider binaries central
star population (Douchin et al. 2015; Jones et al. 2017)."
"A peculiar observational signature of post-AGB stars in bi-
nary systems is an under-abundance of refractory elements in the
spectra of their stellar atmospheres (e.g. Van Winckel et al. 1995;
Van Winckel 1997; Maas et al. 2002). This depletion pattern is
only observed in post-AGB stars with a circumbinary disc (Gezer
et al. 2015; Kamath & Van Winckel 2019). It is currently under-
stood that the pattern is caused by the re-accretion of gas from the
circumbinary disc, since the re-accreted gas becomes poor in refrac-
tory elements after dust formation in the disc (Oomen et al. 2019,
and references therein)."
"Kamath et al. (2016) discovered that the fainter post-AGB bi-
naries with circumbinary discs are actually post-red giant branch
(post-RGB) stars that have evolved off the RGB instead of the AGB.
A subset of the entire post-AGB/post-RGB binary sample populates
the high-luminosity end of the population II cepheid instability strip
(Wallerstein 2002). These pulsating giants are referred to as RV
Tauri stars with dust. The photometric variability of these stars have
typical pulsation periods between 20 and 150 days and a characteris-
tic light curve with an alternation between deep and shallowminima
(Wallerstein 2002; Manick et al. 2017, 2019). Some RV Tauri vari-
ables show a secondary long-term variability with a period between
600 and 2600 days (Pollard et al. 1996), known as photometric type
RVb variables. The variability has been linked to the binary nature
of the system and the presence of a circumbinary disc (Waelkens
et al. 1995; Van Winckel et al. 1999; Manick et al. 2017). When
the inclination angle of the binary system is high enough (about
60◦ or higher), the post-AGB star will be obscured partially by the
circumbinary disc during inferior conjunction, when the post-AGB
star is closest to the observer. This causes a periodic photomet-
ric variability which is synchronous with the orbital period of the
binary system due to variable line-of-sight extinction."
"Gorlova et al. (2012, 2015) performed time-series analyses of
high-resolution optical spectra of post-AGB binaries BD+46◦442
and IRAS19135+3937, and found interesting variations in the
H𝛼 line. They found that the H𝛼 line has a broad, blue-shifted ab-
sorption feature during superior conjunction, when the post-AGB
star is located behind the companion. The origin of this orbital-phase
dependent line variation is the presence of a jet launched from an ac-
cretion disc around the companion star (Gorlova et al. 2012; Bollen
et al. 2017). During superior conjunction, the jet blocks the photo-
spheric light from the post-AGB star. Hence, the hydrogen atoms
in the jet scatter the photospheric light from the post-AGB star out
of the line-of-sight, causing this particular absorption feature. Due
to the orbital motion of the binary, the light of the post-AGB star
shines through different parts of the jet over time, thus allowing for
a tomography of the jet."
"In Bollen et al. (2019), we built a spatio-kinematic model of
the jet, from which synthetic spectra were created and fitted to the
observations. This provided important jet parameters, such as the
jet angle, velocity, and scaled density structure. We found that the"

"jet in BD+46◦442 has a low density inner cavity. This jet cavity can
be caused by the launching geometry of the jet. In the disc-wind
model by Blandford & Payne (1982), the disc matter is launched
from the disc surface. The launching region extends outwards from
the inner disc rim and the matter is launched at an angle larger than
30◦.This results in an inner jet region devoid of matter, similar to
what we observed."
"In Bollen et al. (2020), we improved our spatio-kinematic
model and built an additional radiative transfer model, from which
the absolute jet density structure was estimated. The results of both
models allowed us to calculate the jet mass-loss rates and mass-
accretion rates onto the companion. We found high mass-loss rates
in the order of 10−7 − 10−5M� yr−1, which can be explained by
re-accretion from the circumbinary disc onto the binary system.
This is in line with the observed depletion pattern in post-AGB
stars with circumbinary discs. In Bollen et al. (2020), we tested our
spatio-kinematic and radiative transfer models using BD+46◦442
and IRAS19135+3937. The dynamic spectra and orbital parame-
ters of these two objects were very similar (e.g., orbital periods
of 140.8 days and 127 days, eccentricities of 0.08 and 0.13, and
orbital separations of 0.63AU and 0.55AU, for BD+46◦442 and
IRAS19135+3937, respectively)."
"In this work, we apply our spatio-kinematic and radiative trans-
fermodel to five objectswith diverse dynamicH𝛼 spectra and orbital
parameters, different from the two objects studied in our previous
work.We aim to show that ourmodels contain sufficient physical pa-
rameters to successfully reproduce the observed H𝛼 line variations
for a diverse sample of jet-creating post-AGB binaries."
"This paper is structured as follows: we introduce the spectro-
scopic data and the post-AGB binaries in our sample in Section 2.
We explain our methods for the modelling of these systems in Sec-
tion 3. The results of the spatio-kinematic and radiative transfer
modelling are provided in Section 4. We discuss these results in
Section 5, where we focus on the nature of the jet and the mass-
transfer in the system. We end this paper with a summary and
conclusions in Section 6."

"aims to obtain a clear picture of how these binary systems evolve
(Van Winckel et al. 2010). The spectroscopic data is obtained using
the HERMES spectrograph mounted on the 1.2m MERCATOR
telescope in the Roque de los Muchachos observatory, Canary Is-
lands, Spain (Raskin et al. 2011). The spectra have a spectral res-
olution 𝑅 = 85 000 and cover a wavelength range from 3770 to
9000Å. The total number of high-resolution optical spectra that we
obtained (𝑁obs) and their average signal-to-noise in H𝛼 are listed in
Table 1 for each object. To optimise the fitting routine, the spectra
should provide a good phase coverage of the orbital period, have a
high signal-to-noise in H𝛼 (S/N> 20), and be observed within four
orbital periods of one another. Additionally, if an orbital phase1 is
over-represented by spectra, we remove the spectra with the lowest
signal-to-noise for this phase, in order to avoid over-fitting. This
leaves us with between 26 and 42 spectra for our program stars
(𝑁used in Table 1). In Figure 1, we display the time-series of the
H𝛼 profiles folded on the orbital phase. We call this representation
the dynamic spectra and colour code the normalised spectrum per
orbital phase. To make the dynamic spectra smooth, we interpolate
in orbital phase. The total number of selected spectra are indicated
with a horizontal dash on these dynamic spectra. This shows that we
have a good coverage of the orbital phase for these program stars."
2.2 Sample
"We aim to model a diverse set of post-AGB binaries. To that end,
we select five objects based on three criteria: (1) The objects exhibit
distinct temporal variability in their H𝛼 line caused by the jet. (2)
The objects span a large range of orbital parameters. (3) Since we
have already tested the spatio-kinematic model on BD+46◦442 and
IRAS19135+3937 in Bollen et al. (2019) and Bollen et al. (2020),
we choose objects that differ from these two post-AGB binaries.
Based on these criteria, we selected the following five jet-creating
post-AGB binary systems for our analysis: 89Her, EP Lyr, HD
46703, HP Lyr, and TW Cam. We will introduce these objects in
the following subsections."
"1 We define orbital phase as the phase (from 0 to 1) in the orbital period,
where orbital phase 0 corresponds to periastron."
2.2.1 89 Her
"89Her is an extensively studied post-AGB binary system. The bi-
nary nature of this system was first established by Arellano Ferro
(1984) and later confirmed by Waters et al. (1993). Bujarrabal et al.
(2007) examined CO interferometric data of 89Her and found the
presence of two nebular components: a compact unresolved compo-
nent from the circumbinary disc and an extended hour-glass struc-
ture with an expansion velocity of about 7 km s−1, which can be
ascribed to a molecular outflow. Bujarrabal et al. (2007) inferred
a binary inclination angle of 15◦, based on the symmetry axis of
the hour-glass outflow. Hillen et al. (2013, 2014) established that
the presence of a jet-like outflow originating from the companion
can explain the presence of the over-resolved scattering component
observed in the reconstructed image based on near-IR interferomet-
ric data and the P Cygni-like H𝛼 line of 89Her. Gangi et al. (2020)
acquired spectra over a time-interval of 40 years and found long-
term variability in the H𝛼 line. They propose a possible scenario of
recursive mass-ejection events, occurring every 5000 d."
"Kipper (2011) analysed the chemical composition of 89Her
and found the primary star to be metal deficient with [Fe/H] = −0.5.
They also found 𝑇eff = 6600K and log 𝑔 = 0.8 (see Table 2). With
an orbital period of 289.1 days, 89Her has the shortest period of
the objects in our program stars (Oomen et al. 2018). This binary
has a high eccentricity of 0.29. We use 26 high-resolution optical
spectra of this object, which almost cover four full binary orbits.
These spectra have high signal-to-noise ratios that range between
80 and 160 in the H𝛼 line."
"The H𝛼 line of 89Her has a P Cygni-like profile at all orbital
phases, where the absorption feature reaches blue-shifted velocities
between 100 − 200 km s−1. Interestingly, when we look at the line
variations in the dynamic spectra of the H𝛼 line in Figure 1a, it
becomes apparent that the orbital-phase dependent variations are
minor. The absorption feature is present throughout the whole or-
bital phase and is at its strongest during superior conjunction, at
orbital phase 𝜙 = 0.45. Since the absorption feature is always ob-
served and the inclination angle of the binary system is rather small,
it is highly likely that the continuum light from the post-AGB star
towards the observer is blocked by the jet during the whole orbital
period. This implies that the jet has an half-opening angle larger
than the inclination angle of the binary system."
2.2.2 EP Lyr
"EPLyr is one of three RV Tauri stars in the sample. EP Lyr was
classified as an RVa photometric variable by Zsoldos (1995), who
identified pulsation periods of 41.6 and 83.8 days. Manick et al.
(2017) found similar pulsation periods, based on the radial velocity
measurements of their spectroscopic data. Abundance analyses by
Gonzalez et al. (1997) indicated stellar parameters of𝑇eff = 6200K,
log 𝑔 = 1.5, and [Fe/H]= −1.8. However, due to the pulsations,
the post-AGB star in the system shows significant variations in its
effective temperature, which can fluctuate by 800K (Gonzalez et al.
1997). The binary system has a long period of 1151 days and the
highest eccentricity (𝑒 = 0.39) in our sample (Oomen et al. 2018)."
"The 30 spectra that we use in this study cover two and a half
orbital cycles and have a signal-to-noise ratio that averages at S/N=
45 in H𝛼. The main feature that stands out in the dynamic H𝛼 line of
EPLyr, shown in Figure 1b, is the irregularity in the double-peaked
emission. According to Pollard et al. (1997), this sudden increased
emission in the H𝛼 line can be attributed to shock events in the
photosphere of the evolved star. The absorption feature, caused by"

"the jet in EPLyr, is short-lived but very prominent in the H𝛼 line.
The jet blocks the light from the primary star during approximately
20% of the orbital phase and reaches velocities up to 200 km s−1."
2.2.3 HD 46703
"HD46703 is a post-AGB binary system which shows mild flux
variations in its photometric data, suggesting that the post-AGB
star has weak pulsations (Hrivnak et al. 2008). Hrivnak et al.
(2008) performed a chemical abundance analysis on HD46703
and found the following stellar parameters: effective tempera-
ture 𝑇eff = 6250K, surface gravity log 𝑔 = 1.0, and metallicity
[Fe/H]= −1.5. HD 46703 has orbital period of 597.4 days and an
eccentricity of 0.30 (Oomen et al. 2018). As mentioned by Oomen
et al. (2020), the inclination angle of the binary orbit is most likely
smaller than 60 degrees, since the object does not show an RVb
signature."
"For this object,we select 34 spectra that cover 2.7 orbital cycles.
The signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra range between S/N= 27 and
S/N= 99 in H𝛼. The H𝛼 line of HD46703 is mainly governed
by the photospheric absorption (See Figure 1c). The line has a
weak double-peaked emission feature, which follows the primary
component, suggesting that this emission is associated tomaterial in
the vicinity of the primary component. The blue-shifted absorption
feature caused by the jet is short-lived during the orbital period and
relatively weak. This feature is not centred on the phase of superior
conjunction. The absorption feature occurs sooner, suggesting that
the jet might be tilted forward, towards the direction of travel of the
companion."
2.2.4 HP Lyr
"HPLyr is the second RV Tauri object in our sample. This object
was classified as a photometric RVa type by Graczyk et al. (2002).
They found a remarkably long pulsation period of 68.95 days. The
spectroscopic analysis byManick et al. (2017) found a similar period
of 68 days from a time-series analysis of their spectroscopic data.
Out of the 68 spectra obtained by Manick et al. (2017), 17 show
observational shock signatures, which indicates that shocks occur
rather frequently in this object. The stellar parameters of HPLyr
were determined during the abundance analysis of (Giridhar et al.
2005): 𝑇eff = 6300K, log 𝑔 = −1.0, and [Fe/H]= 1.0. HPLyr has
an orbital period of 1818 days and thus has the longest period in our
sample. The eccentricity for this binary system is 0.20."
"We select 40 spectra of HPLyr that cover 92% of the full binary
orbit, with an average signal-to-noise ratio of 53. Due to the long
orbital period of this system, we did not obtain any observations
between orbital phase 𝜙 = 0.68 and 𝜙 = 0.77. HPLyr has one of the
most remarkable jet absorption features in its H𝛼 line. The dynamic
H𝛼 line is represented in Figure 1d. The jet absorption is observed
during more than half of the orbital period. The absorption feature
rapidly increases in strength around orbital phase 0.2, and appears
to slowly drop of in strength, until it disappears at orbital phase 0.75.
During these phases, the maximum, blue-shifted extent of the ab-
sorption stays relatively constant at −150 km s−1. A weak emission
is observed throughout the whole orbital phase, which occasionally
shows peaks, caused by the shocks. Interestingly, although shocks
are more prevalent in this system than in EP Lyr, the increased
strength of the emission in H𝛼 is limited."
2.2.5 TW Cam
"TWCam is the third RV Tauri star in our sample, with two pulsation
periods of 43 and 85 days (Preston et al. 1963; Zsoldos & Kollath
1991; Manick et al. 2017). This object was first classified as a pho-
tometric type RVa star by Giridhar et al. (2000), until Manick et al.
(2017) showed long-term photometric variations in its light curve
and reclassified TWCam as a photometric type RVb. Giridhar et al.
(2000) derived the following stellar parameters in their abundance
analysis of TWCam:𝑇eff = 4800K, log 𝑔 = 0.0, and [Fe/H]= −0.5.
This object has an orbital period of 662 days and an eccentricity of
0.25."
"TWCam has a very prominent jet absorption feature in its
H𝛼 line, that covers about 50% of the orbital period. The absorption
shows peculiar variations during the orbital phase, as it peaks to a
blue-shifted velocity of −400 km s−1 twice during orbital phases
0.55 and 0.75, but drops to −200 km s−1 between these phases,
giving it a double-peaked shape. The emission feature is present
throughout the whole orbital phase. Although Manick et al. (2017)
observed shock features in the spectroscopic data of TWCam, the
shock-related emission peaks in the H𝛼 line are weak in strength."
3 METHODS
"In this work, we apply the spatio-kinematic model and radiative
transfer model from Bollen et al. (2020), in order to determine the
geometric, kinematic, and density structure of the jet and its mass-
loss rate. Below, we briefly describe the two modelling techniques.
We refer the reader to Bollen et al. (2019) and Bollen et al. (2020)
for a detailed description."
"For the spatio-kinematic modelling of the jet, we recreate the
observed absorption feature in H𝛼 caused by the scattering of pho-
tospheric light of the post-AGB star, by modelling the jet-binary
system. The main components of the model are the post-AGB star,
the companion star, and the jet, which is centred on the companion."
"In the model, we trace the light that travels from the post-AGB
star towards the observer. Hence, we first provide the model with
a background spectrum, which does not include the jet absorption
feature. This background spectrum has two components: the pho-
tospheric light from the post-AGB star and an emission component
observed in H𝛼. For all five program stars, the emission compo-
nent in H𝛼 follows the radial velocity motion of the post-AGB star.
Hence, we assume that this emission is linked to the post-AGB star."
"If this (background) light passes through the jet, we calculate
the optical depth along this ray in order to determine howmuch light
is scattered by the jet. By doing so, we create synthetic H𝛼 spectra
for each orbital phase. We then fit the synthetic H𝛼 line variations to
the observed H𝛼 lines using the emceeMarkov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) algorithm (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). This gives us
the best-fitting parameters for the jet-binary model."
"In the model, we implement three jet configurations: the stellar
jet, the X-wind, and the disc wind. The stellar jet is based on the jet
model by Matt & Pudritz (2005), where part of the disc matter is
ejected along the open stellar magnetic field lines that are anchored
on the star. The disc wind configuration is based on the magneto-
centrifugal disc wind model by Blandford & Payne (1982). In this
model, the matter is ejected along the magnetic field lines anchored
to the accretion disc. These magnetic field lines have a minimum
inclination of 30 ◦ with respect to the jet axis. The X-wind model
by Shu et al. (1994) is similar in nature to the disc wind model. The
disc matter is also launched at an angle larger than 30 ◦. However,"
"MNRAS 000, 1–16 (2020)"
6 D. Bollen et al.
"the magnetic field in this model is squeezed together in the inner
disc region, giving the outflow its distinct X-shape. We incorporate
the most important features of these three jet models in our jet
configurations. Just as the model by Matt & Pudritz (2005), the
stellar jet is centred on the companion and the jet matter follows the
magnetic field lines of the star. For the X-wind configuration, we
include a jet cavity which has a minimum angle of 25 ◦. The disc
wind configuration is similar to the X-wind, but the ejected matter
in the model originates from the surface of the circum-companion
accretion disc. Additionally, we allow the jet in each configuration
to be inclined with respect to the orbital axis of the binary system."
"Next, we use the best-fitting jet configuration of the spatio-
kinematic model as input for the radiative transfer modelling of
the jet. For the radiative transfer, we assume local thermodynamic
equilibrium and an isothermal jet. This radiative transfer model
calculates the level populations of the excited states of hydrogen, in
order to calculate the amount of scattering that is caused by the jet
in the Balmer lines. These level populations are dependent on the
local temperature and density of the jet. Hence, the total amount
of absorption in the four Balmer lines and their relative difference
will change for different jet temperatures and densities. In order to
quantify this absorption, we calculate the equivalent width (EW) of
the first four Balmer lines in the observations, i.e., H𝛼, H𝛽, H𝛾, and
H𝛿. Then, we use a grid of jet temperatures and densities to create
synthetic Balmer line spectra and fit the EW of these synthetic lines
to the EW of the observed spectra. By doing so, we can find the jet
densities and temperatures, from which we can determine the jet
mass-loss rates in each system."

"In the following subsections, we describe the setup for the spatio-
kinematic model for each object, followed by a description of the
spatio-kinematic and radiative transfer results. The best-fitting jet
configurations and parameters are listed in Table 3. The best-fitting
jet temperature and density are listed in Table 4. The corresponding
geometry of the binary system and the jet are represented in Figure 2
and the synthetic spectra are shown in Figure 3. In order to compare
the goodness-of-fit result between the three models, we calculate
the reduced chi-square 𝜒2a from the observed and modelled flux for
each flux point in each spectrum."

in parameters, which results in very small uncertainties. These
uncertainties are not representative of the accuracy of the model
parameters, however, but rather of the sensitivity of the parameters."
4.1 Results: 89 Her
"We perform the spatio-kinematic modelling of 89Her, using the
three aforementioned jet configurations. We use a synthetic stellar
spectrum fromCoelho (2014), based on the atmospheric parameters
of 89Her (see Section 2.2.1). We use the synthetic stellar spectra
from this library for the other objects in our study as well. In the
MCMC-modelling of 89Her, we limit the range for the inclination
angle of the binary system between 8◦ and 20◦, based on the ob-
served inclination angles found for 89Her (Bujarrabal et al. 2007;
Hillen et al. 2014)."
"The best-fitting configuration for 89Her is a stellar jet, with
a half-opening angle of \ = 31◦ and a jet velocity up to 𝑣in =
155 km s−1. As can be seen in Figure 2a, the density profile of the
jet does not drop dramatically from the outer regions to the inner
regions of the jet, but has a rather uniform density. With −1◦, the
jet shows no significant tilt with respect to the orbital axis of the
binary2. The radius of the post-AGB star in 89Her is the smallest
in our sample with 𝑅1 = 50R� ."
"The modelled dynamic spectra of 89Her reproduces the ab-
sorption feature well, which is observed over the whole orbital
period of the binary system (see Figure 3a). As we speculated in
Section 2.2.1, this effect is due to an inclination angle that is smaller
than the jet half-opening angle, such that our line-of-sight towards
the primary star is always blocked by the jet. This is confirmed by
our best-fitting model, where we find an inclination angle of 8◦ and
a jet half-opening angle of 31◦ for 89Her."
"We use this best-fitting jet configuration as input for the radia-
tive transfermodelling.Wefit for a range of jet densities and uniform
jet temperatures. The jet temperatures range between 4400K and
6600K in steps of 100K and the logarithm of the density at the edge
of the jet and at a height of 1AU from the jet base ranges between
14 and 18 in logarithmic steps of 0.2. We fit the EW in H𝛼, H𝛽, H𝛾,
and H𝛿 from the model to the observations (see Figure B2a). The
best fitting jet temperature and density are 𝑇jet = 5000+300−300 K and
log 𝜌 = 17+0.6−0.2 (see Figure B1a). This translates to a jet mass-loss
rate of 2.0+7−0.6 × 10"
−6M� yr−1.
4.2 Results: EP Lyr
"The observed H𝛼 line of EPLyr shows strong variations due to
the stellar pulsations and shocks of the primary. For this reason,
we perform the MCMC-modelling for this object twice, with each
run having different background spectra. For the first run, the back-
ground spectra include the photospheric light of the primary and the
observed emission feature. This emission feature is always centred
on the radial velocity of the primary and constant in strength. For
the second run, we include these two components as well. We also
include the radial velocity shift of the pulsations that were found by
Manick et al. (2017) and the shocks in the H𝛼 line. These shocked
spectra have a stronger emission component. The emission strength
for these spectra is based on the average strength of the observed
spectra with shocks. For both runs, we set a range of inclination
angles between 30◦ and 80◦."
"The best-fittingmodel for the fitting of EPLyrwith andwithout
pulsations is a stellar jet. Interestingly, the reduced chi-square of"
"2 A positive jet tilt corresponds to a jet with the cone through which the
line-of-sight passes through tilted away from the direction of travel of the
companion. A negative tilt implies that this cone is tilted towards the direc-
tion of travel."

the mass will be located at the jet edges and the inner regions of the"
"jet have an extremely low density, which is very similar to the jet
cavity in the X-wind and disc wind configurations."
"The modelled dynamic H𝛼 spectra of EPLyr, shown in Fig-
ure 3b, have a similar short-lived jet absorption feature as the ob-
served dynamic spectra. Based on the best-fitting model results,
this is induced by an inclination angle (𝑖 = 58◦) that is significantly
larger than the jet half-opening angle (\out = 36◦). In other words,
this causes the line-of-sight from the observer to the primary star to
be blocked by the jet for a brief period of time (∼ 20% of the orbital
period)."
"For the radiative transfermodelling,we set a range from 4200K
to 6200K in steps of 100K for the jet temperature and from 14 to
18 in steps of 0.2 for the logarithm of the jet density. For this
object, we only fit the EW of H𝛼 and H𝛽. The best-fitting results
of jet temperature and density are 𝑇jet = 5800+300−1600 K and log 𝜌 =
15.8+1.4−1 (see Figure B1b). The corresponding jet mass-loss rate for
this jet density and configuration is 9 × 10−8M� yr−1. Due to the
larger uncertainty in the data, the one-sigma confidence interval has
a large range from 9 × 10−9M� yr−1 to 2 × 10−6M� yr−1."

"the jet is an X-wind, with a very wide half-opening angle of 63◦ and
a jet tilt of almost 10◦. The density in the jet peaks at a jet angle of
34◦ and is rather uniform throughout the jet, except for the inner jet
region (< 25◦) where the jet has a cavity. The jet velocities range
from 11 km s−1up to 211 km s−1."
"The shape of the absorption feature in HPLyr is well repro-
duced by the model, as can be seen in Figure 3e. The best-fitting
model for HPLyr finds a jet half-opening angle that is larger than
the inclination angle of the binary system, which was also the case
for 89Her. However, contrary to 89Her, the observed absorption
feature is not present over the whole orbital period, but covers about
half of the orbital period. This raises the question as to how it is pos-
sible that our line-of-sight towards the primary is always blocked,
yet the continuum light in H𝛼 is not always scattered by the jet. The
reason for this feature is most-likely the location where the photo-
spheric light of the primary, that travels to the observer, enters the
jet. We have illustrated this in Figure 5, where we show a jet-binary
system with an inclination angle, or viewing angle, smaller than
the jet half-opening angle. During superior conjunction, the photo-
spheric light will enter the jet closer to its base, where the density
is high. During inferior conjunction, the companion and primary
star have switched positions. Now, the photospheric light will pass
through the jet at a greater height. Hence, the entry point will be
further from the base, where the density is significantly smaller
compared to the entry point at superior conjunction. This means
that the amount of scattering of photospheric light by the jet is too
low to observe an absorption feature in H𝛼."

transfer modelling is set from 4000K to 6000K in steps of 100K

4.5 Results: TW Cam
"As for HPLyr, we did not set strict limits on the model parameters
for the spatio-kinematic modelling of TWCam. For this object,
we find the best-fitting jet configuration to be an X-wind, which is
represented in Figure 2e. The binary system has a low inclination
angle of 26◦ and the post-AGB star has a large radius of 83R� . The"
"jet has a half-opening angle of 49◦ with a jet cavity of 25◦, and is
tilted by 5◦ with respect to the orbital axis of the binary system. The
jet in TWCam has the highest outflow velocity in this sample with
𝑣out = 443 km s−1."
"The corresponding dynamic H𝛼 line for the best-fitting model
of TWCam is shown in Figure 3f. The model can successfully
reproduce the complex double-peaked absorption feature in the line.
Themodel predicts an inclination angle (26◦) that is smaller than the
jet half-opening angle, even though the absorption is not observed
throughout the whole orbital period. Hence, we assume the same
argument for TWCam as for HPLyr, that the scattering by the jet
is not substantial enough to create an absorption feature during
inferior conjunction."
"For the radiative transfermodelling,we set a range from 3600K
to 5000K in steps of 100K for the jet temperature and from 17 to
21 in steps of 0.2 for the logarithm of the jet density. We only fit the
EW of the H𝛼 and H𝛽 from our model to the observations, since the
uncertainties in the higher Balmer lines become too large. The best-
fitting jet temperature and density for TWCam are 𝑇 = 4400+200−400 K
and log 𝜌 = 18.4+0.9−0.2 (see Figure B1e). This translates to a jet mass-
loss rate of 1.8× 10−4M� yr−1, which is the highest mass-loss rate
for the jets in our sample. The one-sigma confidence interval ranges
from 1.1 × 10−4M� yr−1 to 1.4 × 10−3M� yr−1."
5 DISCUSSION
5.1 The nature of the jet
5.1.1 The jet-launching mechanism
"For the spatio-kinematic modelling of the jet, we fit three distinct
jet configurations representing three different jet-launching mecha-
nisms: the stellar jet, the X-wind, and the disc-wind configurations."
"The reduced chi-square values for the fitting are listed inTable 3
and the dynamic H𝛼 model spectra are shown in Figure 4. For
89Her, EPLyr, and HD46703, the stellar jet configuration gives
the lowest chi-square value. For HPLyr and TWCam, the X-wind
configuration provides a better fit. This said, the difference in chi-
square between the three jet configurations is not always statistically
significant. The main reason for this is that the line-of-sight probes
the jet at a height of 1−2AU from the jet launch-point, while the size
of the launching region is a factor of ∼ 100 smaller than this height.
At these heights, it becomes difficult to distinguish between the
three jet configurations. This can be seen in Figure 2. For example,
the stellar jet configurations of EPLyr and HD46703 have a low
density region along the jet axis. This mimics the jet cavity that
is included in the X-wind and disc-wind configurations, such that
this jet resembles the X-wind of TWCam. Hence, based on our
fitting results, we cannot easily differentiate between the different
jet-launching mechanisms."
5.1.2 Jet angle and velocity
"The jets in all five systems have wide half-opening angles between
∼ 30−60 ◦. Thesewide jets are commonly observed in other evolved
binary systems and can explain the observed shapes of PNe and
proto-PNe (Soker 2004; Akashi & Soker 2008, 2013, 2018), which
are closely related to our post-AGB binary jets. Additionally, the
maximum jet velocities, which range from 150 to 440 km s−1, are
of the order of the escape velocity of a main sequence star, rather
than, for example, a white dwarf. This strengthens the argument by"
"MNRAS 000, 1–16 (2020)"
12 D. Bollen et al.
"Bollen et al. (2017) that the companion star in these systems is most
likely always a main sequence star."
5.1.3 Jet-binary plane misalignment
"The set-up of the jet in our model is such that the jet axis can be
inclined with respect to the rotation axis of the binary system. A
positive jet tilt corresponds to a jet for which the cone throughwhich
the line-of-sight passes through is tilted away from the direction of
travel of the companion. An interesting outcome of this study is the
range in jet inclinations or tilts that we find in our sample, which
varies from −5◦ up to 10◦. The jet tilt has a strong effect on the
H𝛼 line absorption feature. A positive jet tilt will cause the jet
absorption to be observed later in phase. Hence, the peak of the
absorption feature will not occur during superior conjunction, but
during a later orbital phase."
"A tilted jet is a common phenomenon in jet-launching systems.
Many jets show a long-term precessing motion. Examples are the
precessing jets in protostellar systemV380OriNE (Choi et al. 2017)
and in the ""water fountain"" evolved systems IRAS16342−3814 (Sa-
hai et al. 2017) and IRAS 18286−0959 (Yung et al. 2011). The jet
in IRAS 18286−0959 reaches a precession half-opening angle of
about 14◦, showing that large jet tilts are possible."
"The three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic simulations
performed by Sheikhnezami & Fendt (2015) showed that a jet tilt
might be connected to binarity. They simulated a jet launched from
a star surrounded by an accretion disc, in a single star system and in
a binary system. For the simulations of a jet launched by the star in
a binary system, they found jet bending and the onset of precession,
with a precession angle of 4◦. In a later study by Sheikhnezami &
Fendt (2018), similar simulations were performed for different bi-
nary mass ratios, binary separations, and inclination angles between
the accretion disc and the orbital plane. They assumed mass ratios
𝑞 = 𝑀d/𝑀a = 0.5, 1, and 2, with 𝑀d and 𝑀a the mass of the donor
star and the accretor, respectively. The orbital separations in their
simulations are 𝑎 = 150 𝑅in and 200 𝑅in, with 𝑅in the inner disc
radius of the accretion disc, and accretion disc inclinations of 0◦,
10◦, and 30◦. In their simulations, the offset of the jet rotation axis
relative to its initial position reached 8◦ for the model with 𝑞 = 1,
𝑎 = 150 𝑅in, and a jet inclination of 𝛿 = 10◦. The mass ratios of
the binaries in our sample range from 0.17 up to 0.63, with orbital
separations ranging from 62 𝑅in to 187 𝑅in (assuming an inner disc
radius that is three times the stellar radius of the companion star).
These parameters are listed in Table 5. These orbital and stellar
parameters are similar to the model setup of Sheikhnezami & Fendt
(2018). This is especially the case for EPLyr, with 𝑞 = 0.63 and
𝑎 = 187 𝑅in. Hence, these simulations and the aforementioned ob-
servations of precessing jets lead us to assume that the jets in our
sample are similar in nature."
"If the jets in our sample have a precessing motion, the jet
absorption feature in H𝛼will shift as a function of orbital phase
over time. According to Bate et al. (2000), the precession period of
the accretion disc, and thus the jet, will be about 20 times the orbital
period of the binary. The precession periods for the objects in our
sample would range from 16 years to 100 years."
5.2 Source feeding the accretion
"An important question to understand the formation and evolution of
post-AGB binaries is the nature of the source feeding the circum-
companion accretion disc. The plausible sources are the post-AGB"
"star, the circumbinary disc or both. In Bollen et al. (2020), we cal-
culated the accretion rates in the circum-companion accretion disc
based on the mass-loss rates in the jet and compared these val-
ues with estimated mass-loss rates from the circumbinary disc and
the post-AGB star. We showed that the circumbinary disc is more
likely to be the source feeding the accretion. However, mass trans-
fer from both the circumbinary disc and the post-AGB star cannot
be excluded. Here, we will perform a similar analysis, in order to
determine the source feeding the circum-companion accretion disc."
5.2.1 Mass-transfer rates
"The estimation of the mass-accretion rates onto the companion is
dependent on the mass-ejection rates in the jet. Here, we assume
an ejection efficiency ( ¤𝑀jet, tot/ ¤𝑀accr)3 of 0.4, but we note that this
figure is very much an estimate and that values in the range 0.04
to 1 are possible (Shu et al. 1994; Ferreira et al. 2006; Blackman
& Lucchini 2014). The resulting accretion rates for the jets in our
sample are listed in Table 6."
"First, we compute the possible mass transfer from the stel-
lar wind of the post-AGB star to the accretion disc around the
companion. When a star is in the post-AGB phase, most of the en-

a decreased mass loss with typical mass-loss rates of the order of
10−9 −10−7M� yr−1(Blöcker 1995; Miller Bertolami 2019). How-
ever, there are still large uncertainties associated with determining
the mass-loss rates of stellar winds in post-AGB stars (Soker &
Harpaz 2002; Van Winckel 2003; Cranmer & Saar 2011). Here,
we will use the prescription by Schröder & Cuntz (2005), which is
based on Reimers law (Reimers 1975):"

"with 𝑀1, 𝐿1, 𝑅1, 𝑇eff, and 𝑔1 the mass, luminosity, radius, effective
temperature, and surface gravity of the primary. The actual mass-
transfer rate from the post-AGB star to the companion is highly
dependent on the mass-transfer method, i.e., Roche-lobe overflow
(RLOF), wind-RLOF (Mohamed&Podsiadlowski 2007), or Bondi-
Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion (Hoyle & Lyttleton 1939; Bondi
& Hoyle 1944; Edgar 2004). For RLOF to occur, the post-AGB
star has to fill its Roche lobe. However, the Roche-lobe filling fac-
tor of these objects lies between 0.3 and 0.7. Hence, we can rule
out this method. Instead, we will assume that mass is being ac-
creted by the companion via wind-RLOF or BHL accretion. The
efficiency of wind-RLOF and BHL accretion highly depend on the
stellar and orbital parameters of the binary system (Edgar 2004;
Abate et al. 2013). Most simulations show that the mass-transfer ef-
ficiency ( ¤𝑀accr/ ¤𝑀pAGB) ranges from one percent up to fifty percent
(Mohamed& Podsiadlowski 2007; Abate et al. 2013; Saladino et al.
2019; Chen et al. 2020). Hence, we assume this range as well for the
possible mass-transfer efficiency for the post-AGBwind. We list the
resulting mass-transfer rates from the post-AGB star ( ¤𝑀tr,pAGB) for
a mass-transfer efficiency of 1% (lower), 10% (average), and 50%
(upper) in Table 6."
"Next, we estimate the re-accretion rate from the circumbinary

tion by Rafikov (2016b). We assume the standard 𝛼-disc model by"

ion with the mass-accretion rates of the circum-companion disc in
Figure 6. For EPLyr and HD46703, the mass-transfer rate from the
circumbinary disc is in good agreement with themass-accretion rate"

"Figure 6. The estimated mass-transfer rates to the companion from both

mass-accretion rates onto the companion derived from the model for the five
objects. The values are given in logarithmic scale and the grey dashed line
represents the identity line."
"of the companion. Additionally, the accretion models of EPLyr in
Oomen et al. (2020) reach similar re-accretion rates of the circumbi-
nary disc onto the central binary of the order of 10−7M� yr−1. This
is a strong indication for this object that re-accretion is the source
feeding the circum-companion accretion disc. The final re-accretion
rates found by Oomen et al. (2020) for HD46703 are one order of
magnitude lower (0.5 − 5 × 10−8M� yr−1), but still fall within the
uncertainties."
"Figure 6 shows that for each object the estimated mass-transfer
rates from the circumbinary disc is higher than the estimated mass-
transfer rate from the post-AGB star. Since the mass must be pro-
vided by at least one of these sources, it is thus more likely that the
circumbinary disc provides the bulk of the mass to the companion."
"For TWCam the mass-accretion rate is three orders of mag-
nitude larger than the expected mass-transfer rate from the cir-
cumbinary disc and five orders of magnitude larger than the mass-
transfer rate from the post-AGB star. This high mass-accretion rate
of 9 × 10−4M� yr−1is improbable, since it would imply that either
the post-AGB star has a mass-loss rate > 10−3M� yr−1or that the
lifetime of the circumbinary disc would be 10 years (assuming a
disc mass of 10−2M� yr−1)."
"The high mass-accretion rate in TWCam is likely due to the
limits of our jet model. In our model, we assume a constant effective
temperature for the post-AGB star and a uniform jet temperature.
However, TWCam shows stellar pulsations and shocks, which will
cause a significant change in effective temperature. Additionally,
since we observe absorption caused by the jet, we can infer that the
jet must be colder than the post-AGB star, which is relatively cool
(4800K). The jet density has to be higher at a cooler temperature, in
order to observe the absorption feature in the Balmer lines. Hence,
the combination of the uniform jet temperature and the constant
effective temperature might cause the model to choose a low jet"
"temperature and high densities, which then results in high mass-
loss rates. In future work, we will improve on the jet model by
incorporating more sophisticated prescriptions to better model the
shocks and the jet temperature structure, such that we can better
estimate the mass-loss and mass-accretion in such stars."
6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
"We have modelled a diverse sample of post-AGB binaries with jets,
using the spatio-kinematic and radiative transfer models described
in Bollen et al. (2019) and Bollen et al. (2020)."
"Our sample of five post-AGB binaries comprises a broad range
of orbital parameters and different Balmer line variations that are
caused by the jet absorption. Our model can successfully reproduce
the dynamic H𝛼 spectra for all sources, which demonstrates that it
has a sufficient number of physical ingredients to account for the
most important features in the Balmer line variability of this diverse
group of objects."
"From the spatio-kinematic modelling, we obtained the geomet-
ric, kinematic, and relative density structure of the jet.We found jets
with wide half-opening angles (between 30 and 60◦) and jet outflow
velocities in the range 150 − 440 km s−1. Additionally, our results
show that a tilted jet is very common for these systems (the range
is 5 − 10◦). This tilt can be explained by precession. Jet precession
is commonly observed in different classes of jet-launching objects
(e.g., Choi et al. 2017). Moreover, simulations of jets launched by a
star in a binary system show that the presence of a companion can
cause precessing motion (Sheikhnezami & Fendt 2015, 2018). Jet
configurations in our model are based on three jet-launching mod-
els: a stellar jet, an X-wind and a disc wind. The best fits assuming
each configuration in turn cannot discriminate between the three
models. This is mainly caused by the relatively small dimensions of
the launching region in all three models, compared to the whole sys-
tem. Hence, it is not possible to distinguish which process is more
likely to be the launching mechanism in these jets. Other observa-
tional techniques, such as interferometric imagingwith high angular
resolution, might be necessary in order to get a better understanding
of the jet-launching mechanisms at play in these systems."
"From the radiative transfer model, we were able to obtain
jet temperatures and densities. By combining the spatio-kinematic
structure with the radiative transfer model, we found the jet mass-
loss rates for these objects and estimated the mass-accretion rates in
the circum-companion accretion disc. We compared these accretion
rates with expected mass-transfer rates from the post-AGB star or
from the circumbinary disc. We found that the accretion rates are
too high to be explained solely by mass-transfer from the post-
AGB star to the companion mass-transfer. The accretion rates are in
better accordance with a mass-transfer from the circumbinary disc
to the companion. We conclude that the circumbinary disc is most
likely the main source of the accreted material, however, we cannot
exclude the possible mass-transfer from the post-AGB star."
"In future work, we will improve upon the jet model, by imple-
menting a more sophisticated temperature structure and radiative
transfer calculations. We will also apply improved spatio-kinematic
and radiative transfer model to all 15 jet-creating post-AGB binary
systems in our target sample. This will provide us with jet param-
eters, mass-loss rates, and mass-accretion rates. We ultimately aim
to correlate jet and accretion properties with the binary properties,
which will give us more insights on the binary interaction history
of post-AGB binary systems."
