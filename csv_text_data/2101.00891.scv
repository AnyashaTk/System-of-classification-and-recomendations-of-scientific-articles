ABSTRACT
"Context. Dwarf galaxies and their dark matter (DM) haloes have velocity curves of a different character than those in large galaxies.
These velocity curves are modelled by a simple pseudo-isothermal model containing only two parameters, which do not give us
insight into the physics of the DM halo.
Aims. We seek to obtain some insight into the physical conditions in DM haloes of dwarf galaxies by using a simple physically based
model of DM haloes.
Methods. To treat the diversity of the dwarf galaxy velocity profiles in a unifying framework, we applied polytropic spheres charac-
terised by the polytropic index n and the relativistic parameter σ as a model of dwarf-galaxy DM haloes and matched the velocity of
circular geodesics of the polytropes to the velocity curves observed in the dwarf galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS ensemble.
Results. We introduce three classes of the LITTLE THINGS dwarf galaxies in relation to the polytrope models due to the different
character of the velocity profile. The first class corresponds to polytropes that have n < 1 with linearly increasing velocity along the
whole profile, the second class has 1 < n < 2 and the velocity profile becomes flat in the external region, the third class has n > 2,
and the velocity profile reaches a maximum and demonstrates a decline in the external region. The σ parameter has to be strongly
non-relativistic (σ < 10−8) for all dwarf galaxy models; this parameter varies for the models of each class, but these variations have
negligible influence on the character of the velocity profile.
Conclusions. Our results indicate a possibility that at least two different kinds of DM are behind the composition of DM haloes. The
matches of the observational velocity curves are of the same quality as those obtained by the pseudo-isothermal, core-like models of
dwarf galaxy DM haloes."

1. Introduction
"The general relativistic polytropic spheres represent a physically
relevant idealisation of fluid configurations, giving a coherent
picture of the physical (especially relativistic) phenomena in-
fluencing matter configurations across different distance scales.
The polytropic equations of state are used to model neutron (or
quark) stars. In the basic approximation, degenerated Fermi gas
can be represented by an equation of state with the polytropic
index n = 3/2 in the non-relativistic limit, and n = 3 in the ultra-
relativistic limit (Shapiro & Teukolsky 1983). Polytropic state
equations with various values of the polytropic index n are ap-
plied for precise approximations of the relativistic equations of
state in neutron stars (Özel & Psaltis 2009; Lattimer & Prakash
2001); even several polytropic state equations can be applied to
cover the behaviour of the neutron star core (Alvarez-Castillo
& Blaschke 2017). In the models of neutron stars, the relativis-
tic parameter giving the ratio of the central pressure to the cen-
tral energy density, σ = pc/ρc ≥ 0.1. However, the polytropic
spheres could also be relevant as very extended objects repre-
senting dark matter (DM) haloes of galaxies, or even galaxy clus-
ters; then the parameter σ can take both the large relativistic val-
uesσ ≥ 0.1, or small values corresponding to the non-relativistic
limit σ ≤ 0.001 (Stuchlík et al. 2016, 2017, 2021)."
"Despite long-term efforts in theoretical and experimental
particle physics, the composition of DM remains unknown.
There are a large variety of possible, but not confirmed, can-
didates of both cold and hot (warm) DM that are still accept-"
"able; this is similar to the possibility of the relevance of self-
interacting DM. Since a clear DM candidate predicted by the
particle physics is unknown, we are approved to choose any pa-
rameters of the polytropic equation of state to test predictions
of the general relativistic polytropic spheres related to their ex-
tension, mass, and velocity curves, with respect to the observa-
tional data from galaxies or their clusters. Details of the physical
processes inside the polytropic spheres are not considered; the
power law relating the total pressure to the total energy density
of matter is assumed. The polytropic approximation seems to be
applicable in the DM models that assume weakly interacting par-
ticles (see for example Börner (1993), Kolb & Turner (1990) and
Cremaschini & Stuchlík (2013))."
"The general relativistic polytropic spheres in spacetimes with
the repulsive cosmological constant have been numerically stud-
ied in detail (Stuchlík et al. 2016), generalising the case of uni-
form energy density spheres, corresponding to the polytropes
with an index n = 0 that can be solved in terms of elemen-
tary functions (Stuchlík 2000; Böhmer 2004; Nilsson & Ug-
gla 2000; Böhmer & Fodor 2008). Two important results fol-
low from this study. First, the polytropic spheres cannot exceed
the static radius (Stuchlík 1983; Stuchlík & Hledík 1999; Arraut
2014; Faraoni et al. 2015; Stuchlík et al. 2018; Stuchlík et al.
2020); the radius is governed by the polytrope mass and value of
the cosmological constant, where the gravitational attraction of
the polytrope is just balanced by the cosmic repulsion, giving a
natural limit on gravitationally bound systems in the expanding
Universe (Stuchlík 2005). The static radius thus also represents"
"Article number, page 1 of 18"

"a limit on the extension of the polytropes with critical values of
the relativistic parameter σcrit(n), which are unlimited in space-
times with a vanishing cosmological constant (Nilsson & Uggla
2000; Stuchlík et al. 2016; Stuchlík et al. 2020). The role of the
cosmological constant and the static radius is also crucial for
the motion of gravitationally bound galaxies, for example in the
case of the Milky Way and its small satellite galaxies as shown
in Stuchlík & Schee (2011) and Stuchlík & Schee (2012). Sec-
ond, the extension and mass of the polytropic spheres can even
be comparable with extension and mass of DM haloes of large
galaxies and galaxy clusters (Stuchlík et al. 2016). Extremely
extended general relativistic polytropic spheres can well serve
as models of DM in large galaxies or even galaxy clusters. This
is the case both for non-relativistic polytropes with σ � 0.1,
which can represent very diluted haloes made of cold DM; and
for the relativistic polytropes with sufficiently large polytropic
indices 3.3 < n < 5 when such polytropes can exist, while
σ ∼ σcrit(n) ≥ 0.1, representing haloes constituted by hot DM
(Stuchlík et al. 2021). For such large galaxies (or their clusters),
the role of the cosmological constant is crucial, as an extension
of such galaxies is comparable to the values of the static radius
corresponding to their mass. This statement holds even for Milky
Way (Stuchlík & Schee 2011). As expected, the cosmological
constant is not significant for dwarf galaxies, as their extension is
much smaller than the static radius corresponding to their mass."
"Of special interest are highly relativistic trapping polytropes
containing a region of trapped null geodesics existing for poly-
tropes with n > 2.167 and σ > 0.667 (Novotný et al. 2017).
The trapping of null geodesics is relevant in the region in which
circular null geodesics exist an inner (stable) one at rph(s), and
outer (unstable) one at rph(u). Surprisingly, the local compact-
ness of the trapping configuration does not exceed the global
compactness of ultra-compact objects whose surfaces are located
under the unstable photon circular geodesic of the external vac-
uum Schwarzschild (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) spacetime (Stuch-
lík 2000), namely,"
"m(rph(s))
rph(s)"
"<
m(rph(u))"
"rph(u)
<"
"details are given in Novotný et al. (2017). An analytic confir-
mation of this unexpected phenomenon can be found in Hod
(2018b,a). The trapping zone demonstrates an efficient gravita-
tional instability causing gravitational collapse of its matter con-
tent and its conversion to a central black hole (Stuchlík et al.
2017). For the polytropic parameters properly tuned, the trap-
ping polytrope can be extremely extended, thus representing a
DM halo of a large galaxy with mass Mhalo > 1012 M�; the cen-
tral super-massive black hole created in the trapping zone can
have mass MBH > 109 M� (Stuchlík et al. 2017). The gravita-
tional instability of the “trapping” region of extremely extended
trapping polytropes has thus been proposed as an alternative
model of formation of the super-massive black holes in high-
redshift (z > 6) large galaxies or their clusters (Stuchlík et al.
2017, 2021). There is another interesting family of relativistic
polytropes that contains a region of trapped test particles (Stuch-
lík et al. 2021), which could be relevant for capturing DM in the
interior of neutron stars."
"The cold DM haloes are considered the natural explanation
of hidden gravitating structures in large galaxies or galaxy clus-
ters (Binney & Tremaine 1988; Navarro et al. 1997; Barreira
et al. 2015). However, there are indications of presence of warm
(hot) DM haloes, especially in the primeval galaxies (Lapi &
Danese 2015). Even mixed cold-warm (Anderhalden et al. 2012)"
"or self-interacting (Bondarenko et al. 2018) DM halo models
are considered. In our recent study, we demonstrated (Stuchlík
et al. 2021) that extremely extended polytropes can explain the
DM haloes (their mass, extension, and velocity curves) of large
galaxies and galaxy clusters, both for the polytropes with any
value of polytropic index n ∈ (0, 4–5) and a small value of the
relativistic parameter σ � 0.1 corresponding to cold matter (or
warm matter with a substantially decreased temperature owing
to the cosmic evolution), and polytropes of high polytropic index
n > 3.3 and high relativistic parameter σ ≥ 0.1 corresponding to
hot matter."
"In the present paper, we focus our attention on the type of
galaxies that complement large galaxies, namely, dwarf galaxies,
which demonstrate a behaviour of velocity curves that is not rel-
evant for large galaxies. There is an extensive study of the dwarf
galaxies concentrated in the so-called “LITTLE THINGS” (Lo-
cal Irregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes, The H I Nearby
Galaxy Survey) (Oh et al. 2015) where velocity curves are
presented along the whole regions corresponding to the dwarf
galaxies; we can assume that the polytrope model can be applied
along the entire dwarf galaxy region, including its innermost
part. This is true at least for almost all of the galaxies of the LIT-
TLE THINGS, where the role of the visible parts of the galaxy
on their motion seems to be negligible. However, there are some
dwarf galaxies that demonstrate a strong deviation from regu-
lar behaviour of velocity curves, for which we have to expect a
strong influence of baryonic matter causing the irregularities; see
for example the dwarf galaxies DDO 50 and IC 1613, with the
observed velocity curves divided into several parts, presented in
Oh et al. (2015). Even in these very special cases, we can still re-
alise an average matching of the observed velocity curves, keep-
ing in mind the limits of this matching that could be modified
by considering the possible influence of baryonic matter causing
the strong deviations from the smooth lines predicted by the DM
halo polytropic model. Extension and mass of dwarf galaxies are
several orders smaller in comparison with those of large galax-
ies. Therefore, in the polytrope models of DM haloes related to
the dwarf galaxies, we can abandon the role of the cosmological
constant that can be very important in the case of large galaxies
(Stuchlík et al. 2016). We use the polytrope models to propose a
classification of the dwarf galaxies according to the values of the
polytrope index n, characterising the models of concrete dwarf
galaxies included in the LITTLE THINGS. In these polytrope
models, the relativistic parameter σ can vary between polytropes
modelling various dwarf galaxies of the ensemble, having no in-
fluence on the classification of the polytropes. We have to stress
that the polytrope models enable a systematic study of dwarf
galaxies and search for a unique physical phenomenon hidden
behind their DM haloes."
"In previous studies of the dwarf galaxies of the LITTLE
THINGS, the velocity curves were matched by the standard
phenomenological model of DM haloes, namely the pseudo-
isothermal model. The pseudo-isothermal model is oversimpli-
fied, as it contains only two parameters characterising the core
density ρ0 and core radius RC. This model thus enables us to
match the observational data, but we could hardly extract rele-
vant information on the physics behind such a halo model. On
the other hand, the polytrope model contains parameters that re-
flect physical model conditions, especially the polytrope param-
eter n , which facilitates a representation of physical conditions.
Moreover, we are able to demonstrate that the precision of our
matches by the polytrope models is comparable to those of the
pseudo-isothermal model of dwarf galaxies. However, the fact
that in almost half of the dwarf galaxies the polytrope model give"

"better fits, while the phenomenological iso-thermal model gives
better fits in the other half of the ensemble, indicates the need to
include the role of the baryonic matter in the galaxy structure.
Such a complex model will be considered in future studies."
"In our paper we summarise first the polytrope structure equa-
tions, their solutions, and properties of the polytropic spheres.
Then we present an overview of the circular geodesics in the in-
ternal spacetime of the polytropic spheres, finally giving the ve-
locity radial profiles of the circular geodesics that should corre-
spond to the velocity curves of stars at the dwarf galaxies. We as-
sume applicability of the geodesic velocity profiles in the whole
polytropic sphere to the complete observed velocity curves of
dwarf galaxies. Finally, we present results of the matching pro-
cedure realised for each of the selected dwarf galaxies of the
LITTLE THINGS; the parameters of the polytrope yielding the
best match of the observational velocity curve of the galaxy are
explicitly established and the corresponding theoretical veloc-
ity curve is compared to the observational data for each dwarf
galaxy of the LITTLE THINGS. We then present the conclu-
sions resulting from the best matches."
2. General relativistic polytropes
"The line element of spherically symmetric, static spacetimes, can
be expressed in terms of the standard Schwarzschild coordinates
in the form"
ds2 = −e2Φc2dt2 + e2Ψdr2 + r2(dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2) . (2)
"The line element contains two unknown functions of the radial
coordinate, Φ(r) and Ψ(r). The static spherically symmetric per-
fect fluid configurations are in the fluid rest frame represented
by the mass-energy density radial profile ρ = ρ(r), and isotropic
pressure radial profile p = p(r)."
"The mass-energy density and pressure are related by the
polytropic equation of state"
"p = Kρ1+1/n , (3)"
"where n denotes the constant polytropic index and K denotes
the constant governed by the thermal characteristics of the con-
sidered polytropic configuration, given by the central density ρc
and the central pressure pc. The parameter K is determined by
the total mass and radius of the polytropic configuration, and the
relativistic parameter (Tooper 1964)"
"σ ≡

"=

"The constant K contains the temperature implicitly (Tooper
1964). The polytropic equation represents a limiting form of the
parametric equations of state for the completely degenerate gas
at zero temperature; therefore, this equation can be relevant for a
basic description of neutron stars. Then, both n and K are univer-
sal physical constants (Tooper 1964). The ultra-relativistic de-
generate Fermi gas is determined by the polytropic equation with
the adiabatic index Γ = 4/3 and the polytropic index n = 3; for
the non-relativistic degenerate Fermi gas, the polytropic equa-
tion of state has Γ = 5/3, and n = 3/2 (Shapiro & Teukolsky
1983)."
2.1. Structure equations
"The structure of the polytropic spheres is governed by the two
structure functions; their behaviour is determined by the Ein-
stein field equations and the local energy-momentum conser-
vation law. The first structure function, θ(r), is related to the"
"mass-energy density radial profile ρ(r) and the central density
ρc through the relation (Tooper 1964)"
"ρ = ρcθ

"with the boundary condition θ(r = 0) = 1. The second structure
function is the mass function, which is determined by the relation"
"m(r) =
∫ r"
"0

"the integration constant m(0) = 0 is chosen to guarantee the
smooth spacetime geometry at the origin (Misner et al. 1973). At
the surface of the configuration, r = R, there is ρ(R) = p(R) = 0.
The total mass of the polytropic configuration is denoted as
M = m(R), and outside the polytropic configuration, the space-
time is described by the vacuum Schwarzschild metric with mass
parameter M."
"The structure equations of the polytropic spheres that relate
the two structure functions, θ(r) and m(r), and the polytrope pa-
rameters n, σ, can be put into the form (Tooper 1964; Stuchlík

lated to the cosmological constant enters the structure equations
(Stuchlík et al. 2016). The solutions of the polytropic structure
equations can only be obtained by numerical methods (Tooper
1964); the exception to this is the n = 0 polytropes governing the
spheres with a uniform distribution of the energy density when
the solution can be given in terms of the elementary functions
(Stuchlík et al. 2016; Stuchlík 2000)."

sphere, and the solution v(ξ1) determines the gravitational mass
of the polytrope in the general dimensionless form. The dimen-
sional form is then obtained using the length and mass scales
where the central energy density is also in play."
2.2. Characteristics of the polytropic spheres
"A polytropic sphere constructed for given parameters n, σ, and
ρc is characterised by two solutions of the dimensionless struc-
ture equations, ξ1 and v(ξ1), and by the scale factors L andM.
We note that the mass scaleM is not independent, being deter-
mined by the length scale L and parameters n, σ; both L andM
are determined by the central density ρc."
The radius of the polytropic sphere is given by

spacetime"
"The velocity curves of the stars observed in the galaxy plane of
dwarf galaxies must be compared to the circular geodesics of
the spherically symmetric internal spacetime of the polytropic
sphere in the central plane, which can be selected as the equato-
rial plane, θ = π/2. The circular geodesic motion of the test par-
ticles (stars) in the internal polytrope spacetime is characterised
by two constants of motion — specific energy E and specific an-
gular momentum L, which are defined as the ratio of the covari-
ant energy (axial angular momentum) related to the rest energy
of the star m that is also considered as a constant of the motion.

a linear increase of the velocity, in the second type we observe
a flat tail of the velocity profile, while the third type contains a
maximum followed by the slowly descending part of the profile,
which could correspond to the profiles observed in large galax-
ies."
"The energy profiles clearly demonstrate the tendency to con-
centrate mass in the central region with increasing polytropic in-
dex n and this tendency is strengthened by increasing polytropic
relativistic parameter σ. Nevertheless, the polytropic index plays
the crucial role, so the core-like character of the density profiles
holds for high n, even for strongly non-relativistic polytropes."

4. Dwarf galaxies
"We tested the applicability of our polytrope model of galac-
tic haloes for the very interesting, and in some sense myste-
rious, family of dwarf galaxies. Their basic mystery is related
to the numerical simulations of the evolution of the mass dis-
tribution in the Universe, which predict the number of dwarf
galaxies to be higher (by an order) than the observed number
(Moore et al. 1999). One of the potential solutions of the so-
called missing dwarf galaxy problem is that a small part of these
galaxies are able to attract baryonic matter in amounts sufficient"

"to become visible galaxies. Therefore, the whole structure of
the dwarf galaxies could be generally DM dominated (Simon
& Geha 2007), and whole the profile of the velocity curves ob-
served in such galaxies could be used for direct comparison with
the velocity profiles predicted by the models of DM haloes. The
other crucial open problem of the dwarf galaxies is the so-called
core-cusp problem related to the character of the density profile
in the central region of the DM halo (Bullock et al. 2001), as
the density profiles of dwarf galaxies are rather “core-like” be-
cause they are described by the pseudo-isothermal (ISO) models,
not the “cusp-like” standard CDM Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
model. One possible solution to this problem could be realised
if we put aside the assumption of cold DM and take into consid-
eration warm or self-interacting DM (Lovell et al. 2012; Elbert
et al. 2015; Spergel & Steinhardt 2000). Another solution is con-
nected with the overall effect of a repeating DM heating caused
by a suddenly removed accreted gas (by stellar winds or super-
novae feedback) during the star formation leading to a complete
DM core formation (Read & Gilmore 2005). Moreover, recent
numerical simulations (Teyssier et al. 2013; Mashchenko et al.
2008; Pontzen & Governato 2012; Read et al. 2016) show that
the gas flows transforming DM cusps to cores conduct to cause
a bursty star formation history and the stars are dynamically
heated similar to the DM, leading to a stellar velocity dispersion
approaching the local rotational velocity of the stars (v/σ∼1).
These results are supported by observations of dwarf galaxies
(Dohm-Palmer et al. 1998, 2002; Young et al. 2007; Leaman
et al. 2012; Kauffmann 2014; Sparre et al. 2017; Wheeler et al.
2017). Moreover, Read et al. (2019) show that the dwarfs fell
into two classes related by the central DM density at a common
radius 150 pc (ρDM), respectively, galaxies with old stars (>6"
"Gyr old) with central DM densities ρDM(150 pc) > 108 M�kpc
−3"
"consistent with DM cusps, and galaxies with stars at least 3 Gyr
old with ρDM(150 pc) < 108 M�kpc"
"−3 consistent with DM
cores. Other possible solutions of the core-cusp problem include
“wave-like” DM (Schive et al. 2014), “fuzzy” DM (Hu et al.
2000; Hui et al. 2017), and “fluid” DM (Peebles 2000)."
"In this paper we intend to add a new physical approach view-
point to the cusp-core problem of dwarf galaxies using the prop-
erties of the polytropic spheres in modelling DM haloes, namely
the influence of the polytropic index on the energy density radial
profiles demonstrated in Figure 2"
"In the lines of these warm or self-interacting possibilities, we
consider the possible range of the values of the polytropic index
n. The most extended study of the dwarf galaxies and their ob-
served velocity profiles based on the standard cold DM models
of haloes is presented in LITTLE THINGS (Oh et al. 2015), and
we test our polytrope model for the selected 20 members of the
LITTLE THINGS, using a coherent approach of treating the ob-
servational data in the well-defined extended study of Oh et al.
(2015). In the LITTLE THINGS study of Oh et al. (2015), 26
(including 3 from THINGS) dwarf galaxies were considered in
great detail. We chose 20 galaxies, with regular rotation pattern
in their HI velocity fields. We studied their data using the poly-
trope models, after treating the original observational data kindly
submitted by the authors of Oh et al. (2015) to make it possible
to have a clear comparison of the results of our polytrope mod-
els to the results of the isothermal models of DM haloes of dwarf
galaxies. The polytrope models facilitate a systematic study due
to the estimated values of the polytropic index n and the rela-
tivistic parameter (central density)."
"As shown in the simulations by Governato et al. (2012), the
degree of baryonic contributions is significantly dependent on
the amount of stars. In other words, galaxies with higher past star
formation activity have more significant outflows in the same to-
tal mass budget (DM + baryons) than lower past star formation
activity galaxies. Therefore, to investigate the effect of baryons
on the central cusp, a reliable measurement of the stellar mass
in galaxy is essential. Prada & Burkert (2002) showed that for
the case of late-type dwarf galaxies the total kinematics is domi-
nated by the DM, nonetheless it is still important to separate the
contribution by baryons from the total rotation curve. In our case
we used the velocity curves corresponding to the role of the DM
haloes. As mentioned in Oh et al. (2015), these were achieved by
using multiwavelength data sets, respectively, by using a Spitzer
IRAC 3.6 µm images and ancillary optical colour information
(Hunter & Elmegreen 2006). We plan to extend our polytrope
DM model to the contribution of the baryonic matter in the fu-
ture."
"To compare the fitting of the velocity curves observed in the
LITTLE THINGS by the polytrope models, we used the results
obtained for the standard core-like, spherical pseudo-isothermal
model with constant-density core, with the radial profile given

"5. Matching the velocity curves observed in dwarf
galaxies from LITTLE THINGS"
"To match the observational data reflecting measured velocity
curves in the dwarf galaxies belonging to the LITTLE THINGS,
we use the standard χ-squares method, that is we are looking
for the lowest value of the test representing differences between
the observed data and velocity curves predicted by the polytrope
models."
The so-called reduced χ2 statistics is defined as follows:
"N∑
i=1"
"(
vobs(ri) − vpol(ri)"
")2 /
k , (44)"
"where k is the degree of the freedom, N is the number of the data,
vobs(ri) (vpol(ri)) is the observed (polytropy-predicted) velocity
at the radius ri, and ei is the error of the measurement of the
velocity vobs(ri). The velocity vpol(ri) is governed by the radial
profile of the circular geodesic motion in the polytrope model
given by equation (41) and the viso(R) by equations (42,43)."
5.1. Fitting by polytropes
"In the matching procedure we are considering the values of the
polytropic index 0 < n < 4, and whole the range of the relativis-
tic parameter σ restricted by the causality limit; however, only
very small values of σ were found to be relevant, correspond-
ing to the non-relativistic limit for the matter content. For each
considered dwarf galaxy, we present a map of the ξ-parameter in
dependence on the parameters n–σ, the values of the parameters
n, σ, and the value of χ of the best match in the figure, repre-
senting the corresponding theoretical velocity profile giving the"
"best match to the observational data related to the velocity curve
of the considered dwarf galaxy."
"The χ2 tests are only applied for the data presented in Oh
et al. (2015). For each of the dwarf galaxies of the LITTLE
THINGS, we separately give the results of the fitting proce-
dure and comparison of our polytrope fitting velocity curves with
those predicted by the pseudo-isothermal model. The results are
presented in Figs. 3–7. For more involved comparison of the
methods, we add a different comparison of each point from the
observational data. For each of the considered dwarf galaxies,
the mass density profile of the polytrope obtained by the fitting
procedure is given, and the area of the 97% confidence (the green
contour plot in the bottom right corner in Figs. 3–7) of the free
polytrope parameters n and σ is added. All the results are sum-
marised in Table 2."
"We note that usually the region of 97% confidence is re-
stricted to a relative small range of the parameter n, which is
around ∆n ≤ 0.5, thereby giving relevant restrictions. However,
there are a few cases, (see Figs. 5–6) in which ∆n ∼ 1.5 , giving
signals of significant effects of factors other than DM, perhaps
of the strong effect of baryonic matter."
"We can see that the velocity curves predicted by the poly-
trope models fit in all the considered galaxies the observed veloc-
ity curves whose quality of the fit is comparable with the quality
of the fit by the pseudo-isothermal models. For some galaxies
the χ-square is little bit better owing to the polytrope model, for
the other galaxies the pseudo-isothermal model fit is better; the
relation is 10:10. Clearly, the quality of the fit to observational
data in polytrope models are on the same level as the pseudo-
isothermal model. Considering the interval of confidence, the
variability of the polytropic index n and the relativistic param-
eter σ is around 25% of the best value."
"Our results of the fitting procedure give different values of
n and σ for each of the considered dwarf galaxies, with a large
extension of the polytropic index that covers whole the range of
the considered values, n ∈ (0, 4). This result is very contradic-"

"tory to our expectation that the values of n of the selected poly-
trope models are coupled around one or two characteristic values
in accordance with the assumption of a unique physical mecha-
nism hidden behind the DM halo model. However, this enables
an interesting conclusion that the dwarf galaxies modelled by the
polytrope spheres can be separated into three classes according
to the value of the polytropic index n, governing the behaviour
of the velocity profile of the circular geodesics of the polytrope
interior."
"In the first class of models, where n ∈ (0, 1), the velocity pro-
file increases nearly linearly from the centre to the halo edge. In
the second class of models, where n ∈ (1, 2), the velocity profile
reaches an outer region where it has almost flat dependence on
the radius. In the third class of models, where n > 2, the velocity
profile reaches a maximum with increasing radius and then fol-
lows a slow decline. Inside all of the three polytrope classes, the
parameter σ related to individual members (dwarf galaxy mod-
els) varies significantly, but remains very small (σ < 10−8) in all
the considered cases; the variations of σ has only minor effect
on the qualitative character of the velocity profiles predicted by
the model."
"Of course, the observational data contain four galaxies
demonstrating an apparently irregular (perturbative) behaviour
of the observed velocity curves. It is very interesting that the
polytrope models implied by the fitting procedure predict, in
two of these cases, the values of the relevant polytropic index
on the edges of the allowed range. A value of n = 3.95 is pre-
dicted for the DDO 50 galaxy and n = 0.5 is predicted for the
IC 1613 galaxy. In both of these cases the perturbations of the
smooth theoretical velocity profiles by the observational data
are strongly irregular. The two other galaxies of this kind have
n = 1.70 (IC 10) and n = 1.25 (NGC 1569) and demonstrate"
"in observational data perturbations from the smooth theoretical
velocity profiles having almost periodic character. There is also
an interesting phenomenon that occurs in the behaviour of the
97% confidence range of the polytropic index, ∆nconf , for these
four irregular galaxies. While the confidence range is very high,
∆nconf ∼ 1.5, for the galaxies modelled by the polytropes with
low polytropic indexes n = 0.5, 1.25, 1.70, in the case of the
galaxy corresponding to the polytrope with high index n = 3.95,
the confidence range is only ∆nconf ∼ 0.5, similar to the rest of
the selected 20 dwarf galaxies."
"If we assume that the irregularities are caused by the pres-
ence of a significant amount of baryonic matter, then these lim-
iting cases indicate that the existence of these irregularities is
probably caused by local conditions, not by fundamental physics
related to the behaviour of the polytropes."
"The distribution of the considered dwarf galaxies into the in-
troduced classes is rather irregular: the first class contains seven
galaxies, the second class only four galaxies, while the third
class contains nine galaxies. The polytropic index n is distributed
across whole the range of n corresponding to the classes; the dis-
tribution is almost regular, with an exception of one very high
value of n = 3.95 (for the dwarf galaxy with a strongly irregu-
lar observed velocity curve) in the third class where the rest of
the polytrope models have n ∈ (2, 3). The distribution of the pa-
rameter σ in the first class covers more than one order around
σ = 10−9, in the second class the distribution of σ covers one or-
der, while in the third class it covers more than two orders. The
central density of the selected polytrope models is distributed
around the value of ρc = 10−24 g cm3, with similar characteris-
tics of the distribution as in the case of the parameter σ."
"We observe no correlation between the values of the free
parameters n, σ, ρc; we thus assume they are governed mainly"
"Article number, page 8 of 18"
"J. Novotný, Z. Stuchlík, J. Hladík: Polytropic spheres modelling DM haloes of dwarf galaxies"
"by the local conditions. The masses, velocity profiles, and the
maximal velocities of the profiles of the polytrope models are,
of course, fully related to the values of the polytrope parame-
ters through structure equations, and their distribution reflects
properties of the polytropes. We note that the second class could
be considered an intermediate state between the first and third
classes; the second class is possibly closer to the first class be-
cause there is no maximum velocity profile for both the first and
second classes. We thus could speculate that at least two physi-
cal mechanisms (or two types of DM) could be relevant for bind-
ing dwarf galaxies. Of course, such an idea has to be confronted
with the particle physics models if realistic candidates of the DM
can be found experimentally. On the other hand, we have to re-
call that such a dichotomy in explanation of DM haloes is also
considered in the case of large galaxies because the DM haloes
related to both cold DM and hot DM have recently been in play.
In the case of large galaxies, the polytrope models also predict
high values of the relativistic parameter σ > 0.1 (Stuchlík et al.
2016, 2021); in the case of the dwarf galaxies, the DM must be
in a strongly non-relativistic state with σ < 10−8. However, the
study of relativistic polytropic model with high levels of σ are
important (Stuchlík et al. 2021), as the recent studies of the sec-
ond data release (DR2) of the Gaia mission (Gaia Collaboration
et al. 2018) shows that the Galactic halo is composed of dis-
rupted dwarf galaxies (Haywood et al. 2018; Helmi et al. 2018).
This is especially the case if we take into account that the scal-
ing laws of dwarf galaxies return a DM density for the Galactic
halo that is consistent with measurements from the vertical Jeans
equations (Casagrande 2020)"
5.2. Comparison with pseudo-isothermal model
"Interesting results can also be obtained by comparing the fitting
procedures by the pseudo-isotropic and polytrope models. We
thus study the inner slope of the DM density α for our poly-
trope models, and compare these to those given by the pseudo-
isothermal models."
"During the numerical fitting procedure, the central density ρc
was, for the best fit, selected to approximately match the outer
radius of the dwarf galaxy. For a concrete galaxy, such an ap-
proach enables us to compare the mass of the concrete polytrope
model with the mass of the corresponding pseudo-isothermal
model that is defined by the relation"

"The comparison of the masses Mpol and Miso is presented in
Fig. 8; each point represents a dwarf galaxy, above the equal-
ity line there is Mpol < Miso. We can see that the polytrope
model mass is mostly equal or slightly lower than the isother-
mal model mass. For completeness, we give in Fig. 9 the rela-
tion of the maximal velocity vmax, and the velocity dispersion
∆v, to the mass parameter M, for both the polytrope (red points)
and pseudo-isothermal (blue points) models. The relationship of
the velocity dispersion ∆v and matter is well known; for exam-
ple around the SgrA? super-massive black hole in the Galaxy
centre ∆v∼75 km s−1, while for the Andromeda super-massive
central black hole ∆v∼160 km s−1. For the group of dwarf galax-
ies studied in our paper, ∆v < 35 km s−1, in accordance with
the typical elliptical dwarf galaxies in the Coma cluster where
∆v < 80 km s−1 (Kourkchi et al. 2012)."

"the inner slope α of the matter density profile within the “break
radius” of the DM density profiles for both models used in the
fitting procedure. The break radius is defined as the location at
which the slope of the matter density radial profile changes most
rapidly (de Blok & Bosma 2002). Therefore, we define the ra-
dius Rpolinner for the polytrope models density profile and compute
the mean inner slope α of the polytrope model for each dwarf
galaxy. For the inner slope αiso and the inner radius Robsinner, we
are using those given in Oh et al. (2015). In Fig. 10 we compare
the inner slope α against the observed radius R for both models
and all considered dwarf galaxies."
"As clear from Fig. 10, most of the LITTLE THINGS galax-
ies demonstrate significant deviation from the NFW model of
the Λ-CDM haloes — the slope α related to the density pro-
files of the polytrope and pseudo-isothermal models do not agree
with the cusp predicted by the NFW model corresponding to
the simulations based on the Λ-CDM model. The mean value
of the polytrope slope αpol∼ − 0.06 and the observed value
αobs∼ − 0.26, both differ significantly from those related to the
NFW model, αNFW∼1. The polytrope models thus predict, sim-
ilar to the pseudo-isothermal models, core-like haloes. In the
polytrope model, the slope is concentrated near the zero value
for a longer range of radius in comparison with the other mod-
els, and the break radius is located at larger distance from the
centre. All the results discussed above are summarised in Ta-
bles 2 and 3. These results clearly demonstrate the relevance of
the polytrope models (separated into three classes) to explain the
properties of the dwarf galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS."
6. Conclusions
"We briefly presented the polytropic models of DM haloes and
related construction of the velocity profiles of the circular test
particle motion that can be applied to match the observed ve-
locity curves in galaxies. We realized matching the theoretical
velocity profiles constructed for the DM halo polytropic mod-"

"els with the observational data related to the LITTLE THINGS
of dwarf galaxies (Oh et al. 2015), indicating three types of the
polytropic models of DM in dwarf galaxies, and consequently
possibility of existence of three types of the dwarf galaxies, may
be governed by slightly different physics lying behind the simple
polytrope models."
"We discovered that the polytrope model gives satisfactory
fits of the observational data related to the rotational veloc-
ity curves for the dwarf galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS,
which are fully comparable to those presented from the standard
pseudo-isothermal model. We demonstrated that for all the con-
sidered dwarf galaxies, the inner slope of the DM density of the
polytrope model is generally close to the slope of the pseudo-
isothermal (core-like) model, having α ∼ 0. In fact, the mean
value of the polytrope model αpol ∼ 0.06 and the mean slope re-
lated to the observational data αobs ∼ 0.23 are both much lower
than those corresponding to the NFW model, where αNFW ∼ 1.
The break radius, where the density profile changes most rapidly
is located at a larger distance from the centre for the polytrope
models than for the pseudo-isothermal models."
"The matching procedure implies that the polytropic models
could be of comparable precision with the matches obtained via
the standard phenomenological pseudo-isothermal model of DM
haloes in dwarf galaxies, which is used in the original study of
LITTLE THINGS (Oh et al. 2015). The most important, inter-
esting, and surprising result concerns the fact that the matching
separates (in relation to the character of the velocity profiles) the
polytrope models (and dwarf galaxies) into three classes depend-
ing on the magnitude of the polytropic index n. Moreover, to be
able to describe our tested ensemble of dwarf galaxies, we have
to consider the polytropic spheres with the polytropic index n
starting at very low value of n = 0.1 and ending at an unexpected
large value of n = 3.95. The irregular character of the velocity
profiles observed in two dwarf galaxies requiring the polytropic
index from the low and high value edges of the allowed range
(n = 0.5 and n = 3.95) could indicate a possible significant role
of local conditions for the final structure of the dwarf galaxies."
"In all of the estimated polytropic models, the relativistic pa-
rameter σ has to be very low, corresponding to strongly non-
relativistic matter content, as there is always σ < 10−8. The
qualitatively different groups are separated into those with n < 1,
those with 1 < n < 2, and those with n > 2, giving a qualitatively
different behaviour of the velocity curves. It is very interesting
that the polytropes with n > 2 are frequently considered to be
realistic models of the matter in the central parts of neutron stars
(Alvarez-Castillo & Blaschke 2017); of course, in the DM halo
models of dwarf galaxies the relativistic parameter has to be very
low, contrary to the case of the neutron stars."
"The separation of the polytrope models of the dwarf galax-
ies demonstrated in the present paper roughly corresponds to the
separation of the polytrope models of large galaxies and galaxy
clusters, for which the non-relativistic models with σ � 1 and
arbitrary n can be used along with the relativistic models with
n > 3.3 and σ > 0.1. For the tested dwarf galaxies, the rela-
tivistic parameter is always σ � 10−8, but the polytropic index
can be as high as n = 3.95 as in the case of the dwarf galaxy
with a highly irregular velocity profile, which probably indicates
a significant role of ordinary matter."
"The fitting related to the selected part of the galaxies con-
tained in the LITTLE THINGS requires a very large range of
the values of the polytropic index, n ∈ (0.1, 3.95) and demon-
strates almost uniform distribution along this range. The large
spread of the polytropic index n in polytrope models fitting the
dwarf galaxies indicates that the physical phenomenon behind"
"the construction of DM haloes probably cannot be unique. We
thus propose an idea that at least two physical phenomena (e.g.
two kinds of DM) enter into play. These are dependent on the
local conditions, initialised in the very early stages of the Uni-
verse expansion, and their combined effect implies the large di-
versity of the polytrope models of dwarf galaxies, similar to large
galaxies and galaxy clusters. Of course, such an idea demands a
confirmation from a detection of at least two kinds (e.g. light and
heavy) of particles constituting the DM. On the other hand, bary-
onic matter can be relevant, implying another effect with possi-
bly a significant role, namely the kinematic “heat up” of DM at
the central regions of dwarf galaxies driven by bursty star forma-
tion, which was recently discussed in Read et al. (2019).

is accompanied by a number in brackets representing the dwarf galaxy

a lower value of the χ2 test compared to the pseudo-isothermal model
are depicted as red points, while the blue points indicate a better fit of
