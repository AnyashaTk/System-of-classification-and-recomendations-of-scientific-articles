"The KM3NeT Collaboration has successfully deployed its first detection units in the Mediter-
ranean Sea in December 2015 (ARCA) and September 2017 (ORCA). The sample of data
collected between September 2016 and March 2017 has been used to measure the atmospheric
muon flux at two different depths under the sea level: about 3.5 km with ARCA and about 2.5 km
with ORCA. The atmospheric muon flux represents an abundant signal for a neutrino telescope
and can be used to test the reliability of the Monte Carlo simulation chain. In this work, the
measurements are compared to Monte Carlo simulations based on MUPAGE and CORSIKA
codes. Measured events and simulated events are treated using the same approach, making the
comparison reliable."

Measured and simulated atmospheric muons for the first KM3NeT detectors Piotr Kalaczynski"
1. Introduction
"KM3NeT is a research infrastructure being constructed at the bottom of the Mediterranean
Sea. It consists of two neutrino detectors: ARCA (Astroparticle Research with Cosmics in the
Abyss) located off-shore Portopalo di Capo Passero, Sicily, Italy, at a depth of 3500 m and ORCA
(Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss) off-shore Toulon, France, at a depth of 2450 m."
"The main purpose of the ARCA telescope is the detection of TeV-PeV neutrinos from astro-
physical sources or in coincidence with other high energy events, for example gravitational waves,
gamma ray bursts, blazar flares. The ORCA telescope is designed to study the neutrino mass hier-
archy (NMH), using oscillations of the atmospheric neutrinos in the GeV range [1]."
"Both KM3NeT detectors are based on the same technology [1]: vertically aligned detection
units (DUs), each carrying 18 digital optical modules (DOMs). Each DOM contains 31 3-inch
photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), calibration and positioning instrumentation and readout electronics
boards. The difference between ARCA and ORCA is the horizontal (90 m and 20 m respectively)
and vertical (36 m and 9 m respectively) spacing between the DOMs, which is optimised to search
for high- and low-energy neutrinos, respectively. The first DUs are already taking data at both the
ARCA and ORCA sites. Atmospheric muons represent an important background to the physics
analyses in a neutrino telescope, but they are also a useful tool to test the performance of the
detector and validity of the simulations. In this paper a comparison of the first data collected so far
by ARCA and ORCA to the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations is presented."
2. Simulation chain
"The KM3NeT simulation chain shown in Figure 1 has a modular structure. The generation of
the atmospheric muon bundles is performed using two different codes: MUPAGE [2] and COR-
SIKA [3]. MUPAGE is a fast, parametric simulation code developed for the ANTARES experiment
[4] that generates muon bundles, induced by cosmic rays impinging the Earth atmosphere, at differ-
ent undersea depths and different zenith angles, on the surface of the active volume of the detector.
CORSIKA (COsmic Ray SImulations for KAscade) is a software package that simulates the inter-
actions of the primary cosmic ray (CR) nuclei in the upper layers of the atmosphere and follows the
development of the shower to a specified observation level (in this work it is the sea level). Their
energy spectrum is simulated following a power law, E−γ , where the spectral index γ is chosen
by the user. The CORSIKA package is flexible and allows the user to choose between different
models to describe the primary interactions and the composition of the CR primary flux."
"A dedicated software, called ""Corant"", has been developed to convert the CORSIKA output
format to the KM3NeT standard format of events and to evaluate the weights to be applied to
each event, according to the model of the CR composition chosen by the user. The propagation of
the muon bundles to the active volume of the detector is performed using a 3-dimensional muon
propagator contained in the gSeaGen [6] library, a GENIE-based [5] package designed mainly to
simulate neutrino interactions. After the muon bundle propagation, the Cherenkov photons emitted
along the path of muons and the probability of their detection by the DOMs are simulated with a
custom application developed for KM3NeT using multidimensional interpolation tables [7], called
""JSirene"". The next step is the creation of a simulated data stream, similar to the data stream coming"

"from the detector. This is done with the addition of the environmental optical background, due to
the bioluminescence and to the 40K decay, with the simulation of the detector response, taking into
account the front-end electronics behaviour. The same trigger algorithms used for real data are used
to identify possible interesting events in the simulated sample [8]. Finally, the simulated events
are processed with the same reconstruction programs used for the real data stream. At this stage
the simulated MC events can be easily compared to the calibrated data. A track reconstruction
algorithm is applied both to data and MC events. In this work only a track reconstruction code
(""JGandalf"" [9]) is considered, which is specifically designed to reconstruct atmospheric muons
and muons induced by neutrinos."
3. Data vs MC comparisons
"A sample of data collected with 2 DUs of the ARCA detector (ARCA2) from the 23th of
December 2016 to the 2nd of March 2017 and with 1 DU of the ORCA detector (ORCA1) from
the 28th of September 2017 to the 13th of December 2017 has been reconstructed with the track
reconstruction algorithm ""JGandalf"" (see Figure 1)."
"A sample of muon bundles with energy larger than 10 GeV and multiplicity up to 100 tracks
was simulated with MUPAGE. The equivalent livetime is close to the considered detector livetime,"

"Figure 2: Rate of atmospheric muons as a function of the reconstructed zenith angle for data and
MC simulation for the ARCA2 detector. Most of the upgoing events (all MC events) are downgoing
events that are badly reconstructed as upgoing. No quality cuts have been applied to remove the
badly reconstructed tracks."
"about 20 days for ARCA2 and 23 days for ORCA1. The muon bundle energy is evaluated at the
surface of the detector sensitive volume. The events processed as described in Section 2 are shown
in Figures 2, 3 and 4 with the red marks. Only statistical errors are shown in the plots."
"A total number of 2.5 ·109 showers have been simulated with CORSIKA, using SIBYLL-2.3c
to describe the high-energy hadronic interaction model [10]. Five different species of nuclei were
considered: p, He, C, O and Fe with energies between 103 and 109 GeV and an energy spectrum
E−1primary. For the muon bundles generated with CORSIKA, the simulation procedure presented
in Section 2 has been followed and events were reconstructed with the same set of programs as
for MUPAGE and data events. At the end of the reconstruction, the events have been weighted
according to the composition model described in [11]. The results of the CORSIKA simulation"
"are shown as blue markers in Figures 2, 3 and 4. The errors shown are calculated as ∆x =
√"
"∑w2i ,
where wi are the weights of each event. In all plots no systematic uncertainties on the simulation
are considered."
"The preliminary results discussed in this paper show that the considered MC samples can re-
produce the data with a good level of agreement. The upgoing muon contribution in the zenith
angle plots (Figures 2 and 3) is due to badly reconstructed downgoing muons. In this work, no
quality cuts or selections have been applied to remove the poorly reconstructed tracks. Notice that
expected systematic uncertainties, which have not been considered here, are much larger than the
statistical errors. The good data/MC agreement is not surprising as both approaches, the parame-"

used in ANTARES [12], and confirm that the simulation chain set up for KM3NeT analyses is
reliable and under control."
4. Conclusions
"Using the data taken with the first KM3NeT detection units, it is possible to compare the mea-
sured and the expected muon rate at two different sites. The good level of agreement confirms the
reliability of the simulation procedure defined so far within KM3NeT. Sharing the same technology
and detection medium (sea water), the ARCA and ORCA detectors offer a unique opportunity to
probe the depth dependence of the atmospheric muon flux without applying systematic uncertain-
ties related to comparison between different types of experiments [8]."
"Once the simulation chain is well established, next steps foresee the increase of the simulated
samples, particularly at very high energies, and the study of the impact of the physics parameteres.
This includes the description of the hadronic interaction models in some regions of the phase space
that cannot be explored with accelerators, of the chemical composition of the primary CRs and
of the optical properties of deep-sea water. A detailed study of the detection and reconstruction
efficiency can be also performed."
