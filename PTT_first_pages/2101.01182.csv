"                                                 Star formation in galaxies is regulated by the heating and cooling in the interstellar medium. In particular, the",49.0
                                              processing of molecular gas into stars will depend strongly on the ratio of gas heating to gas cooling in the neutral,46.0

"                                              line emission to PAH emission measures the photoelectric efficiency, a property of the ISM which dictates how much",46.0
"                                              energy carried by ultraviolet photons gets transferred into the gas. We find that star-forming, IR luminous galaxies",46.0
