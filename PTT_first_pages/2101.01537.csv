Abstract,0.0
The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) links baryonic mass of rotationally supported galaxies to their,0.0
flat disk velocities. A popular form of the BTFR linked to MOND is based on an empirically determined,0.0
"characteristic acceleration, a0 that serves as the constant of proportionality. In this work, we propose an",0.0
"alternative, parametric form of the BTFR employing individual galactic properties from the SPARC galaxy",0.0
database. Based on this data we find that a precise mass-velocity correlation is possible taking into,0.0
account galactic disk radius and two dynamical related properties; mass discrepancy and disk surface,0.0

Introduction,0.0
The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) relates the baryonic mass MBar with a galactic rotation velocity,0.0
