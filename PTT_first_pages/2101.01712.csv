"                                              Small-scale density fluctuations can significantly affect reionization, but are typically modelled quite crudely. Unresolved",46.0

"                                              Our results show that the simplistic mean clumping model delays reionization compared to local density-dependent models,",46.0
"                                              despite producing fewer recombinations overall. This is due to the very different spatial distribution of clumping, resulting in",46.0
