                                         Abstract. It is well known that the inflationary scenario often displays different sets of,41.0
                                         degeneracies in its predictions for CMB observables. These degeneracies usually arise either,41.0

"                                         and the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, or because within the same model, the values of {nS , r}",41.0

                                         reheating constraints can break inflationary degeneracies in the T-model and the E-model,41.0

                                         spectrum provides us with another tool to break inflationary degeneracies. This is because,41.0
                                         the GW spectrum is sensitive to the post-inflationary EOS of the universe. Indeed a stiff,41.0
                                         EOS during reheating (wre > 1/3) gives rise to a small scale blue tilt in the spectral index,41.0
