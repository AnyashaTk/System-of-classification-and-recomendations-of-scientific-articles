Abstract,0.0
The I-table contains luminous intensity values over the range of angles for the luminaires used in,0.0
the road lighting in accordance with technical report CIE 121:1996. A limited number of angles,0.0
causes smoothing of the luminous intensity diagram omitting possible local extremal values which,0.0

"luminance, uniformity or treshold increment. The interpolating methods used to calculate the",0.0
luminous intensity can significantly improve the accuracy of the calculations and redound to more,0.0
effective and reliable road lighting design. In the paper standard interpolation methods used up to,0.0
now are compared with newly proposed hybrid adaptive splines. Calculated values of luminous,0.0
intensity are compared and verified by goniophotometric measurements.,0.0

1 Introduction,0.0
         The purpose of the road lighting is to increase the safety and comfort of traffic participants,9.0
at night. Road lighting provides good visibility conditions by illuminating the road and surrounding,0.0
surfaces and by making objects visible to the drivers or pedestrians. Construction of road lighting,0.0
"can reduce night-time accidents by 20-40 %, especially when a participant of the car accident is a",0.0
"pedestrian. In the 1930s, the pioneer work of Waldram defined the silhouette principle of road",0.0
lighting which states that targets on illuminated roads are seen as dark silhouettes against the bright,0.0
"road surface [1]. Since the late 1970s, systematic studies and improvements to the lighting of streets",0.0
resulted in reduction of the crime in night-time.,0.0
         The design of road lighting installation was shifted from that time towards the visible,9.0

of glare [2]. A comprehensive analysis of 62 studies from 15 countries published by CIE,0.0
(Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage - International Commision on Illumination) has the,0.0
relevant answers for the illumination of the roads today. Several studies have tried to evaluate,0.0
