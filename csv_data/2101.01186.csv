"We study gravitational wave (GW) emission in the strong-ﬁeld regime by a hierarchical triple
system composed of a binary system placed in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). The
LIGO-Virgo collaboration recently reported evidence for coalescences with this dynamical origin.
These systems are common in galactic centers and thus are a target for the space-based LISA
mission as well as other advanced detectors. Doppler shifts, aberration, lensing and strong amplitude
modulations are features present in the GW signal from these systems, built into our framework
and with no need for phenomenological patches. We ﬁnd that the binary can resonantly excite the
quasinormal modes of the SMBH, as in the resonant excitation of two tuning forks with matching
frequencies. The ﬂux of energy crossing the SMBH horizon can be signiﬁcant, when compared with
that from standard extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. Therefore, these triple systems are excellent probes
of strong-ﬁeld physics and of the BH nature of compact objects.",8,CMR9,,1029,101
Introduction.,9,CMBXTI10,,13,13
"Since the birth of the gravitational-wave
(GW) era in 2015 [1], dozens of GW events have been
detected [2]. Other detectors will soon join the ground-
based network and further improve our ability to mea-
sure GWs in the 1",9,CMR10,,222,56

"Hz window. GWs with these frequen-
cies are emitted in galactic centers by supermassive black
holes (SMBHs) and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EM-
RIs), but also by cosmological sources [5, 6]. The cover of
such a broad spectrum will allow us to test General Rela-
tivity with unprecedented precision over a wide range of
scales, and to answer questions regarding the nature of
compact objects, of dark matter and dark energy [5, 6].",9,CMR10,,432,59
"However, recent results question the validity of the
“standard” binary system. During its third observation
run, the LIGO-Virgo collaboration detected three BH bi-
nary coalescences [7–10], unlikely to be composed by two
ﬁrst-generation BHs [11, 12]. Instead, their components
are thought to be remnants of previous coalescences,",9,CMR10,,329,56
"forming what is called a “hierarchical merger” [9, 11–
14]. Generally, these require the presence of a third
body to induce coalescence. The Zwicky Transient Fa-
cility [15, 16] reported an electromagnetic counterpart
to one of these events, GW195021 [17], consistent with
the presence of the BH binary in an active galactic nuclei
(AGN) [18–22], reinforcing the claim that its components
were part of a hierarchical triple system. “Hierarchical”
here refers to the distinct length scales between the orbit
of the BH binary and the one of its center-of-mass (CM)",9,CMR10,,562,59
around the third body. Hierarchical triple systems are,9,CMR10,,54,54
"common in a variety of astrophysical scenarios, such as,
globular clusters [13, 23], AGNs [18, 24–26], and other
dense stellar environments [27–29]. Around 90% of low
mass binaries with periods shorter than 3 days are ex-
pected to belong to some hierarchical structure [30–32].",9,CMR10,,278,56
"The above motivated recent studies on the dynamics
and GW emission in hierarchical triple systems Kozai-
Lidov resonances, in particular, have attracted some at-
tention [33–35]. These describe secular changes in the bi-
nary eccentricity and inclination with respect to the orbit
described by its CM around the third object. This mech-
anism triggers periods of high eccentricity (",9,CMR10,,382,59

"1) where
GW emission increases signiﬁcantly, potentially inducing
coalescence in eccentric orbits detectable by LISA [36–
39], which may enter the LIGO-Virgo band still at high
eccentricities [23, 40–42]. Moreover, it can lead to GW
bursts at periapsis [43, 44]. A direct integration of the
equations of motion conﬁrms that GWs from these sys-
tems have unique features [44], which may be detected
indirectly via radio observations of binary pulsars [45].
There are also attempts at modeling the eﬀects of a third
body directly into the waveform. These include Doppler
shifts [46–50], relativistic beaming eﬀects [51, 52], grav-
itational lensing [53, 54] and other dynamical eﬀects in
triple systems caused by the third-body [55–57].",9,CMR10,,734,59
"Studies so far are restricted to the (post-)Newtonian
regime and cannot capture strong-ﬁeld eﬀects. Here, we
take a ﬁrst step towards this direction, and investigate
GWs from binaries around SMBHs. Our methods can
probe resonant excitation of quasinormal modes (QNMs)
in triple systems, and capture for free all of the relativistic
eﬀects which have so far been included at a phenomeno-
logical level only. We adopt units where",9,CMR10,,427,63

". Therefore, the SB can probe the
central BH while still well within the inspiral phase of its
evolution. Note also that even though Teukolsky’s equa-
tion assumes very large mass ratios, results in the liter-
ature have shown that it is able to reproduce Numerical
Relativity for mass ratios of order 10 [62, 63]. Hence, our
results might extend to the case of an intermediate mass
black holes orbiting SMBHs.",9,CMR10,,410,60
Numerical implementation.,9,CMBXTI10,,25,25
"We used two diﬀerent
numerical schemes to solve Teukolsky’s equation. One
works in the time domain, and it smooths the pointlike
character of the SB constituents [64–67]. The other tech-
nique is based on separation of angular variables using
spheroidal harmonics [68] in the frequency domain, where
one can apply standard Green function techniques [69–
73]. Both approaches are well documented and have been
widely tested in the past. Both codes were compared
with analytical estimates in the low-frequency regime,
obtained using matched asymptotic techniques [73–75].",9,CMR10,,569,57

has support in higher modes as the binary is placed fur-
ther away from it [68, 83].
In general, therefore, the
lowest modes will not be dominant and one needs to sum
a suﬃcient amount of modes to understand total ﬂuxes.
Already for a SB at the ISCO of a non-rotating BH we
ﬁnd that the GW ﬂux at inﬁnity is comparable to that
at the horizon of the SMBH. As seen in Fig. 2, the eﬀect
is more dramatic when spin is included, the ﬂux crossing
the horizon can be orders of magnitude larger than that",9,CMR10,,552,56

with analytical predictions [46, 85] when the CM is mov-

beaming [44, 51, 52] and gravitational lensing [54, 86].
The former focuses the radiation along the direction of

"Such classes of hierarchical triple systems are abun-
dant in AGNs, and thus our results have implications
for GW astronomy, in particular for LISA which is spe-
cially designed to detect GWs originated in galactic cen-
ters [6]. While quantifying a detectability rate for the
resonances we described goes beyond the scope of this
work, we can estimate if a SB can get close enough
before being tidally disrupted due to the Hills mecha-
nism [89–91]. This occurs if the tidal forces induced by
the BH overcome the binary’s self gravity, which hap-

"A follow-up to our work is to study the capacity of GW
detectors to distinguish between these systems and iso-
lated binaries. In particular, it is important to quantify
the systematic errors incurred in parameter estimations
from a signal originated in a hierarchical triple, using GW
templates for isolated binaries. Moreover, it is important
to extend our study to other motions. An interesting
case is a SB describing a high-eccentricity orbit around
a spinning SMBH. Such eccentric orbits can be formed",9,CMR10,,507,59

"naturally in non-trivial environments [94]. In these or-
bits, the SB gets closer to the LR, which enhances the
resonant excitation of the SMBH [81] and may lead to
manifestations of superradiance [84]. Another interesting
triple system is a pair same-sized BHs and a third lighter
compact object orbiting around them. These spacetimes
have been shown to have global properties not present in
isolated BHs (e.g. global QNMs) [95, 96] and our results
suggest that the lighter object can excite these global
modes.",9,CMR10,,512,58
