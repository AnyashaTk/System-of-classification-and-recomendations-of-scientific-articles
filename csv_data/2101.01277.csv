Introduction,9,Calibri-Bold,,12,12
,9,Calibri,,0,0
"Exoplanetary  science  at  the  dawn  of  the  2020s  lies  at  a  fascinating  juncture  at  which  the  basic 
atmospheric  properties  of  potentially  rocky  worlds  lying  in  the  habitable  zone  are  already  beginning  to  be 
constrained (see e.g. de Wit  et al., 2018 which focused on TRAPPIST-1 planets in the Habitable Zone). Earlier 
works such as Forget and Leconte (2014) have discussed the potential diversity of exoplanetary atmospheres. 
Some new aspects were recently summarized by Jontof-Hutter (2019) and Madhusudhan (2019). Tinetti et al., 
(2018) summarized a chemical survey of exoplanets with the Atmospheric Remote-Sensing Infrared Exoplanet 
Large-Survey  (ARIEL)  mission.  In  the  present  review  we  highlight  some  recent  aspects  relevant  for  potential 
exoplanetary diversity for terrestrial-type exoplanets up to ~10 Earth masses. It is beyond the scope of our work 
however to review all aspects of this rapidly developing field.",9,Calibri,,971,122
"There  are  numerous  developments  which  motivate  our  review.  First,  improved  mass-radius  data  for 
cooler mini gas planets and super-Earths (see e.g. Fulton et al., 2017; Fulton and Petigura, 2018; Weiss and Marcy, 
2014)  are  confirming  that  exoplanetary  mass  can  vary  over  several  orders  of  magnitude  for  a  given  radius 
whereas radius can vary by up to a factor of ~4 for a given mass.  Small planets are being found which lie above 
the pure water composition line in the mass radius diagram - which suggests they have atmospheres. Emerging 
measurements are providing initial observational constraints for the atmospheres of hot Super Earths. Such new 
data  is  providing  first  hints  of  atmospheric  diversity  and  is  driving  emerging  strategies  for  addressing  the 
challenging degeneracies involved as discussed in e.g. Dorn et  al.  (2017) and Dorn and Heng (2018). Second, 
progress in detection methods has been made for several atmospheric species. These include theoretical studies 
involving spectroscopy of collisional pairs as a potential proxy for O",9,Calibri,,1101,124

predictions for the mass and characteristic timescales of thin silicate atmospheres on magma ocean worlds (see 
e.g.  Kite  et  al.,  2016).  Third,  progress  has  been  made  regarding  key  processes  such  as  escape  (Owen,  2019) 
(including early water loss, see Tian et al., 2018) and outgassing (e.g. Gaillard and Scaillet, 2014) over evolutionary 
timescales. These are being complimented by a growing database of observationally constrained escape rates 
from  exoplanetary  atmospheres.  Fourth,  there  have  been  numerous  studies  on  newly-discovered  planetary 
systems such as TRAPPIST-1 (Gillon et al., 2017) and Proxima Centauri-b (Anglada-Escudé et al., 2016). With the 
above in mind, we focus in our review on a specific selection of potential exoplanetary atmospheric compositions

"Tenuous atmospheres have been proposed for ultra-short period (USP) (periods of <1day) hot Super-
Earths (SEs) such as CoRot-7b (Léger et al., 2009), Kepler-10b (Batalha et al., 2011), 55 Cancri e (Demory et al., 
2011)  and  HD80653  (Frustagli  et  al.,  2020)  plus  several  others  (see  e.g.  Guenther  and  Kislyakova,  2020  and 
references therein). These highly-irradiated worlds could represent the stripped cores of smaller hot gas planets 
but possibly retaining thin atmospheres e.g. derived from refractory material such as silicate (see discussion in 
Lopez  and  Rice,  2018)  whereas  larger,  less  irradiated  SEs  could  retain  their  volatile  envelopes.  Planetary 
population diagrams (e.g. Fulton et al., 2017; Lundkvist et al., 2016) suggest a radius minimum separating rocky 
SEs from mini gas planets which is a focus of numerous modeling studies (e.g. Mordasini, 2020). A central issue 
is whether hot SEs formed mostly in-situ or underwent inward migration which likely depends upon the central 
properties  and  timescales  of  the  protoplanetary  disk  (see  e.g.  Raymond  and  Cossou,  2014;  Martin  and  Livio, 
2016). Direct observations of the proposed tenuous atmospheres of hot SEs is rather lacking although proxy data 
for atmospheric mass and composition is emerging.",9,Calibri,,1312,123
"Regarding  Corot-7b  earlier  model  studies  (e.g.  Schaefer  and  Fegley,  2009)  suggested  silicate 
atmospheres  with  strong  sodium  and  calcium  absorption  lines  analogous  to  Mercury  and  Io.  Kurokawa  and 
Kaltenegger (2013) suggested that XUV-driven photoevaporative loss could remove one Jupiter mass of gaseous 
envelope on Corot-7b (and Kepler 10b) within ~1Gyr. Guenther et al. (2011) placed upper limits for alkali metals 
based on atmospheric spectral features for CoRot-7b.  Samuel et al. (2014) implied that obtaining a few transits 
with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could extend such analyses by constraining atmospheric mass and 
composition of CoRot-7b. Regarding Kepler-10b, Rouan et al. (2011) suggested the observed phase curves were 
best fitted by a rather high bond albedo of ~0.5 with a tenuous (p",9,Calibri,,842,116

et  al.  (2020)  who  discuss  theoretical  atmospheres  which  can  form  above  a  (partially)  melted  crust).    By 
comparison Esteves et al., (2015) derived mostly lower albedos of <0.25 a sample of 14 close-orbiting Kepler 
mission planets",9,Calibri,,291,120
"Regarding 55 Cancri e, phase curve data (Tsiaris et al., 2016) based on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) 
Wide  Field  Camera  (WFC3)  suggested  a  hydrogen-helium  dominated  atmosphere  with  the  surface  pressure 
posterior peaking at 100mb (although this quantity was only loosely constrained) and a possible detection of 
hydrogen cyanide (HCN). High resolution transit spectroscopy (Ridden-Harper et al., 2016) suggested a modest

thermal flux observations (Demory et al., 2016",9,Calibri,,155,108
b,6,Calibri,,1,1
") suggested a strong (~1300K) gradient between the dayside and 
the nightside of 55 Cancri e which implies either a thin atmosphere or weak transport from day to night. Assuming 
partial  vaporization  and  surface  exchange  from  molten  magma  pools,  Kite  et  al.  (2016)  suggested  a  tenuous 
atmosphere with a surface pressure of ~10Pa (~10",9,Calibri,,349,121

a rather thick atmosphere with a surface pressure of ~1.4 bar based on a model fitted to time series of Spitzer IR 
photometry.  Hammond  and  Pierrehumbert  (2017)  applied  a  General  Circulation  model  to  55  Cancri  e  which 
suggested that a light (90:10, H",9,Calibri,,326,116

data. Lightcurve observations including revised stellar activity (Bourrier et al., 2018)  however did not support 
such a lightweight atmosphere. Miguel (2019) and Zilinskas et al. (2020) subsequently modeled the detectability 
of  atmospheric  spectral  features  by  JWST  assuming  heavy,  nitrogen-dominated  atmospheres  on  55  Cancri  e 
varying  [C/O]  from  0.01  to  200.  Results  suggested  e.g.  that  HCN  should  be  clearly  detectable  for  high  C/O 
scenarios. Variability in 55 Cancri e lightcurves (e.g. Demory et al., 2016",9,Calibri,,624,123

years with silicate rainout proceeding via the condensation rock sequence (e.g. corundum, forsterite, wüstite

which is likely sensitive to the rate of iron rainout into the core as it formed. Pahlevan et al. (2011) discussed hot

volatiles  from  the  minerals  driven  by  bottom-up  solidification  and  depends  on  cooling  rates  and  convection

interior (style of convection, mantle size) and the chemical state, which rules the efficiency of mantle outgassing, 
are intimately intermingled. This implies that planetary mass and outgassing could be somehow related. Broader 
relationships exist between planetary interiors and surficial processes. For example, in the upper atmosphere, 
loss to space of atomic hydrogen from e.g. water photolysis escapes to space, must leave behind oxygen-enriched 
atmosphere,  leading  to  oxidizing  continental  and  seafloor  weathering,  which  if  introduced  in  the  mantle  by 
subduction processes could influence its redox state and outgassing efficiency.",9,Calibri,,1269,121
"Can we test the above feedbacks - proposed by theory and occurring between e.g. atmospheric escape 
and the planetary interior - in an exoplanetary context with observables? Regarding escape, an evaporating tail 
can form in the trailing planetary limb which could influence the transit lightcurve duration and shape e.g. in the 
Lyman-alpha for escaping H-atoms. Oza et al. (2019) summarize spectroscopic detections in the exospheres of

the rotational equator of the MC, the outward centrifugal force balances the inward gravitational force. Along 
the MC rotational axis however, the unbalanced gravitational force leads to inward transport of material so that 
the  MC  flattens  into  an  accretion  disk  (Maeder,  2009).  Observations  of  evolving  disks  by  the  Atacama  Large

Predicting the position of disk snowlines and the resulting variation of planetary elemental ratios such as (C/O)

sequestrated in the planetary interior. Technically, the effective partitioning of volatiles into the melt depends 
on e.g. redox state, melt fraction, composition, temperature and pressure. These parameters are linked to the 
exogeodynamics (see 3.4.4) defining the style of planetary internal convection (eg. Noack et al., 2014). On planet 
Earth, geochemical constraints indicate that carbon is in the oxidized form of carbonate in the shallow mantle

massive and far from the Sun to prevent efficient escape in virtually any form. Regarding Venus, Earth and Mars, 
escape processes have been reviewed by numerous works e.g. Shizgal and Arkos (1996). In the early Solar System, 
atmospheric escape on Venus, Earth and Mars was discussed in e.g. Lammer et al. (2018). On Pluto, Zhu et al. 
(2014) suggested energy-limited escape which hydrodynamic treatments under-estimate by ~13% (see also Hoey

uncertainties in the atmospheric fixation rate due to e.g. lightning and cosmic rays, with a weaker variation of

"Regarding Earth-like planets orbiting in the close-in HZ of active, low mass stars, the atmosphere could 
be strongly exposed to high energy particles (Grenfell et al., 2012; Tabataba-Vakili et al., 2016; Scheucher et al., 
2018; Herbst et al., 2019, see also  Airapetian et al., 2018). Stellar proton events (SPEs) on Earth can dissociate 
molecular nitrogen and lead to ~2x10",9,Calibri,,377,117

events are experienced continuously for an Earth-like planet orbiting an active M-dwarf star, would lead to a 
removal rate of atmospheric nitrogen due to cosmic rays of 0.04 Tg NO/yr. By comparison, lightning fixation on 
modern  Earth  (which  without  life  would  remove  atmospheric  nitrogen  within  a  few  hundred  Myr  without 
regassing;  Laneuville  et  al.,  2018)  removes  atmospheric  nitrogen  about  x100  slower.  For  superflaring  stars

"modeling suggests values from below a tenth of a bar up to several bar over Earth’s history. Isotope estimates

"rate  at  which  nitrogen  is  removed  to  the  core  during  planet  formation  needs  further  study.  The  main 
uncertainties in atmospheric processes lie in the distribution of nitrogen in the Earth system and the timing and 
nature of key processes such as biology and subduction. Model feedbacks such as the effect of e.g. atmospheric 
oxidation  via  escape  and  the  influence  upon  the  interior  are  lacking.  A  detailed  intercomparison  of  current 
nitrogen cycle models including their reservoirs and fluxes for clearly defined scenarios would be informative.",9,Calibri,,579,123
"On a positive note, there is some hope that exoplanet science could help by constraining nitrogen abundances 
from  observing  spectroscopic  collisional  pairs  (Schwieterman  et  al.,  2015  as  mentioned  above)  which  will  be 
invaluable in disentangling the possible evolution scenarios.",9,Calibri,,294,122
