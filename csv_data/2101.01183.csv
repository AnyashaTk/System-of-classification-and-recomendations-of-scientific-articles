as evidence that the torque must be lower for rapid rotators than for intermediate ones. The cleaned

INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"Together with mass and metallicity, rotation is one
of the deﬁning properties of stars. Stellar rotation is
strongly mass-dependent (Kraft 1967a; Garc´ıa et al.
2014), and while stars with radiative envelopes (",9,CMR10,,210,55

vective envelopes spin down as they age (Skumanich
1972). The overall framework of the rotational evolu-

momentum losses caused by magnetized winds (Parker
1958; Schatzman 1962; Weber & Davis 1967; Kawaler
1988; Pinsonneault et al. 1989).",9,CMR10,,190,56
"For lower main-sequence stars, the observable stellar
properties do not appreciably change with time, which
makes the determination of ages of individual stars chal-
lenging (Soderblom 2010). In this regard, the empirical
spin-down of low mass stars oﬀers a valuable age diag-
nostic, and this idea is known as gyrochronology (Barnes
2003, 2007; Mamajek & Hillenbrand 2008).",9,CMR10,,374,57
"If properly validated, gyrochronology can provide
valuable age information for Galactic and stellar pop-
ulation studies (McQuillan et al. 2013, 2014; Davenport
2017; Davenport & Covey 2018; van Saders et al. 2019),",9,CMR10,,215,55

(e.g., Gallet & Delorme 2019; Carmichael et al. 2020;
David et al. 2020; Gallet 2020; Zhou et al. 2021). More-
over, although stellar evolution theory is successful in
predicting numerous properties of stars, this is not the
case for the evolution of angular momentum and its re-
lated physical processes (e.g., transport in stellar interi-
ors, birth conditions, magnetic braking). Consequently,
stellar models that incorporate it need to be calibrated
with empirical observations (e.g., Gossage et al. 2020).
All of the above add to a compelling need for gy-
rochronology to be examined and tested. For old ages (",9,CMR10,,670,60

there is another important clue about the torques from

"In other words, the data in Figure 12 appear to require
lower torques for rapid rotators than for intermediate
rotators, which acts to create the bimodal distribution
that has been noted in the literature (and which is now
clearly seen in our sample). One possible explanation
for this, as proposed by Garraﬀo et al. (2018), is that
there is a change in ﬁeld topology, such that rapid ro-
tators have more complex magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations
than intermediate rotators, and are therefore less eﬃ-
cient at losing angular momentum. Although this con-
cept is interesting, the data could also be ﬁt with a wind",9,CMR10,,608,58

where the overall ﬁeld strength declines. Alternatively,
it could indicate a dependence of the convective overturn
timescale on the rotation rate at ﬁxed mass, as loss laws
are typically parametrized by the ratio of the rotation
period to this timescale (i.e., the Rossby number). Ulti-
mately, a number of additional physical properties that
are involved in the loss of angular momentum could be
inﬂuencing the empirical sequences (e.g., mass loss rate,
dipole ﬁeld strength, Alfv´en radius). It will be informa-

dwarf domain, Stauﬀer et al. (2018) found that in the

Pleiades cluster, the stars with multiple period mea-

naries (see also Rebull et al. 2016a, Rebull et al. 2017,",9,CMR10,,91,57
"and Tokovinin & Brice˜no 2018). Furthermore, Stauﬀer
et al. (2018) showed that the rotation periods of these
young, unresolved binaries, are much shorter as well as
similar to each other than otherwise expected for single
M-dwarfs. This hints at the crucial role that binarity
plays in star formation and the rotation rates imprinted
at birth (see also Messina 2019).",9,CMR10,,367,56
