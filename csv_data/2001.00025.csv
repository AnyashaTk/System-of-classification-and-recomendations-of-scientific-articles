"RR Lyrae stars play a crucial role in understanding the formation, composi-

horizontal-branch stars, with periods ranging from 0.2 to 1 d, belong to the very
old stellar population (older than",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,275,82

luminosity relation and have distinctive light curves, which make them primary

"The completeness and purity levels of our collection of RR Lyr stars are af-
fected by various factors. First of all, we draw the reader’s attention to the fact
that the OGLE-IV mosaic camera has technical gaps between CCD chips, which
decrease the absolute completeness of our sample by 6–7%. Objects that fell into
these “dead zones” of our detector have not been observed at all by the OGLE
survey.",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,401,83
"Considering only those objects that have been observed by OGLE, the com-
pleteness of our collection is a strong function of the temporal sampling, brightness,
amplitudes, presence of the Blazhko effect, and, most of all, the pulsation modes
of RR Lyr stars. The completeness and purity levels of our collection are deﬁnitely
largest for RRab stars, since they have characteristic light curves that are not easily
mistaken for other types of periodic variables. We also expect that the efﬁciency of",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,498,87

a certain ratio unambiguously identify an object as a double-mode pulsator.",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,159,83
"In order to assess the completeness of our sample, we used stars located in
the overlapping parts of adjacent GVS ﬁelds. Such objects have double entries in
the OGLE database, so we had the opportunity to detect them twice during our
selection process (however, the ﬁnal version of our collection contains only one
entry per star – usually the one with larger number of data points). Because stars
located near the edges of the ﬁelds are often affected by a smaller number of epochs,",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,483,85

For some of these surveys (ASAS, Catalina Sky Survey, SuperWASP), we found
only several common RR Lyr stars, due to small overlaps between sky footprints or
observed magnitude ranges. By combining our sample with other lists of RR Lyr
stars (VSX, ASAS-SN, ATLAS, VVV, Pan-STARRS), we found from about 2000
to 9000 matches, and the largest overlap – over 15 000 RR Lyr stars – was found

"We carried out a systematic search for RR Lyr stars in the OGLE GVS ﬁelds
covering Galactic disk and outer bulge. We identiﬁed more than 39 000 RR Lyr
stars, which doubles the number of Galactic RR Lyr stars included in the OCVS.
The explored area of the sky was increased by a factor of 15 compared to the regular
OGLE footprint in the Galactic bulge.",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,352,84
"About 40% of the newly identiﬁed RR Lyr stars have not been included in any
existing catalog of pulsating stars, but the greatest advantage of our collection is
an exceptionally high level of completeness (94%) and a very low contamination.
Our sample is complementary to other large catalogs of RR Lyr stars in the Milky
Way halo. The astrophysical potential of the OGLE collection of RR Lyr stars",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,398,84
"in the Galactic bulge and disk cannot be overstated. It allows one to study three-
dimensional structure of the old stellar component in the vicinity of the Galactic
plane and in the bulge-halo transition region, to answer the question what fraction
of the sample is inherent to the bulge and disk and what fraction is just passing
by from the halo population, to explore the abundance patterns in the Milky Way,
to investigate globular clusters, and interstellar matter distribution. We are also
convinced that OGLE time-series photometry will be useful in a variety of astero-
seismological analyses.",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,602,83
