ABSTRACT,9,CMR10,,8,8
"Star formation in galaxies is regulated by the heating and cooling in the interstellar medium. In particular, the
processing of molecular gas into stars will depend strongly on the ratio of gas heating to gas cooling in the neutral
gas around sites of recent star-formation. In this work, we combine mid-infrared (mid-IR) observations of Polycyclic
Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), the dominant heating mechanism of gas in the interstellar medium (ISM), with [C",9,CMR10,,458,117

"] ﬁne-structure emission, the strongest cooling channels in dense, neutral gas. The ratio of IR cooling
line emission to PAH emission measures the photoelectric eﬃciency, a property of the ISM which dictates how much
energy carried by ultraviolet photons gets transferred into the gas. We ﬁnd that star-forming, IR luminous galaxies
in the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) with high IR surface densities have low photoelectric
eﬃciencies. These systems also have, on average, higher ratios of radiation ﬁeld strength to gas densities, and larger
average dust grain size distributions. The data support a scenario in which the most compact galaxies have more young
star-forming regions per unit area, which exhibit less eﬃcient gas heating. These conditions may be more common at

INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"Star-formation in a galaxy is dependent on processes
which remove energy allowing gas to cool. Only the
coldest phases will collapse under self-gravity to form
stars, and so characterizing the mechanisms by which
gas heats and cools is critical to our understanding of
star-formation, and galaxy evolution. The cold gas asso-
ciated with star-formation emits strongly in low energy
atomic and molecular transitions, bright at infrared (IR)
wavelengths.",9,CMR10,,452,57

ergy gains and losses can impact future star-formation.

2014, 2017; Ibar et al. 2015; Smith et al. 2017). More-
over, PAH emission and other far-IR ﬁne-structure lines
key to PDR heating and cooling show similar deﬁcits

Looze et al. 2014; Cormier et al. 2015; D´ıaz-Santos et al.

changes in ISM densities and the strength of the ra-
diation ﬁeld impinging upon PDR surfaces (e.g., D´ıaz-
Santos et al. 2017), and/or opacity eﬀects, thermal line",9,CMR10,,758,59

deﬁcits largely disappear in normal star-forming galax-
ies when the line emission is normalized by total PAH
emission (Helou et al. 2001; Croxall et al. 2012; Sutter
