ABSTRACT,9,CMR10,,8,8
"Recent studies of ultra hot-Jupiters suggested that their atmospheres could have thermal inversions
due to the presence of optical absorbers such as TiO, VO, FeH and other metal hydride/oxides.
However, it is expected that these molecules would thermally dissociate at extremely high temperatures,
thus leading to featureless spectra in the infrared. KELT-9 b, the hottest exoplanet discovered so far,
is thought to belong to this regime and host an atmosphere dominated by neutral Hydrogen from
dissociation and atomic/ionic species. Here, we analysed the eclipse spectrum obtained using the",9,CMR10,,592,103
"Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and, by utilising the atmospheric retrieval
code TauREx3, found that the spectrum is consistent with the presence of molecular species and is
poorly ﬁtted by a simple blackbody. In particular, we ﬁnd that a combination of TiO, VO, FeH and H-
provides the best-ﬁt when considering HST, Spitzer and TESS datasets together. Aware of potential
biases when combining instruments, we also analysed the HST spectrum alone and found that TiO
and VO only were needed in this case. These ﬁndings paint a more complex picture of the atmospheres
of ultra-hot planets than previously thought.",9,CMR10,,631,99

INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"Models suggest that, in the atmospheres of ultra-hot
Jupiters, molecular compounds should evaporate. Some
of these, such as titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium
oxide (VO), were expected to eﬃciently absorb incident
ﬂux high in the atmospheres of these planets, instigat-
ing an increase in temperature (e.g. Hubeny et al. 2003;
Fortney et al. 2008). Studies have since searched for
these thermal inversions, initially by comparing eclipse
depths between the Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 4.5",9,CMR10,,480,56

current subtraction, gain conversion, sky background
subtraction, calibration, ﬂat-ﬁeld correction, and cor-
rections for bad pixels and cosmic rays. For a detailed
description of these steps, we refer the reader to the

to the retrieval, does not change much the retrieval re-
sults (see posterior distribution and temperature struc-
ture in Figure 3), which might provide indications that
the datasets from TESS, HST and Spitzer are compat-
ible for this planet. The presence of these molecular
features in KELT-9 b might suggest that disequilibrium",9,CMR10,,493,56
"processes and/or dynamical mixing with regions that
are much cooler (e.g. the night-side Wong et al. (2019))
are allowing TiO, VO and FeH to remain stable in this

When the Spitzer point is accounted for, the diﬀerence
is ∆log(E) = 190.3 and when TESS is added, ∆log(E)
= 190.9. These strongly suggests that the observed fea-
tures are not arising from statistical ﬂuctuations (Kass
& Raftery 1995) and that the presence of near-optical
absorbers (TiO, VO, FeH and H-) is required to explain
the spectrum of KELT-9 b.",9,CMR10,,412,58
"For the temperature structure, all the performed re-
trievals are consistent with the presence of a thermal
inversion (see Figure 3). The thermal structure in the
HST+Spitzer and the TESS+HST+Spitzer runs are
almost identical, with an inversion relatively deep in
the atmosphere (10",9,CMR10,,282,54
5,6,CMR7,,1,1
"Pa). While cooler, the general
temperature-pressure structure is consistent with the
ﬁndings in Fossati et al. (2020) and could allow for
molecular species to survive in the deeper layers. The",9,CMR10,,192,54
"temperature reaches a maximum of about 5000 K. In
the HST only case, we again ﬁnd a thermal inversion
although the temperature structure diﬀers signiﬁcantly
with the inversion occurring far higher in the atmosphere
(10",9,CMR10,,218,57
3,6,CMR7,,1,1
"Pa).
In Figure 3 the contribution functions are
also plotted, highlighting two classes of models where
diﬀerent regions are probed depending whether Spitzer
is included or not.
In either case, the retrievals ex-
plore a region where a thermal inversion occur, with the
molecules being seen in emission. The inclusion of TESS
only shifts the contribution up in the TESS+HST case,
which is expected due the optical wavelengths probing
much higher in the atmosphere.",9,CMR10,,463,56
"The results for the TESS+HST run are also shown in
the ﬁgures, but we ﬁnd similar results to the HST only
run in terms of molecular detection and thermal proﬁle,
indicating that the additional information contained in
the TESS channel for this case is limited. We also in-
vestigated the signiﬁcance of each species, by performing
retrieval analyses on the TESS+HST+Spitzer case, re-
moving the detected species one by one. The ∆log(E)",9,CMR10,,435,57
"were 186.5, 176.1, 185.2, 181.2 for the runs without TiO,
VO, FeH and H-, respectively. Given that the Bayesian
evidence is signiﬁcantly lower than the ∆log(E) = 190.9
for the full model, the best statistical ﬁt is the one con-
taining all four species. However, we caution that this
result does not prove that other metal oxide/hydrides
and other absorbing species are not present in this at-
mosphere. In fact, we noticed during the removal pro-
cess of the detected molecules, that the abundance of
the remaining ones had the tendency to increase by a",9,CMR10,,554,59

absorption, thus indicating that if other absorbers are
indeed present, our retrieved abundances could be over-",9,CMR10,,165,55

DISCUSSION,9,CMR10,,10,10
"The retrievals performed here explain the modular
shape of the KELT-9 b eclipse spectrum with a mix
of near-optical absorbers. The prevalence of these
molecules is higher than expected but we note that accu-
rate abundances are diﬃcult to extract from the low res-
olution, low wavelength coverage of HST, or even from
combined datasets. In addition to this, the extreme na-
ture of KELT-9 b and its host star imply that conclu-
sions must be cautiously drawn from analyses of these
datasets.",9,CMR10,,492,56
"A number of previous studies have found evidence for
TiO, VO and H- using low resolution space-based emis-",9,CMR10,,106,53
"sion spectroscopy from HST and Spitzer (e.g. Haynes
et al. 2015; Mansﬁeld et al. 2018; Mikal-Evans et al.
2019; Edwards et al. 2020). However, given the narrow
spectral coverage and low resolution of the datasets, dis-
tinguishing between diﬀerent opacity sources is diﬃcult.
Other hydrides and oxides that are not considered in
this work (e.g. Aluminium Oxide (von Essen et al. 2019;
Chubb et al. 2020)), may be contributing to the near-
infrared features. The ones chosen here are the most
likely from chemical models of ultra-hot Jupiters (Par-
mentier et al. 2018; Lothringer et al. 2018; Kitzmann
et al. 2018) while other abundant species (e.g. SiO)
do not have signiﬁcant features in the WFC3 bandpass.

in our retrieval models (Sharp & Burrows 2007; Heiter
et al. 2015; Madhusudhan 2019; Ralchenko & Kramida
2020). Nevertheless, the possibility exists that the abun-
dances of TiO, VO and FeH could be over estimated",9,CMR10,,240,58

Further data, covering shorter wavelengths, would help
to investigate this scenario.",9,CMR10,,141,56
"In addition to this, the accuracy of retrievals are di-
rectly linked to the quality and completeness of the
available linelists. While many of the ExoMol linelists
are suitably broad in pressure and temperature cover-
age for the majority of the currently-known exoplanet
population, KELT-9 b lies far outside the norms. The

emission. In our retrieval, we employ a 1-dimensional

be constant with altitude (e.g. Lothringer et al. 2018).

would only provide a model dependent solution, driven

CONCLUSION,9,CMR10,,10,10
"We analysed the HST eclipse spectrum of KELT-9 b,
the hottest transiting planet discovered so far, using
open source reduction and retrieval frameworks. While
the extreme temperature of the planet’s day-side was ex-
pected to induce thermal dissociation of the main molec-
ular species and lead to an H- dominated spectrum with
few broadband features, we ﬁnd that the emission spec-
trum of KELT-9 b contains rich features which imply the
presence of molecular species.",9,CMR10,,469,56
"We explored 3 scenarios to ensure the consistency
in-
of our dataset across diﬀerent combinations of
struments: HST only, TESS+HST, HST+Spitzer and
TESS+HST+Spitzer.
In all those scenarios, we ﬁnd
that the atmosphere must have a thermal inversion and
that the observed features are well ﬁtted by near optical
absorbers (TiO and VO). Water vapour is not recov-
ered in any of the investigated models, which is consis-
tent with predictions of the molecule being dissociated.
When Spitzer is added, the retrievals (with/without",9,CMR10,,525,57
