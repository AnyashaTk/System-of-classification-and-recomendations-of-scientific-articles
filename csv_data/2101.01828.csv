studied before, the characteristic FDM dynamics are often neglected; in our simulations, we instead show the impact of the full
non-linear dynamics on physical observables. We focus on the evolution of the matter power spectrum, give ﬁrst results for the
FDM halo mass function directly based on full FDM simulations, and discuss the computational challenges associated with the
FDM equations. FDM shows a pronounced suppression of power on small scales relative to cold dark matter (CDM), which can
be understood as a damping eﬀect due to ‘quantum pressure’. In certain regimes, however, the FDM power can exceed that of
CDM, which may be interpreted as a reﬂection of order-unity density ﬂuctuations occurring in FDM. In the halo mass function,
FDM shows a signiﬁcant abundance reduction below a characteristic mass scale only. This could in principle alleviate the need to
invoke very strong feedback processes in small galaxies to reconcile",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1071,128

describing a wide variety of cosmological observations across a

Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2011). Since physical eﬀects experienced by
baryons can become relevant at these scales, it has proven diﬃcult
to disentangle the apparent discrepancies from baryonic physics. In
addition, even though the cosmological properties of cold dark matter
are constrained extremely well on large scales, its micro-physical
nature is still completely unknown thus far.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,439,69

"at small (i. e. galactic) scales compared to heavy particles like WIMPs
or compact objects. These eﬀects have also been proposed to elucidate
some of the ‘small-scale problems’ of cold dark matter (CDM); for
example, early numerical simulations showed that ultra-light scalars
form cores in the centres of dark matter haloes (Schive et al. 2014a).
Furthermore, light (pseudo-)scalar particles are a common feature",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,413,71

CDM utterly dwarfs that of such fuzzy dark matter (FDM), par-

non-linear regime. Computations have been performed using a variety
of approaches and numerical methods, although many attempts were
limited in scope (Zhang et al. 2019; Laguë et al. 2020, table 1).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,389,67
"Correspondingly, our understanding of structure formation in FDM
cosmologies is still comparatively spotty compared to CDM, where
decades of experience have led to extremely detailed insights. Apart
from the lower level of research attention, an important reason im-

"the limit of large scales (or large particle mass), the FDM equations
are equivalent to the Vlasov–Poisson equations of CDM (Mocz et al.
2018; Widrow & Kaiser 1993), the eﬀects of FDM in (mildly) non-
linear regimes of structure formation are still poorly understood when
compared to CDM.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,288,70
"Due to the computational requirements, the cosmological volumes
studied in simulations with full FDM dynamics have been especially
limited (Woo & Chiueh 2009; Schive et al. 2014a; Veltmaat et al.
2018; Mocz et al. 2020), which is an issue that this work seeks to
improve upon. In particular, we would like to carry out simulations
that smoothly connect the non-linear state reached in isolated FDM
haloes to the still linear large-scale structure, thereby bridging, in
particular, the regime of mildly non-linear evolution where diﬀerences
in the temporal evolution compared to CDM can be expected. To this
end, we carry out very large uni-grid FDM simulations with a spectral
method, which fully retains the quantum-mechanical eﬀects. Because
there is still a dearth of precision studies of how FDM compares
to CDM for traditional measures of large-scale structure, we focus
our analysis on central measures of matter clustering, namely the
power spectrum and the halo mass function, and compare to ordinary",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1008,70

Veltmaat & Niemeyer 2016; Zhang et al. 2018; Nori & Baldi 2018;
Nori et al. 2019), these do not capture inherent wave phenomena
such as interference eﬀects, which can have a signiﬁcant impact on
the overall evolution at least on small scales (Li et al. 2019), leaving
the validity of results obtained in this way unclear in the absence
of similar computations solving the fundamental wave equations. In
particular, while all simulations can easily incorporate the impact of
the suppressed small-scale power spectrum present with FDM in the
initial conditions, such methods either lack the wave nature of FDM
entirely or only approximate it. Using our simulations presented in this
work, we aim to clarify the reliability of such approximative results
by explicitly omitting the suppression in the FDM initial conditions,
starting instead from ‘standard’",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,941,72

impact of eq. (23) is clearly visible: The resolution requirements
become more stringent with larger axion masses and at ﬁxed grid size,
a larger box size directly implies worse resolution. Thus, at ﬁxed grid
size, if axion mass and box size are scaled by the same factor, the
resulting power spectra are identical except at small scales, which are
impacted by the change in Jeans length with diﬀerent axion masses.

"reliable results. However, due to the numerical challenges involved
in large-volume simulations of FDM, such determinations have not
been obtained thus far.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,156,67
"Our new simulations for the ﬁrst time allow corresponding measure-
ments, although the results are not representative of a fully consistent
FDM cosmology due to the use of CDM ICs. However, our simu-
lations allow us to demonstrate how strongly the FDM dynamics
alone impact the HMF, and accordingly, to what extent their omission
might aﬀect the result. To this end, we study the HMF using the
grid-based halo ﬁnder introduced in section 3.5, whose operation on
our largest simulation is demonstrated in Fig. 11. In Fig. 12, we show
the obtained mass functions for the FDM and CDM cases for a set of
example simulations.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,621,72
13,7,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,2,2
"As expected from the power spectra, the HMF
of FDM exhibits a lack of low-mass haloes, but agrees for massive
haloes. To obtain essentially perfect agreement with CDM for the
most massive haloes, however, requires suﬃciently high resolution in
the FDM calculation for the target redshift. As we have seen earlier,
the numerical resolution requirements become ever more stringent
towards lower redshift, and once they start to be compromised, the
growth on large (even still linear) scales becomes damped, which then
manifests itself in halo masses which are biased low. This is clearly
seen in Fig. 12 in the comparison of the low- and high-resolution
FDM results for the HMF.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,676,69
"More interesting, however, is the abundance reduction of low-mass
haloes in FDM. Indeed, the delayed onset of structure formation
becomes apparent even more clearly in the HMF than in the power
spectrum, with almost no objects present before",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,241,65
𝑧,8,NewTXMI,,1,1
=,8,txmiaX,,1,1
"7. At late times,
there is a dearth of low-mass haloes in our results, but the deﬁcit
appears not as strong as the cut-oﬀ predicted by Kulkarni & Ostriker
(2020). Rather, it appears that power transfer to smaller scales is
suﬃciently strong in FDM that the break in the HMF is weaker than
predicted by simpliﬁed models based on ‘quantum pressure’-ﬁltered
versions of the Press–Schechter formalism. This reinforces the notion
that simply applying a Jeans ﬁltering at the linear level and assuming
that all smaller scales never grow and thus can be ignored does not
necessarily yield suﬃcient quantitative accuracy to predict the non-
linear outcome of FDM. On the other hand, the simulations shown
in Fig. 12 do not yet include the eﬀect of ICs appropriate for the
FDM model, which feature a strong cut-oﬀ even in the initial power
spectrum (see section 7) and are thus expected to result in additional
suppression of low-mass haloes.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,933,70

has been predicted on theoretical grounds and has been veriﬁed with

and a NFW proﬁle as comprehensive description of the non-linear
density structure of FDM haloes, and to use this to forecast the rotation
curve of galaxies and the core size of galaxies as a function of their
virial mass (Burkert 2020). We caution, however, that this neglects the
potentially signiﬁcant impact of order-unity density ﬂuctuations of the
FDM wave function outside the solitonic core, which are completely
lost in the spherical averaging and the halo stacking. Likewise, it
is unclear how severely baryons can impact the innermost density
proﬁle. These baryonic eﬀects are quite uncertain in CDM, but even
less is known about them in FDM, where they could potentially be
stronger due to the lower dark matter densities in the centres of haloes.

8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,25,25
"In this study, we have carried out simulations of fuzzy dark matter
models with the pseudo-spectral method. This can be considered
the most accurate approach to solve the Schrödinger–Poisson sys-
tem numerically, without neglecting certain aspects of the temporal
evolution of the wave function. In particular, this can account for
oscillatory, order-unity ﬂuctuations of the local density due to the
quantum-mechanical eﬀects in the axion-like dynamics.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,454,68
"Unfortunately, the numerical resolution requirements to faithfully
follow the FDM dynamics are much harder to fulﬁl than for the familiar",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,137,70
𝑁,8,NewTXMI,,1,1
"-body techniques applicable in the CDM case. Even large-scale
modes require a very ﬁne mesh, otherwise the velocities appearing in
the dynamics cannot properly be represented because then the spatial
variation of the quantum-mechanical phase factor is not resolved. Yet,

"of the largest velocities drives down the time step, which depends
quadratically and not linearly on the spatial resolution. In practice, this
means that one cannot trivially simulate large cosmological volumes
at low resolution in a way similar to the standard practice in CDM.
Rather, one is relegated to very small volumes and to the high-redshift
regime, whereas a push to large box sizes and low redshift quickly
becomes extremely expensive, as we highlighted in this paper.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,479,75
"In this work, we could nevertheless compute the largest-volume
simulations with full FDM dynamics thus far by using rather large grid
sizes of up to 8640",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,153,70

the evolution of the non-linear power spectrum in these cosmologies,
and to make the ﬁrst direct measurements of the halo mass function
in such models, especially with respect to how the FDM dynamics
aﬀect these observables without starting from an already-suppressed
power spectrum in the ICs. Our main ﬁndings can be summarized as

the largest scales to linear perturbation theory or a CDM simulation,

FDM and CDM is reduced, and interference patterns on these scales

any case leads to signiﬁcant power transfer to scales smaller than the
initial FDM Jeans scale, even to the extent that oscillatory perturba-

"We could, for the ﬁrst time, measure the halo mass function
directly from spectral FDM simulations. For massive haloes, we ﬁnd
the same abundance of haloes as in CDM, consistent with expectations
based on the agreement of their large-scale linear power spectra. The
formation of the ﬁrst haloes is however delayed for FDM with respect
to CDM, and there are considerably fewer low-mass haloes forming
compared to CDM. The low-mass cut-oﬀ of the HMF we ﬁnd is
less pronounced than found by methods which take into account the
suppressed FDM ICs, even for those which neglect the non-linear
FDM dynamics. This demonstrates that the FDM ICs have a larger
impact on the HMF than the dynamics at later times, although the
suppression caused by the latter is still sizeable. However, since the
cut-oﬀ appears at much lower halo masses compared to the FDM ICs,
the impact of this eﬀect is much more diﬃcult to observe.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,910,70
•,8,txsys,,1,1
"Despite our large grid sizes, our simulations have only limited
resolving power for the internal structure of dark matter haloes.
However, we could still clearly detect characteristic solitonic cores in
spherically averaged density proﬁles of haloes, with a proﬁle shape
that matches results of previous work well. These cores are particularly
large for low-mass haloes, where they also substantially reduce the
central dark matter densities relative to CDM.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,458,72
"Our results thus highlight that it is, in principle, possible to compute
accurate cosmological simulation results for FDM in representative
volumes, albeit at considerable computational cost. We will apply our
implementation to FDM initial conditions (similar to section 7) in
larger volumes in the future, providing physical observables in a fully
consistent FDM scenario. However, to conclusively understand the
combined dynamics of FDM and baryons in the centres of galaxies,
and thus to arrive at reliable predictions about whether these scenarios
can resolve, e. g., the cusp–core tension, will ultimately require to",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,621,72
"add baryonic physics to these simulations, and to make them spatially
more adaptive inside individual haloes such that the resolution can be
increased there in a targeted fashion. First attempts in this direction
have been carried out (e. g. Mocz et al. 2019; Veltmaat et al. 2020),
but the associated numerical challenges are still formidable.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,344,71
