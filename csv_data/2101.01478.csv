expands upon these ﬁndings, by analysing inversion-associated changes in plasma properties

unperturbed magnetic polarity. We ﬁnd that many inversions exhibit anti-correlated ﬁeld and
velocity perturbations, and are thus characteristically Alfvénic, but many also depart strongly

with larger density and magnetic ﬁeld strength changes, and characteristic slow solar wind
properties. We ﬁnd no evidence that inversions which stray further from ‘ideal’ Alfvénicity
have diﬀerent generation processes from those which are more Alfvénic. Instead, diﬀerent
inversion properties could be imprinted based on transport or formation within diﬀerent solar

the ﬁeld becomes locally reversed, and have been observed across a

et al. 1999; Crooker et al. 2004; Yamauchi et al. 2004; Matteini et al.

interchange reconnection (a key process in many solar wind mod-
els Fisk 2003; Antiochos et al. 2011), the newly-opened magnetic
ﬂux tube will have an S-shaped kink embedded within it (see e.g.,
Figure 1 of Crooker et al. 2002). This kinked magnetic structure
propagates upwards through the corona at approximately the local
Alfvén speed. Diﬀerent modelling approaches have demonstrated
that these kinks may survive to reach solar distances observable by
PSP (Zank et al. 2020) or further (Tenerani et al. 2020) as magnetic
inversions. This model for inversion formation has been applied in
the past to use inversions as a solar wind tracer of coronal reconnec-

"processes during
solar wind transport between the Sun and the observer. Modelling
by Squire et al. (2020) has demonstrated that switchbacks could
gradually develop in the solar wind as a result of the growth of
Alfvénic turbulent ﬂuctuations due to solar wind expansion. Earlier
work by Landi et al. (2005, 2006) showed that velocity shears can
suﬃciently distort the ﬁeld to form inversions through interaction
with outward-propagating large scale Alfvén waves (i.e., low fre-
quency Alfvénic turbulence) which create a misalignment between
the radial solar wind ﬂow and the magnetic ﬁeld direction.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,600,67

the model of Landi et al. (2006), Owens et al. (2018, 2020) describe
how magnetic ﬂux tubes threaded by solar wind speed shears can
form inversions at the location of the shear, due to the ﬂux tube
convecting radially at diﬀerent speeds along its length. This process",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,300,69

coincide with both velocity shears, and changes in heavy ion com-
position - a signature of connectivity to diﬀerent source regions.
Inversions could also be driven through the draping of the HMF
over ejecta associated with solar wind transients such as interplan-
etary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) or plasma blobs (Lockwood
et al. 2019). The above driving of inversions through distortion by
streams and structures cannot be expected to produce inversions for
which a typical Alfvénic ﬁeld and ﬂow correlation exists. Stream
shear will produce a structured velocity ﬁeld at the inversion, while
draping will involve compression.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,694,69

2001) to discriminate between locally inverted HMF and true sector
reversals. The primary result of this study was that the occurrence
of inverted HMF increases between 0.3 and 1 AU. If inversions",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,414,67

result supports the view that a signiﬁcant fraction of inversions are

processes discussed above. Velocity shears (Landi et al. 2006) or
other",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,278,69

"processes could also be acting to amplify inversions
which are generated at the Sun, contributing to this trend. As a

"A further result of Macneil et al. (2020b) was that inversions
did not exhibit a particular bias in the direction of deﬂection of
the azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld. For this reason, a driving process
such as turbulence was favoured as an explanation for the increase
in inverted HMF. However, subject to a range of caveats, other
processes could still reasonably contribute. Recent studies on the
near-Sun switchbacks observed by PSP indicate that they occur in
clusters (Dudok de Wit et al. 2020), within which the deﬂections",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,520,66

Inversion Identiﬁcation and HMF Deﬂection Angle,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,47,47
"In typical solar wind conditions, strahl electrons travel anti-sunward
along the ﬁeld. Intervals where the strahl instead travels sunward
are thus identiﬁable as local HMF inversions. We determine the
strahl orientation for each electron PAD using the method detailed
in Macneil et al. (2020a), which also identiﬁes instances of bidirec-
tional strahl and strahl drop outs which we then remove from this
study. Since the unperturbed HMF follows the Parker spiral, unin-
verted HMF which is positive (negative) relative to the expected
Parker spiral direction will have a parallel (anti-parallel) oriented
strahl beam. Inverted HMF which is positive (negative) along the
expected Parker spiral direction will have anti-parallel (parallel)
strahl. This information, summarised in Figure 1 of Macneil et al.
(2020b), is used to tentatively classify all HMF samples which have
a detectable mono-directional strahl as either uninverted or inverted.
To mitigate the eﬀect of possibly mis-identiﬁed inverted HMF
on our results, we apply a further restriction on the samples which",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1072,70

"are categorised as inverted based on the above strahl procedure. This
is motivated by the existence of a subset of inverted HMF samples
which show evidence of mis-identiﬁcation, detailed in Appendix B.
To remove these, we select for inverted HMF which takes the form
of a clear deviation from the background magnetic ﬁeld direction,
i.e., a temporary reversal in the ﬁeld. We do so by computing the

background magnetic ﬁeld (such as large scale inversions, inversions
which occur near the heliospheric current sheet, or inversions which
are indicated by only strahl and not a magnetic ﬁeld deﬂection)
are also removed. It is diﬃcult to disentangle these real inversions
from the falsely identiﬁed ones, so we take the cautious approach
of removing them all. Following these steps, a total of 5620 valid
inverted HMF samples remain, out of 197972 valid samples overall.

in high relative collisional age solar wind are likely linked to this
result, since high collisional age is indicative of typical ‘slow’ solar

"by Bruno & Bavassano
(1991); D’Amicis & Bruno (2015). Under this framework, Alfvénic
and non-Alfvénic inversions could both be formed through similar
processes, such as through interchange reconnection at the Sun, or
growing turbulent ﬂuctuations in the heliosphere (as favoured by
previous analysis of this data set Macneil et al. 2020b). How close
to ideally Alfvénic a given HMF inversion is would then be a result
of its evolution, rather than formation, and linked to the processing
within the surrounding plasma.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,518,69
"An alternative explanation is that non-Alfvénic inversions
which tend to be more compressible are in fact formed through
a diﬀerent process to the more Alfvénic inversions. Suitable can-
didate processes for creating non-Alfvénic inversions would be the
draping of the HMF over blobs, or inversion formation in regions of
solar wind shear, where gradients in density and ﬁeld strength are
more likely present (see Section 1).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,425,67
"Of the two above options to explain discrepancies in inversion
Alfvénicity, the results of this study lead us to favour the ﬁrst; that
variable Alfvénic signatures of inversions are a result of diﬀerent
solar wind processing, likely related to the presence of compressive

"In Section 1 we describe an additional criteria which we apply
to reﬁne our classiﬁcation of inverted HMF. In this appendix we
shall provide the justiﬁcation for taking this step. To recap Section
1, the ﬁrst criteria for inverted HMF is that the strahl is oriented
in the anti-parallel (parallel) direction for positive (negative) HMF
polarity. The second, new, criteria is that the HMF polarity of a
given sample be opposite to the modal polarity over a 12 hr window

not the second are discarded.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,563,69

"Mis-identiﬁcation of inverted HMF could occur because the
strahl alignment is not being accurately determined, perhaps due
to a low overall strahl ﬂux or otherwise anomalous distribution
function. Examining electron PADs corresponding to the samples
which fall in the additional populations in Figure B1, we ﬁnd that
a sizeable fraction have a particularly low total strahl ﬂux, which
supports this hypothesis. However, removing all samples with a
low strahl ﬂux does fully not eliminate the apparently mis-rectiﬁed
population. Some further inverted samples in this population occur
just before or after bidirectional strahl is observed, indicating that
the sunward-travelling strahl (which we assume indicates inverted
HMF) may be instead due to the appearance of strahl PADs on
closed HMF (see Macneil et al. 2020b).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,818,70
"The second additional criteria for inversions, which we apply
for the data used in this study, is designed to mitigate the apparent
mis-identiﬁcation of inversions by applying a separate veriﬁcation
step. Comparing Figure B1 to Figure 4, we see that the additional
population is largely absent, indicating that the second criteria is",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,333,69

lustrates the eﬀect of this additional step most clearly, although a
similar eﬀect is found when we make equivalent comparisons with
e.g., Figures 2 and 5.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,186,68
"While the mis-rectiﬁcation of inverted HMF appears to be
largely solved by introducing the second criteria, there are further
potential consequences of this approach. Primarily, some true HMF
inversions likely exist which do not coincide with a polarity which
is opposite to the background polarity in a 12 hr window. This could
be because they occur near the HCS (so the dominant polarity is
that of the opposite sector), they are particularly large or occur
in bursts (causing the inverted polarity to dominate over a 12 hr
window), or because the inversion does not coincide with a ﬁeld
deﬂection visible in the time series, but is clear from the strahl data
(such as that shown in Figure 1 of Crooker et al. 2004). This true
inverted HMF will be removed by this step in our analysis. The
presence of these types of inversion may explain why the removal
of only samples with a low strahl ﬂux does not fully remove the
non-Alfvénic population in Figure B1.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,958,71
