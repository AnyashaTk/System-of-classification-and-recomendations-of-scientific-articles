ABSTRACT,8,CMBX9,,8,8
"The anisotropy or triaxiality of massive dark matter haloes largely deﬁnes the structure
of the cosmic web, in particular the ﬁlaments that join the haloes together. Here we
investigate such oriented correlations in mass-Peak Patch halo catalogues by using the
initial strain tensor of spherical proto-halo regions to orient the haloes. To go beyond
the spherically averaged two-point correlation function of haloes we use oriented stacks
to compute oriented two-point correlations: we explicitly break isotropy by imposing a
local frame set by the strain tensor of the reference halo before stacking neighbouring
haloes. Beyond the exclusion zone of the reference halo, clustering is found to be
strongly enhanced along the major direction of the strain tensor as expected. This
anisotropic clustering of haloes along ﬁlaments is further quantiﬁed by using a spherical
harmonics decomposition. Furthermore, we compute the evolution of cluster-scale halo
principal directions relative to those of their neighbours and show that there are
strong correlations extending up to very large scales. In order to provide calculations
more suitable to observational confrontations, we also utilize 2D projected versions of
some equivalent correlation functions. Finally, we show that the multipole structure of
the mass-peak patch halo’s anisotropic clustering can be qualitatively captured in an
analytic treatment based on peak theory. Though highly informative, giving the same
qualitative features as the oriented correlations found from the simulation catalogue,
analytic evaluation involves extensive use of Monte Carlo methods, which is also what
the simulated catalogue uses, taking into account as they do the adaptive nature of
the mass-peak patch mass hierarchy and all non-local complexities associated with
the exclusion of smaller haloes overlapping with larger ones: there is no substitute",9,CMR10,,1895,89

walls and voids in this fully connected cosmic network.",8,CMR9,,297,62
"Observations and numerical simulations complement
one another to get a deeper understanding of our Universe.
But still technical issues coming from their manipulation
are rather diﬀerent. Information from observational data is
subject to experimental measurement error and is restricted
to the past light cone constraint. Simulations, though lim-
ited by the theoretical approximations used and computer
performance, can be used to derive mock catalogues of all as-
pects of the matter distribution, including precise positions
and velocities and ﬁeld conﬁguration properties for iden-
tiﬁed objects, over all space and time, not just on the past
light cone. The mass-Peak Patch computational halo-ﬁnding
methodology described in Bond & Myers (1996a) (hereafter
BM1) and other works of that era are accurate on the past
light cone as well as over all space and time, and allow rapid",8,CMR9,,882,62
"calculations of ensembles of such realizations, as parame-
ters deﬁning the cosmology vary. Though traditional N-body
simulations are more accurate, to this day N-body ensem-
bles suitable for mocking all manner of massive observational
campaigns remain limited. The mass-Peak Patch algorithm
was further improved in Stein et al. (2019) for massively
parallel computation. It allows identiﬁcation from an initial
(linear) state distribution of matter of regions (contiguous
mass-patches) that will collapse to form virialized objects
in the ﬁnal state space, haloes. Other approximate meth-
ods of varying speeds have been put forward over the past
decades. e.g., Pinocchio (Monaco et al. 2002) is one such ex-
ample. The attention to fast simulation techniques has been
driven by a dire need to address very costly statistical prob-
lems such as likelihood surface construction for large galaxy
surveys, for which covariance matrices encode the simplest
characterization, e.g., (see e.g Monaco 2016; Lippich et al.
2019, and references therein).",8,CMR9,,1046,62
"Here, we do not focus on these observationally-related
problems but rather undertake a theoretical exploration, us-
ing such approximate methods to determine the clustering
of haloes in the web, in particular focussing on the ques-",8,CMR9,,231,60
tion of halo alignments. Peak patch simulations can address,8,CMR9,,59,59
"this since they use coarse-grained ellipsoidal dynamics of
the halo patches, following the nonlinear development of
initial anisotropic tidal forces which correlate from halo to
halo. Triaxial collapse along the last axis to equilibrate is
slower than in isotropic spherical collapse for highly initially-
sheared patches.",8,CMR9,,322,65
"These tidal forces which dictate the formation sites
of the ﬁlamentary cosmic web (van Haarlem & van de
Weygaert 1993; Bond et al. 1996; van de Weygaert &
Bertschinger 1996), also shape the morphology of haloes
notably through tidal stretching (Catelan et al. 2001) and",8,CMR9,,269,58
"spin them up through tidal torques (see e.g Lee & Pen 2000;
Crittenden et al. 2001; Schaefer 2009, for a review). Because
tides are set on large scales by the cosmic web, a large-scale
coherence of the shapes and spins of galaxies and haloes is
naturally expected (see for instance Codis et al. 2015b, for a",8,CMR9,,307,62
modelling of the spin alignments of galaxies induced by the,8,CMR9,,59,59
cosmic web). Various numerical works,8,CMR9,,36,36
1,5,CMR6,,1,1
"have indeed demon-
strated that the shape of haloes tend to align with ﬁlaments
and walls in dark matter simulations (Patiri et al. 2006;
Brunino et al. 2007; Hahn et al. 2007; Arag´on-Calvo et al.
2007), a result also found more recently for galaxies in cos-
mological hydrodynamical simulations (Codis et al. 2018b).
This is in agreement with observations which have evidenced
a clear radial alignment of massive clusters (Smargon et al.
2012; van Uitert & Joachimi 2017), observations that go way
back to the eighties.",8,CMR9,,521,61
"These halo and galaxy alignments are key to understand
galaxy formation and evolution notably through the role of
the environment versus internal processes. They also repre-
sent a worrisome contamination for current and, even more
so, for future large photometric surveys which are designed
to map the distribution of matter through measurement of
cosmic shear, e.g., KiDS, DES, HSC, CFIS, Euclid, LSST
(see e.g Joachimi et al. 2015; Kirk et al. 2015; Kiessling et al.
2015; Troxel & Ishak 2015, for recent reviews). Indeed, in-
trinsic alignments of galaxies induce a spurious signal in the
lensing-induced shear-shear correlation function which bi-",8,CMR9,,651,65
"ases signiﬁcantly the cosmological analysis if not accounted
for properly (Kirk et al. 2010; Krause et al. 2016). Diﬀer-
ent strategies have been developed over the course of the
last few years, from perturbative approaches (Blazek et al.
2019; Vlah et al. 2020) to semi-analytical models (Schneider
& Bridle 2010; Joachimi et al. 2013a,b; Fortuna et al. 2020),
and now state-of-the-art hydrodynamical computations can
address this, by simulating large cosmological volumes while
keeping enough resolution for galaxies (Codis et al. 2015a;
Tenneti et al. 2015; Chisari et al. 2016; Velliscig et al. 2015;
Hilbert et al. 2017). One of the major diﬃculties in mod-
elling such an eﬀect is the high sensitivity to detailed as-
pects of the nonlinear gastrophysics of galaxies, including
feedback from short scales to large. It is therefore of inter-
est to try to separate the large-scale coarse-grained patterns
that can be predicted from ﬁrst principle dark matter dy-
namical methods such as peak patches from the complex
response functions (susceptibilities) describing the interior
characterizations of haloes, and their embedded galaxies.",8,CMR9,,1141,64
"In this paper, we focus on the theoretical modelling
of the large-scale alignments of haloes. Rather than using
general perturbative treatments, we rely on the nonlinear

tion information in the derived halo catalogues. The detailed
cosmic web structure of clusters, ﬁlaments, membranes and

tational collapse from the linear ﬁelds constrained by the
anisotropic linear tides of the most prominent haloes (Bond
et al. (1996)). First, Section 2 gives a general overview
of haloes, the peak patch theory of them, and the sim-

"Let us consider the ﬂow of a bundle of dark matter tra-
jectories from the ”initial” linear regime (Lagrangian space)
into the ”ﬁnal” nonlinear regime (Eulerian space). If the
dark matter starts cold, the 6D phase space is a 3D one,
with zero peculiar velocities and it remains restricted to a
3D hypersurface, but trajectories in collapsing regions inter-
twine, phase wrapping in the 6D phase space. This is seen
from the vantage point of a particular Eulerian 3D position
in the halo as multiple streams passing through, with a dis-
persion in velocity as well as a bulk average velocity (see e.g
Shandarin 2011; Falck et al. 2012; Abel et al. 2012). From
the 3D perspective, the dispersion is seen as heat and haloes
are regions of such hot dynamics. Even with the most so-
phisticated N-body computations it is diﬃcult to simulate
the orbits with full accuracy (see Sousbie & Colombi 2016;",8,CMR9,,894,63
"Hahn & Angulo 2016, for recent attempts at solving the
Vlasov-Poisson system).",8,CMR9,,78,54
"In halo-ﬁnding, whether in initial or ﬁnal space, the
idea is to identify such regions of hot dynamics, compress
the complex information into a few global parameters, such
as overall mass, mass-concentration, angular momentum, in-
terior heat and binding energy, and, of special interest to us
for anisotropy exploration, tidal tensors, strain tensors and
mass inertia tensors.",8,CMR9,,377,62

ﬂow from ﬁnal to initial state can, of course, be done pre-
cisely in N-body dark matter simulations since all informa-
tion is carried along with the particle labels. There is much
interest in ﬂowing backward from current data to recover
the initial linear state from the ﬁnal state information, but
the orbit entanglements inherent in nonlinear objects limit
what is likely to be do-able with just ﬁnal halo information.
Using triaxial ellipsoid collapse in peak patches the forward

PATCH PICTURE,8,CMBX9,,13,13
"Since the cosmic web develops from linear tidal anisotropies
in the initial Gaussian random ﬁeld which are correlated
across scales, initial strains at halo positions are very likely
to be strongly aligned with the large-scale cosmic web. This
is what we investigate in detail in this paper.",8,CMR9,,291,64
"Even though the initial strain tensor is not equivalent
to the actual shape of the dark matter haloes at the present
day, a number of theoretical models are based on this quan-
tity (e.g., linear tidal alignment model, tidal torquing or any
generalisation of these two based on perturbation theory).
Because the strain and tide are proportional, and strain is
what deﬁnes coarse-grained collapse on halo-scales, we think
it is the most important indicator for collapse. By contrast",8,CMR9,,481,63
"the initial moment of inertia tensor, while highly correlated
with the tide in linear theory, is generally mismatched be-
cause of the",8,CMR9,,134,61
r,8,CMMI9,,1,1
2,5,CMR6,,1,1
"weighting of the strain compared to the un-
weighted strain average that we want to concentrate on.
This mismatch is important since it is acted upon by the

anisotropy, one can mark the two-point halo-halo correlation
function by adding constraints on the pair members. In this

sor to compute the mean number density proﬁle of haloes
around it, for now not taking into account orientation as-
pects of the non-target clusters that we stack on, although
we do that later. In this work the shapes of haloes are mod-

time-dependent nonlinear strain tensor, but the late-time
deformations are determined completely by the pre-collapse

ference with the previous isotropic correlation is that we
are now deliberately breaking the isotropy by enforcing the
halo eigenframe information upon the correlation statistics.
Hence we now do the stacking in 3D instead of in 1D as was
done with the isotropic case before when the correlation only
depended upon the modulus of the pair separation. For the
Lagrangian space results we adopt a regular grid with voxel

show the 3D oriented correlation function in Lagrangian
space. The contours in blue show the exclusion zone near
the central halo. This exclusion is very anisotropic and is
stretched along the minor axis of the halo. The clustering
that is maximum in the red region is also very anisotropic
and occurs along the major direction. This is a clear sig-
nature of the cosmic web like environment with typically a
ﬁlament along the major direction where most neighbour-
ing haloes reside, a wall that encompasses the ﬁlament and
tend to lie in the plane formed by the major and intermedi-
ate direction while two voids tend to be located in the minor",8,CMR9,,705,61

show the oriented correlation functions in Eulerian space.

ment along the major axis being even more pronounced and,8,CMR9,,56,56
"sharper as a result of the gravitational collapse of structures.
This corroborates what we were expecting from the halo
shape visualisations of Fig. 1. The major direction of haloes
more likely points towards other haloes while their minor di-
rection points towards neighbouring voids. Let us also note
that the bump in density is approximately at the same dis-
tance, around 5-10 Mpc, found for the isotropic correlation
(Fig. 3), quantifying the typical extent of inter-cluster ﬁla-
ments (which is an increasing function of halo mass). Note
that this anisotropic clustering of haloes was also investi-
gated recently in the context of galaxy-galaxy lensing (Osato
et al. 2018) where similar results were found.",8,CMR9,,714,64

tainties – in Arag´on-Calvo et al. 2010). Typically the low-
mass haloes are connected to",8,CMR9,,261,60
∼,8,CMSY9,,1,1
"4 ﬁlaments on average while
larger mass haloes can reach typically 8-10 connections. This
is one reason why more massive haloes excite harmonics of
higher orders. At low mass, haloes are embedded in one big
ﬁlament so that two branches emanate on each side and
a quadrupole in the correlation function appears. Possibly
two more branches are also there but on average they will
be less pronounced hence the lower amplitude of the cor-
responding harmonics. There is no signiﬁcant contribution
beyond. On the other hand, massive haloes are connected
to about 8-10 branches of ﬁlaments which is why harmon-
ics up to higher order (8 or so) can be excited. Obviously,
the low orders dominate (corresponding to the dominant ﬁl-
aments) and higher orders are progressively suppressed as
they correspond to fainter ones.",8,CMR9,,814,61
"In Eulerian space, gravitational collapse sharpens the
ﬁlamentary cosmic web. The clustering of haloes is enhanced",8,CMR9,,114,59
"as they moved along the cosmic web. As can be seen on the
bottom panel of Fig. 5, the monopole dominates now over
the entire range of separations. This is especially true for the
smaller mass haloes, maybe because those in clusters have
erased memory of their large-scale environment and there-
fore tend to reduce the relative impact of higher order har-
monics. However, for the more massive bin, the quadrupole
is large and reaches more or less the same amplitude as the
monopole for all separations. This is probably because larger
masses have evolved much less and have kept their initial
main connections (although some small ﬁlaments may have
merged).",8,CMR9,,658,64
3.4 Oriented stacks with symmetry-breaking,8,CMBX9,,42,42
"Previously, we have assumed no preferential orientation (i.e
global sign) of the eigenvectors. Those were headless arrows.
Hence, one could only consider one eighth of the space to
represent the 3D oriented correlation function. This has two
advantages: eight times more data per pixel which is useful
to reduce numerical noise, and a memory usage divided by
8. However, there might be some physical reasons to impose
an orientation for the basis. For example if one wants to",8,CMR9,,475,61
"take into account the displacement of haloes between the
initial and ﬁnal positions to compute the correlations, one
could impose the eigenvectors of our haloes to be oriented
approximately in the direction of the displacement vector
which more or less boils down to orientating ﬁlaments in
the direction of the force (i.e the attractive node). Consider
a halo with a displacement vector",8,CMR9,,387,62

is proportional to its gravitational acceleration vector. We
can add information to the stacking without losing any in-

acceleration, in particular by imposing that the three eigen-",8,CMR9,,327,61

main mode excited is along the ﬁlaments therefore it corre-
sponds to the harmonics (1",8,CMR9,,337,59

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION,8,CMBX9,,27,27
"In this work, the peak patch picture was used as a model
for halo formation and evolution. Based on this model,
the anisotropic halo clustering was ﬁrst investigated. The
anisotropy could be revealed thanks to an oriented stack",8,CMR9,,227,58
"in the frame of the halo’s strain tensor whose orientation
is very correlated with the surrounding cosmic web. Haloes
were shown to cluster mostly in the direction of the ﬁla-
ments as expected. This eﬀect was further quantiﬁed using
an harmonic decomposition of the three dimensional cor-",8,CMR9,,289,58
"relation function, which allowed us to make the connec-",8,CMR9,,55,55
MNRAS,7,CMR8,,5,5

"tion with the so-called cosmic web connectivity modelled
in Codis et al. (2018a). In addition, we also implemented
a symmetry breaking procedure where the direction of the
local ﬂow is accounted for. As expected haloes cluster more
in the direction of the ﬂow.",8,CMR9,,260,59
"Furthermore, the correlations between halo shapes as
traced by their initial strain were quantiﬁed both in 3D and
in projection. It was shown that those correlations exist on",8,CMR9,,174,60
"very large scales and are highly anisotropic. Along ﬁlaments,
they extend to scales as large as 50 Mpc and more.",8,CMR9,,112,61
"In order to provide theoretical insight onto those results,
ﬁrst principle calculations based on the hierarchical peak
theory of Gaussian random ﬁelds can be performed. Such
predictions for the oriented clustering of peaks in Gaussian
random ﬁelds are provided in Appendix A and are shown to
lead to the same qualitative picture as for the peak patch
picture described in this paper. However, one should bear
in mind that the peak theory description, although elegant
since it can be fully written and derived from ﬁrst principles,
cannot model accurately the details of halo formation and",8,CMR9,,589,63
"alignments which require a more complex modelling of their
collapse, displacements and nonlinear exclusion eﬀects which
are provided by the mass-peak patch model used here.",8,CMR9,,172,60

"with structure formation may decrease the initial alignments
modelled in this article. However the work presented here al-
lows us to understand more clearly one of the building blocks
of halo intrinsic alignments: the large-scale tidal coherence.
On smaller scale, this ingredient should be convolved with
the complex response function of galaxies to this underly-
ing tidal correlations. Hence, it would be of great interest
to develop a hybrid framework combining the large-scale
tidal alignments modelled in this paper with galaxy response
functions that could be measured in hydrodynamical simu-
lations. This is however beyond the scope of this paper and
will be studied elsewhere.",8,CMR9,,687,62
"Let us also note that in this study we have not consid-
ered the build up of halo spin which also tends to align with
the cosmic web (Codis et al. 2012; Trowland et al. 2013;
Wang & Kang 2017, 2018; Ganeshaiah Veena et al. 2018).
This would require a better understanding of the shape of
protohaloes, although a simple proxy based on initial peak
shape following Codis et al. (2015b) could easily be used.
This will be the subject of future works.",8,CMR9,,447,61

"composition of the 3D oriented peak-peak correlation func-
tion. This is illustrated on the right-hand panel of Fig. A3
for a few separations. We also display on the left-hand panel
the Mollweide projection of the oriented peak-peak correla-
tion function at separation one and three smoothing lengths.
The structure we ﬁnd is quite similar to what was found for
peak patch haloes in the main text. At small separation,
the monopole is negative because there is an exclusion zone,
and all the other harmonics are negligible there because the
peak is locally close to isotropic (especially so for rare high
mass peaks). Then there is an increase with increasing sep-
aration as the anisotropic cosmic web starts to play a role.
The signal is largely dominated by the quadrupole as ex-
pected (due to the main ﬁlament) and it peaks at about 3
smoothing lengths – which corresponds to the typical sepa-
ration between the peaks – before decreasing for large sepa-
rations. Other harmonics up to",8,CMR9,,991,63

the correlation function along the major (cyan) and minor
(purple) axis on the right-hand panel. For comparison, we
also compute the isotropic peak-peak correlation function
and display it on the same plot with black dashed lines.
In this case, we used 170 millions draws of the ﬁelds per
spatial location. Interestingly, the result of this calculation
is qualitatively quite similar to the oriented halo cluster-
ing in Lagrangian space obtained in Fig. 4. Peaks cluster
along the major axis of the strain tensor mostly between
3 and 4 smoothing lengths from the central object which
is surrounded by an exclusion zone. Although qualitatively
correct, we cannot expect this simple model to be quanti-
tatively correct. It depends signiﬁcantly on the distribution
of peak heights we have chosen, hence on the mass. For in-
stance, as can be seen in Fig. A2, high peaks tend to be
more biased and more clustered. The size of the exclusion
zone is also sensitive to the width of the height distribution.
