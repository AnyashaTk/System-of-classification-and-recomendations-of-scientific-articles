"ABSTRACT
We propose a new model for treating solid-phase photoprocesses in interstellar ice
analogues. In this approach, photoionization and photoexcitation are included in more
detail, and the production of electronically-excited (suprathermal) species is explic-
itly considered.
In addition, we have included non-thermal, non-diﬀusive chemistry
to account for the low-temperature characteristic of cold cores. As an initial test of
our method, we have simulated two previous experimental studies involving the UV
irradiation of pure solid O",11,SFRM1200,,543,86
2,7,CMR8,,1,1
". In contrast to previous solid-state astrochemical model
calculations which have used gas-phase photoabsorption cross-sections, we have em-
ployed solid-state cross-sections in our calculations. This method allows the model to
be tested using well-constrained experiments rather than poorly constrained gas-phase
abundances in ISM regions. Our results indicate that inclusion of non-thermal reac-
tions and suprathermal species allows for reproduction of low-temperature solid-phase
photoprocessing that simulate interstellar ices within cold (",11,SFRM1200,,545,86

INTRODUCTION,11,SFRM1200,,12,12
"While gas-phase and surface reactions on bare carbonaceous or silicate dust grains contribute to
cosmic chemistry, the energetic processing of cosmic ices within dark, dense molecular clouds via pho-
tochemistry (initiated by non-ionizing radiation) and radiation chemistry (initiated by ionizing radi-
ation) is thought to be the dominant mechanism for the interstellar synthesis of prebiotic molecules
(see, for example, review: (Arumainayagam et al. 2019)). Rate-equation based modeling treatments
of UV-induced condensed-phase photochemistry have been moderately successful in reproducing the
abundances of complex organic molecules (COMs) observed toward hot cores/corinos (Shingledecker
et al. 2019b; Grassi et al. 2014; McElroy et al. 2013; Garrod 2013). However, recent detections of
several COMs (e.g., methyl formate (HCOOCH",11,SFRM1200,,834,102

Jiménez-Serra et al. 2016; Öberg et al. 2010), albeit in smaller abundance than in hot cores, have
led to the search for alternative mechanisms for complex molecule production through cold or non-
thermal mechanisms (Shingledecker et al. 2018; Vasyunin et al. 2017). A recent radiolysis-related
computational study (Shingledecker et al. 2019b) has provided an explanation for the unprecedented
observations of chemical synthesis at temperatures as low as 10 K in starless and prestellar cores. In
this modiﬁed bulk-chemistry method involving radiolysis by cosmic rays, radicals produced within
the ice are considered to be trapped and attempt to react with a neighbor with approximately every
vibration. In the study described herein, we use this non-diﬀusive mechanism to revise the treatment
of solid-phase photoprocesses in astrochemical models to account for the complex organics observed
in cold cores. A recent study by Jin & Garrod (2020) utilizes a non-diﬀusive rate-based model which
demonstrates the dependence of COM production on non-diﬀusive reactions between radicals and ice
species in cold astrochemical environments and achieves considerable success in reproducing observa-
tions toward prestellar core L1544. In contrast to that study, the model presented here incorporates
(1) the detailed inclusion of photoionization and photoexcitation, and (2) explicit consideration of
the production and reaction of electronically excited radicals (suprathermal species).",11,SFRM1200,,1584,102

high photon-ﬂux laser experiments which may involve multi-photon processes, photochemistry is
subject to the Bunsen-Roscoe law, which states that the photochemical yield is directly proportional
to dose, irrespective of dose rate; this law allows for extrapolation from laboratory experiments to
real astrochemical predictions, though even these low-ﬂux experiments utilize ﬂuxes much higher
than those experienced by ice in dark, dense molecular clouds.",11,SFRM1200,,576,100
"Astrochemical models provide a critical link between the fundamental chemical information revealed
by laboratory experiments and predictions and observations of chemical abundances in the interstellar
medium. Most models utilize a rate-based approach due to the convenience and speed of that
method, though Monte Carlo models have been used to more accurately simulate processes such as the
catastrophic impact of high energy radiation or multi-layer interactions (Cuppen et al. 2017; Öberg
2016). Because all such simulations involving reaction networks and rate-equations are extremely
sensitive to input parameters, these models generally become more successful as parameters are
better constrained by laboratory experiments. Abundances of several COMs in hot cores/corinos
are well reproduced by modern rate-equation-based computational models, which include a coupled
gas-phase and grain-surface chemistry or three-phase (gas, surface, and bulk) chemistry (Cuppen
et al. 2017).",11,SFRM1200,,982,101

"10 K) cores, however, are generally underpredicted. Most astro-
chemical models that include bulk-phase processes require thermal diﬀusion before reaction (Cuppen
et al. 2017); however, in the low-temperature conditions of starless and prestellar cores, this ther-
mal motion within the bulk ice is not feasible. Several explanations for the formation of COMs in
cold dense cores have been proposed, including: (1) photo-processing followed by reactive desorp-
tion (Watanabe & Kouchi 2002; Chuang et al. 2017; Aikawa et al. 2008; Herbst & van Dishoeck
2009; Jin & Garrod 2020), (2) gas-phase reactions (Balucani et al. 2015; Codella et al. 2020), and
(3) astrophysical-shock-catalyzed chemistry (James et al. 2020), (4) methanol reactive desorption on
CO-rich ices (within the catastrophic CO-freeze-out zone of pre-stellar cores), followed by gas-phase
chemistry (Vasyunin et al. 2017). The model presented herein instead assumes that reactive species

importance of considering fast non-thermal reactions in these systems (Shingledecker et al. 2019b).
In what follows, we apply this assumption to the case of photon irradiation of cosmic-ice analogues.
The model, as utilized in this work, includes only photon-initiated ice processing, including both
excitation and ionization events. Cations produced via ionization are assumed to quickly recombine
with a secondary electron, resulting in the electronically excited parent molecule, which can then
dissociate into electronically-excited products. Models such as ours are essential for interpreting

"In our model, species in the selvedge can, in principle, desorb both thermally as well as following
exothermic association reactions, with the latter being treated by the method of Garrod (2008) with
a standard eﬃciency of 1%. To mimic the Gerakines experiments where such desorption would be
inhibited due to the presence of a capping noble gas layer, thermal, chemical, and photodesorption
processes were disabled in our models. The ices studied by Raut and coworkers lacked such a noble gas
cap, and thus some amount of desorption would have occurred during the course of the experiment.
However, given the fairly low temperature (22 K) of the bulk ice, we assume that thermal desorption
is negligible over the timescale of the experiment. Moreover, photodesorption for the Raut et al.
experiments was also disabled, since the desorption rate is not well constrained (Fayolle et al. 2013;
Bulak et al. 2020) and our focus for this study was, in any case, the chemistry occurring",11,SFRM1200,,981,102

"While the current model provides reasonable agreement with the ﬁndings of the considered exper-
iments, a number of areas could be addressed in future studies that could increase both agreement
with empirical data as well as the underlying physical realism of the simulation. As mentioned, the
focus of this work has been on processes occurring in the mantles of thin ice ﬁlms similar to those
that coat interstellar dust grains, all of which were optically thin, and thus, we have not considered
the eﬀects of extinction that would be of particular importance in optically thick ices. To investigate
this eﬀect in more detail, a multi-layer model which more explicitly treats the vertical structure of ice
mantles, such as the macroscopic Monte Carlo code described in Vasyunin & Herbst (2013), would
be more appropriate.",11,SFRM1200,,822,105
"Moreover, given the focus of this study on bulk chemistry, we have not considered photodesorption
processes occurring in the top several monolayers of the ice. Current values used in models for these
kinds of processes are not well constrained, however, our method of directly simulating laboratory
experiments using astrochemical codes represents a promising means by which suitable values could
be obtained.",11,SFRM1200,,409,101
"Additionally, it is known that the absorption of photons of diﬀerent energies will change both the
eﬃciency and products of photo-processes (Fayolle et al. 2013, 2011; Fillion et al. 2014). Absent

the role of low-energy electrons is not signiﬁcant in this study. To simulate the eﬀects of secondary UV

temperatures of cold cores. Ultimately it would be fruitful to incorporate these types of rate-based
photoprocessing calculations into models that account for atom addition, gas-phase reactions, and
cosmic-ray bombardment. Such models, together with observations and laboratory simulations, are
necessary for a fundamental understanding of interstellar chemistry which is the likely source of
