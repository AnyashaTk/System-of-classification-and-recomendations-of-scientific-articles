"ter would be high enough for the gas to cool and initiate
a high star formation rate in galaxies. It is widely sus-
pected that AGN feedback is the mechanism that sup-
presses such cooling ﬂows (Balogh et al. 2001; Vernaleo
& Reynolds 2006; Peterson & Fabian 2006; McNamara",9,CMR10,,273,57
"& Nulsen 2007; Fabian 2012). For example, AGN can
quench star formation by preventing the gas from cool-
ing (thermal feedback), stirring the gas, or by expelling
the gas from the galaxy completely (kinetic feedback)
(Ishibashi & Fabian 2012). Since the hot ICM repre-
sents most of the baryonic mass of a cluster, AGN feed-
back can have a profound impact on the formation and
evolution of massive galaxies (Silk & Rees 1998; Croton
et al. 2006; Nyland et al. 2018).",9,CMR10,,467,57
"The radio lobes have high pressure, from both the rel-
ativistic electrons and magnetic ﬁeld, assuming that the
energy density of the magnetic ﬁeld is within an order of
magnitude from equipartition (e.g. Kronberg 2004). The
degree of linear polarization of the synchrotron emission",9,CMR10,,282,57

Johnston et al.,9,CMCSC10,,15,15
"is of interest because it reveals ordering of the magnetic
ﬁeld structure on large scales (Burn 1966). The orienta-
tion of a source with respect to the line of sight inﬂuences
which part of the source is most polarized. This may be
due to the projection of the mean magnetic ﬁeld on the
plane of the sky, or a result of the Laing-Garrington
eﬀect (Laing 1988; Garrington et al. 1988). The polar-
ization of extra-galactic sources may also be related to
other properties of the source structure, including the
prominence of jets, hot spots and extended lobes. The
accretion mode of the central engine (O’Sullivan et al.
2017), and opacity of compact components (Farnes et al.
2014a) have been proposed as physical attributes of the
source that aﬀect polarization of the integrated emis-
sion. Depolarization by intervening gas-rich systems has
been suggested as a contributing factor (e.g. Farnes et al.
2014b).",9,CMR10,,911,60

"Stacking is a technique to detect the mean or median
signal of a sample of sources if the individual sources, or
a signiﬁcant fraction of the sample, cannot be detected
individually. Samples of galaxies selected from optical or
infrared surveys, have been stacked at radio wavelengths",9,CMR10,,284,59

types of sources, for which it is impractical to do deep
observations of each source.",9,CMR10,,256,57

catalog can be selected from the total intensity radio
survey, while stacking is performed on the polarization
data from the same survey. When combining a large
sample of unrelated sources, stacking the Stokes param-

random distribution of polarization angles. Stacking is
mostly done on images of polarized intensity. This cre-

"One of the most powerful applications of stacking is to
compare the medians of samples selected from the same
survey, but distinguished by an independent selection
criterion that is related to a physical property of the
targets. In this paper, we stack polarized intensity for
samples of radio sources selected by total ﬂux density
and compactness. We ﬁnd very signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in the (raw) stacked polarized intensity as a function
of the compactness parameter
. The trend shown in
Figure 10 is found for all ﬂux bins.",9,CMR10,,524,56

noise about the median oﬀ-source position in the stacked

This is why the stacked image of a small sample of bright
sources appears noisier than the stacked image of a large

in Figure 10). The eﬀec-
