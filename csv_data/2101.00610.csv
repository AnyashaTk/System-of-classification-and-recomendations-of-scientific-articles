INTRODUCTION,10,CMBX10,,12,12
While multi-messenger astronomy has recently recorded major breakthroughs such as the,11,CMR12,,85,85
ﬁrst joint observations of high-energy neutrinos and electromagnetic radiation from a single,11,CMR12,,92,92
"source [1], the interior and exterior of the Sun have been detected through several messengers",11,CMR12,,94,94
for decades. Both the quiescent and the active phases of the corona are studied through,11,CMR12,,87,87
"the electromagnetic radiation emitted across the entire spectrum. However, in the neutrino",11,CMR12,,90,90
"search presented in this paper, we only focus on the gamma rays produced by high-energy",11,CMR12,,87,87
protons that are accelerated in solar ﬂares and subsequently collide with dense layers of the,11,CMR12,,93,93
"solar atmosphere. These gamma rays can be detected, e.g. by the Fermi-LAT satellite [2, 3],",11,CMR12,,91,91
which signiﬁcantly increased the fraction of solar ﬂares detected in the high-energy range.,11,CMR12,,91,91
"So far, solar neutrinos have only been detected in the MeV range being produced by",11,CMR12,,82,82
fusion reactions in the core of the Sun. Large neutrino telescopes have recently started to,11,CMR12,,91,91
"search for solar atmospheric neutrinos [4], which are created by the collisions of high-energy",11,CMR12,,94,94
cosmic rays colliding with the solar atmosphere [5–8]. While only upper limits have been,11,CMR12,,88,88
"established so far, the observation of this ﬂux would allow us to probe solar magnetic ﬁeld",11,CMR12,,91,91

"the solar atmosphere or deﬂected by the solar magnetic ﬁeld, the ﬂux reaching the Earth",11,CMR12,,87,87

by IceCube [9]. The variations in the shadow can be used to constrain the solar coronal,11,CMR12,,87,87
magnetic ﬁeld [10].,11,CMR12,,19,19
"In addition to the aforementioned emissions that are expected to be continuous in time,",11,CMR12,,87,87
transient neutrino emissions could be produced by solar ﬂares. Despite several searches since,11,CMR12,,93,93
"the late eighties [11–14], no signiﬁcant neutrino signal from solar ﬂares has been conﬁrmed to",11,CMR12,,94,94

"gin: being inherent products of high-energy proton collisions in the chromosphere, neutrinos",11,CMR12,,92,92
represent a direct probe of the proton acceleration. Theoretical investigation [15–17] have,11,CMR12,,91,91
demonstrated that this neutrino ﬂux could extend from MeV up to a few GeV in energy.,11,CMR12,,84,84
Focusing on the high-energy component of the solar ﬂare neutrino spectrum would allow us,11,CMR12,,88,88
to probe the proton acceleration up to the highest energies that can be reached within the,11,CMR12,,90,90
solar ﬂare environment.,11,CMR12,,23,23
This paper describes ﬁrst the scientiﬁc motivation for and the associated production,11,CMR12,,84,84
mechanism of the GeV neutrinos in solar ﬂares. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory used,11,CMR12,,84,84
for this search was built to detect neutrinos with energies larger than 10 GeV. A new analysis,11,CMR12,,94,94
approach developed for this study allows for the measurement of neutrinos at the single GeV,11,CMR12,,91,91
"energy scale. In Section III, we present the scheme of how we select a special class of solar",11,CMR12,,93,93
ﬂares for this study based on the tight link existing between gamma rays and neutrinos. The,11,CMR12,,91,91

III. SELECTION OF SOLAR FLARES,10,CMBX10,,30,30
"Following Eq. (1), one ﬁnds that pion production generates both neutrino and gamma-",11,CMR12,,83,83
ray emissions. We focus only on solar ﬂares that must emit neutrinos at some level and use,11,CMR12,,90,90
the gamma-ray observations to pick the most relevant candidates for our neutrino search.,11,CMR12,,88,88
These are indications that pion-decay products dominate the gamma-ray spectrum above,11,CMR12,,84,84
"100 MeV [22], an energy that Fermi-LAT has the ability to detect. A spectral analysis",11,CMR12,,85,85
conﬁrms that the major contribution of the Fermi-LAT observations was indeed consistent,11,CMR12,,87,87
with pion decay emissions [23].,11,CMR12,,31,31
We assume that the neutrino emission is coincident in time with signiﬁcant pion decay,11,CMR12,,85,85
signals detected in Fermi-LAT during solar ﬂares. This leads to a signiﬁcant diﬀerence,11,CMR12,,86,86
"to previous solar ﬂare samples [13, 14] that were based on the X-ray ﬂux. For example,",11,CMR12,,86,86

1,7,CMR8,,1,1
[24].,11,CMR12,,5,5
The light curve recorded by X-ray devices and by Fermi-LAT usually shows a short high-,11,CMR12,,86,86
intensity peak on top of a lower baseline ﬂux with an underlying period [22]. An example of,11,CMR12,,91,91
such a ﬂare is shown in Fig. 3. The peak is referred to as the,11,CMR12,,62,62
impulsive phase,11,CMTI12,,15,15
. The analysis,11,CMR12,,14,14
of the gamma rays detected during these impulsive short phases reveals a relatively hard,11,CMR12,,88,88
"initial proton spectrum, with a spectral index around 3 [20]. In contrast, the long duration",11,CMR12,,92,92
emissions manifest themselves in a softer proton spectral index (typically between 4 and 6),11,CMR12,,91,91
and a spread of the gamma-ray emission over several hours. Focusing on the impulsive phase,11,CMR12,,90,90
of bright events of the 24,11,CMR12,,26,26
th,7,CMR8,,2,2
solar cycle allows one to minimize the background integrated in,11,CMR12,,63,63
the neutrino telescope and to thus increase the chance of a neutrino detection in coincidence,11,CMR12,,93,93
with solar ﬂares.,11,CMR12,,17,17
These criteria applied to the ﬁrst Fermi-LAT Solar ﬂare catalog [3] resulted in a list of,11,CMR12,,89,89
5 promising candidates for our neutrino search. The details of each analyzed solar ﬂare are,11,CMR12,,91,91
reported in Table I. The choice of the time window and duration of each solar ﬂare was made,11,CMR12,,91,91
in view of maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio in IceCube. We started from the maximum,11,CMR12,,87,87
1,6,CMR7,,1,1
This number has been obtained by counting the number of solar ﬂares detected by Fermi-LAT between,9,CMR10,,97,97
2011 and 2015 and the number of M and X-class ﬂares. The ﬁeld of view of Fermi-LAT allows for,9,CMR10,,93,93

NEUTRINOS,10,CMBX10,,9,9
The IceCube Neutrino Observatory consists of a cubic kilometer of instrumented ice,11,CMR12,,82,82
"located at the South Pole, 2 km below the surface [25]. Completed in December 2010, the",11,CMR12,,87,87
"detector is made of 86 vertical strings, with 60 digital optical modules, or DOMs, each. The",11,CMR12,,92,92
strings have an average horizontal spacing of 125 m while the DOMs are located every 17 m,11,CMR12,,89,89
"along the instrumented portion of the string. A sub-detector, named DeepCore, is installed",11,CMR12,,90,90
at the center of the array as shown in Fig. 4. Characterized by smaller spacings between,11,CMR12,,88,88
strings (,11,CMR12,,9,9

Individual neutrino interactions in the MeV range produce a signal too dim,11,CMR12,,74,74
"to identify individual events, but the large ﬂux emitted during a close-by supernova would",11,CMR12,,90,90
"lead to a detectable coherent rise in the individual hit rates of the DOMs. In this paper,",11,CMR12,,90,90
we apply the principle used for MeV core collapse supernova neutrinos to the GeV energy,11,CMR12,,87,87
range in order to search for neutrinos from solar ﬂares. This is explained in more detail in,11,CMR12,,92,92
the next section.,11,CMR12,,17,17
V. OPTIMIZED SEARCH FOR GEV NEUTRINO INTERACTIONS,10,CMBX10,,49,49
"Before this analysis was developed, neutrino searches in IceCube were possible in the MeV",11,CMR12,,89,89
range by the use of the Supernova Data Acquisition system and starting at around 10 GeV,11,CMR12,,87,87
for neutrino oscillation studies in DeepCore [25]. We introduce a novel selection procedure,11,CMR12,,91,91
that enables us to cover part of the gap between these two energy ranges. The general idea,11,CMR12,,90,90
of the analysis is to monitor the rate of GeV-like events in IceCube and to search for an,11,CMR12,,89,89
"increase in this rate during an astrophysical transient, as for example a solar ﬂare. While",11,CMR12,,91,91
"the principle is similar to the one in use for MeV supernova neutrino searches, the neutrino",11,CMR12,,92,92
ﬂux produced by solar ﬂares is expected to be several orders of magnitude below the one,11,CMR12,,87,87
of Galactic core-collapse supernovae. The Supernova Data Acquisition system could not be,11,CMR12,,88,88
used for our purpose; we focus on events that have triggered the data taking in IceCube.,11,CMR12,,88,88
The new event selection has been developed in a data-driven way following a blind pro-,11,CMR12,,86,86
cedure. We have used several hours of IceCube data recorded when no solar ﬂare had been,11,CMR12,,87,87

that have recorded a signal during a time window of about 12,11,CMR12,,60,60

s around the event. The,11,CMR12,,23,23
size of the points represent the intensity of Cherenkov light that was detected.,11,CMR12,,80,80
detected on either side of the solar disk. In order to determine the time period when such,11,CMR12,,90,90
"data were available, we compared the observations by the X-ray instrument GOES [24] and",11,CMR12,,87,87
"Fermi-LAT [2], which is sensitive to gamma rays. We have also used the observations of the",11,CMR12,,90,90
"STEREO-A and STEREO-B satellites that observe the hidden side of the Sun and detect,",11,CMR12,,84,84
"among others, energetic particles arising from the Sun [30]. In addition to these oﬀ-time",11,CMR12,,89,89
"data, we have simulated various classes of events to understand the behavior of the selection",11,CMR12,,93,93
15,11,CMR12,,2,2
to diﬀerent types of events present in data. We use CORSIKA [31] and GENIE [32] to,11,CMR12,,82,82
"simulate atmospheric muons and neutrinos respectively, and a noise event generator based",11,CMR12,,88,88
on an empirical model consisting of three noise components inherent to IceCube DOMs: un-,11,CMR12,,88,88
"correlated thermal noise, uncorrelated radioactive noise, and correlated scintillation noise.",11,CMR12,,93,93
"Finally, signal-like neutrino interactions were generated with GENIE by selecting events with",11,CMR12,,93,93
an energy between 500 MeV and 5 GeV that arrive from the observed declination range of,11,CMR12,,86,86
"the Sun at the South Pole, i.e. [-23, 23] degrees. We note that various neutrino interaction",11,CMR12,,92,92
"processes are included in the simulation - deep inelastic scattering, quasi-elastic scattering,",11,CMR12,,95,95
"resonant production - which all contribute substantially to the total interaction rate, as well",11,CMR12,,95,95
as scattering that contributes only marginally.,11,CMR12,,47,47
The event selection is discussed in detail below. It can be divided into three main steps:,11,CMR12,,90,90
"removal of high-energy events from the sample, reduction of the contribution from events",11,CMR12,,88,88
"triggered by noise, and the increase of the purity of the ﬁnal sample.",11,CMR12,,70,70
A. Removing High-Energy Events,10,CMBX10,,30,30
"The ﬁrst step of the event selection aims at reducing the number of high-energy events,
in this work understood as neutrinos with an energy",11,CMR12,,139,87
,11,MSAM10,,0,0
"5 GeV, from the data sample be-",11,CMR12,,31,31
cause we expect solar ﬂares to produce neutrinos only up to a few GeV. The main diﬀerence,11,CMR12,,89,89
between an event with arbitrarily high energy and a GeV neutrino interaction is the amount,11,CMR12,,90,90
"of light emitted in the ice, as shown in Fig. 5. We use available data streams (“software",11,CMR12,,89,89
ﬁlters”) that have been developed to tag speciﬁc kind of events such as high energy muons,11,CMR12,,89,89
"or cascades. As depicted in Fig. 5(d), our events activate a small number of DOMs and",11,CMR12,,85,85
are thus not expected to pass any of the ﬁlters designed to tag high-energy interactions.,11,CMR12,,89,89
"To be part of our event sample, an event therefore has to pass the ﬁlter that selects events",11,CMR12,,92,92
contained in DeepCore and fail all other ﬁlter conditions. An exception is made for two,11,CMR12,,87,87
"ﬁlters: one targeting low-energy neutrinos coming from the Northern sky, and the one that",11,CMR12,,89,89
"uses parts of the detector as veto against incoming muon events, as both subsequent samples",11,CMR12,,91,91
contain low-energy events [25]. This combination of ﬁlters results in a signiﬁcant reduction,11,CMR12,,92,92
of the number of atmospheric muons: the event rate after applying this ﬁlter selection is,11,CMR12,,89,89
of the order of 15 Hz while the original rate was around 1400 Hz. More than 98% of the,11,CMR12,,86,86
simulated neutrino events between 500 MeV and 5 GeV pass this ﬁlter selection.,11,CMR12,,78,78
16,11,CMR12,,2,2
The number of HLC hits in IceCube and DeepCore strings is small for low-energy neutrino,11,CMR12,,87,87
"events, while background events from atmospheric muons and neutrinos are typically charac-",11,CMR12,,90,90
terized by a large number of HLC hits in the detector. We can therefore impose a constraint,11,CMR12,,91,91
on the maximum number of HLC hits allowed in DeepCore and the strings outside DeepCore,11,CMR12,,86,86
to remove high-energy events from our sample. More stringent constraints on the number,11,CMR12,,86,86
of HLC hits in IceCube strings do not improve the signal over noise ratio of the selection,11,CMR12,,90,90
because of noise hits on the considered strings present in both signal and background events.,11,CMR12,,93,93
The number of hits that share a causal connection inside an event can also be used as a,11,CMR12,,87,87
parameter for the amount of light emitted in the detector as a consequence of the neutrino,11,CMR12,,90,90
interaction. We use an algorithm designed to select sets of hits most likely connected to the,11,CMR12,,93,93
same physical interaction and therefore unrelated to dark noise. The algorithm selects hits,11,CMR12,,91,91
that have at least one other hit within a sphere of radius,11,CMR12,,58,58
R,11,CMMI12,,1,1
= 150 m and within a time,11,CMR12,,25,25
window of ∆,11,CMR12,,11,11
T,11,CMMI12,,1,1
"= 1000 ns called Single R-T hits, or SRT hits hereafter. The constraints",11,CMR12,,72,72
listed in Table II lower the data rate to about 5.5 Hz while keeping 98% of the simulated,11,CMR12,,89,89
signal events in the sample.,11,CMR12,,28,28
B. Minimizing the Contribution of Pure Noise,10,CMBX10,,44,44
Noise triggers occur with relatively few hits and no preferred direction. Figure 5(c),11,CMR12,,85,85
represents a typical noise event satisfying the SMT-3 trigger condition and passing the ﬁlter,11,CMR12,,93,93
selection previously described. Accidental triggers by pure noise constitute a signiﬁcant,11,CMR12,,89,89
background for low-energy interactions such as the ones illustrated in Fig. 5(d). The IceCube,11,CMR12,,93,93
Collaboration has developed an algorithm able to identify and eliminate noise signals. The,11,CMR12,,90,90
algorithm searches for a preferential direction in pairs of hits to classify the event as being,11,CMR12,,95,95
"of physics origin. In practice, an event is classiﬁed as",11,CMR12,,56,56
physics,11,CMTI12,,7,7
"if it contains, during a certain",11,CMR12,,32,32

"e.g., [33]). The algorithm has a Boolean output with TRUE attributed to physics-like events",11,CMR12,,91,91
and a likely noise event corresponds to FALSE. This optimization allows one to diﬀerentiate,11,CMR12,,91,91
17,11,CMR12,,2,2
noise from 10-100 GeV neutrino interactions. In order to be eﬀective for our lower energy,11,CMR12,,89,89
"events, we have re-optimized the method. We have applied the algorithm for each possible",11,CMR12,,88,88
set of parameters and constructed combinations of these sets that maximize the signal to,11,CMR12,,88,88
noise ratio. We request an output FALSE for sets of variables speciﬁcally targeting small,11,CMR12,,89,89
"apparent speed in a long time window (e.g., [800 s, 0 , 0.00 m/ns, 0.10 m/ns]) as these",11,CMR12,,87,87
"parameters correspond to scattered hits. On the contrary, the sets for which a TRUE",11,CMR12,,83,83
output is required to pass the selection lead to a sample dominated by high apparent speed,11,CMR12,,90,90
"in a short time window, i.e. unscattered hits (e.g., [100 s, 2, 0.20 m/ns, 0.90 m/ns]).",11,CMR12,,87,87
The data rate is about 0.2 Hz after applying the two combinations of parameter sets shown,11,CMR12,,89,89
"in Table II. For comparison, the noise rate is estimated to be around 0.12 Hz. More than",11,CMR12,,88,88

", respectively. A study of these oﬀ-time data showed that the number",11,CMR12,,68,68
of events recorded in short time windows were consistent with a Poisson distribution.,11,CMR12,,85,85
The leading systematic uncertainties in this analysis arise from our limited understanding,11,CMR12,,90,90
of the optical properties of the surrounding ice. We studied in particular the impact of the,11,CMR12,,92,92
DOM eﬃciency and the scattering length in the ice directly surrounding the DOM. This is,11,CMR12,,87,87
the ice in the approximately 60 cm diameter bore hole that refroze after the DOMs were,11,CMR12,,86,86
deployed. The DOM eﬃciency impact study was carried out using a conservative variation,11,CMR12,,86,86
of,11,CMR12,,2,2
±,11,CMSY10,,1,1
10% of the quantum eﬃciency of the photocathodes in the simulation of low-energy,11,CMR12,,80,80
"neutrino interactions. Two diﬀerent scattering lengths (namely, 100 cm and 50 cm) were",11,CMR12,,86,86
used in simulations to assess the corresponding eﬀect on low-energy interaction detection.,11,CMR12,,90,90
We concluded that the uncertainty on each parameter would lead to a number of low energy,11,CMR12,,88,88
events within 20% of the nominal value. As a GeV neutrino interaction needs to happen,11,CMR12,,85,85
"close from a DOM to trigger the data taking, the uncertainties on the light absorption and",11,CMR12,,90,90
scattering in the bulk ice will have a negligible impact compared to the two other systematic,11,CMR12,,93,93
eﬀects previously mentioned.,11,CMR12,,28,28
The passing rate of GeV neutrino events is of the order of 40 % and shows only a small,11,CMR12,,86,86
"zenith dependence (see Fig. 6). Therefore, the event selection previously described can be",11,CMR12,,90,90

"As shown in Table I, the optimized time window for our neutrino search only contains",11,CMR12,,84,84
a fraction of the observed gamma-ray light curve. Since this analysis assumes that the,11,CMR12,,86,86
"neutrinos are emitted jointly with the gamma rays, we assume our time windows contain",11,CMR12,,85,85
the same fractions of the total neutrino emission. We therefore take these fractions into,11,CMR12,,89,89
account when comparing with theoretical predictions. The limits presented in Table III,11,CMR12,,86,86
constrain the integrated neutrino ﬂux emitted during the considered time window.,11,CMR12,,80,80
We note that similar number of events and fractions of the light curves are observed for,11,CMR12,,88,88
"the events of March 7th, February 25th and September 1st (see Table III). This is reﬂected",11,CMR12,,90,90
in the similar upper limits set for these events. Approximatively half of this fraction is,11,CMR12,,90,90
"contained in the short ﬂare of September 10th, which explains the apparent lower upper",11,CMR12,,86,86
"limit. Finally, the September 6th ﬂare targets the long duration emission that lasted for",11,CMR12,,89,89
"several hours, as previously mentioned. The origin of a such temporally extended emission",11,CMR12,,89,89
"is still under investigation [3], and therefore cannot, at the moment, be compared with the",11,CMR12,,91,91

is the integrated neutrino ﬂux between,11,CMR12,,38,38
"500 MeV and 5 GeV. The upper limit obtained from the Sept 10th, 2017 event is shown",11,CMR12,,83,83
"in Fig. 7 together with its systematic uncertainties. In Fig. 7, the obtained upper limit is",11,CMR12,,92,92
"compared to two predictions [16, 17]. The diﬀerence between these two predictions comes",11,CMR12,,87,87
from diﬀerent assumptions on the proton ﬂux accelerated by the solar ﬂare: the total energy,11,CMR12,,91,91
released by the magnetic reconnection is converted into protons that subsequently produce,11,CMR12,,89,89
"pions producing neutrinos is considered in [17], while only a small fraction of the released",11,CMR12,,92,92
"energy, consistent with the estimates based on Fermi-LAT observations, is used in [16]. To",11,CMR12,,90,90
"put the result into context, we estimated the corresponding normalization factor if more",11,CMR12,,88,88
energy should go to the accelerated proton ﬂux for the latter model. The experimental up-,11,CMR12,,89,89
per limit constrains the prediction made in [17] when assuming an average neutrino energy,11,CMR12,,89,89
of 140 MeV. The still optimistic 500 MeV line is slightly below the reach of the current,11,CMR12,,88,88
"sensitivity. The second prediction [16], however, is far below the current reach of IceCube,",11,CMR12,,92,92
even when assuming the entire energy released during the solar ﬂare goes to protons that,11,CMR12,,88,88
subsequently produce pions. Similar results have been obtained for the other solar ﬂares in,11,CMR12,,91,91
"Table I and are discussed in [16, 36].",11,CMR12,,38,38
VII. OUTLOOK,10,CMBX10,,12,12
"In this paper, we presented the ﬁrst results from a search for neutrinos coincident with",11,CMR12,,88,88
solar ﬂares using IceCube. This was possible with the development of a new low-energy,11,CMR12,,85,85
selection that allows IceCube to be sensitive to,11,CMR12,,48,48

"analyses may be carried out on other types of transient sources, such as compact binary",11,CMR12,,87,87
"mergers, fast-radio bursts, or novae.",11,CMR12,,37,37
