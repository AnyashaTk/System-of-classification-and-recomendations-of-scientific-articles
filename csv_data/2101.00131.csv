ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations including ambipolar diﬀusion and Ohmic dissipation. The dynamical",9,CMR10,,227,117
"contraction of the pre-stellar core ultimately leads to the formation of a ﬁrst hydrostatic core, after ambipolar",9,CMR10,,113,113
"diﬀusion decouples the magnetic ﬁeld from the predominantly neutral gas. The hydrostatic core accumulates angular
momentum from the infalling material, evolving into a rotationally supported torus; this ‘ﬁrst hydrostatic torus’ then
forms an accreting protostar and a rotationally supported disc. The disc spreads out by gravitational instability,
3 kyr after protostar formation. The total mass and angular momentum of the
reaching
protostar-disc system are determined mainly by accretion of gas from an infalling pseudo-disc, which has low speciﬁc
angular momentum because of magnetic braking; their removal from the protostar-disc system by outﬂow and disc
magnetic braking are negligible, in part because the magnetic ﬁeld is poorly coupled there. The redistribution of
angular momentum within the protostar-disc system is facilitated mainly by gravitational instability; this allows
formation of relatively large discs even when the speciﬁc angular momentum of infalling material is low. We argue
that such discs should remain marginally unstable as they grow (with Toomre",9,CMR10,,1077,118

1.1 Motivation and observations of protostellar discs,8,CMB10,,53,53
"The formation and subsequent evolution of protostellar ac-
cretion discs are very important events in the star-formation
process. Not only do protostellar discs modulate mass accre-
tion onto young stellar objects and ultimately aﬀect stellar
properties such as mass and initial magnetic ﬂux, but also
they are directly responsible for establishing the initial con-
ditions for the formation of planets.",8,CMR9,,403,63
"The initial conditions for the star- and disc-formation
processes have been observed extensively in molecular line
emission (Myers & Benson 1983; Jijina et al. 1999; Caselli
et al. 2002),
infrared absorption (Teixeira et al. 2005;

2000; Crutcher et al. 2004; Girart et al. 2006; Maury et al.
2018; Auddy et al. 2019). For the later stages of star forma-
tion, high-quality observations of circumstellar discs after the
dispersal of the pre-stellar envelope (e.g., Class II protostel-
lar discs, or protoplanetary discs) have provided constraints
on disc size, mass, and structure (e.g., Andrews & Williams
2007; Andrews et al. 2013; Pi´etu et al. 2014; Ansdell et al.
2018; Andrews et al. 2018).",8,CMR9,,527,64

"The current state of observation makes now a good time
for simulations of protostellar disc formation and evolution
through the Class 0/I phase, as physical insights obtained
from simulations are crucial for interpreting observed trends
and understanding the physical picture of disc formation.",8,CMR9,,294,61
1.2 Physics and simulations of protostellar disc formation,8,CMB10,,58,58
and evolution,8,CMB10,,13,13
"There is now a large family of simulations that touch on var-
ious aspects of protostellar disc formation (see Zhao et al.
2020a for a review). The formation of a rotationally supported
protostellar disc is a natural consequence of the pre-stellar
core hosting a ﬁnite amount of angular momentum. The",8,CMR9,,300,62
"source of angular momentum can be inherited from (slow)
rotation of the core, injected by turbulence in the molecular
cloud (Seifried et al. 2012; Joos et al. 2013), or generated
during the infall of a core with an asymmetric density proﬁle
(Verliat et al. 2020). In hydrodynamic simulations, conserva-
tion of angular momentum produces large, massive discs (e.g.,
Bate 2018). In reality, however, the presence of a magnetic
ﬁeld leads to magnetic braking, which can remove most of the
initial angular momentum of a pre-stellar core (Mouschovias
& Paleologou 1980; Basu & Mouschovias 1994).",8,CMR9,,590,61
"The eﬃcacy of magnetic braking depends on the strength
and orientation of the initial magnetic ﬂux (e.g., Basu &
Mouschovias 1995; Joos et al. 2012; Li et al. 2013; Mas-
son et al. 2016; Tsukamoto et al. 2018; Hirano et al. 2020),
as well as the strength of the non-ideal magnetic diﬀusiv-
ity (e.g., Mouschovias & Paleologou 1986; K¨onigl 1987; Li
et al. 2011; Dapp et al. 2012), which decouples the magnetic
ﬁeld from the poorly ionized gas. Generally, magnetic brak-
ing is weaker when the initial magnetic ﬁeld is energetically
weak, the misalignment between the magnetic ﬁeld and the
rotation axis is signiﬁcant and/or the magnetic diﬀusivity is
strong. These complex dependencies are compounded by the
fact that, amongst the three types of non-ideal eﬀects, Ohmic
dissipation and ambipolar diﬀusion reduce the eﬃciency of",8,CMR9,,827,61
"the braking, whereas the Hall eﬀect can either decrease or
increase the angular momentum of the infalling gas depend-
ing on whether the magnetic ﬁeld is aligned or anti-aligned
with the rotation axis and which species is the dominant cur-
rent carrier (Wardle & Ng 1999; Wardle 2004; Braiding &
Wardle 2012; Tsukamoto et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2020b). In
cores that are not initially rotating, the Hall eﬀect can even
induce rotation, although realistic values of Hall diﬀusion in
dense cores may not be large enough to produce rotation-
ally supported discs (Krasnopolsky et al. 2011). The exact
strength of magnetic diﬀusivity is also important, and it de-
pends on the level of ionization, which is related to the cosmic",8,CMR9,,723,64
"ray (CR) ionization rate as well as the abundance and size
distribution of dust grains (Zhao et al. 2018b), where low CR
ionization, less dust mass, and larger dust grain size generally
increase magnetic diﬀusivity. The initial dust proﬁle may be
inferred from observations, but during the collapse one gen-",8,CMR9,,307,64
"erally expects this distribution to change as grains coagulate
and drift through gas at size-dependent velocities (e.g., Guil-",8,CMR9,,126,63

", 1–20 (2020)",7,CMR8,,13,13
"let et al. 2020). However, there is only one protostellar disc
formation simulation to date that includes (part of) this kind
of active dust evolution (Lebreuilly et al. 2020), and the more
common practice is to use a (somewhat arbitrarily) modiﬁed
dust size distribution with small grains removed (e.g., Zhao
et al. 2018a).",8,CMR9,,324,63
"Finally, the thermal evolution of the disc may also be im-
portant. Relatively realistic modeling of the thermal evolu-
tion of the disc in MHD star-formation simulations using
radiative transfer is included in a few recent studies (e.g.,
Wurster et al. 2019), but it is not so clear whether the out-
come of disc formation is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the more
commonly used barotropic equation of state.",8,CMR9,,406,61
"Currently, there are no simulations that incorporate all of
the potentially relevant physics mentioned above, but recent
simulations are incorporating an increasingly large subset of
them. Through these simulations, we gain some understand-
ing of how the inclusion of various physics aﬀect disc forma-
tion. However, a clear physical picture of disc formation is still
lacking. More precisely, we do not fully understand what are",8,CMR9,,430,66
"the main mechanisms regulating the outcome of disc forma-
tion, and there is no simple way (other than to run a relatively
expensive simulation) to connect reliably and quantitatively
the initial conditions of a pre-stellar core to the eventual for-
mation of a rotationally supported accretion disc.",8,CMR9,,300,65
"Another issue present in many existing simulations is the
diﬃculty of performing numerically converged,
long-term
simulations. Here ‘long-term’ means simulating the system
until the pre-stellar envelope is largely or fully dispersed, cov-
ering most or all of Class 0/I phase. Such long-term simula-
tions are crucial for understanding observations in Class 0/I
systems as well as for connecting with observations and sim-
ulations of protoplanetary (Class II) discs. This diﬃculty is
essentially a problem of computational cost: the physics that
need to be modeled, such as non-ideal MHD, often put a very
stringent limit on the numerical timestep, and the real-world
time of the simulation scales sharply with resolution. Sim-
ulations that directly resolve the protostar show good con-
vergence, but can usually reach no more than 1–2 kyr after
protostar formation (e.g., Machida & Basu 2019). The com-
putational cost of long-term simulations can be reduced to an
acceptable level by signiﬁcantly reducing resolution around
the protostar, often to",8,CMR9,,1051,66
∼,8,CMSY9,,1,1
"1 au per cell or more (e.g., Tomida",8,CMR9,,35,35
"et al. 2017). However, simulations often fail to achieve good
numerical convergence at such low resolution, and behaviour
may depend heavily on how the inner boundary (or sink par-
ticle) is treated (Machida et al. 2014; Vorobyov et al. 2019;
Hennebelle et al. 2020; Wurster & Bate 2019). Additionally,
such simulations generally cannot vertically resolve a geomet-
rically thin disc, and it is questionable whether they can accu-
rately capture the transport of angular momentum within the
disc (e.g., disc spreading by gravitational instability), which
may be an important factor in determining disc size and mass.",8,CMR9,,616,64
1.3 Our goals,8,CMB10,,13,13
"In this series of studies, our main goals are to understand
better the physical picture of protostellar disc formation and
eventually to construct a simple, quantitative model that
links initial conditions to disc-formation outcomes and al-",8,CMR9,,240,62
"lows direct comparison with observations. We plan to work
towards these goals with a focus on three aspects.",8,CMR9,,108,57
"First, in terms of simulations, we plan to perform long-term
simulations of disc formation and evolution, and parameter
surveys covering a suﬃciently large parameter space. As men-
tioned in Section 1.2, keeping the computational cost of such
simulations reasonable while maintaining numerical accuracy
is a challenging task. However, we will show in this paper
that, with careful, physics-oriented modeling, one can achieve
numerical convergence with relatively low resolution. We also
note that, in order to obtain physically correct results, our
simulations may need to incorporate a large subset, if not
all, of the physical processes discussed in Section 1.2. In this
paper, we will leave out some of them (Hall eﬀect, radiative
transfer, dust evolution), but we plan on incorporating some
or all of these processes in future work.",8,CMR9,,836,64
"In terms of understanding the physical picture of disc for-
mation, we will carefully analyze our simulations with a focus
on identifying the relative importance of diﬀerent physical
mechanisms and exploring how the interplay between diﬀer-
ent mechanisms regulates (and puts physical constraints on)",8,CMR9,,300,62
"disc evolution. Physical insights and constraints obtained in
this fashion can then be compared against trends seen in ob-
servations (e.g., our discussion in",8,CMR9,,158,61
§,8,CMSY9,,1,1
7.3).,8,CMR9,,5,5
"Finally, in terms of modeling, we seek to develop either a
semi-analytic model for disc formation, or a set of sub-grid
models that would allow all important physics to be captured
in computationally inexpensive simulations with reduced di-
mensionality and/or low resolution. This requires physical
insights from the previous two eﬀorts, and could involve sim-
plifying the problem by ignoring relatively unimportant phys-
ical processes and by capturing the eﬀect of certain physical
processes or regulation mechanisms through (analytic or em-
pirical) parametrization.",8,CMR9,,571,61
1.4 This paper,8,CMB10,,14,14
"In this ﬁrst paper, we build a basic model including non-
ideal MHD eﬀects and use it to simulate the collapse of a
pre-stellar core until a few kyr after protostar formation. This
covers the formation and early evolution of a protostellar disc.
We show that numerical convergence is achieved through a
proper treatment of the inner boundary, and we motivate a
relatively simple physical picture for disc formation based on",8,CMR9,,423,64
"our simulation results. Future papers in this series will focus
mainly on incorporating additional physical processes in the
model (",8,CMR9,,132,63

surveys to understand any dependencies on physical parame-
ters, and making contact between our simulated protostellar
cores and discs and those now being increasingly imaged by
mm/sub-mm telescopes.",8,CMR9,,249,59
"This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present
our simulation setup. In Section 3, we provide an overview of
the qualitative evolution of our ﬁducial 3D simulation. We
then discuss the physical origin of the mass and angular-
momentum budget of the protostar-disc system in Section",8,CMR9,,294,61
"4 and how redistribution of angular momentum by gravita-
tional instability shapes the disc evolution in Section 5. Sec-
tion 6 concerns the numerical convergence of our solution

ary. We conclude in Section 7 with a summary of our physical",8,CMR9,,297,63

"To begin the discussion of our results, we ﬁrst provide an
overview of the evolution found in our ﬁducial 3D run. This",8,CMR9,,118,59
"run covers the evolution from an initially spherical pre-stellar
core all the way to a few kyr after protostar formation. Some
basic diagnostics of the simulation, including snapshots of
the density, velocity, and magnetic ﬁeld proﬁles at a number
of diﬀerent epochs, are summarized in Figs 1 and 2. The",8,CMR9,,303,64
"evolution can be roughly divided into three diﬀerent phases,
each of which are described in the following subsections.",8,CMR9,,118,60
Protostellar disc formation and evolution,11,CMTI12,,41,41
5,11,CMR12,,1,1
3.1 Pre-stellar ﬂattening and collapse,8,CMB10,,38,38
"The ﬁrst phase of the evolution involves the ﬂattening along
magnetic-ﬁeld lines and the dynamical contraction of the pre-
stellar core before the formation of the protostar. This covers
the ﬁrst",8,CMR9,,195,63
∼,8,CMSY9,,1,1
"1 Myr of evolution. The ﬁrst row of Fig. 1 and
the ﬁrst column of Fig. 2 show snapshots from some repre-
sentative epochs during this phase. The core is observed to
contract slowly under its own self gravity, and the magnetic
ﬁeld is dragged along by the collapsing core to acquire a clas-
sic hourglass shape (as in Fiedler & Mouschovias 1993). The
contraction perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld is slower than
the ﬂattening along the ﬁeld lines because of the additional
magnetic tension and pressure, and the core becomes signiﬁ-
cantly ﬂattened into a pseudo-disc.",8,CMR9,,568,63
"During this phase, the evolution of the density and mag-
netic ﬁeld are largely self-similar (Fig. 2). Due to the initially
slow rotation and further removal of angular momentum by
magnetic braking, the rotation of the core remains negligible.
Evolution during this phase is important for the mass and",8,CMR9,,301,66

will be discussed in more detail in Section 4.2 and 4.3.",8,CMR9,,114,57
3.2 The ﬁrst hydrostatic core/torus,8,CMB10,,35,35
"Around 1026 kyr, the central density exceeds the break-point
of the EoS, the temperature rises, and the ﬁrst hydrostatic
core forms. This time marks the formation of the protostar.
The ﬁrst hydrostatic core is initially approximately spherical
(see Fig. 1, ﬁrst panel in second row), matching the evolution
found previously in non-rotating simulations. However, the
core quickly evolves into a rotationally supported torus due
to its acquired angular momentum (Fig. 1, second and third
panels in second row; at this point the mass within the inner
boundary is much less than the torus mass). This feature has
also been observed in some previous high-resolution simula-
tions (e.g., Machida & Basu 2019) but has not been discussed
extensively.",8,CMR9,,742,62
"Just prior to the formation of the ﬁrst hydrostatic core,
the magnetic diﬀusivity increases signiﬁcantly as a result of
the high densities, which cause the gas-phase ions and elec-
trons to be quickly adsorbed onto grain surfaces (see Ap-
pendix B). This increases the ambipolar resistivity, which",8,CMR9,,297,61
"facilitates the decoupling of the magnetic ﬁeld from the pre-
dominantly neutral gas (Desch & Mouschovias 2001; Tassis &
Mouschovias 2007). As shown in the bottom center panel of

are also some diﬀerences in the initial conditions, including
our adoption of a stronger, near-critical initial magnetic ﬁeld,
which could lead to substantially weaker outﬂow as suggested
by results from Machida & Hosokawa (2013). Overall, it is
important to verify in future studies whether our result is
applicable over a broader range of initial parameters. Finally,
we note that, although observations of relatively high speciﬁc
angular momentum in outﬂows (e.g., Bjerkeli et al. 2016) are
sometimes used as evidence that outﬂows can remove a sig-
niﬁcant amount of angular momentum, this argument is not
grounded ﬁrmly unless the mass-loss rate by outﬂow and the
accretion rate of the disc are also known.",8,CMR9,,774,64
"For the remainder of this section, we focus only on the
pseudo-disc inﬂow (accretion), as it largely determines the
mass and angular-momentum budget of the protostar-disc
system. The exclusion of the other mechanisms, which are
often highly variable, greatly simpliﬁes the problem.",8,CMR9,,281,59

"important in the pseudo-disc but is always unimportant in the
protostellar disc. This is mainly because the density and col-
umn density in the protostellar disc are much higher than in
the pseudo-disc (for example, see Figs 1 and 2), which makes
the magnetic ﬁeld less well coupled and less dynamically im-
portant. The distinction between a dense, non-magnetized
disc and a thin, magnetized pseudo-disc has also been ob-
served, for instance, in Masson et al. (2016).",8,CMR9,,469,62

to advection with the mass accretion and outﬂow and does not con-

which produces the non-axisymmetric hydrodynamic ﬂux (blue)

leads to disc spreading, and is the main mechanism that al-
lows protostar accretion when outﬂow and magnetic braking
in the disc are weak.",8,CMR9,,435,61

spreading is that the disc can now have signiﬁcantly higher
speciﬁc angular momentum than the pseudo-disc inﬂow that

ature by balancing radiative cooling with heating through
spiral shocks and turbulence. This thermal self-regulation,
ﬁrst proposed by Paczynski (1978), is missing in our current
model due to the adoption of a barotropic EoS. In reality,
gravitational instability controls disc evolution through both
spreading (angular-momentum transport) and heating, and
they should be equally important. When the disc is in steady-
state, the rate of heating and angular-momentum transport
are comparable since both are proportional to the rate at
which gravitational instability extracts energy from diﬀeren-

"3). Here we summarize the main re-
sults of our simulations in terms of the physical picture of
disc formation and requirements for numerical convergence,
and discuss how our results connect to recent observational
estimates of protostellar disc masses. The robustness of our
results with respect to physical initial conditions and disc
chemistry will be evaluated in a parameter study in a subse-
quent publication.",8,CMR9,,416,60
7.1 Disc formation: a simple physical picture,8,CMB10,,45,45
"Broadly speaking, the formation and evolution of the pro-
tostellar disc is determined by two processes: the injection
of mass and angular momentum to (and the removal from)
the protostar-disc system, and the redistribution of angular
momentum within the protostar-disc system.",8,CMR9,,277,60
"Regarding the ﬁrst process, we ﬁnd that the mass and an-
gular momentum of the protostar-disc system is determined
mainly by injection from a pseudo-disc in near free-fall, whose
speciﬁc angular momentum is low due to magnetic braking
(",8,CMR9,,236,63
§,8,CMSY9,,1,1
"4). The removal of mass and angular momentum by outﬂow
and magnetic braking in the protostar-disc system is negli-",8,CMR9,,114,59
"gible (contrary to some earlier studies that may have under-
estimated magnetic diﬀusivity in disc), and there is barely
any feedback from the protostar-disc system that aﬀects the
pseudo-disc injection rate (",8,CMR9,,209,60
§,8,CMSY9,,1,1
"4.1,",8,CMR9,,4,4
§,8,CMSY9,,1,1
"6.1). In other words, disc
formation is hierarchical: the mass and angular-momentum
budget of the small scale (protostar-disc system) is solely
determined by large scale (collapse of pre-setllar core and
pseudo-disc evolution).",8,CMR9,,227,59
"Regarding the second process, we ﬁnd that the redistri-
bution of angular momentum within the protostar-disc sys-
tem is mainly facilitated by gravitational instability and the
associated non-axisymmetric angular-momentum transport",8,CMR9,,231,62

gular momentum of the disc can be much larger than of the
material being accreted by the disc, allowing the formation
of large discs even when magnetic braking in the pseudo-disc
is strong.",8,CMR9,,249,60
"Together, we now have a relatively simple picture of disc
formation. Large-scale processes (collapse of the pre-stellar
core and pseudo-disc evolution), which are mostly laminar
and axisymmetric, determine the evolution of total mass and
angular momentum of the protostar-disc system. The total
mass and angular momentum of the protostar-disc system
then directly determine the properties of the disc, including
size and density proﬁle, through gravitational self-regulation.
Of course, this physical picture is based on simulations that
cover only the ﬁrst several kyr of disc evolution, and which
use one particular set of initial conditions and chemical abun-
dances. In future studies, we will determine if this picture is
still applicable for the long-term evolution of discs through-
out the Class 0/I phase and for diﬀerent initial conditions",8,CMR9,,849,63

7.2 Numerical convergence: the importance of the inner,8,CMB10,,54,54
boundary,8,CMB10,,8,8
"Poor numerical convergence has been a signiﬁcant problem
for simulations of protostellar disc formation with relatively
low resolution. We use a set of 2D and 3D simulations to
study the numerical convergence of our results for all nu-
merical parameters (including resolution) in our model, and
ﬁnd relatively good convergence for the mass and angular-
momentum budget of the protostar-disc system.",8,CMR9,,399,62
"Our relatively good numerical convergence is mainly due
to two reasons. First, we use a suﬃciently small inner bound-
ary",8,CMR9,,121,61
r,8,CMMI9,,1,1
in,5,CMR6,,2,2
", which helps to conserve angular momentum and re-
solve the early evolution of the disc. We use",8,CMR9,,96,50
r,8,CMMI9,,1,1
in,5,CMR6,,2,2
"as small as
0.25 au for 2D simulations and 1 au for 3D simulations, which
is signiﬁcantly smaller than used in most previous studies.",8,CMR9,,133,61
6,5,CMR6,,1,1
"Second, we use an inner boundary condition that limits the
angular-momentum ﬂux through the inner boundary, which
relaxes the requirement on",8,CMR9,,140,58
r,8,CMMI9,,1,1
in,5,CMR6,,2,2
"for numerical convergence by
at least a factor of a few (which translates to more than an or-
der of magnitude in computational cost; see more discussion",8,CMR9,,153,64
on computational cost in Appendix E).,8,CMR9,,37,37
"We also explain the origin of this sensitive dependence on
the inner boundary: disc formation requires angular momen-
tum to be accumulated ﬁrst near the protostar and then be
transported outwards by gravitational instability. If the inner
boundary is too large and angular momentum can ﬂow freely
through the inner boundary, the initial accumulation of an-
gular momentum is prohibited and disc formation is strongly
suppressed.",8,CMR9,,429,63

"corresponds
to both a small sink particle and suﬃciently high resolution close

7,5,CMR6,,1,1
"For a Cartesian grid, one must also ensure that angular momen-
tum is not appreciably lost to the grid when the angular sizes of
the cells are large. This is especially problematic when a signiﬁ-",7,CMR8,,195,66
cant amount of angular momentum may have to remain near the,7,CMR8,,59,59
protostar for many orbits before being transported outwards.,7,CMR8,,60,60
7.3 Observational hints of gravitational self-regulation,8,CMB10,,56,56
"Our simulation suggests that protostellar discs are likely
marginally gravitationally unstable for at least a signiﬁcant
fraction of Class 0/I phase. Here we discuss how this predic-
tion compares with recent observations of young discs.",8,CMR9,,237,61
"The most direct way of determining whether a disc is grav-
itationally unstable is through estimating its Toomre",8,CMR9,,112,58
Q,8,CMMI9,,1,1
". This
requires estimating disc mass, which for Class 0/I discs is usu-
ally inferred from dust continuum emission. However, such a
measurement typically assumes optically thin emission at the
observed wavelength, which is likely untrue for some systems
(Galv´an-Madrid et al. 2018; Liu 2020) and may lead to sig-
niﬁcant underestimation of disc mass. To calibrate this eﬀect,
one has to observe the disc at a very long wavelength to en-
sure optically thin emission, or multiple wavelengths to con-
strain opacity. For example, Sharma et al. (2020) use ALMA
0.87-mm data and VLA 8-mm data to show that the disc
around an outbursting Class 0 protostar likely has",8,CMR9,,662,64
Q <,8,CMMI9,,3,3

before outburst. They also comment that using the ALMA",8,CMR9,,56,54
"data (more optically thick because of the shorter wavelength)
alone would underestimate disc mass by at least a factor of
10. A similar trend is also visible in the VANDAM survey of
Orion protostars (Tobin et al. 2020), where ALMA 0.87-mm
data suggest most discs have",8,CMR9,,267,61
Q,8,CMMI9,,1,1
"well above unity (assum-
ing optically thin dust emission), but VLA 8-mm data, when
available, gives much smaller",8,CMR9,,113,58
Q,8,CMMI9,,1,1
"values that are usually con-
sistent with marginally unstable discs (see their Table 9). It
is also worth noting that the protostar mass in these systems
are usually unknown. The estimates discussed above both as-
sume a certain ﬁducial protostar mass when calculating",8,CMR9,,268,62
Q,8,CMMI9,,1,1
",
and that leads to large uncertainty. (On the other hand, if
gravitational self regulation is indeed applicable to a wide
range of Class 0/I systems, one can use disc mass observa-
tions to put rough constraints on protostar mass.) Overall,
although there are several important uncertainties, observed
Class 0/I disc masses, when the dust optical depth is prop-
erly accounted for, should be in broad agreement with our
prediction.",8,CMR9,,432,60

Early measurements of Class II discs usually use CO (or CO

estimate dust mass. These studies (e.g., Ansdell et al. 2016)

"During the ﬁrst few 100 kyr of pre-stellar collapse, the evo-
lution is slow and we expect the rotation in the inner part of
the core to be approximately uniform (similar to the initial
condition). However, as the top left panel of Fig. D1 shows,

pole, where the rotation rate is well above the initial rota-

"This problem is related to geometric truncation errors in
the EMF calculation, which eventually lead to unphysical
generation of a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. D1 bottom left
panel) and unphysical angular-momentum transport. The ori-
gin of this problem can be illustrated by considering a uni-
formly rotating system threaded by a vertical magnetic ﬁeld.
Physically, one expects the path integral of the poloidal EMF
around a cell to be zero, so that the toroidal ﬁeld remains
zero. However, in a simulation with ﬁnite resolution, the EMF
on each edge are subject to diﬀerent geometric errors, and
these errors in general do not cancel out. Additionally, in a
spherical polar grid the amplitudes of such errors do not de-
crease quickly as resolution increases because the error for
the ﬁrst couple of cells around the pole is always",8,CMR9,,834,61

"Typically, the numerical timestep is limited by magnetic
diﬀusion at the inner edge of the disc. One approach to over-
coming this obstacle is to increase the cell size there. This in
turn requires increasing the inner boundary size, since verti-
cally resolving the disc already poses a requirement on angu-
