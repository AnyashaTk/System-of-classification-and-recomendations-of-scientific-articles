ABSTRACT,10,CMBX10,,8,8
"The servo control algorithms of the TNG, developed in the nineties, have been working for more than 20 years
with no major updates. The original hardware was based on a VME-bus based platform running a real time
operating system, a rather popular choice for similar applications at the time. Recently, the obsolescence of
the hardware and the lack of spares pushed the observatory towards a complete replacement of the electronics
that is now being implemented in steps, respecting the basic requirement of never stopping the observatory
night operations. Within the framework of this major hardware work, we are taking the opportunity to review",9,CMR10,,645,109
"and update the existing control schemes. This servo control update, crucial for the telescope performance,
envisages a new study from scratch of the controlled plant, including a re-identiﬁcation of the main axes transfer
functions and a re-design of the control ﬁlters in the two nested position and speed loops. The ongoing work is
described, including preliminary results in the case study of the azimuth axis and our plans for possible further
improvements.",9,CMR10,,461,114

1. INTRODUCTION,10,CMBX10,,15,15
"The 3.5-m TNG telescope saw ﬁrst light in La Palma (Canary Islands) at Roque de Los Muchachos observatory
in 1998. Its axes control system had been realized few years before: all the control hardware had been installed in
1995, completing the procurement of components and custom parts during the preliminary integration in Italy.
In the original design, the speed loop control had been implemented adopting a custom hardware developed by
the Sierracin Magnedyne company, including motors, power ampliﬁers and control CPUs, whereas the position
loop had been realized in-house by the Italian community, using all commercial components based on the VME
bus technology and a real-time operating system: this system has been working every night for more than 20
years.",9,CMR10,,765,115
"Only few relatively minor interventions have been necessary over the years, but after more than two decades,
the observatory was running out of spare parts. Soon after the telescope realization, the stock could no longer
be updated for the custom parts. Of course, over the years this became a critical issue because of aging and
obsolescence, including the commercial components as well. Thus, recently the observatory started a project to",9,CMR10,,440,111
"replace all the control hardware components but motors and feedback sensors: this work is described in Ref. 1.
Obviously, this kind of modernization eﬀorts are common for telescopes operating since a few decades (e.g. see
Ref. 2–4).",9,CMR10,,232,110
"Within this eﬀort, it was decided to maintain the same software, which had proved to be eﬀective and reliable
for many years, so avoiding a full recommissioning of the system. Thus, the control software has been ported to
the new platform with a heavy and accurate work of translation from the old real-time textual environment to
the National Instruments LabVIEW graphical programming language. Thus, the telescope is still running the
“same” axes control software albeit under a totally diﬀerent environment.",9,CMR10,,510,111
"As the whole intervention involves critical system components (e.g. the axes drives), possible eﬀects on the
axes transfer function, and consequently on the servo control performance, can be expected. This motivated",9,CMR10,,215,108
"the team to plan a complete check and redesign of the servo control algorithms, under the strict requirement of",9,CMR10,,111,111
"never stopping the telescope operations. This is the main objective of this paper, which describes the case of the
azimuth axis.",9,CMR10,,128,114

signal is recorded synchronously as system output. The I/O sample pairs are analyzed in Matlab through a laptop
computer.",8,CMR9,,239,117
2. SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION,10,CMBX10,,24,24
"The ﬁrst step of the work has been the identiﬁcation of the azimuth model. The derivation of the transfer
function has been done purely from ﬁeld test data, as no analytical model was available for comparison. A white
noise signal has been applied at the torque input to excite the dynamics of the telescope. The white noise is a
random signal of even spectrum, able to excite evenly each frequency component of the telescope dynamics. The
corresponding velocity output has been measured by diﬀerentiating the position encoder output.",9,CMR10,,534,111
"It is worth noticing that, in the original implementation, the velocity feedback was provided by custom",9,CMR10,,103,103
"tachometers; after several years they started to fail and were replaced by an encoder based system, providing a
back-compatible analogue speed signal. Finally, in the new system it has been decided to work with “software
tachometers” obtained by diﬀerentiating the encoder readings. This is the same solution adopted, e.g. at the
VLT (Ref. 5) and the VST (Ref. 6).",9,CMR10,,364,111
"To be eﬀective, the white noise procedure has been tuned by varying parameters like the amplitude of the
input noise and the duration of the test. After some tuning, the test was run at 500Hz frequency for an overall
duration of 5 minutes, corresponding to 150,000 samples of input-output pairs. Longer acquisition times did not
produce any diﬀerence. The amplitude of the input signal was determined after a trade-oﬀ between the opposite
needs of exciting suﬃciently the axis dynamics and prevent damages to the system. The average input signal
was null, so the axis remained always approximately in the same position.",9,CMR10,,619,111
"The test conﬁguration was extremely easy, as no external equipment was adopted. Everything was based
on dedicated software features prepared in advance, fully integrated into the new graphical implementation of
the control software, adopting a post-processing code developed in Matlab. The white noise input was purely",9,CMR10,,318,109

environment. Figure 1 shows the basic diagram of the open-loop system identiﬁcation.",9,CMR10,,194,109
"In the case of azimuth, it is well known that the transfer function depends on the altitude position (Ref. 7).
The model identiﬁcation has been repeated at the two extremes of the altitude range (ALT=20",9,CMR10,,202,110

and ALT=90,9,CMR10,,10,10

")
and in an intermediate position (ALT=50",9,CMR10,,41,39
◦,6,CMSY7,,1,1
"). As expected, the three transfer functions are similar, but not",9,CMR10,,65,65
identical (Figure 2). The result at ALT=50,9,CMR10,,42,42
◦,6,CMSY7,,1,1
"is assumed to be a good compromise, representing a ﬁrst order
approximation of the axis model.",9,CMR10,,94,61
"In principle, the identiﬁed model might be compared with an analytical model coming from FEA data, which
would help to identify the physical meaning of all resonances in the model. Nevertheless, an accurate FEA model
is not available for the TNG and any old simpliﬁed model, dating back to design time, could not be deemed
reliable. Also, the purpose of this work is the design of the servo control for an existing telescope, rather than
the study of a new optomechanical system still in design phase. Consequently, all the work was based uniquely
on the identiﬁed transfer function. The identiﬁed model has been the starting point for the servo control design,
described in the following sections.",9,CMR10,,698,114
It is worth mentioning that for some control strategies (e.g. model-based control schemes) an accurate,9,CMR10,,102,102
"identiﬁed model is mandatory (Ref. 7). So far, the old servo control architecture has been kept for this work,
but a model-based controller would be a viable alternative. Working on a model-based controller (e.g. LQG)
design, it is generally necessary to reduce the order of the model to get an accurate, but simple, representation
of the system. The order of the system must be decreased saving only an appropriate number of modes that",9,CMR10,,436,113

"still represent the system with good approximation. All the others, adding unuseful complexity to the controller
design, shall be excluded.",9,CMR10,,139,112
"In the case under study, the azimuth axis was identiﬁed with a model of order 50, i.e. the dynamical matrix
of the space-state representation is 50x50. This order is too high for the implementation of e.g. a LQG controller
and likely includes dynamics that do not represent the system, possibly measurement noise. Diﬀerent reduction
techniques exist (Ref. 8); here the Hankel norm technique has been adopted, computing the Hankel singular
vaues of the dynamical system and removing the modes with the smallest norms, under a given threshold. The
threshold must be tuned in order to keep an adequate representation of the system. Figure 3 compares raw data,
the 50-state azimuth model and a balanced 14-state model reduced by truncation of the smallest Hankel norms;
here the 50- and 14-state model diﬀers signiﬁcantly only for the high frequency dynamics, above 100Hz.",9,CMR10,,868,114

good star tracking. When the velocity control works suﬃciently well, the control engineer can start dealing with
the position control loop.",9,CMR10,,250,112
"The implementation of a series of second order ﬁlters oﬀers a full ﬂexibility for the speed controller design.
They have an immediate interpretation, e.g. they can be low-pass, Notch, PID ﬁlters. The serial connection
of a number of simple blocks allows to shape any possible transfer function in the frequency domain. Here,
we preliminarily estimated that a series of four ﬁlters could give enough degrees of freedom. However, a good
solution was identiﬁed using just three of them. The ﬁlters have been designed in the frequency domain, by
placing poles and zeros where appropriate. In the current implementation, the ﬁlter no.1 and no.2 are identical",9,CMR10,,653,111

bandwidth of the closed speed loop as much as possible, preserving simultaneously the system stability. Figure 4

of speed error time series during the tuning phase.",9,CMR10,,390,115

4. POSITION LOOP CONTROL,10,CMBX10,,24,24
"The fundamental goal for a telescope axis servo control is the quality of tracking. The control loops must be
designed carefully to constrain the tracking error within tight speciﬁcations, especially for an optical telescope
like the TNG. However, a good design of the slewing phase is essential as well. The slew phase must be as short
as possible, so ideally the telescope axes should be driven at maximum speed, but this is impossible because of
physical limits for the next position derivatives, i.e. acceleration and jerk. Overall, a system approach for servo
control shall be adopted, addressing simultaneously all issues related to both slew and tracking phases.",9,CMR10,,669,115
"With reference to the PI (Proportional-Integral) controller, one of the most popular tracking position con-",9,CMR10,,107,107
"trollers for telescopes as well, one problem is represented by the large overshoot caused by the integral action",9,CMR10,,112,112
"during the slew phase, when the position error is large. One workaround is the implementation of diﬀerent
position controllers for slew and tracking, with a transition phase between the two; this was the ﬁrst solution
implemented at the VLT as described in Ref. 9 (later the implementation was changed as described in Ref. 10",9,CMR10,,325,111

"adopting a command preprocessor, see also Section 5.1).",9,CMR10,,55,55
"A more sophisticated and ﬂexible solution, still attractively easy, is the implementation of a variable structure
controller in the loop (ﬁg. 6), pioneered in the telescope ﬁeld at the TNG itself in the nineties. With a variable
structure controller, the parameters are dynamically changed as a function of the position error, with the following
guidelines.",9,CMR10,,357,116

•,9,SFRM1000,,1,1
"When the error is large, using the tracking gains would cause instability. The position gain must be smaller",9,CMR10,,108,108

"In the TNG case, this has been implemented through a simple linear interpolation of three points in the
gain-error plane; the principle is simply described by ﬁg. 7. The variable gain function is fully described by the
coordinates of the three points, i.e. by 6 parameters. Thus, the PI variable structure controller is described by
12 parameters, fully deﬁning Kp(e) and Ki(e). With reference to the transition phase, it is worth mentioning
that more mathematically elegant connections of the two extreme points would not give, for the shaping of the
functions, the same total freedom of a simple linear interpolation of points. In the TNG case, setting only one
intermediate point has been enough.",9,CMR10,,699,114

5. ALTERNATIVE IMPLEMENTATIONS,10,CMBX10,,30,30
"Other approaches to the problems outlined in section 4 are possible, rather than recurring to variable structure
controllers. An eﬀective solution can be designing the slew phase by pre-ﬁltering the axes reference positions
coming from the astrometric sequence, a solution sometimes referred to as",9,CMR10,,297,112
command pre-preprocessor,9,CMTI10,,24,24
or,9,CMR10,,2,2
"command
shaper",9,CMTI10,,14,7
"(Fig. 8). This way, the designer can constraint the system variables by planning a trajectory that will
never exceed the velocity and acceleration limits, with two consequences: the telescope dynamics will always
work in the linear regime, as any saturation will be prevented by design; the position error will always be limited,
eﬀectively preventing the overshoot problem caused by the integral action.",9,CMR10,,404,116
"The trajectory planning is not trivial because the telescope target is moving, although slowly, so the ﬁnal
destination of the telescope slew is not rigorously known in advance. Of course, in theory the whole trajectory of",9,CMR10,,222,114
"the celestial object might be precomputed; but this would require the servo control software embeds or replicates
the astrometry computations.",9,CMR10,,142,113
"This is normally an impractical solution, because the two tasks of astrometry and servo control are usually",9,CMR10,,107,107
Figure 8. Position loop adopting a command preprocessor in input.,8,CMR9,,65,65
"decoupled and implemented separately: this is the case at the TNG too. An astrometry module computes the
axes coordinates and generates the set-points for the servo control; on the servo side, the astrometry is seen as a
black-box that outputs periodically the coordinates to track. Thus, the instantaneous trajectory set-points are
known, but all the future ones are unknowns. Therefore, an essential feature for a command preprocessor at
the TNG is the ability to work recursively, having no knowledge of the future positions but using instantaneous",9,CMR10,,551,115
inputs only.,9,CMR10,,12,12
"Examples of slew trajectory planners are in Ref. 11–17. They diﬀer signiﬁcantly in the approach and imple-
mentation. Here, the preference for a possible future implementation at the TNG goes for a recursive scheme
guaranteeing the continuity of velocity and acceleration, i.e. for a preprocessor implementing a C",9,CMR10,,313,107

The implementation of a command shaper may lead to the implementation of a single position controller for,9,CMR10,,105,105
"any phase (large, medium and small errors), removing the need of variable gains.",9,CMR10,,80,80
5.2 Model-based control,10,CMBX10,,23,23
"The current PI controller improves the performance when the gains are increased, but makes the system unstable
if the gains are too high, causing vibrations. The reason is that the telescope is not totally rigid but has ﬂexible
modes. A controller that suppresses the telescope vibrations when the gains are increased would be helpful.
This is what a model-based controller aims to do. Therefore, although the current implementation fulﬁlls the
requirements, moving to a model-based controller could in principle further enhance the system.",9,CMR10,,540,116
"One option is the LQG control. In the optimal control theory, a LQG controller is a combination of a Kalman
ﬁlter (a Linear Quadratic state Estimator - LQE) with a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). The tracking version
of the LQG controller described in Ref. 7 has some similarities with the PI control scheme and may be a candidate
for an experimentation at the TNG.",9,CMR10,,367,113
"As shown in Fig. 9, the LQG is implemented in the position loop and the ”Telescope Axis”, to be modelled",9,CMR10,,104,104
"through a white-noise identiﬁcation procedure, is the velocity closed-loop. Here, the command preprocessor is
mandatory: in fact the capability to shape the trajectory not exceeding velocity and acceleration limits allows
to work always in the linear regime, as needed by this method. The scheme includes an estimator of the states

"action is added to the PI output, allowing the suppression of the telescope vibrations. The
tracking version of the LQG controller is a PI augmented with a ﬂexible mode controller, where the increase of
the proportional gain cause no longer instability because the vibrations are suppressed.",9,CMR10,,291,110

satisfactory performance shown for the previous twenty years. This goal was achieved, as the ﬁnal performance
