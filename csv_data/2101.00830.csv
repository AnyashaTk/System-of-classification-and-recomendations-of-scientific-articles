"Parker Solar Probe (PSP) measures the magnetic ﬁeld and plasma parameters of the solar wind at unprecedentedly close

"In this study, we make use of the PSP data to explore the nature of solar wind turbulence focusing on the Alfvénic character

Results.,8,NimbusSanL-Regu-Slant_167,,8,8
"Our results show that as ﬂuctuations are transported outward by the solar wind, the magnetic ﬁeld spectrum steepens while
the shape of the velocity spectrum remains unchanged. The steepening process is controlled by the “age” of the turbulence, which is
determined by the wind speed together with the radial distance. Statistically, faster solar wind has higher “Alfvénicity,” with a more
dominant outward propagating wave component and more balanced magnetic and kinetic energies. The outward wave dominance",8,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,508,134
"gradually weakens with radial distance, while the excess of magnetic energy is found to be stronger as we move closer toward the
Sun. We show that the turbulence properties can signiﬁcantly vary from stream to stream even if these streams are of a similar speed,
indicating very di",8,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,281,133

propagating away from the Sun (e.g., Belcher & Davis Jr 1971),
even though the solar wind is propagating much faster than any
wave speed and should therefore advect ﬂuctuations outward ir-
respective of the direction of their propagation. This Alfvénic
turbulence is most prevalent in high-speed solar wind streams,
and the Alfvénic property appears to decay with distance from
the Sun and survive out to distances much greater than 1 AU
only in the polar heliosphere at solar minimum (Bavassano et al.
1998). Alfvénic turbulence is also nearly incompressible. Ra-
dial evolution of the power spectra and other quantities, such as
cross-helicity (deﬁned below), seems to conﬁrm ongoing nonlin-
ear dynamics (Bavassano et al. 1982, 1998), which for incom-
pressible Alfvénic turbulence requires the interaction between
colliding counter-propagating wave packets (Iroshnikov 1964;

The wind speed in combination with the radial distance controls
the turbulence spectra via the useful concept of turbulence “age”

wind and the Alfvénicity, if deﬁned by the relative amplitude
of the outward and inward propagating Alfvén waves, gradually
decreases with radial distance. However, the magnetic energy

around -0.75. That is to say, in this time period, there is a non-

magnetic energy signiﬁcantly exceeds the kinetic energy, despite
the near incompressibility. One can see from Fig. 1 that actually
during most of Encounter 5, the turbulence has low Alfvénic-
ity and the wind speed is slow. In examining the middle column
of Fig. 1, we noticed that in Encounter 4 after the heliospheric",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,458,66

the observed non-Alfvénic, or low-Alfvénic, turbulence is pos-

see that at this time period PSP was connected to the boundary
of the northern polar coronal hole without any activities nearby,
neither active regions, nor pseudo-streamers, which are shown
to be crucial in generating the Alfvénic slow wind observed in
Encounter 1 (Panasenco et al. 2020). For most of E5, PSP was
magnetically connected to the boundaries of either the northern
or southern polar coronal hole (Velli et al., 2021, this issue). This
