INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"It has long been considered that mergers or inter-
actions of gas-rich galaxies are the trigger for intense
starburst and black hole growth (e.g., Sanders et al.
1988; Hopkins et al. 2006).
In this scenario, a sub-
stantial fraction of the black hole growth takes place
inside a dusty starburst, during which time the sys-
tem appears as an obscured active galactic nucleus
(obscured AGN, Hickox & Alexander 2018).
Sub-
sequent strong AGN feedback, particularly in the
form of massive outﬂows (e.g., Maiolino et al. 2012;
Cicone et al. 2014; Carniani et al. 2016; Bischetti et al.
2019; Fluetsch et al. 2019; Lutz et al. 2020), is expected
to clear gas and dust from the galaxy, halting further
star formation and black hole growth. This feedback is
also invoked in galaxy evolution models to shape the
galaxy mass function and ultimately black hole-host
galaxy co-evolution relations (Kormendy & Ho 2013).",9,CMR10,,906,58

to be hosted by major mergers (e.g., Urrutia et al. 2008;
Glikman et al. 2015). These properties support an evo-
lutionary scenario, in which red quasars are emerging
from the merger-induced dusty starburst phase likely by
blowing out surrounding medium with powerful winds
