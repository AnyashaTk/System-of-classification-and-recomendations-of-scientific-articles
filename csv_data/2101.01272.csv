Abstract.,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,9,9
Launching a starshade to rendezvous with the,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,44,44
Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope,9,NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal,,33,33
would provide the ﬁrst,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,22,22
opportunity to directly image the habitable zones of nearby sunlike stars in the coming decade. A report on the science,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,119,119
and feasibility of such a mission was recently submitted to NASA as a probe study concept.,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,90,90
1,6,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,1,1
The driving objective of,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,24,24
the concept is to determine whether Earth-like exoplanets exist in the habitable zones of the nearest sunlike stars and,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,119,119
"have biosignature gases in their atmospheres. With the sensitivity provided by this telescope, it is possible to measure
the brightness of zodiacal dust disks around the nearest sunlike stars and establish how their population compares to",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,238,120
"our own. In addition, known gas-giant exoplanets can be targeted to measure their atmospheric metallicity and thereby",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,117,117
determine if the correlation with planet mass follows the trend observed in the Solar System and hinted at by exoplanet,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,119,119

Given the ﬁxed capability of",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,139,110
Roman,9,NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal,,5,5
"and the constrained observing windows inherent for the starshade, we calculate
the sensitivity of the combined observatory to detect these three types of targets and we present an overall observing
strategy that enables us to achieve these objectives.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,251,118

1 Introduction,11,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,14,14
"Space-based direct imaging is the next frontier of discovery for exoplanet science, moving beyond
detection of Earth-like planets toward full characterization of their atmospheres, potentially iden-
tifying signs of life. The",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,225,100
Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope,11,NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal,,33,33
(hereafter referred to as,11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,25,25
Roman,11,NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal,,5,5
") is
scheduled to launch in late 2025. While its Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) will reach planet-star
ﬂux ratios only achievable in space, with the capability to directly image gas giant planets around
nearby stars, it does not have the sensitivity to detect Earth-like planets. With the launch of a com-
panion starshade – a free-ﬂying 26-m external occulter – such a goal can be reached within the
next decade.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,411,102
The Starshade Rendevous Probe (SRP) mission concept was presented in a recent report,11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,84,84
1,7,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,1,1
"as-
sessing the possibility to ﬂy an external starshade. Using the CGI, the starshade signiﬁcantly
enhances the exoplanet observing capabilities of",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,147,94
Roman,11,NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal,,5,5
"by providing 1) improved contrast and a
reduced inner working angle (IWA), enabling sensitivity to Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable
zone, 2) an unlimited outer working angle, enabling a wider view of the planetary system around",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,233,97
"each target, and 3) higher throughput (the coronagraph masks are not needed with a starshade),
enabling the sensitivity needed to spectrally characterize an Earth-like exoplanet.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,178,94
In this paper we provide the technical basis for the SRP study report,11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,69,69
1,7,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,1,1
"along with the simulations
used to estimate sensitivity of the observatory. While many such assessments have been done in
the past,",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,131,94

"While detailed simulations of Starshade missions
exist,",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,55,48
5–7,7,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,3,3
"we found that the SRP has a relatively small number of targets, which imposes different
demands. The need to understand how to balance the different objectives of the mission, within
signiﬁcant mission constraints, and how to prioritize targets led us to produce a simulations pack-
age focused on the SRP. This software is publicly available for reproduction of the results below
and for comparison with similar simulations.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,425,99

SRP report (§2) followed by and outline of the top-level mission constraints, based on its partnering
with the",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,203,101

"to discover and potentially characterize Earth-like exoplanet candidates around these stars drives
the observatory requirements. Meeting these challenging requirements means the observatory will
also be capable of discovering and characterizing a wide range of planet types, from those like the
giant planets in our Solar System, to the sub-Neptune planets commonly discovered by Kepler,",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,387,99

goal: 1) initial detection via direct imaging, 2) habitable zone determination, by multi-epoch orbit
tracing, and 3) atmosphere characterization, with spectroscopy of the most compelling candidate
planets – particularly those in the habitable zone. Each of these steps places unique requirements
on the mission parameters, as described in this paper.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,444,100
"The requirement to detect Earth-like exoplanets also enables the ability to detect exozodiacal
dust disks and spectral features of gas giants. The distribution of exozodiacal dust brightness, at
the level relevant for Earth-like exoplanet detection, is largely unconstrained. Recent bounds on
the warm dust disk brightness of many sunlike stars of interest to the SRP are provided by LBTI,",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,389,99

starshade mission’s parameters are ﬁxed by",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,72,42

"’s established telescope, instruments, and oper-

imposed constraint, it is an important one imposed by the Starshade architecture and limits the
target observing windows.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,311,96
"The imaging end-to-end efﬁciency, discussed in more detail in §5, is the result of losses from
the telescope aperture, optical path, with coronagraph masks excluded, and all the way down to the
quantum efﬁciency of the detector. The Starshade observations depend on the CGI camera with
little modiﬁcations, so we take this as an imposed constraint. The ﬁeld of view of the CGI detector
is limited to 4.5",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,403,99

"Lastly, note that while",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,23,23
Roman,11,NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal,,5,5

6 Observing Strategy,11,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,20,20
"The science objectives are met with an observing program that balances detection and characteri-
zation of new exoplanets with the characterization of known giant planets. The observing strategy
is guided by the sensitivity toward individual targets (§5) and fundamental limits on the targets’
visibility.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,305,98
6.1 Earth-Like Planets,11,NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal,,22,22
"Having already identiﬁed the best targets for detection of Earth-like planets for SRP given its
constraints(§5.1), we now describe our strategy on how to schedule observations to optimize the
number of characterized planets. The 8 most promising stars will be given priority for at least one
visit. The revisit strategy for these targets depends on the information gathered during each visit.
The decision tree used for observations is illustrated in Figure 11 and described in detail here.
The decision tree assumes that the imaging observation is complete with",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,562,100

"The ﬁrst visit is a reconnaissance observation. The ﬁrst check is whether the system has a
exozodiacal dust disk above or below 10 zodi. While some of our target stars have existing upper
limits on their exozodiacal dust disk brightness, based on precision nulling measurements of their",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,286,98

we have used a ﬁducial value of 4.5 zodi in §5 and §7, for the purposes of estimating background,
in reality the exozodiacal dust brightness will be vary from target to target and we assume it will
be unknown prior to the ﬁrst observation. Here we are describing the tentative design reference
mission for Starshade Rendezvous Probe mission. If the disk is brighter than 10 zodi, the target is
removed from the habitability and biosignatures target list since it is not expected that an Earth-",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,598,104

increased risk of false-positive planet detections from planet-induced dust structures.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,183,95
34,7,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,2,2
If a target,11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,11,11
"is removed, the observation plan will be updated with the next best target, which may or may not
be visited at a later period depending on what is discovered for the target ensemble.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,182,96

"On the second visit to a target, if no planet consistent with an HZ orbit has been detected, then",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,97,97
"the target is removed and the observation plan is updated with the next best target in the list. If the
planet is detected either for the ﬁrst or second time, a decision is made based on the data to take
a spectroscopic measurement as described above. Spectroscopic measurements are only required",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,296,103

repeated.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,104,94
"On the third visit, if the planet consistent with a HZ orbit has only been detected once, no further
visits will be planned since at least 3 observations in 4 planned visits are required. However, there is
some ﬂexibility in this decision since the third visit will be made in the second year of observations
and the science team will have additional information on the exozodiacal dust disk brightness and
population of planet candidates in the ensemble of targets already observed. In the event that there
are a small number of target systems left, then this system could have more visits planned. If there
are a large number of relevant target systems still available, this revisit priority may fall lower than
the priority of these other systems,recognizing revisit priority may evolve as knowledge is gained
about each system.Spectroscopic measurements can be triggered based on the criteria discussed
above.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,913,104

surement has been made yet, a fourth visit will be needed to determining whether the planet’s orbit

"of Earth-like exoplanets, this requires a fairly sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation that demon-
strates that the decision tree is adaptable to the full range of possibilities. This will be the subject
of a future study.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,221,104
"In the Starshade Probe Study report, the delta-v allocated to retargeting was 1100 m/s.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,87,87
1,7,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,1,1
"An
additional 300 m/s of delta-v is allocated for stationkeeping. The allocation for large slews was
estimated to be sufﬁcient for 36 retargeting maneuvers using a limiting scenario where 9 targets
were visited 4 times each (Figure 12). For retargeting within other starshade mission concepts see
5, 7. While our objective is to visit 10 habitability and biosignatures targets, some with multiple
revisits, and 10 known gas giants only once, the extreme scenario bounds the fuel usage because it
assumes the need to retarget in situations that are not necessarily the most fuel efﬁcient. The gas
giants, for example, can be visited when they are close to the path needed for other targets resulting
in signiﬁcantly smaller fuel burns.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,734,102
"The main driver for delta-v is the need to visit targets 4 times in a period of 2 years. If the
mission duration could be made longer, the retargeting strategy could follow the natural right
ascension progression of observing windows as the Earth rotates around the Sun, which can result
in highly efﬁcient fuel burns. With a two year window, there are cases where fairly aggressive",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,382,96
burns are required to catch targets of interest when their observing windows are available.,11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,91,91

habitable exoplanet targets with a subset of them requiring revisits in addition to the known gas

its primary limitation is the sensitivity to spectral measurements. The main means for improving",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,319,101
"this is to increase the aperture of the telescope, as would be done with HabEx, since this has the
dual beneﬁt of increasing the photon rate and better resolving the exozodiacal background. It is
worth noting there are large uncertainties in the occurrence rates of Earth-like exoplanets and the

"The SRP will obtain measurements of the exozodiacal dust of nearby sunlike stars with un-
precedented sensitivity. This information is key to the future of direct imaging observatories since
the dust brightness distribution is not known well enough to pin down the level of background
light expected for planet detection and characterization. The sensitivity of the SRP to dust disks
provides additional scientiﬁc opportunities to investigate the inﬂuence of planets on the dust disk
morphology provided such systems are found.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,527,100
