"mirror bubbles, the quantum property of the phase has to be retained because it is just the phase which contains the microscopic",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,128,128
"information. Moreover, space plasmas are ideal conductors and no resistors. Hence the normal current will naturally be different",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,128,128
from zero and will reﬂect the microscopic effect of the interaction. For this reason the quantum part of the current must be,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,124,124
retained. We will see that this is important in the case under consideration.,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,77,77
"There is, however, a difference in the region between the two bubbles. It is void of any condensate and thus that narrow",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,120,120
domain is void of the Meissner effect. The magnetic ﬁeld and density it contains are spatially constant. Hence the difference,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,125,125
between the two regions is just in the quantum mechanical term in the boundary condition and thus cannot be neglected while,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,123,123
"the conditions in the two adjacent bubbles may be different. Moreover, the tangential currents (which we do not consider here",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,125,125
as they contribute to the partial Meissner effect but are not involved into the normal current which must by itself be continuous),9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,130,130
ﬂowing in the adjacent bubble boundaries are in opposite directions. This implies that the two bubbles do not merge. They do,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,124,124
not attract each other because of the repulsive Lorentz forces such that they remain separated. Nevertheless one may assume,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,123,123
that the separation is narrow with non-compensating currents. Since all regions are conducting a normal current will ﬂow. In,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,124,124

a streaming plasma with plasma ﬂow across the magnetically depleted region or where an externally applied cross potential,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,121,121
"exists. Examples are the magnetosheath (Lucek et al., 2005) or other regions like, for instance, mirror mode chains in the",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,122,122
"solar wind (Winterhalter et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 2008). Other examples are collisionless shocks (Balogh & Treumann, 2013)",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,125,125

similar kind of junctions. Ion-inertial scale plasma turbulence or ﬂow-driven reconnection are further examples.,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,112,112
The Josephson frequency of oscillation is comparably high. Its large value is due to retaining the quantum effect which,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,119,119

. Thus the Josephson current oscillates,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,39,39
at high frequency. For any classical macroscopic process it averages out as neither the ﬂow nor the density can follow the,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,122,122
ﬂuctuation. It is just the current whose real phase oscillates between the two adjacent mirror bubbles. The quantum effect on,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,125,125
"the macroscopic plasma behaviour of the ﬁelds thus disappears. This is, of course, what is expected if considering the ﬂow or",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,125,125

"However, there is one effect which is retained even in classical physics. This is radiation which can, in principle, be observed",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,128,128

"which can, without any problem leave the region of its excitation. Mirror mode chains in the solar wind on the other hand are",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,125,125
roughly perpendicular to the ﬂow and of generally larger extension. Hence their frequency will be higher closer to the optical,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,126,126

in contrast to the region behind shocks like the bow shock. Here they seem to be present almost at any time.,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,108,108
Similarly one expects that the heliosheath region behind the heliospheric termination shock evolves into magnetic turbulence,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,124,124

"will also glow in the infrared, possibly however at slightly longer wavelengths. In general, any infrared glow around stellar",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,125,125
winds might indicate the position of their external boundaries by this kind of Josephson effect which evolves solely in mirror,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,126,126

glow may drop into the microwave domain.,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,40,40
5.2 The case of reconnection,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,28,28
In this context it is of particular interest to refer to reconnection as these results are independent of the direction of the magnetic,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,135,135
"ﬁeld. Reconnection and mirror modes may be closely related (Phan et al., 2005; Volwerk et al., 2003) as one can easily imagine",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,126,126
"that mirror modes when encountering an antiparallel magnetic ﬁeld could ignite reconnection. Moreover, they may also evolve",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,123,123
"in the reconnection process as recent MMS observations (Hau et al., 2020) of reconnection at the magnetopause and Grad-",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,119,119
Shafranov reconstructions suggest.,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,34,34
Consider the case of reconnection when two plasmas of oppositely directed magnetic ﬁelds approach each other. Let them,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,118,118
be separated by a non-magnetic plasma which by deﬁnition is ideally conducting. Then the magnetic ﬁelds penetrate it only,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,121,121
up to their skin depth,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,22,22
λ,9,CMMI10,,1,1
e,6,CMMI7,,1,1
. When the two plasmas approach each other the nonmagnetic sheet between them will become,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,89,89
compressed and ultimately some plasma will be squeezed out into jets escaping from the compressed region in all directions,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,122,122
10,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,2,2
but ultimately preferably parallel/antiparallel to the two external magnetic ﬁelds. When the two plasmas are roughly,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,116,116

"contact and merge. However, the current normal to the boundaries of the sheet will be a Josephson current and oscillate at",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,122,122

V,9,CMMI10,,1,1
of the approaching plasmas. Hence the reconnection region should radiate at high frequency.,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,91,91
If many such regions contact in a large volume the volume may glow in the emitted frequency. Since the plasma is highly,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,119,119
"diluted, there is no problem for the radiation to escape and become visible from remote if only being composed of many such",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,123,123
radiators such that the volume emissivity becomes susceptibly large. A single reconnection region will of course emit very,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,122,122
weak radiation only.,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,20,20
"This is probably the case in completely evolved low frequency plasma turbulence. Recently (Treumann & Baumjohann,",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,113,113
2015) we suggested that that the main energy dissipation in fully developed plasma turbulence may be provided at the shortest,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,125,125

by reconnection in the turbulently generated small-scale current vortices into which the streaming,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,98,98
turbulent plasmas will necessarily decay on these scales. In general this reconnection in each single small-scale (microscopic),9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,127,127
current sheet is weak. However since there are very many such current vortices distributed over the large-scale turbulent,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,121,121
volume the integrated dissipation will become substantial such that it under stationary conditions will balance the mechanical,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,126,126
energy input at large scales by the large scale ﬂow of the plasma. Since such plasmas are ﬁlled by a multitude of small-,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,120,120

In collisionless shocks this may indeed be of particular interest. They separate regions of vastly different magnetic ﬁeld,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,122,122
"strengths while on the scales of the shock remain collisionless. Moreover, shock fronts exhibit various regions of different",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,124,124
"properties with spatially highly variable magnetic ﬁelds evolving into overshoots and, relative to the shock also “holes” in both",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,129,129
"quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel shocks (Balogh & Treumann, 2013). Some of these regions may well be considered of",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,120,120

"become visible as sources of soft X-rays becoming emitters, as is frequently observed in astrophysics. Such X-ray radiation is",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,126,126
"conventionally attributed to shock acceleration of electrons when interacting with the shock front. However, part of the radia-",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,127,127
tion may also be caused by the Josephson junction effect inside the shock as well as in any texture of mirror modes downstream,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,126,126
of the shock. The distinction between the two regions is given by a difference in the emitted spectrum. The much higher veloc-,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,126,126

6 Summary,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,9,9
Following earlier work on condensate formation in magnetic mirror modes we have provided the conditions for a quasi-,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,116,116
"superconducting phase transition in high temperature plasma, following the linear mirror instability. In this process bouncing",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,126,126
charged particles in discrete particle resonance with the thermal ion acoustic background noise lock to the ion sound wave and,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,126,126
temporarily escape from bounce motion while generating a large anisotropy. Through production of a weak attracting electric,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,123,123
potential in their wakes they give rise to a correlation length,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,63,63
ξ,9,CMMI10,,1,1
. The phase transition is governed by the semi-classical GL theory,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,66,66
and results in a second kind quasi-superconducting state exhibiting a partial Meissner effect. Since the Ginzburg ratio,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,119,119
κ,9,CMMI10,,1,1
G,6,CMMI7,,1,1
>,9,CMMI10,,1,1
1,9,CMR10,,1,1
"is large, the phase transition perforates the plasma causing a magnetic texture which consists of chains of mirror bubbles.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,123,123
We then investigated the interaction of two closely spaced bubbles ﬁnding that it can be described as Josephson junctions,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,121,121
producing a classical signature in weak high frequency electromagnetic radiation at frequency depending on the equivalent,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,121,121
electric ﬁeld and direction of the plasma ﬂow. Its frequency is far above the plasma frequency cut-off such that it would be,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,124,124
observable from remote. Though weak and if observable it maps the mirror mode region into frequency space. Similar effects,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,122,122
are expected in reconnection and shocks and could be of interest in application to astrophysical objects.,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,105,105
