Abstract.,10,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,9,9
"We present a new study of archival ALMA observations of the CO(2-1) line emission
of the host galaxy of quasar RX J1131 at redshift z=0.654, lensed by a foreground galaxy. A
simple lens model is shown to well reproduce the optical images obtained by the Hubble Space
Telescope. Clear evidence for rotation of the gas contained in the galaxy is obtained and a simple
rotating disc model is shown to give an excellent overall description of the morpho-kinematics of
the source. The possible presence of a companion galaxy suggested by some previous authors is
not conﬁrmed. Detailed comparison between model and observations gives evidence for a more
complex dynamics than implied by the model. Doppler velocity dispersion within the beam size in
the image plane is found to account for the observed line width.",10,NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal,,809,98

However, they probe only the vicinity of the cusp of the caustic curve. As the emission of the

it as granted that the simple lens model obtained from the study of the quasar images reliably
applies to the whole host galaxy. This is at variance with the gravitational lensing of quasar hosts
that are farther away and cover only part of the caustic in addition to being intrinsically smaller.

gives an excellent description of the astrometry of the HST images. Agreement has been obtained
with the results of earlier analyses and a good understanding of the uncertainties attached to the
model parameters and of their correlations has been reached. However, these results probe only
the environment of the eastern cusp of the caustic and the validity of the model at larger distances,

lected on July 19th 2015 using the normal 12-m array with 37 antennas covering baselines be-
tween 27.5 m and 1.6 km. Details of the observations and of the data reduction are given in
Thai T. T. 2020 [22]. Imaging was performed using the standard CLEAN algorithm applied to
the calibrated visibilities. With the aim to understand the effect of a different data reduction than
used by P18 on the results obtained, we used robust weighting rather than natural weighting as
adopted by P 18. This means a better angular resolution (the beam is 70% in area compared with
the P18 beam) but a larger noise level. This dictated our choice of 0.5 as robust parameter, a
reasonable compromise between angular resolution and noise. We recall that a rigorous treatment
of the noise is only possible in the uv plane. Here, as we work in the image plane, we can only
obtain an approximate estimate of its level. However, we have been careful to take this caveat",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,1031,101

the de-lensed source brightness being smeared by the beam in a way that depends on the location
of the image pixel. And it introduces de-lensing noise, implying the application of a strong cut on
image brightness in order to stand aside from it. We have been careful to ensure that our results
were robust with respect to both. For this reason one usually prefers to start from a model of the
source brightness, image it, convolve it with the beam and compare the result with the observed
image (as we do with the second method). In practice, application of the ﬁrst method requires",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,749,99

2 images (outside the caustic) or 4 images (inside the caustic). In the ﬁrst case a weighted aver-
age of the de-lensed brightness gives the source brightness outside the caustic and in the second

"The above results call for a word of caution. Qualitatively, the presence of an excess of
emission in the vicinity of the quasar is likely to be a robust result of the analysis; it had been noted
by P18 who suggest that it is most likely associated with a site of on-going star-formation. How-
ever, its location on top of the caustic makes it difﬁcult to specify reliably its morpho-kinematical
properties. The lens model used in the present work is very crude and so is also that used by
P18: none of these allows for local inhomogeneity of the lensing potential, they describe it in very
general terms; the vicinity of the caustic is particularly difﬁcult to model reliably, small variations
of the lensing potential having strongly ampliﬁed effects in the construction of the images. As we
shall see in the next section, the overall remarkable agreement between model and observations

warning: measuring the velocity dispersion requires a careful evaluation of the contribution of
rotation within the ﬁnite angular resolution of relevance. Making the angular acceptance smaller

Summary and conclusions,10,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,23,23
"The present study of the emission of the CO(2-1) molecular line by the host galaxy of quasar
RX J1131 uses ALMA observations of unprecedented quality; they have been previously analysed
in much detail by their proponents, [18], P18. We have shown that the HST images of the quasar
and of the lens galaxy are very well reproduced by a simple lensing potential, sphere+external
shear. We obtained parameters that are in agreement with the results of previous authors within
errors. We discussed the uncertainties attached to the model parameters and their correlations and
explained them by remarking that these results probe only the environment of the eastern cusp of
the caustic. At this stage, the validity of the model at larger distances, in the region covered by the
emission of the host galaxy, cannot be taken as granted. But we demonstrated its validity from our
analysis of the ALMA observations of the CO(2-1) line emission. We reduced the raw data and
produced cleaned images, at variance with P18 who perform their analysis in the uv plane. We
obtained morpho-kinematics properties of the gas that are in good agreement with the results of
P18. We used two different methods for de-lensing these images, which produce source brightness
distributions in agreement with each other as well as with the P18 results. We have shown that the
general morphology of the image is dictated by the properties of the lens and conﬁned within a
band bracketing the critical curve. This leaves in practice no freedom to conceive lensing potentials
that would be signiﬁcantly different from those that we and other authors have been using.
It
guarantees the robustness of the results obtained by P18 within observational uncertainties.",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,1730,103
"We used polar coordinates better adapted to this geometry than Cartesians to reveal very
clearly the evidence for rotation. We looked for possible deviations from the predictions of a
simple rotating disc model, in particular for the possible presence of a companion as was predicted
by L17 using Plateau de Bure observations of much less good angular resolution than the ALMA
observations; but our analysis did not support such a presence. We paid special attention to the red-
most velocity interval, which displays a particularly complex morphology. We found evidence for
enhanced emission revealing a signiﬁcant deviation from the prediction of the simple disc model.
However the associated hot spot in the source plane overlaps the caustic, implying important
uncertainties on its de-lensed properties.",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,807,101
We discussed the rotation curve in some detail and argued that it probably rises faster than,10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,92,92
"assumed by P18 in the vicinity of the quasar; we noted that the angular resolution is such that
the dispersion of the rotation velocity within the beam size in the image plane causes an important
effective broadening of the line width, which we evaluated in the range between 50 and 70 km s",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,290,99

However, uncertainties attached to the effect of noise prevent from giving a reliable evaluation of
the contribution of turbulence. This is at variance with the conclusion of P18 who attribute the high

the galaxy, which they compared with those of other similar galaxies. The nature of our study
