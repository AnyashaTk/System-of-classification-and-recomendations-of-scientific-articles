in the spectrometer. These misalignments and performance errors come from each of the three
main components of the spectrometer: the OGRE optic assembly, the OGRE grating modules,",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,271,91
and the OGRE detector assembly. An additional error arises from the in-ﬂight pointing error of,11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,94,94
"the payload. Each of these misalignments and performance errors modiﬁes the observed LSF
from the idealized LSF by increasing its extent in the dispersion and/or cross-dispersion direction.
This behavior directly impacts the achievable spectral resolution and/or the effective area of the
spectrometer. Additionally, misalignments can shift the centroid of the LSF on the detector. These
shifts can move important spectral lines of Capella off of the detector, impacting the science return
of the spectrometer. Thus, each potential performance error and misalignment must be analyzed
to ensure the OGRE performance requirements are met.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,636,101

"Beyond the ﬁnite performance of the optic, additional grating-related errors are introduced into the
observed LSF of grating spectrometers. In OGRE, these grating-related errors arise from ﬁve main
sources: aberrations induced by the diffraction geometry, the ﬁnite performance of the individual
gratings within the grating module, and three misalignments during the construction of the grating
module and the alignment of this grating module to a 60° azimuthal section of the OGRE optic
assembly. Each of these ﬁve error sources will be discussed in the following subsections.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,577,100
2.2.1 Diffraction Geometry Aberration,10,NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal,,37,37
The ﬁrst contribution to the OGRE LSF from the gratings in the spectrometer comes from the,11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,90,90
"diffraction geometry itself. While the goal of a reﬂection grating spectrometer such as OGRE is
to exactly reproduce the optic PSF at dispersion, this rarely happens in practice. Aberrations are
induced into the system which blur the diffracted-order LSF and cause it to diverge from the optic
PSF. These aberrations can arise from several sources, including diffraction-induced astigmatism
and the sampling of a curved focal plane with a ﬂat detector. For OGRE, the grating positions were
numerically optimized such that these aberrations were eliminated in the dispersion direction at Fe",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,589,99

the extent of the LSF in the cross-dispersion direction grew slightly durin this numerical optimiza-
tion exercise; the LSF error in the cross-dispersion direction was 60.5 µm HPD. A summary of this
induced LSF error is listed in Table 2 as “Diff. Aberration”.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,343,100
2.2.2 Grating Performance,10,NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal,,25,25
"The second contribution to the LSF from the gratings is the aberration due to the ﬁnite resolution
of the gratings that form an OGRE grating module. The OGRE spectrometer is designed to utilize
gratings with a radial groove proﬁle and a groove period of 160 nm at a distance of 3300 mm
from the hub of the converging grooves.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,325,98
10,7,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,2,2
"However, the processes used to manufacture these
gratings will introduce errors that cause the manufactured groove pattern to deviate slightly from",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,147,98
"the idealized groove pattern. This deviation is expected to be a random process; therefore, the
groove period at any given location on a grating will have a Gaussian distribution about its nominal
value. From Eq. 2, this Gaussian groove period error will manifest on the focal plane as a Gaussian
error in the dispersion direction. These Gaussian period errors do not impact the cross-dispersion
extent.",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,403,100

– the pointing stability of the payload during ﬂight. The frequency of this movement is expected
to be higher than the readout cadence of the detector, so the jitter of the payload about the source
will artiﬁcially increase the size of the source. This therefore impacts the extent of the observed",11,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,395,100
