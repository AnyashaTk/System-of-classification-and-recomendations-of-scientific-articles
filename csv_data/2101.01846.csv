ABSTRACT,9,CMR10,,8,8
"While magnetic ﬁelds likely play an important role in driving the evolution of protoplanetary disks
through angular momentum transport, observational evidence of magnetic ﬁelds has only been found
in a small number of disks. Although dust continuum linear polarization has been detected in an
increasing number of disks, its pattern is more consistent with that from dust scattering than from
magnetically aligned grains in the vast majority of cases. Continuum linear polarization from dust
grains aligned to a magnetic ﬁeld can reveal information about the magnetic ﬁeld’s direction, but not
its strength. On the other hand, observations of circular polarization in molecular lines produced by
Zeeman splitting oﬀer a direct measure of the line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld strength in disks. We present
upper limits on the net toroidal and vertical magnetic ﬁeld strengths in the protoplanetary disk AS
209 derived from Zeeman splitting observations of the CN 2-1 line. The 3",9,CMR10,,972,103

"respectively, and 6.2 and 5.2 mG on the net vertical magnetic ﬁeld on the red and blue sides of the
disk. If magnetic disk winds are a signiﬁcant mechanism of angular momentum transport in the disk,
magnetic ﬁelds of a strength close to the upper limits would be suﬃcient to drive accretion at the rate
previously inferred for regions near the protostar.",9,CMR10,,354,103

disk wind system modeled in Suriano et al. (2018) pre-
dicts that the disk magnetic ﬁeld will have both toroidal

"ization observations of protoplanetary disks was to ﬁnd
evidence of dust grain alignment to disk magnetic ﬁelds
(e.g., Stephens et al. 2014; Rao et al. 2014; Segura-Cox
et al. 2015). However, the polarized emission seen in
many disks at these wavelengths is better explained by
dust scattering of thermal emission (e.g., Kataoka et al.
2015; Yang et al. 2016, 2017). While possible evidence of
grain aligment to disk magnetic ﬁelds has been found in
the circumbinary disks BHB07-11 (Alves et al. 2018) and
VLA 1623 (Sadavoy et al. 2018; Harris et al. 2018), and
in the disk of HD 142527 (Ohashi et al. 2018), these ob-

In this case,
if the disk is not too optically thick, an individual line
of sight will contain CN emission from above and below
the disk midplane and thus sample gas with reversed
toroidal magnetic ﬁelds and thus Zeeman signals of op-
posite sign. The optical depths of the bright rings of AS
209 are estimated to be 0.46 and 0.52 at ALMA Band
6 (Dullemond et al. 2018) and should be much lower
in the gaps. It is likely that the bulk of the CN emit-
ting materials both above and below the disk midplane
contribute to the observed signals, which leads to a can-
cellation of the Zeeman signal. In this case, the Zeeman
measurement can signiﬁcantly underestimate the abso-
lute strength of the magnetic ﬁeld, as illustrated quan-
titatively by Mazzei et al. (2020, MNRAS, submitted).",9,CMR10,,826,58

circumstellar disk of AS 209, using 9 hyperﬁne compo-
nents of CN 2-1 in ALMA Band 6. Although we easily
detect the dust polarization of the disk, which is consis-
tent with previous Band 7 observations, we do not detect
any polarized emission in the CN lines. After correct-
