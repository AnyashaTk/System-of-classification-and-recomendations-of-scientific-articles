"The swampland conjectures from string theory have had some really interesting implications on
cosmology, in particular on inﬂationary models. Some models of inﬂation have been shown to be
incompatible with these criterion while some have been shown to be severely ﬁne tuned, with most of
these problems arising in single ﬁeld inﬂationary models in a General relativistic cosmology. Recent
works have although optimistically shown that single ﬁeld models in more general cosmologies can
be consistent with these conjectures and hence there is an optimism that not all such models lie in
the swampland. However a paradigm of inﬂation which has been shown to not be perfectly okay
with the conjectures is eternal inﬂation. So in this work, we discuss Tachyonic inﬂation in the high
energy RS-II Braneworld scenario in the context of the swampland conjectures while also considering
the possibility of swampland consistent eternal inﬂation. We show that our concerned regime evades
all the prominent swampland issues for single ﬁeld inﬂation being virtually unscathed. After this,
we show that the main conﬂicts of eternal inﬂation with the swampland can easily be resolved
in the considered tachyonic scenario and in particular, we also discuss the exciting prospect of a
Generalized Uncertainty Principle facilitating the notion of Swampland consistent eternal inﬂation.",8,CMR9,,1368,100

INTRODUCTION,8,CMBX9,,12,12
"The idea of Cosmic Inﬂation has achieved a tremen-
dous amount of success in describing various properties
of the early universe [1–5]. Numerous predictions of
Inﬂation for the early universe have been repeatedly
validated by various satellite experiments, and the most
recent data from the Planck experiment follows this
trend [6–9]. Further the observational data supports a
huge variety of Inﬂationary models which are motivated
from vastly diﬀerent backgrounds, from Modiﬁed gravity
theories to quantum gravitational realizations [10–20].
Inﬂation has not only been thoroughly studied in regimes
where the inﬂaton is a scalar or a vector ﬁeld, but also for
very non standard scenarios as well where the Inﬂaton is
a complex scalar, a tensor or even a tachyonic ﬁeld [21–
31] . A form of Inﬂation which has attained widespread
interest in the cosmological community in recent decades
is Eternal inﬂation [32–43]. Perhaps the most starkling",9,CMR10,,942,60
"outcome of Inﬂation continuing eternally is the pro-
duction of a ”Multiverse”, as Inﬂation does not have
to stop everywhere at once and can keep on happening
in some parts of space while it ceases in some other parts.",9,CMR10,,218,59
"There has been a lot of work dedicated towards a
” Theory of Everything ” in recent years, and arguably
the most well known candidate for such a paradigm is
String Theory [44–52]. As String theory presents itself in
such a vivid mannerism, one can reasonably expect this",9,CMR10,,270,58
"theory to have wide ranging implications for cosmology.
Consequently, there is a rich and diverse amount of",9,CMR10,,107,55

impli-

the many cosmologically intriguing features of string
theory is the incredibly high amount of possible vacua

states it allows, which goes as high as
goes to constitute what is known as the ”landscape” of
string theory. A natural question which then arises is
exactly what class of low energy eﬀective ﬁeld theories
are actually consistent with String theory.
In a bid
to answer this question, Vafa introduced the term
”Swampland” to refer to the class of low energy eﬀective
ﬁeld theories which are inconsistent with the framework
of String theory. [61]. Further, in recent years a number
of ﬁeld theoretic UV completion criterion from string
theory called the ”swampland conjectures ” have been
proposed [62–66] which classify whether a given regime
lies in the swampland or not. As string theory is also
seen by many as a viable paradigm of quantum gravity,
if a low energy EFT satisﬁes these criterion then it",9,CMR10,,814,57
"could also potentially be on amicable terms with a self-
consistent theory of quantum gravity. While there have
been a considerable number of swampland conjectures
(and their modiﬁcations) proposed in recent times, the

implications are :",9,CMR10,,290,56

"These conjectures have pretty interesting implica-
tions on cosmology and in particular on single ﬁeld
inﬂation. It was shown in [71] that single ﬁeld inﬂation
in a GR based cosmology is not consistent with these
conjectures, considering the data on Inﬂation [6, 7]. A
lot of work has been done to alleviate this conﬂict [72–
75]. It has ,however, been shown that if the background
cosmology for single ﬁeld inﬂation is not GR based then
this regime of inﬂation can still be consistent with the
swampland criterion [76–79]. Particularly, in [80] it was
shown that (cold) single ﬁeld inﬂation can be consistent
with these criterion in a large class of non-GR based
cosmologies.
It’s also worth noting that the paradigm
of warm inﬂation [13] has also been shown to be quite
consistent with the swampland criterion for
single
models in both GR and non-GR based cosmologies
[81–87].
Another swampland conjecture which has
gathered quite an immediate interest with regards to",9,CMR10,,970,57
"inﬂationary cosmology is the recently proposed ”Trans
Planckian Censorship Conjecture”(TCC) [66].
It was
shown in [88] that single ﬁeld GR based inﬂationary
models can only be consistent with the TCC if they are
severely ﬁne tuned, which is quite ironic considering that
inﬂation was made to solve the ﬁne tuning problem in
standard big bang cosmology. A lot of work has further
been done to understand the issues of the TCC with

"Single ﬁeld models in non standard inﬂationary regimes
have been shown to not be severely ﬁne tuned due to the
TCC, unlike their counterparts models in a GR based
cosmology [96, 97]. The current literature on inﬂation
and the swampland criterion hence suggests that these
conjectures support the notion that early universe",9,CMR10,,322,55

inﬂation were also in conﬂict with the dS conjecture. It,9,CMR10,,56,56
"was then shown by Kinney [101] that eternal inﬂation
can be consistent with the Reﬁned dS conjecture (3),
and this could prevent eternal inﬂation from being in
the swampland( as it has been shown that consistency
if not both, can prevent a
with either of (2) or (3),
paradigm from plunging into the swampland [64] ). But
it was then shown by Brahma and Shandera in [102] that
eternal inﬂation can actually not be consistent with the
Reﬁned dS conjecture as well. In addition to this, Wang
et.al [103] showed that the Gibbons-Hawking entropy
bounds for eternal inﬂation are also not consistent with
the swampland conjectures , which is again a very
serious issue for eternal inﬂation. Hence, it does look
like eternal inﬂation has some unavoidable conﬂicts with
the conjectures. However, a key point all of the ventures
discussed above is that they considered eternal inﬂation
in a GR based cosmology.The situation does look a tad
bit better in more general cosmologies , as Lin et.al
showed in [104] that certain hilltop models of eternal
inﬂation in a braneworld cosmology can be consistent
with the dS conjecture and its reﬁned form. This is
encouraging and could point towards the idea that in
order for eternal
inﬂation to be consistent with the",9,CMR10,,1249,57
"swampland conjectures, one should look towards regimes
which are motivated by String theory (as braneworld
cosmology also has its roots in string theory [105–107]).",9,CMR10,,164,57
"A regime of inﬂation which was inspired from string
theory itself is tachyonic inﬂation [21], where the inﬂa-
ton ﬁeld is considered to be of tachyonic nature. This
paradigm of inﬂation has been shown to be consistent
with the swampland criterion in a GR based cosmology
for a warm inﬂationary setup [28] under some condi-",9,CMR10,,322,57
"tions. Tachyonic inﬂation has also been studied in a
braneworld background cosmology [24, 29, 108], so it
would be quite interesting to see if tachyonic inﬂation
on the RS-II Brane is consistent with the conjectures,
as these scenarios for single ﬁeld cases have always been",9,CMR10,,274,57
"on relatively amicable terms with the conjectures as
compared to GR based paradigms. Further, eternal
inﬂation with tachyonic ﬁelds in the braneworld can
present a great chance of being consistent with the
conjectures and the reasons for that are two-fold. First,
braneworld inﬂationary scenarios have proven to be a
great ﬁt with the swampland conjectures in a diverse
range of regimes and this cosmological setup, as noted
above, traces its roots in string theory itself. Secondly,
tachyonic models of inﬂation are also inspired by string
theoretic properties and hence, one can be optimistic
in exploring the consistency of such a string inﬂuenced
regime with the conjectures for eternal inﬂation. Indeed,
in our paper we show that this is indeed the case and
hence, this paper is structured as follows.
In section
II, we discuss some of the basic features of tachyonic
inﬂation after which we show that tachyonic inﬂation-
ary models in the high energy RS-II Braneworld are
virtually unscathed by the swampland conjectures and",9,CMR10,,1030,58
are consistent with all of the criterion individually too.,9,CMR10,,58,58

tachyonic scalar ﬁelds in a braneworld scenario suﬀers
no issues with the swampland conjectures and ﬁnally in
Section IV, we conclude with some ﬁnal remarks on our
explorations.",9,CMR10,,233,55

the Generalized Uncertainty Principle based corrections
make in allowing us to evade the entropy bound issues

such a regime is consistent with the swampland, however,

onic inﬂation in the high energy RS-II Braneworld sce-
nario in the light of the swampland conjectures and con-
sidered the possibility of swampland consistent eternal
inﬂation in this regime. We started oﬀ by describing
why tachyonic inﬂation in this particular scenario could
possibly be one of the most suited arenas for the swamp-
land conjectures and hence, might allow for the possi-
bility of evading the swampland issues eternal inﬂation
too. Then after describing some basics of Tachyonic in-
ﬂation in this regime, we showed that this inﬂationary
model is virtually unscathed by the swampland conjec-
tures and can quite intrinsically evade all the prominent
swampland issues which have been discussed for regular
single ﬁeld inﬂation, as they only imply a lower bound
on the inﬂation energy scale which can be easily satis-",9,CMR10,,887,57
ﬁed in the considered high energy limit. We then cast,9,CMR10,,53,53
"our glance towards eternal inﬂation in this scenario, and
discussed the two main swampland issues in this context
where we ﬁrstly addressed the curvature amplitude issue.
We showed that the basic eternal inﬂation requirement of
quantum ﬂuctuations dominating over classical ﬁeld evo-
lution does not set unavoidable constraints on tachyonic
models of any kind and in particular, inﬂation in high en-
ergy RS-II Braneworld. We hence showed that the issues
of inconsistency of the dS and reﬁned dS conjectures with
the perturbation requirement do not hold good for our
tachyonic regime. We then discussed the conﬂict of en-
tropy bounds with the dS conjecture and showed that our
concerned inﬂationary regime does not have any issues
with the entropy bound even when the concerned entropy
formalism is the standard Bekenstein-Gibbons-Hawking
one, as the lower limit on the energy scale implied for con-
sistency with the bound is well within the range needed
for consistency with basic inﬂationary swampland issues.
Then made the case as to why it would be better suited
if we consider quantum corrections to the BGH entropy

"tainty Principle corrected entropy formalism. In order to
focus on this particular correction to the entropy, we only
considered the leading order GUP corrections to the en-
tropy and showed that a GUP formalism of the entropy
allows one to evade the entropy bound issues in both
tachyonic inﬂation in our concerned scenario and even in
a usual single ﬁeld model in a GR based cosmology. This
allowed us to make a startling observation that a gen-
eralized uncertainty principle actually facilitates one to
have a swampland (and hence possibly, a quantum grav-
itationally) consistent picture of eternal inﬂation and a",9,CMR10,,618,59

not carried out a detailed analysis of eternal inﬂation in
any kind of a tachyonic regime as we have just focused on
showing how the prominent swampland-eternal inﬂation
