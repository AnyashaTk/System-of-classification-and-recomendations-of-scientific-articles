"employs a plane-parallel matrix operator multiple-scattering model (Plass et al., 1973). In",9,CMR10,,91,91
"this model, integration over zenith angle is done with a Gauss-Lobatto quadrature scheme,",9,CMR10,,89,89

this approach has some drawbacks: 1) it requires two sets of calculations at two diﬀerent,9,CMR10,,89,89

The latitudinal variation of cloud-top methane mole fraction with latitude observed,9,CMR10,,83,83
here in 2018 seems little changed from that seen by HST/STIS in 2003 (Karkoschka,9,CMR10,,80,80

Having now developed a scheme that matches the observed spectra of Neptune from 800,9,CMR10,,83,83
"– 900 nm, the next step will be to reproduce the appearance of Neptune at other wavelengths",9,CMR10,,91,91
to see if our ﬁtted cloud/methane model is more generally applicable. There will be two,9,CMR10,,87,87
main challenges to this:,9,CMR10,,24,24
"1. Firstly, extending to shorter wavelengths the contribution of Rayleigh scattering be-",9,CMR10,,88,88
"comes more important, which limits our ability to see to deeper cloud layers. However,",9,CMR10,,86,86
more importantly for the MUSE-NFM observations is the fact that the full-width-,9,CMR10,,79,79
half-maximum (FWHM) of the point-spread-function (PSF) becomes signiﬁcantly,9,CMR10,,75,75
worse.,9,CMR10,,6,6
"It can be seen in Fig. 1 that even at 800–900 nm, there is a considerable",9,CMR10,,73,73
residual oﬀ-disc signal due to the PSF. We could have tried to model this in our ﬁt-,9,CMR10,,84,84
"ting procedure, but concluded that it was simpler to limit ourselves to locations not",9,CMR10,,85,85
"too near the disc edge in the Minnaert analysis. However, this would become more",9,CMR10,,80,80
"diﬃcult to justify at shorter wavelengths. Instead, in future work we hope to take our",9,CMR10,,86,86
"existing model, calculate the appearance at shorter wavelengths, and convolve with",9,CMR10,,82,82
"a PSF model, which still needs to be developed. By thus simulating the shortwave",9,CMR10,,80,80
observations we will be able to see if we can discount more of the possible cloud/haze,9,CMR10,,86,86
"paramaterisation setups, which will help reﬁne our methane retrievals.",9,CMR10,,70,70
"2. Extending to longer wavelengths, the contribution of Rayleigh scattering becomes less",9,CMR10,,88,88
and the increasing strength of the methane absorption bands means that it is possible,9,CMR10,,85,85
to probe the vertical extent and location of clouds more precisely. We would need,9,CMR10,,81,81
"to extend to J, H and K-band observations to see which of our cloud/haze setups",9,CMR10,,79,79
"can be discounted, using the fact that the opacity of small cloud particles will fall",9,CMR10,,85,85
–31–,8,CMR9,,4,4
manuscript submitted to,8,CMR9,,23,23

"more quickly with wavelength than large particles. However, this will mean trying",9,CMR10,,81,81
"to analyse observations taken at diﬀerent apparitions and with diﬀerent instruments,",9,CMR10,,84,84
which will mean that the cloud distribution will not be the same and that systematic,9,CMR10,,84,84
"errors in the photometric calibration and PSF characterisation will arise. In addition,",9,CMR10,,87,87
the complex refractive indices of the particles will be diﬀerent from those we have,9,CMR10,,83,83
derived at these wavelengths.,9,CMR10,,29,29
"Although these diﬃculties are not insurmountable, they will require careful evaluation",9,CMR10,,86,86
"and eﬀort to overcome, which is why we leave them as future work. However, it is clear from",9,CMR10,,91,91
this study that splitting the atmosphere of Neptune into a background zonal part (that can,9,CMR10,,90,90
be ﬁtted with a the Minneart limb-darkening scheme) and an additional spatially-varying,9,CMR10,,87,87
part due to discrete methane clouds greatly simpliﬁes the retrieval process and allows us,9,CMR10,,89,89
to eﬃciently reconstruct the entire 3-D structure of Neptune’s clouds and methane cloud-,9,CMR10,,88,88
top mole fraction. Our model is then simultaneously consistent with the observations at,9,CMR10,,87,87
all wavelengths under consideration and all locations on Neptune’s disc. The approach,9,CMR10,,85,85
could also be applied to observations of Neptune at other wavelengths and also Uranus and,9,CMR10,,89,89
