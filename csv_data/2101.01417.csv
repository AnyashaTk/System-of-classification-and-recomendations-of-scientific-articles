ABSTRACT,9,CMR10,,8,8
"If not properly accounted for, unresolved binary stars can induce a bias in the photometric deter-
mination of star cluster masses inferred from star counts and the luminosity function. A correction
factor close to 1.15 (for a binary fraction of 0.35) was found in (Borodina et al 2019), which needs
to be applied to blind photometric mass estimates. This value for the correction factor was found to
be smaller than literature values. In an attempt to lift this discrepancy, in this work the focus is on
higher order multiple stars with the goal of investigating the eﬀect of triple and quadruple systems
adopting the same methodology and data-set as in the quoted work. Then the result is found that
when triple and quadruple together with binary systems are properly accounted for, the actual cluster
mass (computed as all stars were single) should be incremented by a factor of 1.18
1.27, depending
on the cluster and when the binary fraction",9,CMR10,,946,103

INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"Binary and higher order multiple stars play a very important role in the dynamical evolution of star clusters, mainly
because dynamically active binary and multiple systems can absorb (negative) energy. In the case of globular clusters,
such systems are known to prevent the so-called gravo-thermal catastrophe (Heggie 1975; Sugimoto & Bettwieser
1983). As for open clusters, dynamically active pairs can inﬂate the parent cluster. According to theory, early on, during
a star cluster assembly, wide and close binary and multiple systems are forming, before the non-stationary, dynamically
young star cluster, starts to contract. Then wide systems (and dynamically active pairs) tend to be disrupted during
this contraction phase (Parker et al. 2009, 2011; Parker & Reggiani 2013). Wide systems are forming again during
the expansion phase (Danilov 2020) which naturally follows the contraction. On the observational side, a deﬁcit of",9,CMR10,,934,122
dynamically active binaries has been identiﬁed in some nearest open clusters (Deacon & Kraus 2020; Danilov 2020).,9,CMR10,,113,113

"Therefore, the evolution of wide binaries (their number and location inside the cluster) and multiple stars can serve
as probe of open clusters’ dynamical state (Danilov 2020).",9,CMR10,,176,117
"The binary fraction changes (diminishes) during the evolution of a star cluster. Nevertheless, the distribution of
orbital parameters and the distribution of the stellar mass ratio are conserved keeping a memory of the primordial
binaries’ properties (see references in Borodina et al (2019)).",9,CMR10,,293,114
"The dynamical evolution of stars in close binary systems in star clusters generate diﬀerent types of exotic stellar
objects, such as blue straggler stars (Carraro & Seleznev 2011; Boﬃn, Carraro & Beccari 2015), millisecond pul-
sars (de Menezes et al. 2019), cataclysmic variables (Belloni & Rivera Sandoval 2020), X-ray binaries (van den Berg
2020), binary black holes (Fragione et al. 2020), and so on. The loss of material enriched by elements produced in
CNO cycle during the mass transfer in massive interacting binaries constitutes one of possible scenarios for the origin
of the multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (Renzini et al. 2015).",9,CMR10,,658,119
"The presence of unresolved binary and multiple systems can distort the estimates of the cluster mass determined both
by the velocity dispersion (Seleznev et al. 2017; Rastello et al 2020) and by the cluster luminosity function obtained
from star counts (see a discussion in Borodina et al (2019)).",9,CMR10,,297,118
"The present study follows up Borodina et al (2019) study where the inﬂuence of unresolved binary stars (UBS)
on the estimate of open star cluster (OSC) mass derived through its luminosity function (LF) was investigated. In

HIGH ORDER STELLAR SYSTEMS IN STAR CLUSTERS,9,CMR10,,43,43
"No much data are available in the literature on the presence and abundance ratios of multiple systems in star clusters.
For the multiple systems ratio we take the data from Mermilliod et al.
(1992) for the Pleiades cluster, which should
be more appropriate for the case of OSCs than the ﬁeld stars’ data from Tokovinin (2014). Anyway, Tokovinin (2014)
found for stellar systems with multiplicity of 1:2:3:4:5 (“1” stands for single stars, “2” for binaries, “3” for triples, “4”
for quadruples, and “5” for quintuples) the relative abundance ratios of 54:33:8:4:1. These estimates were obtained
compiling data in the solar neighborhood. The population of multiple stars in stellar clusters might be signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent, though. For instance, Mermilliod et al.
(1992) found the relative abundance ratios of 56:30:2 for stars in
the Pleiades cluster (singles, binaries, and triples). A similar work was performed by Mermilliod & Mayor (1999)
for Praesepe cluster as well. They found the relative abundance ratios of 47:30:3 for stars of diﬀerent multiplicity.
Mermilliod (2001) considered diﬀerent sources of incompleteness in the search of binary and multiple systems and",9,CMR10,,1171,125
"concluded that “in spite of the large eﬀorts undertaken, the available material is still incomplete at several levels”.

"It is readily seen that even in the case of adopting the multiple star ratio for Galactic ﬁeld (Tokovinin 2014) the
cluster mass increment does not exceed 1.20 for the speciﬁc value of the binary fraction of 0.35. In the more realistic
case of multiple star ratio for the Pleiades cluster (Mermilliod et al. 1992), the cluster mass increment does not exceed
1.16. Then, the value of Khalaj & Baumgardt (2013) of 1.35 for the mass increment can not be explained with the
luminosity-limited pairing (Borodina et al 2019).",9,CMR10,,519,121
"We deem that the likely explanation of the Khalaj & Baumgardt (2013) value for the cluster mass increment could
be following. If the binary fraction is 0.35 and the second components of the binary systems are distributed with
the same mass function as the primary components, then an addition to the cluster mass should be just 0.35 of
the cluster mass in the case of single stars only (which is “primary-constrained random pairing” as described by
Kouwenhoven et al.
(2009)). Such approach is quite reasonable, for example, when one sets up an initial cluster
model for N-body experiments. However, such arguments contain a mistake when one estimates the cluster mass from
photometric data because the luminosity of the binary star composed in this way would be larger than the observed
one.",9,CMR10,,792,113
"Khalaj & Baumgardt (2013) determined the mass of the Praesepe cluster following this logical path. First, they
selected probable cluster members and evaluated their masses using isochrone tables and treating them as single ones.",9,CMR10,,228,117
"Second, Khalaj & Baumgardt (2013) evaluated the mass of invisible low-mass stars and stellar remnants of massive
stars. Then, they assumed that 35 percent of stars were binaries and added the mass of secondary components taken
from the same mass function of single stars. As a result, the mass of each binary star would naturally increase by 35
percent on average. In turn, however, the luminosity of every binary star would also increase (and its stellar magnitude",9,CMR10,,465,120

"Table 2 lists the UBF values for star clusters considered in Borodina et al (2019) and in this paper for two cases of
spatial resolution for binary components. The ﬁrst one corresponds to the 2MASS resolution (4 arcsecond) and the
second one corresponds to the Gaia DR2 resolution (we take 0.5 arcsecond as ambiguity limit). The cluster distances
were taken the same as in Borodina et al (2019).",9,CMR10,,395,117
"One can readily see that even for Gaia DR2 resolution the fraction of unresolved binaries keeps high. The probability
to detect resolved binary depends on the component mass ratio and the limiting stellar magnitude of the sample.
Independently on the visibility of the secondary component, a resolved binary would behave as a single star for the
purpose of deriving the cluster mass.",9,CMR10,,383,117
"When using Gaia data, one would need to ﬁnd which fraction of binary and multiple systems is unresolved in the",9,CMR10,,110,110

"We plan to investigate the population of the resolved binaries in nearest open clusters in the future, especially
when the new Gaia data release (DR3) is publicly available. The key point for such investigation is the accuracy of
astrometric parameters and the presence of accurate radial velocities. We also plan to investigate the population of
unresolved binaries with photometric data and spectroscopic monitoring of bright stars in nearest clusters.",9,CMR10,,454,116

CONCLUSIONS,9,CMR10,,11,11
"In this study we investigated the eﬀect of unresolved multiple stars (binaries, triples, and quadruples altogether) on
Galactic clusters’ mass estimates as obtained from clusters’ LF built through star counts. We used the same LF data
and the “luminosity limited pairing” method as described in Borodina et al (2019).",9,CMR10,,317,118
"The data on the multiple stars’ ratio were taken from Mermilliod et al. (1992) for the Pleiades open cluster and from
Tokovinin (2014) for the general Galactic ﬁeld in the solar vicinity.",9,CMR10,,187,117
"The inspection of Figure 1 and Table 1 allows one to conclude that mass estimates obtained considering all stars as
single should be corrected for factors which depend on the ratio of binary and multiple stars. The correction factor,
which implies always a mass increment, ranges from 1.18 to 1.27 (for a binary ratio of 0.35 as Khalaj & Baumgardt
(2013) determined for the Praesepe cluster).",9,CMR10,,392,117
"The correction factor depends on the considered cluster only marginally. On the contrary it shows quite a signiﬁcant
variation whether either ﬁeld stars or Pleiades multiple star percentages are adopted.
As expected, increasing multiple stars ratio, the mass increment turns out to be larger. Therefore, the mass correction",9,CMR10,,323,119
is larger if one adopts ﬁeld stars’ percentages for binary and multiple systems.,9,CMR10,,80,80
"Ideally one should obtain an independent, cluster by cluster, binary and multiple star percentage. In fact, the Pleiades
cannot be fully representative of every star cluster, since any individual star cluster has diﬀerent mass at birth and
undergoes diﬀerent dynamical evolutionary history. All this aﬀects the number and nature of binary and multiple
systems present at any given time.",9,CMR10,,386,120
"It is expected that the third data release (DR3) will be very helpful to obtain more information on binary percentages.
Key also is the cluster distance which determines the amount of binaries we detect as unresolved, given the Gaia DR3
ﬁxed spatial resolution.",9,CMR10,,261,119
