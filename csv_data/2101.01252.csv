Introduction,11,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,12,12
"Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays provide access to hadronic interactions at energies well beyond those
achievable with human-made accelerators, albeit only through the measurement and interpretation of the
extensive air showers that they induce. These air showers are initiated in collisions of primary cosmic rays
with nuclei comprising the upper atmosphere. What results is a cascade of billions of particles with a
footprint in excess of 10 km",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,443,108
2,7,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1,1
"at the ground for primaries of the highest energies, which can exceed 10",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,72,72
20,7,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,2,2
"eV.
Chains of reactions of secondary mesons and baryons form the hadronic cascade of a shower. Upon losing
suﬃcient energy, the probability for charged mesons to decay exceeds that of further interaction and muons
are produced. These muons serve as tracers of the hadronic component. The electromagnetic component of
air showers is born and fed predominantly from the decay of neutral pions and rapidly proliferates through
subsequent cycles of pair production and bremsstrahlung.",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,480,106
"Consisting of a hybrid design of ﬂuorescence telescopes overlooking a massive surface detector array, the
Pierre Auger Observatory [1] is the largest detector of extensive air showers in the world. The ﬂuorescence
detector consists of 27 telescopes spread between 4 sites that measure the evolution of extensive air showers
as they traverse the atmosphere towards the ground. It provides a calorimetric measurement of the shower
energy through integration of the measured longitudinal proﬁles of ﬂuorescence light, which is emitted
by nitrogen molecules following their excitation by passing charged particles overwhelmingly belonging to",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,637,109

", which is a well-studied, mass-sensitive variable that agrees reasonably well in its absolute
value and evolution with energy between models. As the depth of shower maximum inversely scales with
mass, showers induced by primaries of lower mass are statistically distinguishable from those of heavier
mass. Overlooked by ﬂuorescence detector is the massive 3000 km",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,364,104

"eV has now been corroborated by a number
of experiments as summarized in [2]. With its various hybrid capabilities and unequaled exposure at the
highest energies, the Pierre Auger Observatory is equipped to measure a number of hadronically-sensitive
air shower observables and has played a key role in conﬁrming and characterizing this deﬁcit. A compilation
of these observables is given here, where it is evident that the measured number of muons exceeds model
expectations to an extent irreconcilable by mass composition arguments constrained by complimentary
measurements of the electromagnetic component of showers.",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,619,107

"Resolving the deﬁcit in model predictions of the number of muons requires an increase in the energy
routed to the hadronic component of extensive air showers. Although increasingly disfavored, this could
occur in the initial, highest energy interactions, where exotic phenomena could play a role. Alternatively,
this routing could be achieved over many generations of shower development.",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,387,107
"The large-scale upgrade to the Pierre Auger Observatory [11], termed AugerPrime, will increase its
sensitivity to hadronic interactions and the composition of cosmic rays by disentangling the electromagnetic
and muonic components of extensive air showers. The highlight feature of AugerPrime is a 4 m",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,300,108

Surface Detector, currently being deployed atop the existing water-Cherenkov detectors. Its relatively higher
sensitivity to the electrons of the electromagnetic shower component will allow for the deconvolution of the
muonic and electromagnetic contributions to detector signals. This disentanglement will improve access to
the magnitudes of the diﬀerent shower components and hadronic interactions on an event-by-event basis.",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,440,109
