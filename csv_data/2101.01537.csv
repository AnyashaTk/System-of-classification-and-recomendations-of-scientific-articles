Abstract,11,Calibri-Italic,,8,8
"The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) links baryonic mass of rotationally supported galaxies to their 
flat disk velocities. A popular form of the BTFR linked to MOND is based on an empirically determined 
characteristic acceleration, a",11,Calibri,,240,106
0,6,Calibri,,1,1
"that serves as the constant of proportionality. In this work, we propose an 
alternative, parametric form of the BTFR employing individual galactic properties from the SPARC galaxy 
database. Based on this data we find that a precise mass-velocity correlation is possible taking into 
account galactic disk radius and two dynamical related properties; mass discrepancy and disk surface 
density. We find no need to invoke a characteristic acceleration constant although its ansatz can be 
extracted and compared to several recent analyses also arguing against the MOND interpretation of a",11,Calibri,,588,104
0,6,Calibri,,1,1
". 
This improved BTFR finding has ramifications for the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) as well. Rather 
than a universal relation that describes the dynamics of all rotationally-supported galaxies, we find the 
RAR consists of a statistically distributed family of curves, reflecting the unique properties attributed to 
individual galaxies.",11,Calibri,,345,109
