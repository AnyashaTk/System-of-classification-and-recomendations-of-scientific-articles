"The precision anticipated from next-generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys will
create opportunities for characteristically new insights into cosmology. Secondary anisotropies of
the CMB will have an increased importance in forthcoming surveys, due both to the cosmological
information they encode and the role they play in obscuring our view of the primary ﬂuctuations.
Quadratic estimators have become the standard tools for reconstructing the ﬁelds that distort the
primary CMB and produce secondary anisotropies. While successful for lensing reconstruction with
current data, quadratic estimators will be sub-optimal for the reconstruction of lensing and other
eﬀects at the expected sensitivity of the upcoming CMB surveys.
In this paper we describe a
convolutional neural network, ResUNet-CMB, that is capable of the simultaneous reconstruction
of two sources of secondary CMB anisotropies, gravitational lensing and patchy reionization. We
show that the ResUNet-CMB network signiﬁcantly outperforms the quadratic estimator at low noise
levels and is not subject to the lensing-induced bias on the patchy reionization reconstruction that
would be present with a straightforward application of the quadratic estimator.",8,CMR9,,1237,100

INTRODUCTION,8,CMBX9,,12,12
"Observations of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) have provided a wealth of cosmological informa-
tion. The coming generation of CMB surveys, includ-
ing those from Simons Observatory [1], CCAT-prime [2],
CMB-S4 [3], PICO [4], and CMB-HD [5], will map the
CMB with unprecedented precision. In addition to pro-
viding greater sensitivity to primary CMB intensity and
polarization ﬂuctuations, next generation observations
will allow for much more precise measurements of sec-
ondary CMB anisotropies [6].",9,CMR10,,507,55
"Secondary anisotropies of the CMB are generated by
interaction of CMB photons with structure which in-
tervenes between our telescopes and the surface of last
scattering. Prominent sources of secondary anisotropies
include weak gravitational lensing by large-scale struc-
ture (see [7] for a review); the various manifestations
of the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich eﬀect [8–12], which describe
Compton scattering of CMB photons with free electrons
in galaxy clusters and the intergalactic medium; the in-
tegrated Sachs-Wolfe [13] and Rees-Sciama eﬀects [14],",9,CMR10,,548,56
"characterizing how time-dependent gravitational poten-
tials alter the energy of CMB photons; and the moving
lens eﬀect [15], where the transverse motion of massive
objects imprints temperature ﬂuctuations on the CMB.
The sensitivity of upcoming experiments should allow
some of these eﬀects to be detected for the ﬁrst time in
the coming years [16–24]. These secondary anisotropies
act both as a source of cosmological information and as
a source of confusion for the primary anisotropies.",9,CMR10,,490,56
"Sources of secondary anisotropies can be reconstructed
due to the changes they imprint on the statistics of",9,CMR10,,107,54
"the primary CMB ﬂuctuations.
In particular, the pri-
mary CMB anisotropies are expected to be well described
by nearly Gaussian ﬂuctuations that can be fully char-
acterized by their power spectra",9,CMR10,,196,55
C,9,CMMI10,,1,1
,6,CMMI7,,0,0
". Sources of sec-
ondary anisotropies break rotational invariance, induce
oﬀ-diagonal correlations between the spherical harmonic",9,CMR10,,129,55
"coeﬃcients, and cause the observed statistics to be non-
stationary. This change to the statistics can be observed
in the data, and thereby can be used to reconstruct the
ﬁeld causing the distortion [25, 26].",9,CMR10,,208,57
"The standard technique for reconstructing distortions
of the CMB ﬂuctuations utilizes a quadratic estimator,
constructed from a weighted product of two factors of
CMB ﬂuctuations [25]. The quadratic estimator has been
used to great success to detect the eﬀects of gravita-
tional lensing at high signiﬁcance with existing CMB sur-
veys [27–29]. While the quadratic estimator works well
with current data, it will be sub-optimal at the sensitivity
anticipated in the next generation of CMB surveys. One
reason for this is that higher order eﬀects of the sources of
secondary anisotropies become too important to ignore in
very high ﬁdelity CMB maps, and use of the quadratic
estimator results in an estimate of the distortion ﬁeld
whose variance is limited by secondary anistropies rather
than by instrumental noise. This challenge can be over-
come by using maximum likelihood estimators [30, 31] or
by iteratively removing the eﬀects of the secondaries [32].
Another limiting factor in the use of the quadratic esti-",9,CMR10,,1017,61
"mator is that the presence of more than one distortion
ﬁeld can lead to biases in the reconstructed ﬁelds. This
bias can be avoided at the cost of increased variance with
the use of ‘bias-hardened’ estimators [33].",9,CMR10,,214,58
"One of the main motivations for an accurate recon-
struction of the CMB lensing ﬁeld is related to the search
for primordial gravitational waves. CMB polarization
can be split into curl-free",9,CMR10,,190,58

"Delensing the CMB is useful beyond the beneﬁts it
provides for primordial gravitational wave searches [41].
For example, delensing the temperature and",9,CMR10,,150,57
E,9,CMMI10,,1,1
"-mode po-
larization leads to sharper peaks in the power spectra,
allowing for a better determination of parameters which
impact peak positions [41, 42]. Delensing can also re-
duce the oﬀ-diagonal covariance induced by lensing [41]
and thereby improve the sensitivity of the CMB to other
eﬀects, such as primordial non-Gaussianity [43].",9,CMR10,,337,55
"In order to achieve the goals of next generation CMB
surveys, delensing will be necessary (see e.g. [3, 44, 45]).
However, achieving the required delensing performance
is not without challenges. Delensing algorithms that
go beyond the quadratic estimator are under develop-
ment, but the implementations can be computationally
intensive [31, 46–48].
In the near-term, delensing the
CMB using external tracers of the lensing ﬁeld holds
promise [49], though at improved sensitivity, internal de-",9,CMR10,,493,60
"lensing, whereby the CMB is delensed using a map of
the lensing ﬁeld reconstructed from the observed CMB
map, will be necessary to achieve the best delensing per-
formance [32].
Internal delensing can lead to biases in
the delensed CMB map, though these biases can be mit-
igated without much loss in sensitivity by splitting the
data appropriately [50].",9,CMR10,,354,57
"Reionization, the process by which the neutral gas
ﬁlling the Universe became ionized by the ﬁrst stars
and galaxies between redshifts of about 20 and 6, was
a complex and non-uniform process [51–59]. The spa-
tial variations or patchiness in the process of reioniza-
tion leads to eﬀects on the observed CMB temperature

primordial gravitational waves [72].",9,CMR10,,103,56
"Quadratic estimators have been designed to recon-
struct the spatial variations in optical depth that result
from patchy reionization [65, 66]. However, when ap-",9,CMR10,,161,58
"plied to maps of the lensed CMB, the patchy reioniza-
tion quadratic estimator will be biased by the eﬀects of
lensing, since both eﬀects lead to mode-coupling and the
estimators are not independent [73].
In principle, the
lensing estimator is also biased by the presence of patchy
reionization, though the bias to the lensing estimate is
expected to be small because the eﬀects of patchy reion-
ization are much smaller than those of lensing. These
biases can be mitigated with delensing, and they can be
essentially avoided with bias-hardening at the cost of a
small increase to the variance of the estimator [73]. So",9,CMR10,,619,58
"far, only upper limits on the eﬀects of patchy reioniza-
tion exist [74, 75], though the eﬀects may be detectable
in future data [76].",9,CMR10,,134,56
"In this paper, we apply the techniques of machine",9,CMR10,,49,49
"learning to reconstruct the eﬀects of patchy reionization
in simulated CMB data. It has been shown recently that",9,CMR10,,112,57
2,9,CMR10,,1,1
"machine learning is capable of producing promising re-
sults for lensing reconstruction and delensing at noise
levels where the quadratic estimator is sub-optimal [77].
The focus of this work is to extend the techniques of
Ref. [77] to the simultaneous reconstruction of CMB lens-
ing and patchy reionization. As described above, recon-
structing patchy reionization in the presence of lensing
is challenging due to the extra variance coming from
lensing-induced",9,CMR10,,462,57

layer of the encoder, the minimum representation, and
learns how to combine them to achieve the desired out-
put. Starting from the minimum representation which is
an abstract base, it is up-sampled while detail is added
through consecutive convolutional layers. The ﬁnal re-

"Some localization information is lost through down-
sampling. To combat this, the outputs of some layers
in the encoder phase can be concatenated with those of
the same size in the decoder. The concatenations are
with respect to the channel dimension and are called
skip connections. As the output is reconstructed from
the minimum representation, the skip connections pro-
vide high resolution information just after up-sampling.
These skip connections in combination with a convolu-
tional autoencoder were introduced for the purpose of
biomedical segmentation, and the resulting architecture",9,CMR10,,594,56

phase in the U-Net often mirror each other in both depth
and the locations at which up- or down-sampling occur.

U-shape, hence its name.",9,CMR10,,250,57

layers, it has been shown that performance and accuracy
of the network decreases [85–87]. Residual connections,

tional layer, allow more layers to be added to the network
without degrading performance by helping to propagate
parameter corrections to earlier layers and information
to latter ones, through direct identity paths [86, 88, 89].

"modes is limited by the signal-to-noise
ratio at those small scales. For the case of patchy reion-
ization this issue is of particular importance since its ef-
fects are much smaller than lensing. This problem can
potentially be partially mitigated by using higher resolu-
tion maps to include smaller physical scales, which should
improve the reconstruction on all scales. Accommodat-
ing maps of a diﬀerent resolution requires extensive re-
structuring of the network to ensure that features on all
scales are being properly analyzed by the network while",9,CMR10,,556,60
"ensuring VRAM constraints are not exceeded. Another
avenue to consider would be to ﬁrst train the network on
patchy reionization maps with a magniﬁed signal, then
slowly decrease the signal magnitude until the ﬁducial
amplitude is reached. This method, used in Ref. [99]
for a diﬀerent purpose, could help with the reconstruc-
tion on scales dominated by noise. On the other hand,
the noise levels where signiﬁcant gains seem possible are
much lower than those of currently planned CMB sur-
veys, meaning that optimization in that very low noise
regime may not lead to much practical improvement with
forthcoming data.",9,CMR10,,618,57
"One extension to our work that could improve patchy
reionization reconstruction is to consider a broader set of
input maps. One simple addition is to include CMB tem-
perature maps in addition to polarization. More realistic
simulations would also include correlations between the
patchy reionization ﬁeld and the matter density, leading
to correlations with the lensing ﬁeld, galaxy counts, or
other tracers of structure. If such correlations were in-
cluded, one could also consider adding maps of the cos-
mic infrared background, surveys of galaxies, or 21-cm",9,CMR10,,563,59
"intensity maps, the addition of which has been shown
to improve patchy reionization reconstruction by other
means [100–102].",9,CMR10,,124,54
"Another extension of our work would be treat more re-
alistic simulations, for example by adding astrophysical
foregrounds or anisotropic noise. Applications of ma-
chine learning to simulated foregrounds on the full sky
are already showing promising results [78]. Addressing
the complications presented by more realistic simulations
is a necessary step if machine learning is to be usefully
applied to the data collected by upcoming CMB surveys.",9,CMR10,,446,57
"We found a few modiﬁcations of standard machine
learning techniques to be beneﬁcial for our purposes. We
included a batch normalization layer in all of our residual
connections, contrary to the standard implementation of
residual connections [86, 88]. We found that the inclusion
of the batch normalization layer lowered validation loss",9,CMR10,,336,59
14,9,CMR10,,2,2
"across all outputs, thereby improving all reconstructions.
The success of this change in our network prompts fur-
ther questions about whether similar changes would be
beneﬁcial to other machine learning applications. When
training the network, we included in the training set some
maps which had both lensing and patchy reionization set
to zero. We found this to be necessary for the trained net-
work to successfully pass the null test for patchy reioniza-
tion reconstruction. Without the null maps in the train-
ing set, we found that the network returned non-zero es-
timates for the patchy reionization signal, even when no
patchy reionization was present in the maps of the test
set. This procedure of including a subset of maps with
varying conditions into the training set can be explored
for further possible improvements to the network. The
potential beneﬁts of this modiﬁed subset training method
should not be understated. Not only were the impacts
to the quality of the reconstructions minimal, the change
to the training also ﬁxed a problem in the predictions of",9,CMR10,,1077,60
"the trained network without requiring any modiﬁcation
to the architecture.",9,CMR10,,74,53
"We did not explore the generalization of our predic-
tions to maps generated with diﬀerent cosmological pa-
rameters. Further tests are required to determine how
well the network is able to reconstruct patchy reioniza-
tion and lensing in CMB maps generated assuming dif-
ferent cosmologies. The success of the modiﬁed subset
training provides a positive indication that a similar tech-
nique could be applied to improve the generalization ca-
pability of the network without much negative impact to
the results.",9,CMR10,,512,60
"In order to be useful for constraining cosmological pa-
rameters, the predictions made by any estimator need to
be incorporated into a framework that is capable of rig-
orously quantifying uncertainties. Once trained, making
predictions with ResUNet-CMB is very computationally
eﬃcient, and so the network provides good candidate to
be included in a Monte Carlo exploration of posteriors.
Another possibility would be to incorporate ResUNet-
CMB into a Bayesian framework like that described in
Ref. [47].",9,CMR10,,505,56
"Our results act as a proof of concept that machine
learning is capable of the simultaneous reconstruction of
two ﬁelds that lead to the distortion of the statistics of
CMB ﬂuctuations. It is natural to ask whether machine
learning can also be usefully applied to the reconstruction
of other sources of secondary CMB ﬂuctuations, perhaps
by including additional maps as input. The ResUNet-
CMB network described here is a useful model for such
exploration, since new architecture aimed at similar tasks
can easily be constructed by simply modifying the inputs
and outputs of the publicly available network.",9,CMR10,,605,59
"The work presented here adds to the list of examples
that show machine learning is likely to play a positive
role in the future of cosmology, especially when applied
to the wealth of new data expected from forthcoming
cosmological surveys.",9,CMR10,,239,56
