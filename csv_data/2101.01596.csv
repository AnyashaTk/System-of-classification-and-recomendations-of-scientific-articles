ABSTRACT,8,NimbusSanL-Bold,,8,8
Aims.,8,NimbusSanL-Regu-Slant_167,,5,5
"Accretion and luminosity bursts triggered by three distinct mechanisms: the magnetorotational instability in the inner disk
regions, clump infall in gravitationally fragmented disks and close encounters with an intruder star, were studied to determine the disk
kinematic characteristics that can help to distinguish between these burst mechanisms.",8,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,347,136
Methods.,8,NimbusSanL-Regu-Slant_167,,8,8
"Numerical hydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk limit were employed to model the bursts in disk environments that
are expected for each burst mechanism.",8,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,157,118
Results.,8,NimbusSanL-Regu-Slant_167,,8,8

"burst mechanisms, which can be useful when identifying the burst origin. The disks in the stellar encounter and clump-infall models
are characterized by tens of per cent deviations from the Keplerian rotation, while the disks in the MRI models are characterized only
a few per cent deviation, which is mostly caused by the gravitational instability that fuels the MRI bursts. Velocity channel maps
also show distinct kinks and wiggles, which are caused by gas disk ﬂows that are peculiar to each considered burst mechanism. The
deviations of velocity channels in the burst-hosting disks from a symmetric pattern typical of Keplerian disks are strongest for the
clump-infall and collision models, and carry individual features that may be useful for the identiﬁcation of the corresponding burst
mechanism. The considered burst mechanisms produce a variety of light curves with the burst amplitudes varying in the",8,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,911,134

"Burst triggering mechanisms are associated with distinct kinematic features in the burst-hosting disks that may be used
for their identiﬁcation. Further studies including a wider model parameter space and the construction of synthetic disk images in
thermal dust and molecular line emission are needed to constrain the origin mechanisms of FU Orionis bursts.",8,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,358,129

1. Introduction,10,NimbusSanL-Bold,,15,15
"Protostars grow in mass through accretion from a surrounding
protostellar disk. The details of protostellar accretion are, how-
ever, not fully understood. One aspect that is currently under de-
bate is the behavior of protostellar accretion with time. Evidence
is growing that protostellar accretion is not constant or steadily
declining, but is highly variable (e.g, Contreras Peña et al. 2017;
Guo et al. 2020). FU-Orionis-type luminosity outbursts (FUors)
that are characterized by orders of magnitude increase in lumi-
nosity provide a prime example of accretion variability. A few
conﬁrmed dozens of such objects are known to date (Audard
et al. 2014; Connelley & Reipurth 2018a) and several new can-
didates are routinely discovered every year.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,751,67
"It is generally agreed that FUors are caused by a sudden in-
crease in the mass accretion rate from the disk on the protostar.
However, the mechanisms that trigger such an increase are un-
certain. These mechanisms include the magnetorotational insta-
bility (MRI) in the innermost disk regions prompted by a sudden
increase in the ionization fraction (e.g., Armitage et al. 2001;",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,380,65

"We use numerical hydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk
limit to explore accretion bursts in young stellar systems. Three
burst mechanisms were considered: triggering of the MRI in the
innermost disk regions, infall of gaseous clumps in a gravitation-
ally unstable disk, and encounter between a protoplanetary disk
and an intruder (sub)-solar-mass star. These models are referred",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,384,66

in the presence of rotation and large-scale magnetic ﬁelds (Basu

when the inner infalling layers hit the centrifugal barrier near the
inner computational boundary. The material passing through the
inner boundary forms the growing central star. The infalling core
continues to land at the outer edge of the circumstellar disk (a
reasonable approximation according to Visser et al. (2009)) un-

studied by Vorobyov & Basu (2015). This mechanism requires
massive gravitationally unstable disks prone to fragment. Grav-
itational interaction between the clumps and also between the
clumps and spiral arms causes the clumps to preferentially mi-
grate inward. Fast inward migration followed by tidal destruc-
tion delivers large amounts of matter to the inner disk regions
causing an accretion burst. This mechanism has recently been
conﬁrmed to operate also in disks around massive stars (Meyer",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,554,63

star is allowed to accrete matter from its surroundings and its

When calculating the velocity of the Keplerian disk we also take

the Keplerian disk is obtained by azimuthally averaging the sur-
face density of our model disk near the peak of the burst. For

features are caused by the spiral density waves that traverse and
perturb the disk. They are absent in the idealized Keplerian disk.
In general there are no strong deviations from the Keplerian ve-
locity channel maps for the inner several tens of astronomical
units of the disk because the spiral pattern is weakened there. No-
table deviations occur only in the outer disk regions in the vicin-

to address this point. However, the spiral arms causing these de-
