1. Introduction,11,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,15,15
"KM3NeT is a research infrastructure being constructed at the bottom of the Mediterranean
Sea. It consists of two neutrino detectors: ARCA (Astroparticle Research with Cosmics in the
Abyss) located off-shore Portopalo di Capo Passero, Sicily, Italy, at a depth of 3500 m and ORCA
(Oscillation Research with Cosmics in the Abyss) off-shore Toulon, France, at a depth of 2450 m.
The main purpose of the ARCA telescope is the detection of TeV-PeV neutrinos from astro-
physical sources or in coincidence with other high energy events, for example gravitational waves,
gamma ray bursts, blazar ﬂares. The ORCA telescope is designed to study the neutrino mass hier-
archy (NMH), using oscillations of the atmospheric neutrinos in the GeV range [1].",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,742,98
"Both KM3NeT detectors are based on the same technology [1]: vertically aligned detection
units (DUs), each carrying 18 digital optical modules (DOMs). Each DOM contains 31 3-inch
photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), calibration and positioning instrumentation and readout electronics
boards. The difference between ARCA and ORCA is the horizontal (90 m and 20 m respectively)
and vertical (36 m and 9 m respectively) spacing between the DOMs, which is optimised to search
for high- and low-energy neutrinos, respectively. The ﬁrst DUs are already taking data at both the",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,563,98
"ARCA and ORCA sites. Atmospheric muons represent an important background to the physics
analyses in a neutrino telescope, but they are also a useful tool to test the performance of the
detector and validity of the simulations. In this paper a comparison of the ﬁrst data collected so far
by ARCA and ORCA to the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations is presented.",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,354,102
2. Simulation chain,11,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,19,19
"The KM3NeT simulation chain shown in Figure 1 has a modular structure. The generation of
the atmospheric muon bundles is performed using two different codes: MUPAGE [2] and COR-
SIKA [3]. MUPAGE is a fast, parametric simulation code developed for the ANTARES experiment
[4] that generates muon bundles, induced by cosmic rays impinging the Earth atmosphere, at differ-
ent undersea depths and different zenith angles, on the surface of the active volume of the detector.
CORSIKA (COsmic Ray SImulations for KAscade) is a software package that simulates the inter-
actions of the primary cosmic ray (CR) nuclei in the upper layers of the atmosphere and follows the
development of the shower to a speciﬁed observation level (in this work it is the sea level). Their
energy spectrum is simulated following a power law,",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,815,101

"is chosen
by the user. The CORSIKA package is ﬂexible and allows the user to choose between different",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,101,91
models to describe the primary interactions and the composition of the CR primary ﬂux.,10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,86,86
"A dedicated software, called ""Corant"", has been developed to convert the CORSIKA output
format to the KM3NeT standard format of events and to evaluate the weights to be applied to
each event, according to the model of the CR composition chosen by the user. The propagation of
the muon bundles to the active volume of the detector is performed using a 3-dimensional muon
propagator contained in the gSeaGen [6] library, a GENIE-based [5] package designed mainly to
simulate neutrino interactions. After the muon bundle propagation, the Cherenkov photons emitted
along the path of muons and the probability of their detection by the DOMs are simulated with a
custom application developed for KM3NeT using multidimensional interpolation tables [7], called",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,752,96
"""JSirene"". The next step is the creation of a simulated data stream, similar to the data stream coming",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,102,102

account the front-end electronics behaviour. The same trigger algorithms used for real data are used
to identify possible interesting events in the simulated sample [8]. Finally, the simulated events
are processed with the same reconstruction programs used for the real data stream. At this stage
the simulated MC events can be easily compared to the calibrated data. A track reconstruction
algorithm is applied both to data and MC events. In this work only a track reconstruction code
(""JGandalf"" [9]) is considered, which is speciﬁcally designed to reconstruct atmospheric muons
and muons induced by neutrinos.",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,677,100

4. Conclusions,11,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,14,14
"Using the data taken with the ﬁrst KM3NeT detection units, it is possible to compare the mea-
sured and the expected muon rate at two different sites. The good level of agreement conﬁrms the
reliability of the simulation procedure deﬁned so far within KM3NeT. Sharing the same technology
and detection medium (sea water), the ARCA and ORCA detectors offer a unique opportunity to
probe the depth dependence of the atmospheric muon ﬂux without applying systematic uncertain-
ties related to comparison between different types of experiments [8].",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,544,96
"Once the simulation chain is well established, next steps foresee the increase of the simulated
samples, particularly at very high energies, and the study of the impact of the physics parameteres.
This includes the description of the hadronic interaction models in some regions of the phase space
that cannot be explored with accelerators, of the chemical composition of the primary CRs and",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,390,100
"of the optical properties of deep-sea water. A detailed study of the detection and reconstruction
efﬁciency can be also performed.",10,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,130,97
