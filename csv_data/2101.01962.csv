ABSTRACT,9,CMR10,,8,8
"A highly important aspect of solar activity is the coupling between eruptions and the surrounding
coronal magnetic-ﬁeld topology, which determines the trajectory and morphology of the event and can
even lead to sympathetic eruptions from multiple sources. In this paper, we report on a numerical
simulation of a new type of coupled eruption, in which a coronal jet initiated by a large pseudostreamer
ﬁlament eruption triggers a streamer-blowout coronal mass ejection (CME) from the neighboring hel-
met streamer. Our conﬁguration has a large opposite-polarity region positioned between the polar
coronal hole and a small equatorial coronal hole, forming a pseudostreamer ﬂanked by the coronal
holes and the helmet streamer. Further out, the pseudostreamer stalk takes the shape of an extended
arc in the heliosphere. We energize the system by applying photospheric shear along a section of
the polarity inversion line within the pseudostreamer. The resulting sheared-arcade ﬁlament channel
develops a ﬂux rope that eventually erupts as a classic coronal-hole-type jet. However, the enhanced
breakout reconnection above the channel as the jet is launched progresses into the neighboring hel-
met streamer, partially launching the jet along closed helmet streamer ﬁeld lines and blowing out the
streamer top to produce a classic bubble-like CME. This CME is strongly deﬂected from the jet’s initial
trajectory and contains a mixture of open and closed magnetic ﬁeld lines. We present the detailed
dynamics of this new type of coupled eruption, its underlying mechanisms and the implications of this
work for the interpretation of in-situ and remote-sensing observations.",9,CMR10,,1669,104

"across a vast range of sizes and time scales. At the
largest scales, eruptive active-region ﬂares produce sub-
stantial bubble-like coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that
can strongly inﬂuence near-Earth space weather (e.g.
Webb & Howard 2012). At the smallest end of the spec-
trum, tiny ﬁlament-channel eruptions form coronal jets
(e.g. Sterling et al. 2015). The ultimate unifying feature
of all these eruptions are ﬁlament channels, consisting of

ogy.",9,CMR10,,60,55
"A prime example of this variety is the array of erup-
tion morphologies that result from ﬁlament channels
formed within multipolar magnetic topologies. At the
largest scales, these eruptions can be triggered by the
systematic removal of strapping ﬂux by reconnection at
a coronal null point, magnetic breakout (Antiochos et al.
1999). Such events ultimately lead to fast, large-scale,
bubble-like CMEs (e.g., Lynch et al. 2008, 2009, 2016;
Karpen et al. 2012; Masson et al. 2013, 2019; Chen et al.
2016; Dahlin et al. 2019). At much smaller scales, both
observations (e.g. Sterling et al. 2015; Moore et al. 2018;
Kumar et al. 2018, 2019) and simulations (e.g. Wyper
et al. 2017, 2018, 2019) have shown that the same erup-
tion mechanism is at work in the mini-ﬁlament eruptions",9,CMR10,,778,59
"that form many coronal jets. The key diﬀerence deter-
mining the eruption morphology is how the erupting ﬂux
rope that forms from the ﬁlament channel interacts with
the surrounding magnetic ﬁeld. In jets, the ﬂux rope re-
connects at the null point low in the corona, transferring
magnetic twist and ﬁlament plasma to the surrounding
open ﬁeld and creating a narrow plasma ejection that
adds no new open ﬂux to the heliosphere. In eruptions
at active-region scales, on the other hand, the erupt-
ing ﬂux rope remains connected to the surface at both",9,CMR10,,549,58
"ends, opening new ﬂux into the heliosphere as part of",9,CMR10,,53,53
"the bubble-shaped CME. The local magnetic environ-
ment around the ﬁlament channel clearly plays a crucial
role in its eventual eruptive morphology.",9,CMR10,,148,55
"Perhaps the most deﬁnitive, and certainly the most
striking, example of the interaction between the ﬁlament
channel and its surrounding is the phenomenon of sym-
pathetic eruptions. That ﬂares can be sympathetic has
been known for many decades (e.g. Richardson 1951),
but sympathetic eruptions have attracted much atten-
tion recently due to the high-cadence, full-Sun coronal
observations of",9,CMR10,,392,56

"(e.g., Schrijver &
Title 2011; Titov et al. 2012; Jin et al. 2016). By exam-
ining a series of eruptions that included ﬁlament ejec-
tions, ﬂares, and CMEs, and whose locations covered
a large fraction of the solar surface, Schrijver & Title
(2011) presented compelling observational evidence that
the sympathetic nature was due to the reconnection in
the corona of neighboring magnetic ﬂux systems, as oc-
curs in the breakout model. Subsequent numerical mod-
eling by T¨or¨ok et al. (2011) and Lynch & Edmondson",9,CMR10,,513,57
"(2013) demonstrated that null-point reconnection in the
corona, as in breakout, naturally couples diﬀerent ﬂux
systems and leads to the sympathetic eruptions. A key
feature of these and other studies, both observational
and theoretical, is that each eruption has its own ﬁla-
ment channel. Consequently, each ﬂux system is primed
to erupt and one simply destabilizes the next. Our new
work presented here, in contrast, shows that a coupled
eruption of multiple ﬂux systems can be driven by a sin-
gle ﬁlament channel. Furthermore, it shows that break-
out reconnection can energize, as well as destabilize, cou-
pled eruptions.",9,CMR10,,627,59
"The vast diﬀerence in scales and energies between
eruptions that produce large-scale, bubble-like CMEs
versus small-scale, collimated coronal jets implies that
there is a continuum of eruption scenarios in between,
uniﬁed by the role of breakout reconnection in dictating
the eruption morphology. One scenario in this middle
ground is a ﬁlament eruption from a pseudostreamer. At
ﬁrst glance, pseudostreamers have the same topology as
coronal jets, simply on a much larger scale. Figure 1",9,CMR10,,488,56
"shows a SWAP image of a pseudostreamer harbouring
a small ﬁlament observed on the limb.
In proﬁle, the
pseudostreamer topology resembles that of a single null
point above two coronal arcades, which sit between coro-
nal holes of like polarity. The presence of this multipo-
lar topology assures that, like mini-ﬁlament coronal-hole
jets, pseudostreamers can host ﬁlament eruptions that
occur via magnetic breakout.",9,CMR10,,414,57

dostreamers leads to a much richer variety of mag-",9,CMR10,,103,52

"In this work, we present a simulation that addresses
both of these interactions, along with the speciﬁcs of the
pseudostreamer eruption itself. We constructed a large
pseudostreamer that has multiple null points and sepa-
rator lines (Fig. 2(a)), is bounded north and south by",9,CMR10,,276,58
"the polar and an equatorial coronal hole, and that par-
tially underlies the global helmet streamer that forms
the polar coronal-hole boundary to the east and west of
the pseudostreamer (Fig. 2(c)). The pseudostreamer is
rooted in a large, elliptical region of minority polarity
that represents a decayed active region. There are sev-
eral important diﬀerences between this simulation and
our previous studies of jets and CMEs. First, the “over-
lying” coronal ﬁeld consists of both open (coronal-hole)
and closed (helmet-streamer) ﬂux. In earlier work, the",9,CMR10,,557,57

"the neighboring helmet streamer, so that reconnection
between the pseudostreamer and helmet-streamer ﬂuxes
is possible. As we shall see, the breakout reconnection
indeed involves both the usual open/closed interchange
reconnection of jets (Wyper et al. 2018) and the usual
closed/closed reconnection of CMEs (e.g., Masson et al.
2019; Dahlin et al. 2019). Second, the reconnection in
the corona can occur at multiple null points and along
the separator line. Consequently, it could be expected
to be much more eﬃcient than single-null-point recon-
nection, but the eﬀect this should have on the eruption
is not clear. Highly eﬃcient breakout reconnection may
limit the amount of free energy that can be built up in
the ﬁlament channel; but it also may allow more of the
stored free energy to be released. Third, as will be shown
below, the ﬁlament channel that we formed extends over
a rather small fraction (",9,CMR10,,909,58

that an explosive eruption could be obtained with such
a small ﬁlament channel. Highly eﬃcient, multiple null-
point breakout reconnection could play a critical role in
the vigor of an eruption from our pseudostreamer.",9,CMR10,,278,59
"The results presented below show that the low-coronal
evolution of our pseudostreamer eruption is quite simi-
lar to that of a mini-ﬁlament jet, and that breakout re-
connection plays a similarly central role in dictating the
eruption morphology. However, rather than producing a
collimated jet-like expulsion of mass in the outer corona,
our simulated eruption generates a bubble-like CME by
blowing out the top of the adjacent helmet streamer.

open and closed ﬁeld lines that broadly follow the S-Web
arc. This result has important implications for in-situ

"within the negative-polarity strip, Fig-
ure 3(a). This naturally creates a system of at least
three nulls, one associated with each minimum (NP1
and NP3) and another that resides between them (NP2).
Two separators connect the three nulls along the top of
the separatrix surface dome. In the PFSS solution only
these three nulls were present. However, during the re-
laxation currents naturally developed around the nulls
and along the separators. Combined with changes in the",9,CMR10,,476,55
"ﬁeld around the pseudostreamer as the helmet streamer
relaxed, this led to a bifurcation of NP3 and the for-
mation of two further nulls, labeled NP4 and NP5, con-
nected by an additional two separators. Due to where we
store the magnetic free energy in our simulation, these
additional nulls are not involved in the eruption.",9,CMR10,,326,55
"The key elements of the pseudostreamer topology can
be understood by considering NP1, NP2, and NP3 (with
NP4 and NP5 understood by extension). The fan planes
of NP1 and NP3 form the main sections of the sepa-
ratrix surface that divide the closed ﬁeld beneath the
pseudostreamer from the surrounding open (or distantly
closing) ﬁeld in the rest of the corona (blue and red ﬁeld

"NP2 sit on the separatrix surface of the pseudostreamer
and its fan plane is aligned radially (yellow ﬁeld lines,
Fig. 2(a)). The spines of adjacent nulls actually bound
the fan plane of the other, so the radial partially open
fan plane of NP2 is bounded on either side by the closed
spines of NP1 and NP3. As a consequence, the fan of
NP2 must straddle the open-closed separatrix of the
helmet streamer (note the closed yellow ﬁeld lines ad-
jacent to NP1 and NP3, Fig. 2(a)). Therefore, there
must be two separators connecting the base of the helio-",9,CMR10,,551,57

for the shape of the boundary. Corridor formation also
is consistent with the observed shift of the outer spine of
NP1 into the open ﬁeld. A similar switch from tapered

"Recently, Kumar et al. (2021) identiﬁed observed EUV
dimmings above the breakout current sheet as a new di-
agnostic signaling the onset of breakout reconnection.
The dimming occurs due to depletion of plasma in the
surrounding volume as external ﬁeld sweeps into the
breakout sheet, reconnects, and ﬂows out along the
sheet as reconnection exhaust. Figure 5(b) shows a syn-
thetic EUV base-diﬀerence image of our simulation at

"The presence of the ﬂux rope makes it diﬃcult to be
unambiguous about the precise mechanism that triggers
the continued rise of the ﬂux rope towards eruption from
this time onward. Breakout reconnection certainly is key",9,CMR10,,219,56
"to maintaining the eruption once the ﬂux rope is rising
rapidly. However, it is possible that an ideal rise of the
ﬂux rope due to torus instability couples to the breakout
reconnection, to tip the evolution into a self-sustaining
feedback. A similar coupling associated with ideal kink
instability recently was shown to occur in simulations of
active-region periphery jets (Wyper et al. 2019). Com-
parisons of our results with those from a perfectly ideal-
MHD model (e.g. Pariat et al. 2009; Rachmeler et al.
2010), which is well beyond the scope of the current
investigation, would be required to address this issue
deﬁnitively. However, it is clear from the fast evolu-
tion following onset of reconnection of the ﬂux rope and
from the energy plots (both described in detail below)
that ideal instability of the ﬂux rope is not the dominant
process once the eruption is underway.",9,CMR10,,884,58

"the evolution of a mini-ﬁlament jet, but on a much larger
scale. Once the breakout reconnection gets underway,
the strapping ﬁeld above the ﬂux rope begins to be re-
moved and the ﬂux rope continues its rise, slowly at
ﬁrst. Figure 6(a) shows the same ﬁeld lines from Figure
5 2 hrs 13 min later. The ﬁeld lines are traced from ﬁxed

"dostreamer, Figure 6(b). As the last of the strapping
ﬂux is exhausted, the rising ﬂux rope becomes bent to-
wards the breakout current sheet over the top of the
south lobe, Figure 6(b). This bending of the ﬁlament-
channel ﬁeld, with or without ﬁlament/prominence ma-
terial, is a typical feature of pseudostreamer eruptions
(e.g. Panasenco et al. 2011; Kumar et al. 2018, 2021).
In addition to bending, the ﬂux rope accumulates more
ﬂux, as the reconnection in the ﬂare current sheet is en-
hanced by the stretching of the sheet as the ﬂux rope
rises.",9,CMR10,,553,57
"When the ﬂux rope reaches the breakout current
sheet, the system departs from its previously quasi-2D
evolution and enters a fully 3D phase, described below,
in which the ﬂux rope reconnects and a large fraction",9,CMR10,,211,55
"of the twist within the ﬂux rope is liberated. Exactly
analogous to mini-ﬁlament jets, this transfer of twist
launches an untwisting plasma jet characterised by a fast
radial velocity component (Fig. 6(f)) and oppositely di-
rected line-of-sight velocity components on either side of,
and extended along, the jet axis; see Figure 6(i). This

the ﬂare reconnection transitions from quasi-separatrix
layer reconnection to null-point reconnection, and the
positive-polarity footpoint of the ﬂux rope opens com-
pletely, Figure 7(c). The breakout current sheet is car-
ried upwards with the eruption, forming the interface
between the outwardly propagating twisted ﬁeld and
the untwisted ambient ﬁeld surrounding it. The over-
pressure of the magnetic ﬂux built up in the southern

S-WEB CONNECTIVITY & IMPULSIVE SEPS,9,CMR10,,35,35
"The mixture of open and closed ﬂux within the CME
provides a natural avenue of escape for impulsive SEPs
produced by the ﬂare. Although a full investigation of
the expected SEP signatures of this simulation is well
beyond the scope of this investigation, we can still make
some preliminary remarks based on the connectivity of
the CME. There are two potential scenarios where we
might expect SEPs to be impulsively accelerated and re-
leased in this eruption. The ﬁrst is the scenario explored
by Masson et al. (2013, 2019), whereby ﬂare reconnec-
tion",9,CMR10,,552,58
prior,9,CMTI10,,5,5
"to reconnection of the ﬁlament channel ﬂux
rope stores high energy particles within the ﬂux rope.
These are then promptly released when the ﬂux rope",9,CMR10,,148,54
"is opened by reconnection with external ﬁeld, in this
case when the ﬂux rope reaches the breakout current
layer. The second is that once the ﬂux rope opens the
ﬂare reconnection transitions to interchange-like recon-
nection at NP1, directly accessing open ﬁeld lines along
which SEPs could escape in a manner similar to a jet.
These two scenarios overlap at the moment the ﬂux rope
opens, but the latter would continue beyond the initial
ﬂux rope reconnection making them potentially distin-
guishable observationally.",9,CMR10,,519,56

the CME is fully developed. The circular region corre-
sponds to the open ﬁeld lines that wrap into the CME
ﬂux rope (cyan ﬁeld lines, Fig. 12). This is bordered on
one side by disconnected ﬁeld (yellow) within the helio-

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS,9,CMR10,,26,26
"In addition to observations of SEPs, our results
presented here on coupled pseudostreamer/helmet-
streamer eruptions have clear implications for under-
standing solar eruptions. First, we emphasize that the
assumed magnetic conﬁguration of a pseudostreamer
close to the helmet streamer, Figure 3, is quite com-",9,CMR10,,310,54
"mon on the Sun. The coronal hole pattern of Figure
2 in which a small coronal hole extension is separated
from the main coronal hole by a large parasitic polar-
ity region can be seen frequently in source surface maps
and is reﬂected in S-Web maps (e.g. Antiochos et al.
2011; Wang et al. 2012; Crooker et al. 2012; Titov et al.
2012). Furthermore, ﬁlament channels are very often
observed to form over the PIL of the parasitic region,
leading to a jet-like eruption (e.g. Filippov et al. 2013,
2015; Yang et al. 2015; Wang & Hess 2018; Kumar et al.",9,CMR10,,549,58
"2021), so the scenario described in this paper should",9,CMR10,,53,53
"be readily observed. We note that our scenario shares
some general features with streamer blowouts driven by
eruptions beneath the streamer, but near its edge (e.g.
Moore & Sterling 2007; Lugaz et al. 2011; Panesar et al.",9,CMR10,,221,56
"2016). The key diﬀerence is that in our scenario the
pseudostreamer has a substantial presence outside the
streamer, within the coronal hole.",9,CMR10,,141,53
"Another key point is that our jet eruption is some-
what special from a theoretical viewpoint in that it oc-
curs in a 3D system with multiple nulls and separator
lines. There have been many simulations of jets and
CMEs in the ubiquitous topology of a single null, but
to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst simulation of a ﬁla-
ment channel driven eruption in a multi-null/separator
topology. This topology allows for more copious recon-
nection, because the breakout current sheet now corre-
sponds to a deformed line segment rather than a de-
formed point. As argued in Antiochos et al. (1999),
the breakout mechanism requires reconnection to oper-
ate, but the reconnection must not be too “easy” if the
system is to be explosive. Our simulation veriﬁes that",9,CMR10,,758,56
"breakout can produce explosive eruption even in a gen-
eral pseudostreamer topology.",9,CMR10,,84,54
"The eruption from the actual pseudostreamer, how-
ever, is clearly a jet rather than a CME. We do not see
closed pseudostreamer ﬂux expanding outward into the
heliosphere. This results holds even though the pseu-
dostreamer of Figure 2 is quite large and, as discussed
above, the breakout reconnection is extended, more eas-
Instead, the pseu-

dostreamer ﬂux rope is completely destroyed by inter-
change reconnection either with the open ﬁeld or the
helmet streamer ﬁeld. We conjecture that this, in fact,
is the general result for an eruption from a unipolar
background as in a pseudostreamer or jet. The reasons
for this are that ﬁrst, a plasmoid in a unipolar back-
ground must have its twist component anti-parallel to
the background ﬁeld on one side or the other, so that
reconnection is inevitable. Second, the amount of ﬂux
in the pseudostreamer rope is limited by the ﬂux of the
parasitic polarity, which is generally small compared to
the background. However, if the ﬂux rope can survive",9,CMR10,,1032,56
out to the Alfv´en radius,9,CMR10,,25,25
∼,9,CMSY10,,1,1
10,9,CMR10,,2,2
R,9,CMMI10,,1,1
s,6,CMMI7,,1,1
", then any interchange
beyond this point has no eﬀect on the amount of escap-
ing ﬂux, because a closed ﬁeld line will still not retract
back down to the corona. Depending on the balance
between gas dynamic pressure and magnetic tension,
this result may hold even at somewhat lower radii, say
5",9,CMR10,,294,58
R,9,CMMI10,,1,1
s,6,CMMI7,,1,1
"or so. These arguments imply that in order for a
pseudostreamer eruption to produce a CME when the
pseudostreamer is deep within a coronal hole, the para-
sitic polarity must have an exceptionally large amount",9,CMR10,,209,55
"of ﬂux and the eruption must develop a high speed early
on, which requires that the ﬁlament channel be highly
sheared. Further simulations are required in order to
quantify the ﬂuxes and speeds required for an isolated",9,CMR10,,218,55
19,9,CMR10,,2,2
"pseudostreamer CME, if even possible, and observations
of pseudostreamer eruptions far from helmet streamers
are needed to test the conclusions.",9,CMR10,,144,54
"The situation is very diﬀerent for a helmet-streamer
eruption.
In this case the background ﬁeld is bidirec-
tional and parallel to the plasmoid on both sides. As
a result, interchange reconnection does not occur and a
plasmoid is free to propagate outward so that even small
plasmoids can survive indeﬁnitely in the heliospheric
current sheet (Higginson & Lynch 2018). Evidence for
this behavior can be gleaned from our simulation in Fig-
ures 10 and 12 and their associated animations, in which
twisted, closed helmet-streamer ﬁeld lines are swept up
in the CME and expand outwards within or adjacent
to the ﬁeld reversal that deﬁnes the heliospheric current
sheet. A key conclusion from these ﬁgures and anima-
tions is that not only does the ﬁeld of the CME consist of",9,CMR10,,771,58
"a mixture of closed and open ﬂux, but the plasma as well",9,CMR10,,56,56
"consists of a mixture of material that was in the large
outer loops of the helmet streamer and the small inner
loops of the parasitic polarity. This result has important
consequences for in-situ measurements of plasma com-
position. Even in the outer layers of a streamer-blowout
event, the plasma may have originated from the small
closed loops of a decayed active region, with a diﬀer-
ent FIP bias and freeze-in temperature from the helmet
streamer. Again, this result requires deﬁnitive testing
against data.",9,CMR10,,512,58
"This work also has important implications for under-
standing S-web dynamics. The bulk of the S-Web con-
sists of high-",9,CMR10,,119,52
Q,9,CMMI10,,1,1
"arcs that start and end on the helio-
spheric current sheet, as in Figure 14. All these arcs
are due to large parasitic polarity regions that produce
narrow or singular connections between coronal holes
(Antiochos et al. 2011; Titov et al. 2012; Scott et al.
2018, 2019). These polarity regions have PILs, which
will invariably become sheared with time; consequently,
the type of eruption that we calculated above is bound",9,CMR10,,422,56
"to be a frequent driver of the S-Web. Our results show
that the S-web is intrinsically coupled, in that strong
dynamics at one location are likely to lead to dynam-
ics elsewhere with the subsequent mixing of plasma and
ﬁeld lines. This conclusion may help explain the long-
standing puzzle of ﬂare SEPs with large longitudinal
extent (e.g. Dresing et al. 2012; Richardson et al. 2014)
although further work is required to conﬁrm this.",9,CMR10,,435,57
"Perhaps the most important and far-reaching conclu-
sions from this new type of coupled eruption are for un-",9,CMR10,,108,56

the global coronal magnetic ﬁeld. Taken alongside pre-
vious work, our results suggest that CMEs originating

"the helmet streamer or adjacent to it in a coronal hole,
should be expected to be deﬂected, have a more com-
plex morphology and to involve a mixture of open and
closed magnetic ﬁeld lines. Whereas eruptions from deep
within the closed ﬁeld will form classic CMEs and if our
conjecture is correct those from pseudostreamers deep
within coronal holes will form jets. Accurate global ﬁeld
modeling, supported by further simulation studies of the
coupling between eruptions and the global coronal ﬁeld,
is clearly then crucial to predicting and interpreting the
in-situ and remote-sensing observations being made by
current and future solar missions.",9,CMR10,,647,58
