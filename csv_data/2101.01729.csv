INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to be
ubiquitous within massive galaxies (Magorrian et al.
1997; Kormendy & Ho 2013), but it is still a mystery
why gas accretion rates onto these SMBH are low to neg-
ligible in some galaxies, and extremely high in others.
In order to power the most luminous quasars, nearly the",9,CMR10,,324,55
whole gas content of a massive galaxy must be funneled,9,CMR10,,54,54
"onto the black hole in a few hundred million years, or
roughly a dynamical time (Hopkins et al. 2008b). The
primary mechanism that triggers episodes of rapid ac-
cretion, which give rise to the observational signatures",9,CMR10,,218,56
"of active galactic nuclei (AGN), is still unclear. Galaxy
interactions oﬀer a compelling candidate for a number of
reasons. Mergers and interactions can dissipate angular
momentum and channel gas into galactic nuclei (Barnes
& Hernquist 1991; Springel et al. 2005a; Gabor et al.
2016; Blumenthal & Barnes 2018). This may simultane-
ously funnel gas onto the central SMBH and drive star
formation in the bulge, helping to explain tight observed",9,CMR10,,443,57
correlations between SMBH and galaxy bulge properties,9,CMR10,,53,53
"(Gebhardt et al. 2000; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; Mar-
coni & Hunt 2003; H¨aring & Rix 2004).",9,CMR10,,92,53
2,9,CMR10,,1,1
Sharma et al.,9,CMCSC10,,13,13
"Furthermore, major mergers can transform rota-
tion supported disk-dominated galaxies into pressure-
supported spheroid dominated galaxies, while AGN
feedback may eﬃciently heat and drive gas out of the
galaxy, leading to quenching of star formation. Thus,
a link between mergers and AGN triggering could ex-
plain the observed correlation between spheroid-like
morphologies and kinematics, and old stellar popula-
tions (Somerville & Dav´e 2015; Kormendy & Ho 2013,
It has been shown using em-
and references therein).
pirical and semi-analytic models that, under the ansatz
that mergers trigger AGN activity, the observed merger
rate can account for the observed evolution of the AGN
luminosity function (Hopkins et al. 2006, 2008b), as well
as the observed growth rate of quenched, spheroid dom-
inated galaxies (Hopkins et al. 2006, 2008a; Somerville
et al. 2008; Brennan et al. 2015).",9,CMR10,,889,57
"However, there are numerous other possible mecha-
nisms for fueling accretion onto black holes and thereby
AGN activity. Alternative mechanisms that can fun-
nel gas toward the centers of galaxies have been iden-
tiﬁed, including secular processes such as bar instabil-
ities (Kormendy & Kennicutt 2004; Hirschmann et al.
2012) and violently unstable and/or clumpy disks (Dekel
et al. 2009; Bournaud et al. 2011). Recycled gas from
the evolution of stars in the galaxy’s nucleus can fuel
signiﬁcant AGN activity (Ciotti & Ostriker 1997, 2007).
Cooling ﬂows from the hot halo are another proposed fu-
eling mechanism (Nulsen & Fabian 2000). Recent work
using high resolution simulations of massive ellipticals
have highlighted the importance of cooling ﬂows fueled
by stellar evolution in generating AGN outbursts (Gan
et al. 2019; Pellegrini et al. 2020; Gan et al. 2020).",9,CMR10,,872,56
"Observations do not oﬀer a clear picture of the connec-
tion between AGN and galaxy mergers. Some observa-
tional studies, using a variety of techniques, ﬁnd mergers
to be correlated with AGN activity (Sanders et al. 1988;
Koss et al. 2010, 2012; Ellison et al. 2011; Silverman",9,CMR10,,277,58

Ellison et al. 2019), while many others ﬁnd that mergers
do not correlate with AGN activity (De Robertis et al.

coalescence. However, they also ﬁnd the majority of
SMBH growth does not occur during mergers.",9,CMR10,,225,57
"Some simulations ﬁnd that mergers are diﬃcult to dis-
entangle from smooth accretion of gas, as these pro-
cesses tend to occur together in cosmological simula-
tions. Bellovary et al. (2013) trace the origins of gas
particles accreted by SMBHs in cosmological zoom simu-
lations, and ﬁnd SMBHs are not preferentially fueled by
either smoothly-accreted or merger-accreted gas. Simi-
larly, Menci et al. (2014) use semi-analytic models to in-
vestigate disk instabilities in AGN, and ﬁnd both merg-
ers and disk instabilities are viable candidates as the
dominant fueling mechanism.",9,CMR10,,581,58
"Finally, other simulations ﬁnd little to no connec-
tion between AGN activity and galaxy mergers. Stein-
born et al. (2018) ﬁnd that AGN in the Magneticum
Pathﬁnder cosmological simulation are nearly as likely",9,CMR10,,209,54
"as inactive galaxies to be found in a merging state, and
the majority of AGN activity is driven by stochastic
gas accretion. Using cosmological zoom simulations,
Pontzen et al. (2017) ﬁnd that mergers serve to en-
hance the quenching eﬀects of AGN feedback by me-
chanically disrupting the cold disk, but do not enhance
AGN activity. Finally, Hirschmann et al. (2012) show
that semi-analytic models where SMBH growth is driven
by mergers can reproduce the AGN luminosity function
at intermediate redshifts and luminosities, but an ad-",9,CMR10,,534,56
"ditional accretion mode via disc instabilities is required
in order to fully reproduce the number densities of the
most luminous AGN.",9,CMR10,,133,58
"There are a number of explanations for the confus-
ing status on the question of whether mergers play a
vital role in AGN activity and BH growth. First, select-
ing AGN is not a straightforward task. AGN emission
spans a broad range of wavelengths, and the radiation
can originate from many diﬀerent phenomena including
the accretion disk, dust obscuring structures, and jets.
Second, identifying galaxy mergers is also not a straight-
forward task. Mergers have been commonly identiﬁed by
visual inspection (Bridge et al. 2007; Jogee et al. 2009;
Darg et al. 2010; Kartaltepe et al. 2015; Rosario et al.
2015), close pairs (Lackner et al. 2014; Mundy et al.
2017; Mantha et al. 2018), non-parametric morphologi-
cal diagnostics (Conselice et al. 2003; Lotz et al. 2004;
Pawlik et al. 2016; Nevin et al. 2019), and statistical
learning techniques (Hocking et al. 2018; Goulding et al.
2018; Ackermann et al. 2018; Snyder et al. 2019). Each",9,CMR10,,939,58
"method may be particularly sensitive or insensitive to
certain merger stages, or may be limited by availability
of data. Few previous studies have attempted to select
both mergers and AGN",9,CMR10,,187,56

vational sample and a cosmological simulation in order
to robustly determine whether the AGN-merger connec-

"In this work we analyze a set of zoom-in cosmologi-

tween mergers and AGN activity. In particular we aim
to answer whether 1) AGN are more likely to be found in
disturbed or merging galaxies than a control sample, and
2) mergers/disturbed galaxies are more likely to host
AGN. Studying high-resolution galaxy simulations in a
cosmological context allows us to better understand how
AGN may be triggered by mergers, how SMBHs grow
during periods of merger activity, and how gas content
plays into SMBH fueling. In order to enable us to se-

the majority class when trained on unbalanced train-

to non-mergers, we perform a random undersampling of
the majority class (non-mergers) to bring the two classes
into balance. Results change little when we instead
apply random oversampling of the minority (mergers)

luminous AGN and quasars at high redshifts, and may
not provide good statistical representation of rare major
mergers. With only 30 halos, we are likely not sampling
the full diversity of halo merger histories.",9,CMR10,,654,58
"Our methodology itself has some caveats as well. As
seen in Figure 3, our automated classiﬁer performs well
in ﬁnding true mergers at the cost of incorrectly classi-
fying many non-mergers. The high impurity in our clas-
siﬁer means that it is often diﬃcult to disentangle the
eﬀects of the mock-observation process from the short-
falls of the classiﬁer. At low redshifts in Figures 11 and
13, we found an excess of merger fraction and AGN frac-
tion, respectively, for classiﬁed synthetic images. How-
ever, because of the above discussion along with the rel-
atively large uncertainties on the intrinsic fractions, we
caution against over-interpretation of the excess in the
classiﬁed synthetic image fractions.",9,CMR10,,714,58
"The intrinsic merger fractions in the lowest redshift
bin hint at a similar excess, however we are limited
by number statistics and cannot properly constrain the
diﬀerence. Although we partially mitigate the small
sample size in the synthetic images by generating im-
ages from multiple orientations, we caution against over-
interpreting the strength of this excess merger fraction.
Finally, there are many ways that mergers can be",9,CMR10,,432,57
"identiﬁed both within the simulation and in observa-

"Our study has yielded some important insights into
the AGN-merger connection and our ability to probe it
with observations.
It is clear that the simple picture
painted by binary merger simulations such as those pre-
sented by Hopkins et al. (2005) is not representative
of the results of modern cosmological simulations. The
reasons for these diﬀerences are not yet entirely clear,
and will be the subject of future studies, but we can
speculate on some of them. The most commonly used
initial conditions for the binary merger simulations are
1:1 mergers of thin, rotationally supported (Milky Way",9,CMR10,,597,56

the progenitors of most AGN hosts, particularly at high
redshift, which based on both simulations and observa-

tually thought to be",9,CMR10,,303,58

driven nuclear inﬂows, as most of the torque that drives
