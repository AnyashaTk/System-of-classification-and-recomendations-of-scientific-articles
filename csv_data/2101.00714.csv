use the “Fscan veto,” based on spectrograms of the data,
to eliminate candidates caused by nonstationarity and
spectral lines. Applying that veto resulted in the elimi-
nation of almost 1/4 of the frequency band of each search.
This was due to the wide “wings” of the veto account-
ing for varying Doppler shifts, spin-down values, and the
width of the Dirichlet kernel (used in computing 2",9,CMR10,,444,58

However, the same factors mean that template waveforms
have less overlap with stationary instrumental lines than
in shorter searches done previously, and so eliminating
this veto did not produce an unmanageable number of
candidate signals (see below).",9,CMR10,,254,57

"We used data from the Gravitational Wave Open Sci-

strain data sampled at 4 kHz. We downloaded all such
O1 data for the oﬃcial duration of the run (from GPS
times 1126051217 to 1137254417) from both interferom-
eters (H1 and L1), gating on only “CBC CAT1” vetoes.
These indicate disastrous conditions for the instruments,
such as loss of laser power. We ignored the other vetoes
used in searches for binary black holes and neutron stars
because they are aimed at short-duration disturbances
which are not signiﬁcant for continuous wave searches.
We then used the code",9,CMR10,,619,57

Suite [37] to generate 1800 s long short Fourier trans-

knee frequency of 7 Hz and windowed with the default

In the near future, with more and better data, we will
be able to extend this type of search to longer data sets
with lower noise, thereby increasing sensitivity. We will
also be able to beat the spin-down limits of more pulsars.
With improvements in our code, we will be able to take
advantage of the spin axis orientation for those pulsars
(such as the Crab) for which it is known and integrate
data sets with glitches in them.",9,CMR10,,489,58
