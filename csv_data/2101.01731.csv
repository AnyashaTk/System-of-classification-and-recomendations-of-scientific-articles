a major merger and rapidly cooled, with cool, star-forming gas raining back toward the core. This
unique system is an excellent case study for high-redshift clusters, where such phenomena are proving
to be more common. Further studies of such systems will drastically improve our understanding of

"INTRODUCTION
Early X-ray observations of the intracluster medium
(ICM) in the center of galaxy clusters revealed cooling
times much shorter than the Hubble time, leading to
the development of the cooling ﬂow model (e.g., Fabian
1994). In this model, hot gas in dense cores should ra-
diatively cool and fuel 100–1000 M",9,CMR10,,318,55

Nulsen 2012; Gaspari et al. 2020). Evidence supporting

as “strong CCs”. A number of observational studies have
found that CCs are mostly found in relaxed clusters while
NCCs reside in dynamically-active clusters. Indeed, all

"found in the most relaxed clusters (e.g., Phoenix (Mc-
Donald et al. 2012), Abell 1835 (McNamara et al. 2006),

variety of other studies that found star-forming BCGs in
the most relaxed CC clusters (Crawford et al. 1999; Don-
ahue et al. 2010; Molendi et al. 2016; Cerulo et al. 2019).
On the other hand, morphologically-disturbed clusters
(which are likely to be recent mergers) generally have
no evidence for ongoing cooling, suggesting that major
mergers may have the potential to destroy cool cores

low-redshift, the most star-forming BCGs tend to be lo-
cated in the most relaxed, cool-core clusters (Cavagnolo

in high-redshift BCGs tend to be higher in dynamically
active, non cool-core clusters (McDonald et al. 2016;
Bonaventura et al. 2017). CHIPS1911+4455 may rep-

support this scenario, depicting a disturbed cool core
elongated in the north-south direction. While the bulk
of the cool, star-forming gas extends along a southern-
pointing ﬁlament, there is a fainter blue ﬁlament that
connects the central BCG to the more northern X-ray
peak. This suggests that the northern X-ray peak might
contain low-entropy gas that is dislodged from the loca-
tion of the BCG. The existence of this system – a dynam-
ically active but rapidly cooling core – provides evidence
that mergers may stimulate star formation and enhance
cooling. This process would be especially relevant in the
distant universe when mergers were more common com-
pared to present time (Fakhouri et al. 2010).",9,CMR10,,816,58
"Closely related to this, in the chaotic cold accretion
scenario (CCA; e.g., Gaspari et al. 2019) turbulence is
a key ingredient to drive direct non-linear thermal in-
stability and extended condensation. During CCA the
global driver can be tied not only to AGN feedback, but
to mergers too, which can stimulate signiﬁcant amount of
turbulence (e.g., Lau et al. 2017) and density ﬂuctuations",9,CMR10,,390,58

summarized as follows:,9,CMR10,,22,22
1. We measure the ICM density in the core (,9,CMR10,,43,43

", which is within the low-
est ten percent for cluster cores from the ACCEPT
samples (Cavagnolo et al. 2009). The low entropy
core is a clear signature of strong cooling in the
center of the cluster.",9,CMR10,,199,50
"2. The X-ray morphology of CHIPS1911+4455 is
highly peaked in the center (96th percentile for
“peakiness”) and very asymmetric (7th percentile
for “symmetry”) compared to a large sample of X-
ray-selected clusters. This contradiction in its mor-
phology between a relaxed (peaky) cluster and a
dynamically active (asymmetric) cluster is highly
unusual, and is rarely observed.",9,CMR10,,376,53

tionally low core entropy, we propose that rapid
cooling in this system may have been triggered by
a dynamical interaction between two similar-mass
clusters. In this scenario, some of the low-entropy",9,CMR10,,239,51
"gas from the more massive cluster is dislodged
from the central AGN-hosting galaxy. For the
low-entropy gas separated from the central galaxy,
cooling is more favorable due to the longer mixing

cause of its exceptionally bright cool core that appears

a unique opportunity to understand the relationship be-
tween a merging galaxy cluster and star formation in its
BCG, which, in turn, unravels an alternative method to
form cooling ﬂows and massive starbursts apart from a",9,CMR10,,402,57
