INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
Very low surface brightness (vLSB) galaxies are es-,9,CMR10,,51,51
"sential to our understanding of questions ranging from
galaxy formation (e.g., Agertz & Kravtsov 2016) to cos-
mology (e.g., Giovanelli & Haynes 2016), but can be
diﬃcult to study at optical wavelengths. While vLSB
galaxies have been studied for decades (e.g., Disney
1976; Sandage & Binggeli 1984; Ellis et al. 1984; see also
reviews by, e.g., Bothun et al. 1997; Impey & Bothun
1997), more recent advances in low surface brightness
detection techniques (see Abraham & van Dokkum 2014;",9,CMR10,,486,58
Greco et al. 2018) have revealed increased numbers of,9,CMR10,,53,53

radii of several kpc; e.g., van Dokkum et al. 2015).
Dubbed “ultra-diﬀuse” galaxies (UDGs), these galaxies
have generated signiﬁcant attention for, among other
things, their potentially extreme dark matter properties
(e.g., van Dokkum et al. 2016, 2018; see also Trujillo
et al. 2019), and their implications for galaxy formation
models, since they make up a non-negligable fraction
of the total galaxy population (Jones et al. 2018; Prole
et al. 2019; Danieli & van Dokkum 2019).",9,CMR10,,503,57

have been detected in cluster environments (e.g., Koda
