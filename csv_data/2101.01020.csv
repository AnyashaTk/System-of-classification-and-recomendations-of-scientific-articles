"ABSTRACT
Magnetic ﬂux ropes (MFRs) rising buoyantly through the Sun’s convection zone are thought to be
subject to viscous forces preventing them from rising coherently. Numerous studies have suggested
that MFRs require a minimum twist in order to remain coherent during their rise. Furthermore, even
MFRs that get to the photosphere may be unable to successfully emerge into the corona unless they
are at least moderately twisted, since the magnetic pressure gradient needs to overcome the weight of
the photospheric plasma. To date, however, no lower limit has been placed on the critical minimum
twist required for an MFR to rise coherently through the convection zone or emerge through the
photosphere. In this paper, we simulate an untwisted toroidal MFR which is able to rise from the
convection zone and emerge through the photosphere as an active region that resembles those observed
on the Sun. We show that untwisted MFRs can remain coherent during their rise and then pile-up
near the photosphere, triggering the undular instability, allowing the MFR to emerge through the
photosphere. We propose that the toroidal geometry of our MFR is critical for its coherent rise. Upon",9,CMR10,,1185,101

"INTRODUCTION
An important unsolved problem in solar physics is the
origin of active regions on the photosphere and in the
overlying corona. While it is generally agreed that pho-
tospheric ﬂux distributions are due to the emergence of
sub-photospheric magnetic ﬁelds (Parker 1955; see also
review by Cheung & Isobe 2014) that are generated by
a dynamo process (Parker 1955; Moﬀatt 1978; Nelson &
Miesch 2014), the exact manner in which the magnetic
ﬁelds make their way from deep in the solar interior to
the solar surface is a matter of debate.",9,CMR10,,545,56
"First, magnetic ﬂux ropes need to be able to rise
through the convection zone. One method that has been
studied extensively in the literature is that of a buoy-
ant rise of magnetic ﬂux ropes (Parker 1955). In these
models, a ﬂux rope in the convection zone that is in pres-
sure balance with the outside ambient plasma is either in",9,CMR10,,332,58
"gravitational or thermal equilibrium with its surround-
ings. Since the magnetic pressure of the ﬂux rope lowers
its internal plasma pressure, if the ﬂux rope is in thermal
equilibrium, the density inside the ﬂux rope will be lower
than the density outside the ﬂux rope, while the temper-
ature inside and outside will be the same. Conversely, if
the ﬂux rope is in gravitational equilibrium, the temper-
ature inside the ﬂux rope will be lower than temperature
outside the ﬂux rope, while the density inside and out-
side will be the same. In this case, and in the absence of
convection, the ﬂux rope can remain stable in the convec-
tion zone until thermal conduction brings it into thermal",9,CMR10,,692,59

"decrease (assuming it maintains pressure balance), mak-
ing the ﬂux rope buoyant and causing it to rise. Thus,
the fate of a pressure balanced ﬂux rope is to be buoy-
antly unstable as a result of the density deﬁcit caused by
the added magnetic pressure. In this picture, therefore,
the rise of magnetic ﬂux ropes through the convection
zone is a buoyantly driven process. This model has been
used in numerous studies of ﬂux emergence (D’Silva &
Choudhuri 1993; Fan et al. 1993; Moreno-Insertis et al.
1994; Schussler et al. 1994; Galsgaard et al. 2007; Ar-
chontis et al. 2013; Knizhnik et al. 2018).",9,CMR10,,601,58
"One issue with this model is that it has been thought
that buoyantly rising ﬂux ropes require a critical twist
in order to maintain their integrity against viscosity-
generated vortical ﬂows that fragment the ﬂux ropes dur-
ing their rise (Parker 1979; Schuessler 1979; Longcope
et al. 1996; Moreno-Insertis & Emonet 1996; Emonet
& Moreno-Insertis 1998; Fan et al. 1998; Wissink et al.",9,CMR10,,385,56
"2000; Toriumi & Yokoyama 2011). While Rempel & Che-
ung (2014) showed that convection supports the integrity
of even an untwisted ﬂux rope against these forces so that
it can rise coherently through the upper portion of the
convection zone, in the absence of convection the twist
that is required to withstand viscous fragmentation is
unclear. Furthermore, if the ﬂux tube breaks up into
fragments, for ﬂux tube vortices with circulation Γ rising

MacTaggart & Hood (2009), though small, leaves open
the question of whether magnetic ﬂux ropes with even
smaller twists would be able to rise coherently.",9,CMR10,,358,57
"There is a further problem for ﬂux ropes that, having
survived the rise through the convection zone, make it
to the photosphere. It has been shown that a signiﬁcant
twist is needed in order to emerge through the photo-
sphere without the aid of convection, since the emergence
process is thought to occur through a magnetic buoy-
ancy instability (Parker 1955; Newcomb 1961; Thomas
& Nye 1975; Acheson 1979; Murray et al. 2006; Toriumi
& Yokoyama 2010; Archontis et al. 2013; Leake et al.
2013). In this picture, the photosphere forms an interface
separating low- and high-density plasma that is modiﬁed
by the pile-up of ﬂux just below the photosphere. Per-
turbations which bend the ﬁeld lines can easily grow,
since plasma drains from the concave down ﬁeld lines,
unburdening them and allowing them to rise further (Fan
2001).",9,CMR10,,829,58
Murray et al. (2006) found that ﬂux ropes needed to,9,CMR10,,51,51
"be at least moderately twisted to be able to exceed the
threshold for this instability, and that weakly twisted ﬂux
ropes were unable to emerge through the photosphere.

riumi & Yokoyama (2011) and found that it did, in fact,
emerge through the photosphere if given enough time,",9,CMR10,,157,55
and attributed the emergence to the magnetic buoyancy,9,CMR10,,53,53
"instability. They found that the emergence occurred
quite diﬀerently than a typical moderately twisted ﬂux
rope. Instead of forming a simple arcade in the corona,
such as that formed in the emergence of the toroidal ﬂux
rope of MacTaggart & Hood (2009), the weakly twisted
ﬂux rope formed two distinct arcades that they termed
‘magnetic lobes’, separated by a neutral line. The mag-
netic buoyancy instability allowed portions of the ﬂux
rope to emerge into the corona while keeping other parts
of the ﬂux rope submerged. The concave down portions
of the ﬁeld were able to emerge, whereas the concave
up portions containing heavy plasma remained stuck be-
low the photosphere. Additional plasma draining down
from the emerging loops onto the submerged loops exac-
erbated the situation. Further, they found that the two
lobes interacted and reconnected, causing a high speed
jet and a reconﬁguration of the ﬁeld.",9,CMR10,,912,56

riumi & Yokoyama (2011) and Archontis et al. (2013)

ropes will emerge or not, or whether there are additional
considerations in whether emergence occurs. Toriumi &

ent ﬁeld strengths and depth-to-radius ratios: Toriumi
& Yokoyama (2011) use a ﬁeld strength of 15 kG and
a depth to radius ratio of 20 whereas Archontis et al.

& Yokoyama (2011) was initially placed about 10 times
deeper than the ﬂux rope of Archontis et al. (2013). As
a result, a direct comparison is diﬃcult to perform and
there are indications that the ﬂux ropes of Toriumi &
Yokoyama (2011) did, in fact, emerge, or would have had
the simulation been run out for longer (see, for example,
Figure 10 of Toriumi & Yokoyama 2011). As a result,
the question of just how weakly twisted a ﬂux rope can
be before emergence is suppressed remains open.",9,CMR10,,528,57

nection, diﬀusion, and possibly kinking of the ﬂux rope as
it rises, the twist at the photosphere would consequently
be reduced.
In addition, signiﬁcant twist may remain
trapped below the photosphere (Fan 2009). Thus, twists
measured at the photosphere are unlikely to constrain

oval-like shape, before spreading out as the ﬂux rope ap-
proaches the surface. Although the ﬁeld weakens with",9,CMR10,,426,61

fragmenting of the ﬂux rope, and no evidence of vorti-
cal magnetic structures breaking oﬀ the rope, as is often
seen in weakly twisted 2D ﬂux ropes (Schuessler 1979;
Longcope et al. 1996). Evidently, this ﬂux rope is able
to maintain its coherence throughout its rise, despite the
generation of velocity vortices, implying that the curva-
ture of the axis plays an important role in maintaining
the integrity of the ﬂux rope (Abbett et al. 2000).",9,CMR10,,505,58

"An interesting feature of this simulation, seen in Fig-
ure 5, is the salt-and-pepper nature of the photospheric
magnetogram. It is reminiscent of observational signa-
tures, which are often attributed to the presence of con-
vection breaking up emerging ﬂux bundles (Kitiashvili",9,CMR10,,279,57
"et al. 2015), which then coalesce back into large scale
polarities (Dacie et al. 2016). Such salt-and-pepper fea-
tures have been observed in convectively unstable simu-

been seen in convectively stable simulations (",9,CMR10,,271,57

tive region displaying lots of salt-and-pepper ﬂux con-
centrations, which have previously been identiﬁed as the
result of convective ﬂows destroying the rising ﬂux rope
(Rempel & Cheung 2014; Dacie et al. 2017). However,
the simulation presented here shows that the undular in-
stability is a second mechanism which could account for",9,CMR10,,503,57

role in the coherent rise of that ﬂux rope, either because
viscous forces on a torus are important only over a very
short segment, or because plasma is able eﬀectively to
drain down the legs of the rising torus. This lends cre-
dence to the hypothesis that the toroidal shape of the ﬂux
rope is crucial to a coherent rise and emergence. Finally,",9,CMR10,,511,58

of Archontis et al. (2013) and Knizhnik et al. (2018) was
that the ﬂux rope of Archontis et al. (2013) was twisted
only weakly. It is possible that this prevented emergence
for long enough that a signiﬁcant gradient in the mag-
netic ﬁeld was able to build up, triggering the onset of
the instability. On the other hand, the simulation of To-
riumi & Takasao (2017) with no undular signatures had
a smaller twist than that used by Archontis et al. (2013),",9,CMR10,,532,58

vestigation is needed into why some ﬂux emergence simu-
lations produce salt-and-pepper structure resulting from
undulating ﬁeld lines while other simulations do not.",9,CMR10,,222,56

whether emergence occurs is the time required for a sig-

down loops in the corona, which then reconnected. At
the photosphere, they showed that, rather than form-
ing a pair of opposite polarity regions - as is typical for
moderately twisted ﬂux ropes - the ﬂux rope formed two
extended opposite polarities between the two primary
polarities. Our toroidal simulations corroborate this re-
sult, with the additional ﬁnding that there is a signiﬁcant
amount of salt-and-pepper structure dispersed through-
out the active region.
In other words, there are many
magnetic ﬁeld undulations, as opposed to just the two
seen in Archontis et al. (2013).",9,CMR10,,750,59

lows the ﬂux rope to maintain its circular cross section,
and the downward concavity of the rising ﬁeld lines will
facilitate emergence through the photosphere. On the
other hand, weak twist allows the ﬂux rope to expand
and become more horizontal. 3) The active region pro-

important to understand. Previous studies have argued
that weakly twisted ﬂux ropes, in particular, require con-
vective upﬂows to emerge, since these counteract the de-",9,CMR10,,226,58

convection is not necessary for the emergence of weakly
twisted ﬂux ropes. On the other hand, convection could
also act to break up a weakly twisted ﬂux rope and pro-
duce more small scale ﬂux, or, instead, could act to con-
centrate ﬂux bundles together, which would bring the",9,CMR10,,390,57
