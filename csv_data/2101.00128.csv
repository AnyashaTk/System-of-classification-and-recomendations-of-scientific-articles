INTRODUCTION,7,CMR8,,12,12
"Supernovae (SNe) of type Ib/c are believed to mark
the deaths of massive stars that are stripped of their
hydrogen (type Ib), and possibly helium (type Ic), en-
velope before explosion (Filippenko 1997). A sub-class
of Ib/c SNe dubbed broad-line (BL) Ic, estimated to
constitute only",9,CMR10,,283,54
≈,9,CMSY10,,1,1
"5% of the Ib/c population (Woosley
& Bloom 2006; Gal-Yam 2017), is of particular interest
due to its relation to long-duration gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs), the most relativistic stellar explosions we know
of in the universe (Piran 2004; M´esz´aros 2006). While
all GRB-associated SNe are of type BL-Ic (Woosley &
Bloom 2006; Hjorth & Bloom 2012, but see Cano et al.
(2014) for the peculiar case of SN 2013ez), not all BL-Ic
events make a GRB (e.g., Berger et al. 2003; Soderberg
et al. 2006; Corsi et al. 2016). Thus, the question of what
physical ingredients enable some stripped-envelope mas-
sive stars to launch a relativistic jet remains open (e.g.,
Modjaz et al. 2016).",9,CMR10,,671,59
"As ﬁrst demonstrated by the well-known case of
SN 1998bw/GRB 980425 (Galama et al. 1998; Kulkarni
et al. 1998), radio observations are particularly well",9,CMR10,,152,54

GRBs (hereafter referred to as engine-drive SNe), since
radio synchrotron emission traces the fastest moving

cause non-thermal radio photons are produced in the in-
teraction of the SN shock with the circumstellar mate-

"for the
fastest SN ejecta (Corsi et al. 2014), placing PTF11qcj in
an intermediate class between “ordinary” BL-Ic SNe and
engine-driven ones like SN 1998bw or SN 2009bb (Soder-
berg et al. 2010). The simple, spherically symmetric
model of SN shock interaction with a smooth CSM (sim-
ple power-law density proﬁle), however, cannot explain
the second radio peak. As discussed in Palliyaguru et al.
(2019), two more complex scenarios can be invoked to in-
terpret this peculiar behavior of PTF11qcj: (i) A spheri-
cal SN shock going through a medium with extreme CSM",9,CMR10,,564,58

lowed by radio emission from an emerging oﬀ-axis GRB
jet, initially pointed away from our line of sight (second
peak).",9,CMR10,,177,58

"deed explain the second radio peak, the presence of an
oﬀ–axis jet (scenario (ii)) cannot be ruled out just based
on light curve measurements. However, scenarios (i) and
(ii) make rather diﬀerent predictions for the angular size
of the PTF11qcj ejecta at very late times. Motivated by
these considerations, here we present Very Long Baseline
Interferometry (VLBI) observations of PTF11qcj aimed
at setting direct constraints on the size (angular diam-
eter) of its radio ejecta. These observations ultimately
provide a direct test for the presence of relativistic ex-
pansion, as expected in the case of an oﬀ-axis GRB jet.
In Section 2,
we present the HSA and eMERLIN observations of
PTF11qcj. In Section 3, we discuss these observations
within the light curve and radio ejecta size predictions of
the two scenarios mentioned above. Finally, in Section 4
we summarize our results and conclude.",9,CMR10,,894,59

") to a constant density medium. This
variable CSM proﬁle also aﬀects the temporal evolution
of the shock radius. We also ﬁnd that synchrotron cool-
ing may be playing a role at the highest radio frequencies.
Within this SSA model with variable CSM, the derived
size of the shock at the time of our HSA observations can
be reconciled with our measurements. Our results are
thus consistent with the CSM interaction model (con-
sidering that such model is highly simpliﬁed). The size",9,CMR10,,480,59

"to disfavor an oﬀ-axis relativistic jet scenario for the ra-
dio re-brightening of PTF11qcj.",9,CMR10,,92,60
"In conclusion, the VLBI observations reported in this
paper favor the original interpretation of PTF11qcj as
a strongly CSM-interacting radio SN (see Corsi et al.
2014; Palliyaguru et al. 2019). However, our conclusions
are limited by the simpliﬁcations inherent in the spheri-
cally symmetric SSA model adopted here. We encourage
more detailed theoretical modeling aimed at interpreting
PTF11qcj complex radio light curve and available VLBI
data.",9,CMR10,,447,57
