We present a measurement of average histograms of line-of-sight velocities over pairs of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Since,9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,124,124
"the histogram can be measured at diﬀerent galaxy-cluster separations, this observable is commonly referred to as the stacked

applied to real samples of galaxies and clusters. We examine our model by using an actual sample of massive clusters with
known weak-lensing masses and spectroscopic observations of galaxies around the clusters. A likelihood analysis with our
model enables us to infer the spherical-symmetric velocity dispersion of observed galaxies in massive clusters. We ﬁnd the

1 INTRODUCTION,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,14,14
"Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe. The abundance of clusters at diﬀerent redshifts as a function of
their masses is known to be a powerful probe of gravitational growth in cosmic mass density as well as expansion history of our universe
(e.g. Allen et al. 2011, for a review). Although previous astronomical surveys at diﬀerent wavelengths have enabled us to construct a large",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,420,143
"sample of galaxy clusters, the constraining power of cosmological analyses with clusters is currently limited by the uncertainty in estimates of
cluster masses (e.g. Vikhlinin et al. 2009; Rozo et al. 2010; Mantz et al. 2014; Planck Collaboration et al. 2016b; de Haan et al. 2016; Bocquet
et al. 2019; Abbott et al. 2020). Ongoing and upcoming surveys will further increase the number of galaxy clusters (e.g. Merloni et al. 2012;
Abazajian et al. 2016), allowing us to measure the cluster abundance with a high precision. Hence, an accurate estimate of individual cluster
masses is an important and urgent task in studies of galaxy clusters.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,643,144
"Since the ﬁrst application to the Coma cluster (Zwicky 1937), kinematics of galaxies in a cluster has been commonly used to infer the
cluster mass so far. We refer to the mass estimate by galaxy kinematics as the dynamical mass. The underlying assumption in the dynamical
mass estimate is that the motions of galaxies inside a cluster is a good tracer of the gravitational potential in the system. A set of cosmological
N-body simulations has shown that the velocity dispersion of N-body particles inside cluster-sized halos exhibits a tight correlation to the true
halo masses with a small scatter, regardless of assumed cosmological models (Evrard et al. 2008). In practice, there are several complicating",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,707,147
factors to use the kinematic information of member galaxies as a proxy of the cluster mass. Biviano et al. (2006) have studied possible biases,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,142,142
"of the dynamical mass estimate based on the velocity dispersion of member galaxies with a hydrodynamical simulation. They found that the
degree in the mass bias depends on the number of member galaxies used. High-resolution zoom-in simulations of galaxy clusters have revealed
that the scaling relation between the velocity dispersion of galaxies and the true cluster mass can diﬀer from the dark-matter counterpart, and
that the diﬀerence depends on the selection of member galaxies (Lau et al. 2010; Munari et al. 2013; Armitage et al. 2018). Besides the bias,",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,562,143

"Saro et al. (2013) have shown that projection eﬀects of galaxies selected by spectroscopic observations can make the scatter in the scaling
relation larger. White et al. (2010) also found that the velocity dispersion in the line-of-sight direction can be correlated with the orientation of
large-scale structures around clusters.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,329,149
"Apart from the dynamical mass estimate on an individual basis, galaxy kinematics in high-density environments provides a means of testing
the theory of gravity. Numerical simulations have shown that velocity statistics of galaxies around clusters have a great potential to test gravity
on non-linear scales (Schmidt 2010; Lam et al. 2012; Hellwing et al. 2014; Zu et al. 2014). For a comprehensive search of modiﬁcations of
gravity, it is essential to investigate the kinematics of galaxies outside the virial region of clusters, because a wide class of modiﬁed gravity
theories can reduce to General Relativity (GR) in high-density regions (e.g. Baker et al. 2019, for a review). However, galaxy kinematics in the
outskirts of clusters is subject to projection eﬀects on a cluster-by-cluster basis. Wojtak et al. (2011) have demonstrated that a stacking analysis
of the line-of-sight velocity distribution of galaxies around optically-selected clusters can be used to infer the gravitational redshift of light
at scales beyond the cluster virial regime. Lam et al. (2012) have also proposed the velocity dispersion in the stacked distribution at diﬀerent
galaxy-cluster separations for a robust test of gravity on scales of 1-30 Mpc. The stacked velocity distribution of galaxies around clusters,
referred to as the stacked phase-space density, has drawn much attention as a probe of the average dynamical mass estimate and galactic orbits
in the cluster regime (Wojtak et al. 2009), the physics of star formation quenching (Haines et al. 2015; Adhikari et al. 2019), and large-scale
galaxy infall (Aung et al. 2021; Tomooka et al. 2020).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1639,148
The stacking analysis of galaxies around clusters in phase space,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,64,64
1,7,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1,1
"contains rich information about structure formation and possible modiﬁ-
cations of gravity, whereas its theoretical model is still developing. Wojtak et al. (2009) have developed a theoretical model of the phase-space
density of galaxies inside a cluster by assuming a spherically symmetric system in dynamical equilibrium, while Mamon et al. (2013) have
proposed a fast, eﬃcient method to predict the phase-space density for a given three-dimensional velocity distribution of galaxies in a cluster.
Zu & Weinberg (2013) have studied the pairwise velocity distribution for galaxy-cluster pairs by using a semi-analytic galaxy model, and
have built a phenomenological model of the velocity distribution as a function of galaxy-cluster separation lengths. On the other hand, Lam
et al. (2013) developed a semi-analytic approach based on the halo model (Cooray & Sheth 2002) and the perturbation theory of large-scale
structures. Recently, Hamabata et al. (2019b) have proposed a two-component model of the three-dimensional phase space distribution of halos
surrounding clusters up to 50",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1085,145

density and lensing masses of clusters. For this purpose, we adopt the halo-model prescription as in Lam et al. (2013), while we improve the
previous model so that it can be applied to realistic observational data. In our model, we can include a wide distribution of cluster masses (not
restricted by mass-limited cases), contributions from satellite galaxies in single clusters, and large-scale pairwise velocity statistics between
two halos. We then examine our model with a set of spectroscopic observations of galaxies around low-redshift massive clusters. For the sample
of massive clusters, we use 23 clusters at 0",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,756,145

they reside in the centre of their host dark matter halos and individual host halos can have a single central galaxy at most. For the satellite
galaxies, we populate satellite galaxies to a halo only when a central galaxy exists. In this case, the phase-space density of galaxies is written as",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,434,149

"For the ACReS galaxies, we have three ingredients, (i) the HOD, (ii) number density proﬁles of satellites in the LoCuSS clusters, and (iii)
velocity distribution functions of satellites in the clusters. For the ACReS HOD, we basically use the observational results for photometric
galaxies in the Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam survey (Ishikawa et al. 2020), but calibrate the mass dependence in the satellite HOD by ﬁtting the
number density proﬁle of the ACReS galaxies around individual LoCuSS clusters. Throughout this paper, we assume the number density proﬁle
of the ACReS galaxies in clusters can be expressed as a spherical symmetric NFW proﬁle, while we allow the concentration parameter to be
diﬀerent from the counterpart in underlying mass density. On the velocity distribution of satellites, we adopt a Gaussian velocity distribution.
We set the dispersion in the Gaussian distribution by assuming dynamical equilibrium in the LoCuSS clusters. We also include the velocity
oﬀset in the Gaussian distribution arising from gravitational redshifts of satellite galaxies in clusters. We refer Secion 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 for details

of the BCG may be diﬀerent from the centre of its host halos in practice, Okabe et al. (2010) carefully examined a possible oﬀ-centring eﬀect
by studying the lensing signals with various centre proxies such as the X-ray peak, and concluded that the oﬀ-centring should be well within
100 kpc in radius. Therefore we ignore the oﬀ-centring eﬀect throughout this paper. Furthermore, we assume that the mass density distribution

5 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,29,29
"In this paper, we measured average histograms of pairwise velocity of galaxies in and around clusters at diﬀerent projected cluster-galaxy
separations, referred to as the stacked phase-space density. We employed a halo-model forward-modelling approach for the stacked phase-space
density. In our model, we take into account realistic eﬀects on the phase-space density including a wide distribution of cluster masses, satellite
galaxies in single clusters, and large-scale streaming motions between two diﬀerent dark matter halos. We speciﬁed key ingredients in our
model by using the spectroscopic data of galaxies around the LoCuSS clusters (Haines et al. 2015) with precise weak-lensing mass estimates
(Okabe & Smith 2016). We then performed the stacking analysis of phase-space density around the LoCuSS clusters and made a comparison
with our model. A likelihood analysis enables us to infer kinematics of our galaxy sample in the LoCuSS clusters. We found that the velocity
dispersion of our selected galaxies within the virial region is constrained to be 1180",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1065,146

increase number of clusters as well as spectroscopic observations of galaxies around each cluster. As the statistical uncertainty becomes smaller,
we require more detailed analysis to test gravity. Possible velocity oﬀsets between BCGs and their host halos induced by mergers (e.g. Martel

"outskirts has been observed (e.g. More et al. 2016; Chang et al. 2018; Murata et al. 2020; Bianconi et al. 2020), while infall galaxies onto
clusters can have non-Gaussian velocity distributions (Hamabata et al. 2019a; Aung et al. 2021). Our model can not account for these eﬀects
correctly, because the mass accretion history of individual clusters plays an important role in determining properties of galaxies at cluster
outskirts (e.g. More et al. 2015). More spectroscopic observations play a central role in verifying the presence of infall galaxies in and around
galaxy clusters. A joint analysis with stacked weak lensing is promising to explore a broad range of modiﬁed gravity models (e.g. Barreira
