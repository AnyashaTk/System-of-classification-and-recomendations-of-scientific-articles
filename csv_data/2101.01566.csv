Abstract,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,8,8
"The magnetic activity of the Sun directly impacts the Earth and human life. Like-
wise, other stars will have an impact on the habitability of planets orbiting these host stars.
Although the magnetic ﬁeld at the surface of the Sun is reasonably well characterised by ob-
servations, the information on the magnetic ﬁeld in the higher atmospheric layers is mainly
indirect. This lack of information hampers our progress in understanding solar magnetic ac-
tivity. Overcoming this limitation would allow us to address four paramount long-standing
questions: (1) How does the magnetic ﬁeld couple the different layers of the atmosphere,
and how does it transport energy? (2) How does the magnetic ﬁeld structure, drive and inter-
act with the plasma in the chromosphere and upper atmosphere? (3) How does the magnetic
ﬁeld destabilise the outer solar atmosphere and thus affect the interplanetary environment?
(4) How do magnetic processes accelerate particles to high energies? New ground-breaking
observations are needed to address these science questions. We suggest a suite of three in-
struments that far exceed current capabilities in terms of spatial resolution, light-gathering
power, and polarimetric performance: (a) A large-aperture UV-to-IR telescope of the 1-3
m class aimed mainly to measure the magnetic ﬁeld in the chromosphere by combining
high spatial resolution and high sensitivity. (b) An extreme-UV-to-IR coronagraph that is
designed to measure the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld in the corona with an aperture of about
40 cm. (c) An extreme-UV imaging polarimeter based on a 30 cm telescope that combines
high throughput in the extreme UV with polarimetry to connect the magnetic measurements
of the other two instruments. Placed in a near-Earth orbit, the data downlink would be max-",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,1799,95
"imised, while a location at L4 or L5 would provide stereoscopic observations of the Sun
in combination with Earth-based observatories. This mission to measure the magnetic ﬁeld
will ﬁnally unlock the driver of the dynamics in the outer solar atmosphere and thereby will
greatly advance our understanding of the Sun and the heliosphere.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,335,92

1 Introduction,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,14,14
"The magnetic ﬁeld plays a central role in many if not most of the processes we observe in
our universe. It governs complex plasma processes from the formation of structures in the
early universe to the interplanetary space that connects planets to their host stars. Although
we know the magnetic ﬁeld at the solar surface reasonably well, our information on it in the
higher layers is mainly indirect. This state of knowledge is highly unsatisfactory because
the ﬁeld carries most of the energy in these layers and is the dominant driver of most of the
phenomena that are observed there (e.g. heating of the gas to millions of degrees, coronal
shape and brightness, magnetic reconnection and its effects, and large-scale ejection of parts
of the solar atmosphere). The lack of direct measurements of coronal magnetic ﬁelds is
similar to being blind to the main driver of solar activity. We contend that this is one of the
major hindrances to our understanding of coronal physics. Obtaining these measurements
would help to explain a very wide variety of phenomena.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,1064,95

"We can follow the interaction of the magnetic ﬁeld and plasma on our central star in
detail and may essentially use the Sun as a laboratory for uncovering key magnetic and
plasma processes that act throughout the universe. In the coming decades, we expect that
answering the following overarching questions will lead to a giant leap in understanding the
Sun:",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,358,92

4. How do magnetic processes accelerate particles to high energies?,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,67,67
"Answers to these questions will be relevant not only to solar research alone, but will af-
fect a broad range of current and upcoming topics in astrophysics. The Sun is a template for
other stars. This makes it a key to understanding the host stars of other planets and how these
host stars might affect the formation and evolution of life on their planets. For the reliable
detection of Earth-sized planets around other stars and in particular for their habitability,
we have to understand stellar variability. The magnetic ﬁeld is also responsible for the UV
emission from planet-hosting stars, which is central for the chemistry in the planetary atmo-",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,654,95
"sphere, for instance. If the magnetic ﬁeld destabilises parts of the stellar atmosphere, which
results in the ejection of plasma and magnetic ﬁeld into interplanetary space, this can also
strongly affect planets around the host star. Finally, high-energy particles generated by mag-
netic and plasma processes in the stellar atmosphere can have severe impacts on life. In the
case of the the solar system, this includes space technology.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,437,94
"The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was launched in 1995 [25]. The inten-
sive research in the two decades since then has enabled us now to deﬁne the questions we
outlined above with high precision. Observational work together with progress in theoretical
understanding and numerical modelling shows clear paths to solving these questions in the
coming decades if the observational tools can be made adequately available.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,431,92
"In this paper we describe the key measurements that give direct access to the magnetic
ﬁelds in the solar chromosphere and upper atmosphere. These measurements will have to
exceed what is currently available. This will enable us to address the overarching questions
when we combine it with the (simultaneous) measurements of the dynamic response of the
plasma to changes that are induced by the evolving magnetic ﬁeld.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,418,92
2 Overarching science questions,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,31,31
"The focus of this paper is on measuring the magnetic ﬁeld in the outer solar atmosphere, i.e.
in the upper chromosphere, transition region, and corona. This information is currently not
directly available on a routine basis. Extrapolations together with extreme UV imaging can
give an instructive overview of the large-scale structure of the magnetic ﬁeld in the outer so-
lar atmosphere, where the relevant physical processes occur (see Fig. 1). Our understanding
of the solar atmosphere is drastically limited by such indirect estimations of the magnetic
ﬁeld, however. We have to rely on the theory of extrapolations of the magnetic ﬁeld that is
measured in the photosphere, i.e. the visible surface of the Sun. These extrapolations have
to apply several assumptions, e.g. that the solar atmosphere is a vacuum or that the Lorentz
force is the only relevant force and that the inertia of the plasma is completely negligible.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,927,95

An image of Earth to scale is overlaid at the bottom right corner. The image is processed using a Multi-Scale
Gaussian Normalization technique [60]. Data courtesy of NASA/SDO and AIA science team.",7,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,405,109
"Observations of the dynamic solar atmosphere clearly show that assumptions like this are
not appropriate. The actual measurement of the changing magnetic conﬁguration is a key
part in solving the puzzle of how the magnetic ﬁeld interacts with the plasma, in particular
when fast-changing processes are followed that are driven by magnetic reconnection, for
instance.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,366,92
"With direct measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld throughout the solar atmosphere, we will
be able to locate sites of transient energy release (through magnetic reconnection), analyse
the formation and disruption of current sheets where plasma is heated, study the transport
of energy through different modes of magnetohydrodynamic waves (or through energetic
particles), and investigate the helicity of erupting structures, all by unveiling how the mag-
netic ﬁeld connects the different parts of the atmosphere. These measurements together will
provide us with an understanding of solar magnetic activity: how does the magnetic ﬁeld
govern the energetic radiation from the Sun and how does it drive space weather effects?
These two questions have implications for Earth, and likewise for planets of other host stars.
The polarisation of spectral lines encodes the information on the magnetic ﬁeld of the
outer solar atmosphere (i.e. the chromosphere and beyond). This encoded information has
not been accessible to current space instruments. Sub-orbital rocket ﬂights of about a few
minutes each have provided the only glimpse into this domain. Because the level of polari-
sation is generally low, the required noise level has to be as low as a few times 10",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,1256,94

of the intensity for some polarimetric measurements. In order to achieve this signal-to-noise
ratio at high spatial resolution, the required instrumentation has to combine large aperture

"In the following we describe how the direct measurement of the magnetic ﬁeld in the
outer solar atmosphere (from the upper chromosphere into the corona) will provide the cru-
cial information we need to answer the general four questions we listed above. We ﬁrst
concentrate on the implications for solar research and then address how this will contribute
to a better understanding in other ﬁelds of astrophysics.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,412,92
2.1 Interaction of magnetic ﬁeld and plasma,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,43,43
"The interaction of magnetic ﬁeld and plasma includes a diversity of processes that are cur-
rently poorly understood. Of particular interest are the role of the magnetic ﬁeld in the
coupling of the different layers of solar and stellar atmospheres, and the conversion and
transport of energy. The most complex mixture of physics on the Sun is found in the chro-
mosphere. In a simple one-dimensional picture, this is the layer above the surface, where
the temperature starts to rise outwards. This layer is sandwiched between the photosphere,
where most photons originate, and the corona, where the temperature reaches several million
Kelvin.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,642,91
"The chromosphere is a highly complex region. The magnetic ﬁeld energy there is com-
parable to the internal energy of the gas. This causes an intense turbulent interaction between
the two, in particular when the velocities reach the sound speed. To add to the complexity,",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,271,95
"the radiation processes and line formation are far away from local thermodynamic equi-
librium (LTE), and the ionisation is only partial. A model that describes this requires an
extended Ohm’s law and the consideration of multi-ﬂuid effects.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,241,90
"The hot part of the outer atmosphere, the corona, is magnetically rooted in the chromo-
sphere. To answer fundamental questions on the dynamics and energisation of the corona,
we have to understand how the magnetic ﬁeld couples the corona to the chromosphere. This
is essential for describing the internal magnetic state of coronal loops. They are the basic
building blocks of the corona. Understanding the magnetic structure of coronal features on
the Sun is a stepping stone to the unsolved problem of the heating of hot plasma that is
observed throughout the universe.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,571,92
"The large magnetic Reynolds numbers in the chromosphere and corona mean that we
can expect magnetic turbulence. The chromosphere and corona are additionally ﬁlled with
different wave modes that range from acoustic waves to Alfv´en waves, including all mixed
forms. To unravel the magnetic effects on the plasma, we have to decompose these wave
modes into their respective parts and relate them to the (slower) build-up of currents that are
then dissipated to energise the plasma. The key for this is a continuous knowledge of the
magnetic ﬁeld throughout the atmosphere. Only then can we understand the coupling and
the transport of energy by the magnetic ﬁeld.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,661,95
"New observations will have to provide reliable information on the magnetic structure of
the upper atmosphere that is not available today and will not be available in the coming years
with current instrumentation. We need direct access to the magnetic ﬁeld through remote-
sensing observations to detect the magnetic current sheets that cover a range of spatial and
temporal scales [76]. In coronal loops as in chromospheric features, we see ﬁne structure
down to the resolution limit of current instruments. Imaging and spectroscopic observations
indicate thin structures at scales down to 50 km [74].",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,601,94
"The requirements on spatial resolution for magnetic structure measurements are slightly
more relaxed: the magnetic ﬁeld starts to dominate the plasma in terms of (internal) energy
in the upper chromosphere (and beyond). Thus the spatial variations of the magnetic ﬁeld
can be expected to be smaller than those of the plasma in responding to the magnetic driving.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,362,93

"To achieve magnetic ﬁeld measurements, the light needs to be decomposed into its polari-
sation states. This increases the requirements on the noise level, i.e. the collected number of
photons. This means that a large aperture is also required for the magnetic measurements.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,274,95
2.2 Magnetic coupling in the atmosphere,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,39,39
"To understand the magnetic activity of the Sun, we have to follow the magnetic connections
that channel the energy transport throughout the atmosphere. This is a multi-scale problem
because large-scale magnetic features, such as long coronal loops or helmet streamers, are
rooted in small magnetic patches in the low atmosphere. Recent observations demonstrated
the key role of small-scale magnetic patches in the photosphere for large coronal structures
[18], see Fig. 2. Even compact ﬂaring loops show small-scale ﬂux cancellation at their foot
points [17]. Only by tracing and quantifying the energy ﬂux deep in the chromosphere can
we build a physical connection between the small-scale processes in the photosphere and
the large-scale coronal features. The prime requirement to achieve this is to measure the
magnetic ﬁeld in all layers of the solar atmosphere in order to gain insight into the magnetic
coupling.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,918,94
"Here we describe with one example how we investigate the magnetic coupling from
the chromosphere to the large-scale corona. High-resolution observations enable us to char-
acterise the magnetic ﬁeld close to the limb. Very stable observing conditions such as are
found on a space-based platform are crucial for observations like this. For example, the mod-
est 50 cm telescope on Hinode was able measure the magnetic ﬁeld up to heliocentric angles
of about 80",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,459,93
◦,7,CMSY10,,1,1
", and the polar magnetic ﬁeld could be characterised based on this [84]. With
higher resolution and sufﬁcient sensitivity, an investigation even closer to the limb would be
possible and the magnetic ﬁeld in the chromosphere could be measured. This could then be
directly connected to coronagraphic observations above the limb. When observations in the
extreme UV are added to this, structures can be followed continuously from the chromo-",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,438,94
Magnetic Imaging of the Outer Solar Atmosphere (MImOSA),7,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,55,55
7,7,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,1,1
"sphere into the corona, i.e. from small to large scales. With this full magnetic ﬁeld informa-
tion, magnetic disturbances such as Alfv´enic perturbations could be traced, and the energy
ﬂow from the chromosphere into the corona could be followed.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,247,94
"Another prime target for the study of magnetic connectivity is the destabilisation of the
upper solar atmosphere (discussed in more detail in the next subsection). Magnetic structures
in the corona can become unstable in a very short time (compared to their overall lifetime)
and then erupt. The actual triggers of this process are still elusive. Only a full characterisation
of the connectivity of the magnetic ﬁeld before the onset of the destabilisation can provide
the necessary information for understanding the magnetic conﬁguration that later erupts.
Here again the coupling of the magnetic ﬁeld across scales plays a signiﬁcant role: at least
in some scenarios, small-scale processes cut the tethers of the magnetic ﬁeld that holds the
magnetic structure down that later erupts [59].",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,791,99
2.3 Destabilising the outer solar atmosphere,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,44,44
"During large disruptions of the upper solar atmosphere, huge amounts of magnetic energy
are converted into thermal energy and kinetic energy, and accelerate energetic particles.
The associated heating and acceleration processes through magnetic reconnection are still
poorly understood, and even the change in magnetic structures in the course of an eruption",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,358,90
"is not well constrained. Extrapolations of the magnetic ﬁeld from the surface are currently
used to constrain the change in free energy of the magnetic ﬁeld. Before and during dy-
namic events, however, the assumptions that underlie these extrapolations break down. It is
therefore mandatory to actually measure the coronal magnetic ﬁeld before, during, and after
the disruption to fully characterise this process. This destabilisation is the origin of coro-
nal mass ejections (CMEs). Once initiated, CMEs can dominate the inner heliosphere, and
stellar CMEs are likely to be a major inﬂuence on exoplanetary atmospheres.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,622,94
"A CME expands when it lifts off. In this process, some CMEs reveal their complex in-
ternal structure (e.g. Fig. 3). Our current information is based on intensity images, therefore
no direct information on the magnetic ﬁeld is available. Only direct measurements of the
magnetic ﬁeld will allow us to distinguish between the very different physical mechanisms
that have been proposed for the initiation of CMEs [15]. This knowledge is needed not only
to strongly improve the predictability of CMEs and their space weather effects, but also
to predict what the CMEs on other stars could look like [e.g. 3, 6]. Coronagraphic direct
measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld in the corona will close this gap in our knowledge.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,715,95
"Many erupting features show a high degree of magnetic twist and writhe. Magnetic
helicity quantiﬁes how elementary magnetic ﬂux tubes are wound around each other in
a deﬁned volume. In a closed system, magnetic helicity is almost conserved in resistive
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on timescales shorter than the global diffusion timescale
[57, 11]. Magnetic helicity can be used to quantitatively link ﬂux ropes that are observed
in situ in the solar wind to their sources in the solar atmosphere. Magnetic helicity also
constrains the dynamical evolution of the ejected magnetic ﬁeld in the solar wind [e.g. 20].
Determining the magnetic helicity carried by a CME requires measuring the magnetic ﬁeld

"The magnetic ﬁeld is reconﬁgured on large scales in the course of large-scale disrup-
tions. This magnetic reconﬁguration requires that the connection to the small-scale mag-
netic features in the lower atmosphere changes as well. This is illustrated by the emergence
and submergence of magnetic ﬂux on the solar surface and the tether-cutting mechanism for
CME eruption. Information on the magnetic ﬁeld beyond what extrapolations can provide",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,443,92

"The most spectacular events on the Sun are ﬂares and CMEs. They govern the space
weather. During such events, particles are accelerated to high energies and can leave the
Sun. If they hit Earth, they cause a wide range of effects, including damage to satellites
and harm to astronauts. With an understanding of the magnetic processes before and during
the initiation of ﬂares and CMEs, we will ﬁnally be able to understand the roots of space
weather.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,450,90
2.4 High-energy processes in the atmosphere,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,43,43
"Particles are accelerated to high energies during ﬂares and CMEs. Energetic processes are
not limited to large scales, however. They essentially occur on all scales, including those
we cannot currently resolve. For example, it has been proposed that particles are also ac-
celerated during unresolved energy release events (nanoﬂares), but we have only indirect
evidence for this [79]. These nanoﬂares are associated with magnetic reconnection. Measur-
ing the magnetic conﬁguration and its change during such events will greatly advance our
understanding of the basic plasma physics process of reconnection and particle acceleration.
Our diagnostics for reconnection in the upper solar atmosphere are currently restricted to
imaging the thermal response of the plasma that is associated with the heating during such
events, in particular through extreme-UV imaging [e.g. 78, 49]. The presence of current",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,904,92

"sheets is often indirectly derived from thin threads that are visible in extreme-UV images.
For a few cases, however, observations have revealed current sheets through direct measure-
ments of the magnetic ﬁeld. They were all very low in the atmosphere [76, 44].",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,262,91
"Measuring the change in the magnetic ﬁeld in space and time around the reconnection
site is very important to understand the heating and particle acceleration at a reconnection
site. This alone gives access to the structure of the current sheets that form during the event
and to the location and manner in which particles are accelerated. Imaging observations in
the extreme UV and X-rays can show the changing structure of the magnetic ﬁeld (assuming
that the emission indeed outlines the magnetic ﬁeld). We can quantify how much magnetic
energy is converted into other forms of energy only through directly measuring the magnetic
ﬁeld because some of that energy is in forms that are hard to detect (e.g. in the form of ener-
getic particles, or in small brightenings in the visible and IR wavelength ranges). Measuring
the magnetic ﬁeld will therefore be essential to derive the energy that is available for particle
acceleration and for the generation of (hard) X-ray emission during the ﬂare events.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,1005,97
2.5 Relation to other science ﬁelds,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,35,35
The upper solar atmosphere is the source region of the radiation in the UV. This radiation,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,90,90
"is of paramount importance for Earth’s atmosphere. It controls the chemistry and heating
in the stratosphere and in higher layers of the atmosphere of our home planet, and thereby
may signiﬁcantly affect the long-term climate evolution. The extreme-UV radiation from
the corona is important for the upper atmosphere of Earth, and the near-UV radiation affects
the stratosphere. The near-UV originates from the solar photosphere and chromosphere. To
date, the relative variability in the UV radiation and its contribution to solar variability is
not fully understood, although it is clear that it is driven by magnetic ﬁeld variations. When
we understand why the outer atmosphere becomes unstable, we can scientiﬁcally deﬁne
the ingredients of space weather, which through energetic particles and CMEs impacts the
terrestrial environment.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,837,95
"The science proposed here is also relevant for host stars of other planets. Far more
violent disruptions than on the Sun have been observed in the outer atmospheres of other
stars. For example, super-ﬂares have been found on sun-like stars [e.g. 71, 54]. The energy
released by these ﬂares exceeds the energy released by the largest ﬂares on our Sun by 1000
times. Stars that are more active than the Sun can produce CMEs that then propagate into
the astrosphere of the star [e.g. 6]. It is clear that this will affect the exoplanets of these stars
in terms of their (magnetic) environment and possible habitability.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,616,101
"Understanding the magnetic processes in the outer solar atmosphere will also greatly
enhance our understanding of accretion disc coronae and winds. We can expect the same
processes to operate in these magnetically dominated environments as in the solar corona.
As in many other cases, the Sun can serve here as a template and laboratory for other astro-
physical objects.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,371,92
"The science we propose will also contribute to basic space plasma physics (e.g. current
sheets, reconnection, and instabilities). By imaging the magnetic ﬁeld in the outer solar at-
mosphere, we can characterise the large- and small-scale structure. This is otherwise only
possible through in situ measurements in planetary magnetospheres (and possibly the he-
liosphere) with large swarms of probes. We can study the cross-scale coupling through one
single solar observatory as proposed here.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,493,93

spectral lines, without the need of any magnetic ﬁeld. This especially occurs in many of
the spectral lines that originate in the outer solar atmosphere, where the anisotropy of the
radiation ﬁeld coming from the underlying solar disc is higher than in the photosphere. The
physical origin of this resonance-line polarisation lies in the fact that the radiative transitions
induced by the incident anisotropic radiation produces atomic level polarisation, that is,
population imbalances and quantum coherence among the magnetic sublevels of degenerate
atomic energy levels. This in turn produces polarisation in the radiation that is re-emitted in
the scattering process.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,764,99

"The polarisation measurements need to be inverted to derive the magnetic ﬁeld from ob-
servations. More than a century ago, magnetic ﬁelds on the Sun were discovered through
the Zeeman splitting of spectral lines in the strong magnetic ﬁeld of a sunspot [33]. This
was possible even without analysing the polarisation state of the light. When the geometry
of the magnetic ﬁeld or the thermal structure of the atmosphere is more complex, the full
information of the polarisation has to be taken into account to reconstruct the full 3D vector
of the magnetic ﬁeld, i.e. its strength and direction. Not only the Zeeman effect, but also the
Hanle effect has to be considered for the weaker magnetic ﬁelds in the outer atmosphere.
This requires an inversion of the observed polarisation data.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,787,95
"Several inversion codes are available for the chromosphere that include the Zeeman ef-
fect [73, 21]. In the next few years, they will be extended to also cover the Hanle effect, so",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,181,94

will be made in 1D, but will include non-LTE effects (i.e. departures from local thermody-
namic equilibrium). Ultimately, 3D versions will be required, and ﬁrst steps in this direc-
tion have been taken. Inversion codes have been developed and implemented that take into
account the coupling of neighbouring pixels in the observation [85, 86]. This coupling is
introduced by the point spread function of the instrument.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,518,97
"A very important role will be played by realistic models of the outer solar atmosphere.
Here a numerical simulation that includes all relevant physical processes provides the evo-
lution of the plasma and the magnetic ﬁeld in a 3D volume. A forward-modelling code is
then used to calculate the emission, including the state of polarisation, from the simulation
results (see Fig. 5 for an example). The numerical simulations are currently mostly run by
solving the 3D MHD equations (with extensions). Examples are MURaM [67] and Bifrost
[12], both including the radiative transfer problem, or Pencil that allows to model a data-
driven corona [89]. Several 3D non-LTE codes also exist for the forward modelling of the
radiation in spectral lines, e.g. Multi-3D [45] for the intensity and PORTA [87] for all Stokes
parameters. This shows that the basic tools are available even now so that numerical models
can be used to evaluate and improve inversion techniques with which the magnetic ﬁeld can
be derived from observations.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,1024,95

They can be included in inversions of spectropolarimetric observations within a few years,",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,173,90

culations today provide an essential reference to identify and distinguish the impact of vari-

reliable approach to infer information about the magnetism of the outer solar atmosphere.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,460,94

magnetic ﬁeld, plasma, and waves are all of a similar magnitude, which provides a wealth
of dynamics. Radiation cannot be treated as optically thin as in the case of the corona, nor
can the atoms be assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) as in the photo-
sphere. The gas in the chromosphere is dynamic and only partially ionised, so that additional
effects have to be taken into account, such as ambipolar diffusion and time-dependent partial
ionisation.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,560,93

"The past decade saw a very fast evolution of chromosphere modelling, and different
models can now account for a range of the required physics, including non-equilibrium
populations [46, 30], non-LTE radiation transfer [13], two-ﬂuid MHD [64], and non-ideal
MHD [56, 38]. With further progress at this pace, we can expect to have reasonably realistic
3D numerical experiments of the solar chromosphere in another decade. In other words, the
required models will be available when they are needed to develop and evaluate improved
inversions to retrieve the chromospheric magnetic ﬁeld.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,583,92
4.2 Coronal models,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,18,18
"Numerical models for the large-scale corona potentially involve fewer physical processes
than are required in the chromosphere. The coupling across scales and the loss of collisional
coupling between particles adds to the problem, however. The former requires high spatial
resolution or adaptive grids, the latter means that kinetic models or particle-in-cell simula-
tions are necessary. These effects have been considered, but are still far from being realistic
in the sense of reproducing actual coronal structures. Still, signiﬁcant progress has been
achieved, e.g. in modelling the dynamics of ﬂares [16].",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,610,95
"Another complication in the large-scale corona is the integration along the line of sight
of the optically thin emission that prevents simple direct inversions of the magnetic ﬁeld
[41, 40]. Recent forward models show paths to interpreting coronagraphic measurements
by minimising the difference between synthesised coronal observables and real coronal data
[e.g. 19]. In the same way as for the chromospheric models, we can expect (global) coronal
models to be ready within a decade to assist in the inversion of the polarimetric measure-
ments of the global corona.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,567,90

4.3 Outlook,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,11,11
"When realistic 3D models of the chromosphere and the corona become available, the assim-
ilation of data into the models will be a powerful tool to better understand the structure of
the outer solar atmosphere and its evolution. The experience of data assimilation in weather
forecasting shows the enormous potential of this technique. Continuously assimilating the
acquired data into the model provides a way to iterate from the measured polarisation maps
towards a correct solution of the magnetic ﬁeld structure and its evolution. These are ensem-
ble models, therefore the computations require two orders of magnitude more computational
power than current models. With more efﬁcient codes and the expected progress of compu-
tational resources in the next decade, however, this will become feasible. This would then
provide an advanced tool for analysing the polarimetric measurements of the outer solar
atmosphere.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,919,93
"5 Scientiﬁc requirements for measuring the magnetic ﬁeld in the upper solar
atmosphere",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,86,75
5.1 Limitations in current approaches,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,37,37
"Measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld at the surface of the Sun (the photosphere) are currently
routinely performed at high spatial resolution in smaller regions, and with moderate res-
olution when they cover the whole Sun. This is achieved by remote-sensing observations,
mainly through the Zeeman effect (see Sect. 3). However, the magnetic ﬁeld at only about
1000 km above the surface dominates the gas in terms of energy, i.e. plasma-",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,435,91
β,9,StandardSymL-Slant_167,,1,1
"becomes
smaller than unity. To understand how the magnetic ﬁeld governs solar activity above the
surface (in the chromosphere and corona), we require reliable and routine measurements
there as well.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,198,88
"To estimate the magnetic ﬁeld in the outer solar atmosphere, we currently mostly have
to take recourse to extrapolations of the magnetic ﬁeld based on observations of the solar
surface. While this has reached a considerable degree of sophistication, these methods are
not satisfactory because there are limitations in principle [e.g. 23]. Also, it is not possible to
capture the temporal evolution of dynamic phenomena from the chromosphere to the atmo-
sphere at large with extrapolation methods that assume a static or stationary situation. This
prevents further progress in solar atmospheric research because the magnetic ﬁeld structures
and drives the dynamics in the solar atmosphere, from the chromosphere to the outer corona.
Therefore we need direct observations of the magnetic ﬁeld not only in the photosphere, but
throughout the whole outer solar atmosphere.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,869,98
"With the instrumentation we have so far, attempts to measure the magnetic ﬁeld in the
corona have been more a proof of concept than regular observations. The ﬁrst of such ob-
servations above the limb using a coronagraphic technique in the IR had very low spatial
resolution and required very long exposure times [52, 51]. While the ﬁeld progressed, ob-
servations are still sparse and limited to a few sample structures on the Sun. For example, a
post-ﬂare-loop system above the limb has recently been observed in some detail in the IR
[42] and in radio wavelengths [29]. This gave consistent results.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,602,93
"Observations of the magnetic ﬁeld in the chromosphere have been obtained in a more
regular fashion, but are mostly limited to the diagnostics in the lines of He",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,160,82

"and Mg II only provided a glimpse of polar-
isation measurements in the UV, however, and the existing measurements in C IV are not
reliable [53].",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,145,86
"Upcoming and planned space-based solar observatories will not provide polarimetric
information in the UV. They will therefore not provide measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld
in the uppermost layers of the chromosphere. We propose to close this observational gap in
this paper.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,274,90
5.2 Scientiﬁc requirements,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,26,26
"To measure the magnetic ﬁeld in the upper atmosphere, we distinguish (a) measurements in
front of the solar disc and (b) measurements above the limb. Observations on the disc will
give access to the small-scale structures in the chromosphere that form the base of the outer",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,273,93
"atmosphere and thereby shape the magnetic connection throughout the whole atmosphere
(see Sect. 5.2.1). The off-disc measurements will provide information on the large-scale
structure of the magnetic ﬁeld, giving a view of the corona similar to what is seen during
a solar eclipse (see Sect. 5.2.2). Finally, the small-scale chromospheric features have to be
connected to the global corona, for which observations in the extreme UV are crucial be-
cause they can also give access to coronal structures when observations are made on the
solar disc (see Sect. 5.2.3). To describe the respective requirements, we restrict the discus-
sion to one example for each case. More than one process that constrains each requirement
in most cases. The scientiﬁc requirements for the respective observations are summarised in
Table 1.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,821,94
5.2.1 Magnetic ﬁeld in the chromosphere,9,NimbusRomNo9L-ReguItal,,39,39
"The chromosphere is a highly structured and very dynamic part of the solar atmosphere.
Current 1m class ground-based and balloon-borne solar telescopes show features down to
scales smaller than 100 km. The Sunrise telescope, for example, revealed ﬁbrils (Fig. 6) with
widths ranging from 100 to 270 km [28]. These ﬁbrils are generally thought to map the mag-
netic ﬁeld [35] and are heated when magnetic ﬂux emerges [47]. Current instruments do not
allow us to directly measure the magnetic ﬁeld in these ﬁbrils, and similar conclusions apply
to other key chromospheric features. This leads to the requirement for an angular resolution
of 0.1",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,642,93
,7,CMSY10,,0,0
"for chromospheric magnetic measurements, which corresponds to about 70 km. Only
by achieving this resolution will we be able to reveal the formation and evolution physics of
these chromospheric structures.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,205,93
"The required temporal resolution is closely linked to the spatial resolution. Essentially,
the time resolution should be equivalent to the time it takes for a perturbation to cross the
resolution element. The relevant speed for magnetic changes is the Alfv´en velocity, which
is of the order of 10 to 100 km/s in the chromosphere. Consequently, the observations have
to allow for a temporal resolution of about 1 s.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,415,93

the extreme UV. Because the (black-body) radiation from the surface is negligible in the
extreme UV, these images will show the corona in front of the disc and above the limb.
One example would be on-disc observations that are performed near the limb. The chromo-
spheric observations (Sect. 5.2.1) would then show the roots of the global coronal magnetic
structure (Sect. 5.2.2), and an extreme-UV observation would show the essential connection

have an aperture of 1 to 3 m, which means that this instrument would dominate the conﬁgura-

thus be under ESA responsibility. Post-focus instrumentation such as a spectropolarimeter
and an imager can then be considered as payload provided by institutions throughout ESA
member states. The other two telescopes, the coronagraph and the EUV polarimetric imager
(Sects. 6.2 and 6.3), can be mounted on the sides of the main telescope. This ensures that
the coronagraph aperture has an unobstructed view over 2",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,790,97

a position at L1 would provide a continuous coverage of the Sun and a very stable en-
vironment. Observations from L4 or L5 would provide the highly interesting possibility
of conducting coordinated observations with Earth-based facilities: viewing the Sun at the
same time from two different angles would enable stereoscopic observations. Determining
the orbit that is best suited for the mission will require a careful trade-off study based on the

is rotated to provide the necessary measurements of linear polarisation. A single-mirror
polarising system is required to maximise the photon count in a given exposure time. This
is achieved by a rotating focal plane assembly, which implies that any connectors follow the
movements of the detector. A two-mirror polariser would not require a rotating focal plane
assembly, but would reduce the ﬂux at the focal plane by a factor two.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,514,92

"at 17.4 nm, multi-layer coatings can be optimised
for maximum throughput at 17.4 nm and maximum rejection of other nearby emission lines,
some of which are predicted to show zero or opposite polarisation compared to Fe",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,218,87
X,7,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,1,1
". It is
important to reject these lines because they constitute stray light in the polarisation measure-
ment and degrade the measurement signal-to-noise ratio. Such coatings have already been
developed for EUI/Solar Orbiter. Using new techniques for the multi-layer mirror coatings,
we can reach a width of the transmitted band of only 0.35 nm, which is twice as narrow as
bands on current instruments.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,403,96
6.4 Mission scenario in case of an M-class mission opportunity,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,62,62
"What we outlined so far in this paper calls for an L-class mission. We consider that the
chromospheric telescope with an aperture of up to 3 m is the main cost driver in our mission
proﬁle. When we downsize our mission scenario for an M-class mission, the 3 m telescope
is therefore the ﬁrst item to consider. Other mission options can also open up when a smaller
main telescope is considered.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,393,93
"The effect of reducing the size of the chromospheric telescope from a 3 m class to a 1 m
class instrument means cuts in the science return. In addition to a reduced spatial resolution,
the main downgrade would be the sensitivity to the magnetic ﬁeld, and here in particular in
the UV, where the aperture is essential for reaching the required signal-to-noise ratio. The
smaller telescope will reduce the spatial resolution by more than what is suggested by the
reduction of the aperture (to collect the same number of photons per resolution element),
or the sensitivity to the magnetic ﬁeld will be reduced, or both. A trade-off study will have
to show possible paths when the aperture needs to be reduced and what effects these would
have for the science goals.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,762,95
"Even a 1 m class telescope would outperform any currently operational or planned so-
lar space observatory. We can still expect signiﬁcant advances. The scientiﬁc return would
be downgraded from a full characterisation of the magnetic ﬁeld in the outer atmosphere,
however. We would mostly be able to investigate only bright structures on the Sun, while
the faint features are often essential to understanding the global large-scale connection. This
would affect all of the science goals outlined in Sect. 2 because the magnetic ﬁeld is present
not only in the bright features, but is volume ﬁlling. It would mean that we could only
investigate a fraction of the outer solar atmosphere.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,686,95
"Downgrading the chromospheric telescope from a 3 m to a 1 m class instrument might
also open new opportunities. For example, one could place a smaller observatory at either
L4 or L5 instead of in Earth orbit (or at L1). In combination with a facility either in Earth
orbit or on the ground, this would give the possibility for stereoscopic observations.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,353,93

7 Technological challenges,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,26,26
7.1 Main telescope: Thermal control and optical performance over the ﬁeld of view,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,81,81
"Relatively large telescopes that cover the visible to UV range have previously been ﬂown
into space or near-space (stratospheric) environments, for example the 0.5 m telescope on the
Hinode telescope [77] or the Sunrise balloon-borne 1 m telescope [8]. These two instruments
have proven that it is possible to build a UV-to-visible light solar telescope that manages
the solar ﬂux while keeping performances up to the tight requirements (e.g. the Sunrise
telescope is diffraction limited in the visible). In the case of the 3 m telescope discussed here,
a Gregory design with a heat rejection ﬁeld stop will also have to be used. The telescope can
be seen as a scaled-up version of the telescope on board Sunrise. Because of the size, it
will be challenging but possible, especially when we consider that it does not have to be
diffraction limited.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,848,98

rors cannot maintain the required 0.1",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,133,85

"resolution (two pixels) over the full ﬁeld of view. A
corrective optical element or a curved focal plane assembly will have to be considered.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,141,87
"7.2 Data transmission, handling, and storage",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,44,44
"The number of large-format cameras will be signiﬁcant: at least three for the chromospheric
telescope, two for the coronagraph, and one for the EUV polarimetric imager. They have
to operate simultaneously with a cadence of down to 1 s, so that even with some loss-less
data compression, this leads to a data rate of the order of 1 Gbit/s (see Fig. 10). A data
rate like this is certainly challenging and will require the use of high-capacity transmission
systems such as the laser communication systems currently under development and testing.
It is likely that such systems are available in one or two decades.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,611,94
"Large on-board storage units are required that have a capacity to temporarily save 50 TB
or more. This is the equivalent of continuously observing for 8 hours. Such a storage unit
requires an improvement in capacity by a factor of 10 compared to PHI/Solar Orbiter, for
instance, which might be feasible in a decade from now.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,324,90
"The continuous stream of data at a high rate requires re-thinking the techniques for
processing and archiving data. While the storage of this amount of data might not pose a
signiﬁcant challenge in a decade, the processing will need signiﬁcant improvements. Here
machine-learning techniques to be developed in the framework of big-data strategies will
help with the efﬁcient and automated standard processing steps, and may even provide a
(preliminary) data selection.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,468,88
8 Relation to other space- and ground-based observations,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,56,56
"Synoptic observations of the whole solar disc and the corona (at moderate resolution) are
important to place high-resolution data acquisition as proposed in this paper into context.
Synoptic observations are currently available through a range of space- and ground-based
facilities, for example by SOHO/LASCO, SDO, Proba2, STEREO, Hinode, or GONG+. Be-
cause of the relevance for operational space weather services, it can be assumed that (sim-
ilar) global monitoring observations will remain continuously present in the future (GOES,",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,535,91

"The next important step for the solar community in space is provided by the Solar Orbiter
mission that was launched in February 2020. This mission will address many of the funda-
mental questions in solar physics, in particular those concerning the connection from the
Sun to the heliosphere. However, it will not directly measure the magnetic ﬁeld in the outer
solar atmosphere. The science questions outlined in this paper in Sect. 2 will remain largely
open after Solar Orbiter. EUVST, a Japan-led high-resolution extreme-UV spectrometer, is
planned to be launched in the late 2020s. This will also lack the capability of investigating
polarisation and thus the magnetic ﬁeld in the outer solar atmosphere.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,709,93

(downgraded to M-class) with one or more missions in the ﬁelds of solar, heliospheric,
magnetospheric, and ionospheric physics as described in other papers in this volume. This

9 Conclusions,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,13,13
"The Sun is the star closest to Earth. It is the only star for which we can resolve details on
its surface and in its atmosphere. The outer solar atmosphere from the cool chromosphere
to the hot corona is permeated by a magnetic ﬁeld that energetically dominates the gas.
The magnetic ﬁeld controls the level of solar activity. It thus modulates the radiative output
of the Sun throughout the activity cycle, largely governs the emission from the UV to X-
ray radiation, ejects particles and ﬁelds from the corona, and drives space weather effects.
Through these magnetic activity effects, the Sun directly impacts the Earth and human life.
Likewise, the magnetic activity of other stars will have an impact on the planets orbiting
these host stars, and it will govern the habitability on these planets.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,802,94
"Although we can observationally characterise the magnetic ﬁeld on the solar surface (the
photosphere) reasonably well, we fail to do so for the higher layers. In the overlying chromo-
sphere and in the corona that stretches essentially into interplanetary space, our information
on the magnetic ﬁeld is mainly indirect. This state of knowledge is highly unsatisfactory be-
cause the magnetic ﬁeld energetically dominates the plasma in this outer solar atmosphere
and thus largely controls the phenomena that are observed there. Only by knowing the mag-
netic ﬁeld and its evolution can we unlock the source of heating of the gas to millions of
degrees, understand the shape and brightness of the corona, learn about magnetic reconnec-",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,734,94

unravel the initiation of large-scale ejections of parts of the solar atmosphere.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,174,92
"The lack of direct measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld in the outer solar atmosphere
is a major hindrance to our understanding of the physics of the outer solar atmosphere. If
we could remedy this, we would be able to explain a very wide variety of phenomena. In
essence, we are blind to the main driver of solar activity in the critical layers of the solar
atmosphere.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,367,94
"By directly measuring the magnetic ﬁeld in the outer atmosphere of the Sun, we will be",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,86,86

4. How do magnetic processes accelerate particles to high energies?,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,67,67
