ABSTRACT,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,8,8
"The physical foundations of the dissipation of energy and the associated heating in weakly collisional plasmas are poorly
understood. Here, we compare and contrast several measures that have been used to characterize energy dissipation and kinetic-
scale conversion in plasmas by means of a suite of kinetic numerical simulations describing both magnetic reconnection and
decaying plasma turbulence. We adopt three diﬀerent numerical codes that can also include interparticle collisions: the fully
kinetic particle-in-cell vpic, the fully kinetic continuum",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,556,126

There is an overall agreement between the dissipation measures obtained in the PIC and continuum reconnection simulations,
with slight diﬀerences due to the presence/absence of secondary islands in the two simulations. There are also many qualitative
similarities between the signatures in the reconnection simulations and the self-consistent current sheets that form in turbulence,
although the latter exhibits signiﬁcant variations compared to the reconnection results. All the parameters conﬁrm that dissipation
occurs close to regions of intense magnetic stresses, thus exhibiting local correlation. The distribution function-based measures
show a broader width compared to energy-based proxies, suggesting that energy transfer is co-localized at coherent structures,
but can aﬀect the particle distribution function in wider regions. The eﬀect of interparticle collisions on these parameters is",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,986,131

1 INTRODUCTION,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,14,14
"Understanding energy dissipation and heating in weakly collisional
plasmas is a key challenge in the study of space and astrophysical
plasmas, such as the solar corona, solar wind, the outer magneto-
spheres of planets, and compact astrophysical objects. At variance
with neutral ﬂuids and collisional plasmas (e.g. magnetoﬂuids), in-
terparticle collisions are typically weak in these systems and are of-
ten neglected. One example is during magnetic reconnection, where
magnetic ﬁelds with a reversing component eﬀectively break and
cross-connect at length-scales at and below the gyroradius of the",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,600,70

"particles (kinetic scales), allowing the conversion of magnetic en-
ergy to kinetic, thermal, and non-thermal energy (Yamada et al.
2010). Another example is that weakly collisional plasmas are often
observed to be in a strongly turbulent state (Federrath et al. 2010;
Bruno & Carbone 2016; Narita 2018; Beresnyak 2019; Fraternale
et al. 2019). Hence, they are characterized by the cross-scale transfer
of ﬂuctuation energy from large injection scales to smaller, kinetic
scales, where energy dissipation is expected to occur (Schekochihin
et al. 2009; Howes 2015b; Matthaeus et al. 2015; Vaivads et al. 2016;
Verscharen et al. 2019). These features have, at least, two profound
implications.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,692,71
"First, the dynamics of weakly collisional plasmas involve the whole",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,67,67
"phase-space, both in conﬁguration and velocity space, as opposed to",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,67,67
2,11,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1,1
O. Pezzi et al.,11,TeXGyreTermesX-Italic,,15,15
"collisional systems for which the proximity to local thermal equilib-
rium restricts velocity distribution functions to be near-Maxwellians
due to eﬃcient collisional thermalization. Indeed, VDFs in weakly
collisional plasmas frequently display non-equilibrium features, such
as temperature anisotropy and agyrotropy, rings, beams of acceler-
ated particles, etc. (Marsch 2006; Servidio et al. 2012, 2015; Lapenta
et al. 2017; Perri et al. 2020). In turbulence, this interesting dynamics
has been envisioned as a phase-space cascade (Tatsuno et al. 2009;
Plunk & Tatsuno 2011; Kanekar et al. 2015; Parker et al. 2016;
Schekochihin et al. 2016; Servidio et al. 2017), where the plasma
exhibits a power-law scaling –typical of turbulence– in both phys-
ical and velocity space. In this perspective, by expanding particle
VDFs in velocity space using Hermite polynomials, a power-law
Hermite spectrum was recently observed, reﬂecting the presence of
ﬁne velocity-space structures, in both",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,985,73
in situ,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Italic,,7,7
"observations (Servidio
et al. 2017) and numerical simulations (Cerri et al. 2018; Pezzi et al.
2018). This clearly illustrates the necessity of using kinetic models
to describe such plasmas. Moreover, non-Maxwellian structures in
particle VDFs are observed to be signiﬁcant in the vicinity of intense
current sheets or other nearby coherent structures such as vortices,
where MHD-like dissipation is thought to occur (Osman et al. 2011;
Servidio et al. 2012; Matthaeus et al. 2015; Parashar & Matthaeus
2016).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,509,71
"Secondly, concepts about energy dissipation and conversion in
neutral ﬂuids and magnetoﬂuids do not necessarily carry over to
weakly collisional systems. The rate and parametric dependence of
dissipation and kinetic-scale energy conversion for such plasmas is
extremely challenging and is not thoroughly understood. One chal-
lenge is that various physical mechanisms and processes can cause
dissipation and kinetic scale energy conversion in various physi-
cal circumstances. In weakly collisional plasmas in which kinetic
eﬀects play a crucial role in the dynamics, such as during turbu-
lence and reconnection, it may be diﬃcult to assess quantitatively
the relative importance of the various dissipative mechanisms, and
likewise the net eﬀect of a given dynamical process may be unclear
due to reversibility. To address these issues diﬀerent mechanisms and
concepts of dissipation have been proposed and, hence, several dis-
sipation surrogates have been adopted (see e.g. Vaivads et al. 2016;
Matthaeus et al. 2020, for recent reviews). However, a uniﬁed and
general picture of when and where diﬀerent views work better is still
lacking.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1142,69
"Another important question is the following: do the sites identiﬁed
potential sites of dissipation correspond to regions where interpar-
ticle collisions, although weak, dissipate energy in an irreversible",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,205,68
"way? Addressing this question has encouraged the examination of
a diﬀerent concept of dissipation associated with the growth of en-
tropy due to collisions (TenBarge et al. 2013; Navarro et al. 2016;
Pezzi et al. 2019c; Liang et al. 2019). Although collisions typically
act on large characteristic times (Spitzer Jr. 1956; Vaﬁn et al. 2019),
their eﬀects are enhanced where particle VDFs exhibit strong dis-
tortions, since intense velocity-space gradients are dissipated very
quickly by collisions (Landau 1936; Rosenbluth et al. 1957; Balescu
1960; Schekochihin et al. 2009; Pezzi et al. 2016; Pezzi 2017). Non-
Maxwellian VDFs make intraspecies collision operators non-zero,
thus activating this dissipation channel.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,719,71
"In the following, we classify eight diﬀerent dissipation proxies into
two general classes that we call “energy-based” and “VDF-based”.
The energy-based deﬁnition describes dissipation as a transfer of
energy within a ﬂuid-like description. Often such transfer occurs
from an ordered component (e.g. magnetic or bulk ﬂow ﬂuctuations)
into a random (e.g., internal) component. On the other hand, VDF-",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,398,69
based surrogates directly quantify the presence of non-equilibrium,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,66,66

"features in the particle VDF. The two classes of dissipation proxies
are correlated, since the distortion of the particle VDF is often the
consequence of a transfer of energy and vice versa. The dissipation
proxies here adopted do not explicitly distinguish signatures asso-
ciated with particular phenomena, e.g. Landau damping, cyclotron
damping, or stochastic processes (Chandran et al. 2010; Numata &
Loureiro 2015; Li et al. 2016; Chen et al. 2019). Future studies will
analyze the connection between these dissipation measures –useful
to detect potential sites of inhomogeneous dissipation in a turbulent
environment– and the underlying plasma processes, e.g. highlighted
through the ﬁeld-particle correlation (Klein & Howes 2016; Klein
et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2019; Klein et al. 2020).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,793,69
"In this work, we investigate numerically the functionality of several
dissipation proxies belonging to the two classes introduced above.
We focus on two diﬀerent types of numerical simulations: mag-
netic reconnection in a single current sheet and the development
of a turbulent cascade at kinetic scales. We exploit three diﬀerent
numerical Boltzmann–Maxwell algorithms, of both Lagrangian and
Eulerian type, that can include inter-particle collisions. In partic-",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,464,69
"ular, we adopt the fully kinetic particle-in-cell vpic code (Bowers",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,67,67
"et al. 2008), and two Eulerian Vlasov–Maxwell codes. These latter
codes are the fully kinetic continuum Vlasov–Maxwell solver imple-
mented in the",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,146,66

"simulation framework (Juno et al. 2018) and
the Hybrid Vlasov–Maxwell (HVM) code with kinetic protons and
ﬂuid electrons (Valentini et al. 2007). We ﬁnd that the dissipation
measures well characterize signiﬁcant features of both magnetic re-
connection and turbulence, such as the reconnection diﬀusion region
and the intermittent current sheets surrounding turbulent vortices.
The dissipation surrogates evaluated from the PIC and",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,431,67

A qualitative correspondence between the signatures in the recon-
nection simulations and the self-consistent current sheets generated
in turbulence is also found, despite larger variations observed in the
turbulent case with respect to the magnetic reconnection one. The
parameters show a",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,344,70

": their local peaks take place
in similar spatial regions, but they are not necessarily point-to-point
correlated (Yang et al. 2019; Matthaeus et al. 2020). When including
interparticle collisions, peaks of the dissipation proxies are in general
weaker than in the associated collisionless system, suggesting that the
slow yet incessant eﬀect of collisions locally reduce the transfer of
energy and the presence of non-Maxwellian features. By considering",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,454,73
"the eﬀect of both intraspecies and interspecies collisions, we conﬁrm
that the former mainly dissipate non-Maxwellian features in the par-
ticle VDF, although they may have an indirect eﬀect also on energy
transfer through the pressure tensor isotropization (Del Sarto et al.
2016). On the other hand, the latter also signiﬁcantly aﬀect energy-
based parameters. Finally, by adopting a suite of diﬀerent algorithms
and numerical codes, the current work aims at providing a further
contribution to the “turbulence dissipation challenge” (Parashar et al.
2015), on which several recent eﬀorts have been dedicated (e.g. Pezzi
et al. 2017; Perrone et al. 2018; González et al. 2019).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,679,71

is the constant mean energy transfer (or, in the stationary steady
state, the dissipation) rate of the turbulent cascade (Kolmogorov
1941). In 3D ﬂuid, fully developed turbulence, the sign of the av-
eraged third-order moment has to be negative, corresponding to an
ensemble-averaged global net transfer towards the small scales (the
non-linear turbulent energy cascade). Other terms locally contribut-
ing to the energy transfer vanish and are disregarded here. These
represent the diﬀerent ﬂuid contributions to the turbulent transfer of
energy: kinetic and magnetic turbulent energy transported by veloc-
ity ﬂuctuations, coupled magnetic and velocity Alfvénic ﬂuctuations
transported by magnetic structures, and two associated Hall terms. In
weakly collisional plasmas, the LET may be unable to describe the
contribution of compressibility, as well as the role of possible non-
thermal features. The latter might enter in the energy budget via the
pressure–tensor contributions. However, it can provide information",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1051,70
"on the local transfer of ordered energy towards small scales, where
it is made available for conversion through various possible mecha-
nisms, including dissipation. In particular, according to the deﬁnition
used in this work, negative LET terms can be thought of as locally
contributing to the non-linear energy transfer towards small scales,
and positive LET terms describe a contribution to energy transfer to
large scales. In non-turbulent systems as well as in systems displaying
a large-scale structure (e.g. a single reconnecting current sheet), the
interpretation of the LET sign is more diﬃcult, since the assumption
of homogeneity is not satisﬁed. However, for this analysis, peaks of
LET indicate the local concentration of cross-scale energy transfer
that can be made available for dissipation, regardless of the sign.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,830,71

the current-helicity term, i.e., the last term in Eq. 13) dominate
the non-linear energy transfer. This is related to the presence of
Hall-scale electric currents and to the magnetic conﬁguration of
the reconnection region, which thus are the main drivers of the non-
linear interactions. Furthermore, the prevalent positive sign observed
for the MHD cross-helicity term (not shown) suggests that non-linear
interactions are inhibited by the strong presence of coupled velocity-

transfer of energy and possibly the onset of turbulence.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,654,70

conditions is still not suﬃciently understood (Vaivads et al. 2016).
Therefore, a multiplicity of dissipation surrogates have been adopted
in the literature to identify potential sites of dissipation. Owing to
the strongly non-linear dynamics and the importance of physics at
kinetic scales in such systems, numerical simulations of the Vlasov–
Maxwell system (or, including collisions, the Boltzmann–Maxwell
system) are the decisive tool to address the long-standing issue of
plasma heating and energy dissipation in magnetized plasmas, e.g.
Parashar et al. (2009). For example, the “turbulence dissipation chal-
lenge” (Parashar et al. 2015) motivated numerical work to compare",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1145,70

", and the Eulerian Hybrid Vlasov–Maxwell codes
— to perform numerical simulations of two important physical phe-
nomena in plasma physics. The ﬁrst class investigates reconnection in
an isolated current sheet, and the second concerns plasma turbulence
at kinetic scales. We have calculated and compared eight distinct
dissipation proxies, delineated in Section 2. For the sake of clarity,
we have categorized them in terms of (i) energy-based parameters,
whose deﬁnition describes energy transfer and conversion; and (ii)
VDF-based parameters, that are directly related to kinetic signatures
in the particle VDF. Energy-based parameters considered here are the
power density by electromagnetic ﬁelds on charged particles (Zeni-
tani et al. 2011), the pressure–strain interaction (Yang et al. 2017a),
and a local proxy of the turbulent energy transfer (Sorriso-Valvo et al.
2018a). The VDF-based parameters are the local pressure agyrotropy
(Swisdak 2016) and three measures describing how diﬀerent a lo-
cal distribution function is from being Maxwellian (Kaufmann &
Paterson 2009; Greco et al. 2012; Liang et al. 2019).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1120,72
"Our ﬁndings are that each of the studied measures is non-zero
in key settings in reconnection and turbulence, including the recon-
nection diﬀusion region and magnetic islands, and the intermittent
magnetic shear regions bordering magnetic eddies in a turbulent sys-
tem. The region that each proxy is strongest highlights a potentially
diﬀerent aspect of the physics taking place, as is described in detail
in Sections 4 and 5. It is intended that the discussion therein will
contribute to the assessment of dissipation and energy conversion in
satellite and plasma laboratory experiment measurements. We here
remark on the importance of the VDF-based diagnostics, which re-
veal further details about the underlying dynamics of the plasma
compared to the energy-based diagnostics. Indeed, the energy-based
diagnostics give similar results for similar simulations in the mag-
netic reconnection setup (i.e. vpic and",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,916,70
Gkeyll,8,t1xtt,,6,6
"runs), as we expect
since these simulations which show little diﬀerence in many of the
measures of the plasma response to magnetic reconnection. However,
the additional level of detail provided by VDF-based diagnostics al-
lows us to more carefully ascertain the kinetic response of the plasma
from small diﬀerences which arise naturally between two diﬀerent
simulation codes, and the added robustness of these diagnostics is
likely to be especially useful when analysing more general simu-
lations and observations of real plasma systems such as the solar",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,556,70
"wind. In contrast, the energy-based diagnostics are directly related to
the turbulence cascade process that connects the energy containing
scales to the kinetic range of scales where the velocity space structure
becomes increasingly important. Therefore both type of diagnostics
are helpful to form a complete picture of the dynamics leading to
dissipation.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,357,72
"The spatial locations where each proxy has a local maximum can
be diﬀerent between the diﬀerent proxies. For example, in the mag-
netic reconnection simulations, the Zenitani measure is peaked at
the X-point while the pressure–strain interaction terms are peaked
inside the magnetic islands. This conﬁrms a suggestion that both
energy-based and VDF-based parameters display a regional correla-
tion: structures identiﬁed by these parameters often occur in similar
regions, although not necessarily exhibiting a point-to-point corre-
lation. This underscores a key conclusion of this work: that no one
single measure is universally the best measure for dissipation. Rather,
employing a number of proxies is likely best for assessing the dissi-",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,742,71

"We also consider the role of collisions by including their dy-
namical eﬀect",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,76,62
ab initio,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Italic,,9,9
"in the numerical simulations for both re-
connection and turbulence. When including only weak intraspecies
(proton–proton) collisions in the turbulence simulations, the VDF-
based proxies decreased while the energy-based proxies were largely
unchanged. This behavior is expected since such collisions drive par-
ticle VDFs towards Maxwellian distributions, but they do not pro-
duce a net energy transfer between diﬀerent species although they
indirectly modify the energy equations by isotropizing the pressure
tensor (Del Sarto et al. 2016). On the other hand, both energy- and
VDF-based proxies are inﬂuenced by interspecies and intraspecies
(electron–proton) collisions in simulations of magnetic reconnection.
In particular, small-scale structures are dissipated by collisions, and
the distributions in the diﬀusion region are less non-Maxwellian and
thermalize more rapidly than in the collisionless case.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,911,71
"Interestingly, we ﬁnd the peaks of dissipation proxies in the sys-
tems with collisions are generally weaker than in the collisionless
system. VDF-based dissipation proxies show this behavior for all the
simulations reported in the manuscript. These surrogates are local",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,270,68
in position space and provide only a local measure of the complex-,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,66,66
"ity of the distribution function. Energy-based measures also become
weaker in the collisional runs of magnetic reconnection, which in-
clude interspecies collisional eﬀects. This behavior is an eﬀect of the
work of collisions that, since the beginning of the numerical simula-
tion, have produced dissipation. In particular, intraspecies collisions
dissipate VDF complexity, while interspecies collisions aﬀect both
the VDF and the energy. Therefore, by looking at these parameters at
a ﬁxed time snapshot, their peaks are weaker in the collisional runs
with respect to the collisionless case. Further, it also clearly illustrates
that the energy-based measures contain information about both col-
lisional and collisionless processes, implying that they are not yet
capable of distinguishing reversible from irreversible processes.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,832,76
"Although deﬁning the concept of dissipation in a collisionless
plasma is rather complicated, analysing dissipation surrogates in col-
lisionless simulations and comparing the evolution of these proxies in
collisionless and collisional runs, as done in this study, is meaningful.
Such a comparison indeed addresses the key question: are collisions
preferentially active in regions where the dissipation surrogates eval-
uated in absence of collisions are intense, i.e. where other dynami-
cal characteristics (e.g. pressure–strain interactions, non-Maxwellian
structures) are signiﬁcant? Our analysis may indirectly suggest a posi-
tive answer to this question. The regional correlation of energy-based
and VDF-based diagnostics indicate that non-Maxwellian structures
in the particle VDF are expected close to regions where energy-",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,831,73
"based dissipation surrogates are also strong. Moreover, as shown
in previous studies (Landau 1936; Rosenbluth et al. 1957; Balescu
1960; Schekochihin et al. 2009; Pezzi et al. 2016, 2019c), collisions
rapidly dissipate strong velocity–space disturbances in the particle
VDF. Hence, we suggest that regions identiﬁed by dissipation sur-
rogates in the collisionless simulations are regions where collisions,
if present, preferentially smooth out non-Maxwellian features in the
particle VDF, thus producing irreversible dissipation.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,530,70
"The present study is not intended to be the ﬁnal word on this
topic, as there are many avenues for future work. The diagnostics
considered here do not discriminate the underlying process which
may lead to energy dissipation or conversion, e.g. Landau damping,
cyclotron damping, phase-mixing, and stochastic heating (Chandran
et al. 2010; Li et al. 2016). In this perspective, a diﬀerent approach,
based on the",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,410,71
ﬁeld-particle correlation,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Italic,,25,25
", has been recently adopted to
identify the presence of particular signatures in the particle VDF
(Klein & Howes 2016; Klein et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2019; Klein",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,161,66
et al. 2020). This method has the advantage of diagnosing energiza-,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,67,67
"tion directly in velocity space while the others here adopted involve
an integration over the full velocity space. The ﬁeld-particle corre-
lation is also local in physical space and does not require spatial
gradients, which would require multiple spacecraft for",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,262,69
in situ,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Italic,,7,7
"ob-
servations. Incorporating the ﬁeld–particle correlation gives a visual
way to identify energy transfer between particles and ﬁelds, and
would be interesting to compare with the other proxies. Indeed, the
diagnostics considered in this work are extremely useful to char-
acterize potential sites of intermittent dissipation, e.g. in structures
close to intense current sheets. On the other hand, methods such as
the ﬁeld–particle correlation identiﬁes basic plasma processes, e.g.
Landau damping. Connecting these two points of view would also
contribute to addressing the fundamental question whether dissipa-
tion in plasmas is uniform or intermittent (Vaivads et al. 2016) and
deserves a dedicated, future study. Moreover, kinetic plasma turbu-
lence excites in a very complex way an entire ensemble of genuinely
kinetic degrees of freedom, i.e. those related to velocity–space struc-
tures in the particle VDF (Servidio et al. 2017; Pezzi et al. 2018),
thus driving free energy towards ﬁner and ﬁner scales in velocity
space where it is dissipated through interparticle collisions (Pezzi
et al. 2019c). The relation of the dissipation surrogates considered
here with the enstrophy phase-space cascade will be the subject of a
future work.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1245,72
"Finally, there are many necessary extensions to the current study.
The present simulations varied collisionality, but for a particular set
of ﬁeld and plasma initial conditions, so the parametric dependence
of the conclusions attained herein should be the subject of future
work. Both the reconnection and turbulence simulations were 2D,
and therefore 3D eﬀects are not captured. The reconnection sim-
ulations studied here employed a small system size in which the
protons do not fully couple back to the large-scale systems, so it is
important to revisit the proton dissipation measures in larger sys-
tem sizes. The eﬀect of proton–electron collisions on energy-based
parameters in turbulence should be addressed in future work. The tur-
bulence simulations considered here addressed decaying turbulence,
and comparisons to driven turbulence would be interesting.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,866,71
