"Neutron stars are one of Nature’s most intriguing astronomical objects and provide a unique
laboratory for studying strongly interacting, neutron-rich matter under extreme conditions.
With masses of about 1
2 times that of the Sun and radii of only approximately 10 km,
neutron stars contain the densest form of matter in the observable Universe and lie just
at the threshold for collapse to a black hole. Much has already been learned about neu-
tron stars through mass and radius measurements, pulsar timing, x-ray observations, and
gravitational-wave measurements of binary mergers in the new era of multimessenger as-
tronomy (see,",8,CMR9,,635,91

the last few years, the combination of systematic nuclear matter predictions from ChEFT,
uncertainty quantiﬁcation, and neutron star observations has developed into a new avenue

zero and ﬁnite temperature based on chiral two- and multi-nucleon interactions. We also
discuss Bayesian methods for quantifying and propagating statistically meaningful theo-
retical uncertainties. Together with nuclear experiments, astrophysical simulations, and
neutron star observations, next-generation ChEFT calculations will be crucial to infer the
nature of the extreme matter hidden deep beneath the surface of neutron stars.",8,CMR9,,566,90
"The review is organized as follows. In Section 2 we focus on recent progress in deriving
nuclear forces from ChEFT and renormalization group (RG) methods to improve the many-
body convergence in nuclear matter calculations. We then dedicate Section 3 to recent
high-order MBPT calculations of the moderate-density nuclear EOS at zero temperature
and advances in the Bayesian quantiﬁcation of EFT truncation errors. We also discuss
ﬁnite-temperature calculations and nuclear thermodynamics. In Section 4 we review the
present status of the high-density nuclear EOS constrained by nuclear theory, experiment,
and observation in the era of multimessenger astronomy, emphasizing the importance of
ChEFT. Section 5 ends the review with our summary and perspectives on future advances
in nuclear matter calculations and their applications to astrophysics.",8,CMR9,,849,89

In the traditional Brueckner (or,8,CMR9,,32,32
G,8,CMMI9,,1,1
"-matrix) approach (35), the pp ladder diagrams are
resummed to all orders, motivated by the large high-momentum components of traditional
NN potentials to which the pp ladders are particularly sensitive. The pp bubbles in these
diagrams are even ultraviolet divergent if the potential is not suﬃciently suppressed at high",8,CMR9,,321,93
"momenta. For modern low-momentum potentials, however, the pp ladders no longer play
a distinguished role in the many-body expansion, and explicit MBPT calculations at third
and fourth order have shown that they are not enhanced compared to other diagrams at
the same order (27). Nevertheless, partial diagrammatic resummations are still pertinent
for consistent calculations of in-medium single-particle properties and response functions as
performed in the self-consistent Green’s functions method (for more details see Section 2.4).

"this review, various other many-body methods have been applied in initial nuclear matter
studies with chiral NN and 3N interactions. In particular, nonperturbative frameworks are
important to benchmark the MBPT convergence and probe aspects of many-body physics
beyond the nuclear EOS. Below we will brieﬂy discuss the",8,CMR9,,318,89
"self-consistent Green’s functions
(SCGF) approach",8,CMTI9,,49,33
and,8,CMR9,,3,3
Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods,8,CMTI9,,33,33
". Other methods not dis-
cussed here for brevity are coupled-cluster (CC) theory (40), the in-medium SRG (4), and
lattice EFT (41). Systematic comparisons between diﬀerent many-body frameworks will
provide a coherent picture of microscopic interactions and nuclear many-body properties.
The SCGF approach (42, 43) is based on the self-consistent computation of in-medium",8,CMR9,,370,88
"propagators (or Green’s functions) in Fourier (Matsubara) space, corresponding to the to-
all-orders resummation of some perturbative contributions to the propagators. SCGF calcu-

to all orders, providing a thermodynamically consistent generalization of Brueckner the-
ory (43). Furthermore, SCGF calculations have been used to benchmark the order-by-order
convergence of MBPT (up to third order) in neutron matter (46). The energy per particle
obtained in SCGF and MBPT was found to agree well for a range of unevolved chiral NN
and 3N interactions up to N",8,CMR9,,439,88

with MBPT calculations of these quantities.",8,CMR9,,192,91
"QMC refers to a family of stochastic methods that solve the many-body Schr¨odinger
equation through random sampling (6). As such, QMC methods are truly nonperturba-
tive and provide important benchmarks for many-body methods with basis expansions.
However, apart from the fermion sign problem a caveat is that most QMC methods require
local nuclear potentials to obtain low-variance results, restricting both the regularization
scheme and the interaction operators that can be included in the ChEFT expansion. QMC
calculations with local chiral NN and 3N potentials up to N",8,CMR9,,573,92
2,5,CMR6,,1,1
"LO have been carried out in
neutron matter (47, 48) and recently also symmetric nuclear matter (49). Because of Fierz
invariance breaking, the regulator artifacts are signiﬁcantly larger than in MBPT calcula-
tions with nonlocal potentials. On the other hand, since QMC methods are not restricted",8,CMR9,,296,90
"to soft interactions, a much wider range of momentum cutoﬀs can be studied with QMC.
Hence, QMC methods can provide important insights into the residual cutoﬀ dependence
of observables and the breakdown scale of ChEFT at high densities.",8,CMR9,,236,84

Recently, the calculation (166, 162) of nuclear response functions that include mean-ﬁeld
eﬀects from ChEFT interactions have shown that terms beyond the Hartree-Fock approxi-

diagrams were shown (166) to produce larger isovector mean ﬁelds due to resonant, non-
perturbative eﬀects in the NN interaction. Moreover, for neutral-current neutrino reactions,

to signiﬁcantly enhance reaction rates at low densities compared to the traditional one-pion

calculations provide the basis for improved modeling of supernovae, neutron stars, and neu-

studying the nuclear EOS and transport properties across a wide range of densities, isospin
asymmetries, and temperatures. We have also shown how advances in high-performance
computing have enabled the implementation of two- and multi-nucleon forces in MBPT
up to high orders in the chiral and many-body expansions. Finally, we have described
new tools for quantifying theoretical uncertainties (especially EFT truncation errors) to
confront microscopic calculations of the nuclear EOS with empirical constraints. Such sys-
tematic studies are particularly important in view of EOS constraints anticipated in the
