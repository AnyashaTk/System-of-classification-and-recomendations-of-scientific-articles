edge of ﬁlaments, providing an excellent way to constrain the outer ﬁlament radius. When
feedback is included the gas temperature and vorticity ﬁelds are strongly perturbed, hindering
such a measurement in the vicinity of the galaxy. However, the core radius of the ﬁlaments as
measured from the gas density ﬁeld is largely unaﬀected by feedback, and the median central
density is only reduced by about 20%.",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,476,94

INTRODUCTION,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,12,12
Galactic surveys have revealed the presence of anisotropic structure,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,68,68
"on scales of Mpc, made up of nodes, voids, sheets and ﬁlaments (e.g.
Davis et al. 1982; de Lapparent et al. 1986; Geller & Huchra 1989).
Cosmological simulations are able to reproduce this network, the
so-called cosmic web (Bond et al. 1996; Pogosyan et al. 1998), and
unveil its existence not just for the distribution of galaxies but also
for the underlying gas and DM density, as a consequence of the hi-
erarchical growth of structures in",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,442,71

"CDM. Gravity ampliﬁes small
anisotropies, resulting in a near homogenous background collapsing
to form sheets which can collapse again along another axis to form
ﬁlaments. Halos form at ﬁlament intersections where, according to
cosmological hydrodynamics simulations, galaxies at high redshift
grow in mass and angular momentum primarily by material trans-
ported along these ﬁlaments (Birnboim & Dekel 2003; Kereš et al.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,421,66

"While at large scale gas ﬁlaments closely follow the structure
of their DM counterparts in the cosmic web, at the scale of halos
they can penetrate deep into the virial radius and even connect to
galactic disks triggering star formation episodes (see e.g. Katz et al.
2003; Kereš et al. 2005; Woods et al. 2014; Stewart et al. 2017).
The erosion of these small-scale gas ﬁlaments at lower redshifts is
argued to be at least partly responsible for the bimodal distribution
in colour, star formation rates and morphology of galaxies (Dekel
& Birnboim 2006) (though quenching of the largest galaxies are
dependent on AGN feedback, see e.g. Croton et al. (2006)). Other
implicit evidence for the presence of inﬂows is the presence of
low metallicity G-dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood, as established
in the seminal work of van den Bergh (1962). As gas depletion
timescales are estimated to be on the order of a few Gyrs for local
disk galaxies (e.g. Bigiel et al. 2011; Leroy et al. 2013; Rahman et al.
2012), replenishment by inﬂow of pristine gas is required to match
the observations. This ﬁnding is also supported by observations",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1131,72

At high masses this behaviour is overcome by mergers, or as Laigle
et al. (2015) argues, the accretion of material from multiple vortic-
ity domains. This dichotomy in galaxy spins shows the profound
impact of cosmic ﬁlaments on the galaxies embedded within them.
The inverse problem has also been studied (Pandya et al. 2019) at-
tempting to use the alignment of galaxies to detect the cosmic web
with the CANDELS survey (Grogin et al. 2011; Koekemoer et al.
2011). The non-detection of the alignment signal is likely due to

"On smaller scales, the misalignment of gas and DM angular
momenta in simulations has been attributed to diﬀerent redistri-
bution processes during halo virialisation (e.g. Kimm et al. 2011;
Stewart et al. 2013). However, it has also been argued that instabili-
ties within the ﬁlaments could develop, leading to their fragmenta-
tion and breakup, thereby preventing cold gas from being smoothly
accreted by the host galaxy. In such a scenario, the angular mo-
mentum segregation between DM and gas could be construed as an
artefact of poor numerical resolution in ﬁlaments. Several authors
(Freundlich et al. 2014; Mandelker et al. 2016; Padnos et al. 2018;
Mandelker et al. 2019; Berlok & Pfrommer 2019) carried out ide-
alised simulations of ﬁlaments entering a halo, and concluded that
they should be stable, given their width and velocity. Cornuault et al.
(2018) used a phenomenological model of a gas stream to explore
the possibility of a turbulent, multi-phase ﬁlament. The accretion ef-",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,995,71

as to whether such a multi-phase model constitutes an acceptable

line with arguments made in Birnboim & Dekel 2003).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,121,66
"Ultimately, to distinguish between these scenarios and better
assess the role played by ﬁlaments on galaxy evolution, quantitative
direct measurements of their properties need to be made. How-
ever, these have proven notoriously elusive so far (see e.g. Kimm
et al. 2011, for a more detailed discussion). Indeed, direct obser-
vations of the distant cosmic web suﬀer from the steep scaling of
surface brightness with redshift, which makes the cold ﬁlaments
extremely hard to detect in emission (though not impossible, see
e.g. Giavalisco et al. 2011; Ribaudo et al. 2011; Kacprzak et al.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,587,68
"2012; Martin et al. 2016; Gallego et al. 2018; Elias et al. 2020), and
thus rely on stacking, or back-lighting by a bright source. Future
surveys using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) (Gardner
et al. 2006) while being insensitive to the smoothly accreting gas
itself, the telescope will be sensitive to a range of associated phe-
nomena. Filaments are typically traced by Lyman-",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,384,70

BlueMUSE instrument. On larger scales, ﬁlamentary gas can be

by looking at the separation between temperature peaks caused by
the accretion shock, although these authors acknowledge that they
did not separate edge-on sheets from ﬁlaments in their sample. Us-
ing cosmological simulations, Dekel et al. (2009) found that DM
ﬁlament radii are comparable to the virial radius of the halos they
connect, and that the cold gas streams residing within the halos are
considerably narrower, typically a few percent of the virial radius.
The scale free nature of CDM results in progressively smaller ﬁla-
ments feeding into larger ones at all scales, down to the numerical
resolution of the simulation in this case. However, alternative DM
theories could result in diﬀerent DM structures, (e.g. Warm DM
Gao & Theuns 2007). This produces ﬁlaments down to Mpc-scales,
while erasing smaller scale structure. Mocz et al. (2019) studied
ﬁlaments under the Fuzzy DM regime, where an additional quan-
tum pressure prevents the formation of lower mass ﬁlaments. Both
WDM and FDM result in higher density ﬁlaments at earlier times,
with the formation of population III occurring within them (Mocz
et al. 2019), further distinguishing these versions of DM from CDM.
It is possible that the supernovae of these stars will be detectable
with JWST (Hartwig et al. 2018).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1289,68

"The DM particle distribution is tessellated using the Delaunay Tes-

DisPerSE (Sousbie 2011). DisPerSE computes stationary points
(maxima, minima and saddle points) of the density ﬁeld using the
Hessian matrix and assigns to each pair of critical points (e.g.
maxima-saddle) a persistence, namely a measure of how signiﬁ-
cant it is with respect to a Poisson distribution. The persistence
threshold is the single parameter that determines which features are
considered as noise and which robustly pertain to the topology of
the underlying density ﬁeld. From this set of stationary points that
characterize the topology of the ﬁeld, DisPerSE connects saddles to",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,724,68

with skelconv (see DisPerSE manual",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,101,66
1,7,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1,1
") using the breakdown and
smooth functions. breakdown removes duplicate segments enter-
ing a node from two diﬀerent starting points. These segments can be
so close as to be indistinguishable from one another and as such are
removed to prevent their over-representation in the ﬁnal skeleton.
The skeleton is then smoothed by averaging over the positions of the
30 nearest neighbours of each segment. This mitigates the eﬀects
of Poisson noise on the skeleton, ensuring that individual segments
locally follow the global direction of the ﬁlament they belong to.
In both the feedback and no-feedback runs, 1.22 physical kpc is
the maximum spatial resolution reached in ﬁlaments, deﬁned as
the size of an individual cell on the highest AMR grid level that
entirely maps the ﬁlament (see Fig. 2). As is clear from Figure
2, higher reﬁnement levels are triggered within ﬁlaments but their
coverage is patchy, and mostly concentrated around halos/galaxies
embedded within these elongated structures. As we argue in our
convergence analysis (Section 3), we believe 1.22 kpc is enough to
resolve the radial structure of ﬁlaments, at least those that connect
to halos/galaxies with masses similar (or larger) to the one we study
in this paper (roughly M",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1244,69
★,7,NewTXMI7,,1,1
"). We emphasize that this is a much higher
resolution than that currently reached in large-scale cosmological
hydrodynamics simulations, where",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,142,66
,8,txsys,,0,0
"1 kpc resolution is only at-
tained within galaxies (e.g. Dubois et al. 2014; Vogelsberger et al.
2014; Nelson et al. 2018; Davé et al. 2019; Schaye et al. 2015;
Nelson et al. 2019a). The main drawback of our study is that such
resolution is obtained at the cost of simulating a much smaller vol-
ume, and thus focuses on a single object. Filament extraction is per-
formed at the maximum level of resolution thus deﬁned. However,
as highlighted by Rosdahl & Blaizot (2012) and in our convergence
study (Section 3), increasing the resolution does not seem to aﬀect
the ﬁlament properties much, and we thus expect that our results
only weakly depend on resolution.
Finally, we note that DisPerSE applied to the DM particle distri-
bution, as is done in this paper, only allows the extraction of the
ﬁlaments down to a scale comparable with the virial radius of DM
halos. Below this scale, DM ﬁlaments (at least in standard 3D space)
are washed out by the virialisation process at the origin of halo for-
mation and evolution. Therefore, we restrict our measurements of
ﬁlament properties to ﬁlament segments located outside of the virial
radii of embedded DM halos.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1164,70

ﬁlaments are aﬀected by feedback, the impact of this feedback on
the growth of the central galaxy is minimal (it does not lead to
the disruption of the main ﬁlament) as the majority of the gas
feeding it at high redshift is accreted via ﬁlaments, and not from
mergers (Danovich et al. 2012; Tillson et al. 2015). However, the gas

signiﬁcance of a feature with respect to Poisson noise). For these

2.3.1 Calculating DM temperature and vorticity ﬁelds,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Italic,,52,52
"Due to the discrete Lagrangian nature of the numerical technique
used to evolve the DM density ﬁeld, a simple cloud-in-cell interpo-
lation onto a reasonably sized regular grid generates a non-smooth
density ﬁeld in poorly sampled, low density regions. To get around
this diﬃculty, a Delaunay tessellation (Schaap & van de Weygaert
2000) is computed from the DM density and velocity ﬁelds (see e.g.
Schaap 2007), which ensures their spatial continuity. The Delaunay
grid is then projected onto a regular uniform grid, coinciding with
AMR grid level 11, which corresponds to the maximum resolution
mapping of the entire ﬁlament (cubic cells 1.22 kpc on a side, see
Fig. 2). This uniform grid is used for measurement of all quantities
in this paper unless otherwise stated. The DM velocity dispersion
ﬁeld – used as a proxy for temperature – is then obtained by com-
puting the square of the diﬀerence between each particle velocity
and the value of its nearest neighbour grid cell and re-applying the
Delaunay tessellation with this dispersion as the weight. Every time
the Delaunay tessellation is projected onto the grid, we average all
the tetrahedra (or volume fractions of) that co-exist in each grid",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1204,68
"cell. The vorticity, on the other hand, is simply calculated by taking
the curl of the velocity ﬁeld on the uniform grid. As this latter is ex-
tremely noisy, a Gaussian smoothing is applied prior to computing
vorticity, with a width of 2 cells.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,245,72
2.3.2 Cross-section extraction and radial proﬁles,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Italic,,49,49
"For each segment of the skeleton, a ﬁeld (density, temperature or
vorticity) is linearly interpolated in a plane, the thickness of which
is equal to the skeleton segment length (typically 0.3 kpc, though
this depends on the local density). This plane is perpendicular to
the segment and centred on it. An example of individual cross-
sections in the density, temperature and vorticity ﬁelds is displayed
in Fig. 5. Note that the position of the DM or gas density peak
does not necessarily lie exactly at the centre of the plane due to
the smoothing of the skeleton. Smoothing is required to ensure that
individual segments point along the ﬁlament direction, and thus",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,666,70
"that the extracted planes are truly perpendicular to the ﬁlament.
The gas density maximum is not tied to the DM density maximum
and thus is also unlikely to be at the centre of the plane. In order
to correct for such small oﬀsets which nevertheless do aﬀect pro-
ﬁle measurements, each plane is shifted using a method similar to
the ’shrinking sphere’ method outlined in Power et al. (2003). The
centre of mass of a circle centred (with a radius greater than the
truncation radius) on the initial guess from DisPerSE is calculated.
The circle is moved to the centre of mass before the procedure is
repeated with a smaller circle. This method is more robust to the
presence of additional substructure within the ﬁlament, particularly
as cells with",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,746,68

themselves, with weaker shocks also present at the wall boundaries
and where the walls intersect to form the ﬁlaments. In the vorticity

stacking is required, we therefore use the modulus of the vorticity
parallel to the direction of the ﬁlament and ignore azimuthal varia-
tions in vorticity. The vorticity ﬁeld in the direction of the ﬁlament

the vorticity ﬁeld probably reﬂects the fact that the analysis in this
paper looks at smaller scale vorticity than Laigle et al. (2015), and
extends the measurement to gas. We recall that primordial vortic-
ity is destroyed in an expanding Universe, and therefore voids are
extremely vorticity poor. Vorticity can later be produced by shocks
or shell-crossing (respectively for gas and DM), and as result is
chieﬂy conﬁned to walls, ﬁlaments and nodes (see e.g. Pichon &

the sound speed and velocity dispersion are ﬂat and dominate over
the accretion velocity onto the ﬁlament, which suggests – for the

"The ﬁrst assumption we have made concerns the isothermality of
the ﬁlament-wall system and that accretion onto the ﬁlament pro-
vides it with negligible support. In Fig. 7 we can see that for the
no feedback run both the gas sound speed (black solid line and
solid disk symbols) and the DM velocity dispersion (red solid line
and solid disk symbols) stay constant over most of the width of the
ﬁlament, indicating that the isothermal approximation does indeed
hold rather well. In addition, the gas and DM accretion velocities are
considerably lower than the sound speed and velocity dispersion re-
spectively, and as such the dynamics of the system should be mainly
driven by the pressure support. Moreover, the accretion shock itself
is also non-adiabatic. Indeed, the upstream mach number (beyond

"Beyond a certain radius it is no longer true that sound and
dispersion velocities dominate over the accretion velocity, as can
be seen in Fig. 7. A failure of the hydrostatic model will thus oc-
cur, leading to a potential deﬁnition of the truncation radius, which
also coincides with the position of the accretion shock onto the
ﬁlament for the gas. We have opted not to use the peak tempera-
ture position as a deﬁnition of the truncation radius, as individual
skeleton segment proﬁles, both in temperature and vorticity are
often asymmetric and/or distorted by their environment, and may
contain multiple peaks when averaged over concentric radial shells
as a result (see Fig 5 for an example). Moreover, such a deﬁnition
would not apply to DM velocity dispersion proﬁles. We have there-
fore chosen to use a universal method for all physical quantities
and types of ﬁlament (gas or DM), which also has the beneﬁt of
providing internal consistency between measurements. We thus de-
ﬁne the truncation radius as the point where the steepest descent

"Looking ﬁrst at the density proﬁles both of the DM and gas
ﬁlaments (top panels of Fig. 9), one can see that in going from the
highest resolution level to the lowest one, the central density (inside
the core) is underestimated by about an order of magnitude, and
one becomes unable to measure the core radius of the proﬁle with a
reasonable accuracy. On the other hand, the DM velocity dispersion
proﬁles (middle left panel of Fig 9) seem to converge faster than
the density ones, with the lower resolution estimates compatible
with the higher resolution ones at all radii. This seemingly rapid
convergence is induced by the shape of the isothermal proﬁles which
are, by deﬁnition, ﬂat, especially in the case of the DM. For the
gas (middle right panel of Fig 9), the temperature does not show
as marked a convergence as the DM velocity dispersion because
of the presence of the accretion shock: the low resolution data
(black curve), which barely resolves the truncation radius of the

to propagate outwards and ends up ﬁlling the entire DM ﬁlament

to the galaxy on the width of the ﬁlament. As can be seen in Fig.
11 (top panel), both the core and truncation radii of the gas ﬁla-
ment decrease by less than a factor 2 as a function of the distance
to the main galaxy embedded within it. This decrease is progres-
sive, from a maximum radius at 300 kpc away, which corresponds
to the distance of either ends of the ﬁlament (see Fig. 1), to the
virial radius of the central galaxy. We caution the reader that this is
somewhat diﬀerent to the reported behaviour of the ﬁlament once
it enters the virial radius of the embedded DM halo (e.g. Danovich
et al. 2012). Indeed, within the virial radius, one expects the gas
ﬁlament to undergo more important gravitational focusing (Klar &
Mücket 2012). The reason why this does not happen as strongly
in our case very likely has to do with the fact that, as previously
mentioned, we chose to excise embedded DM halos to focus our
analysis on ﬁlament properties. However, while the ﬁlament radii
do not decrease much as the gas approaches the halo, it is still
enough to increase the central density, rising by a factor of a",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1151,71

that such a behaviour is not speciﬁc to the gas as the DM central
density (green solid line in the bottom panel of Fig. 11) undergoes
a similar change with distance to the galaxy, which is consistent
with an interpretation in terms of mild gravitational focusing but
also of the progressive draining of the ﬁlament core draining by
the halo, as previously mentioned. Finally we want to emphasize
that the nut galaxy, essentially connected to one (two if counting",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,531,67

ﬁlament properties to be dependent on ﬁlament environment, with
longer ﬁlaments typically (and therefore more distant from dense
structures) hosting colder gas. Once again, further high resolution

back, and so the temperature signature of the accretion shock onto

signiﬁcant perturbations, the presence of a DM ﬁlament potential
well coupled to the relatively high density of the gas ensures that",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,467,71

ﬁlament is still visible as a cold stream cutting through the hot

"Due to these consequent perturbations induced by the stellar
feedback, we cannot use either the temperature or vorticity to deﬁne
the gas ﬁlament truncation radii in the feedback run. It should also be
noted that our assumption of isothermality of the ﬁlaments becomes
less valid than in the no stellar feedback case as stronger temperature
gradients develop between core and outer envelope. To be more
speciﬁc, in the no feedback case, the temperature varies between
core and truncation radius by about a factor of two, but in the
feedback case in can reach an order of magnitude. However, most
of this gradient is localised in the outer parts of the ﬁlament, so that
the central region retains a signiﬁcantly large isothermal core. This
can be understood by performing the following simple calculation.
Neglecting the presence of the wall, we may integrate both the gas

by this supernova feedback then they are unlikely to be destroyed
by any ’realistic’ supernova feedback. Yet, other types of stellar
feedback are also present which could alter ﬁlament properties,
whether by direct action of the feedback on the ﬁlaments or through
suppression of star formation and thereby the supernova feedback
(e.g. resonant scattering of Lyman alpha photons in high redshift
dwarf galaxies Kimm et al. 2018). There is, of course, photo-heating
due to ionising radiation which can induce an important gas density
depletion especially in ﬁlaments connecting low mass halos (see

another mode of stellar feedback which we do not account for, might
be more eﬀective at ﬁlament disruption as it is less conﬁned to the
galaxy: cosmic rays (see e.g. Pfrommer et al. 2017), . Finally, for

characteristics are, as yet, not completely understood, and they are
extremely hard to detect observationally. We used a suite of high
