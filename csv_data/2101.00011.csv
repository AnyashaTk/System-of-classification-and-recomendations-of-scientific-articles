Abstract,8,CMBX9,,8,8
"The next decade will be an exciting period for solar astrophysics, as new ground- and space-based
instrumentation will provide unprecedented observations of the solar atmosphere and heliosphere. The
synergy between modeling eﬀort and comprehensive analysis of observations is crucial for the understand-
ing of the physical processes behind the observed phenomena. However, the unprecedented wealth of
data on one hand, and the complexity of the physical phenomena on the other, require the development
of new approaches in both data analysis and numerical modeling. In this white paper, we summarize
recent numerical achievements to reproduce structure, dynamics, and observed phenomena from the
photosphere to the low corona and outline challenges we expect to face for the interpretation of future
observations.",8,CMR9,,814,104

"spatial resolution images in wavelengths from radio to X-rays, as well as helioseismic imaging of the solar
interior. The nearness of the Earth to the Sun allows measurements diﬃcult or impossible for other stars,
such as in-situ measurements of solar wind properties (e.g., chemical composition, magnetic ﬁeld, particle
energy distributions, etc.), detection of neutrinos emitted in the solar core, and geomagnetic indices (which
include direct measurements of properties of the magnetic ﬁeld as well as indirect indices such as cosmogenic
isotopes). Each of these contributes to providing unique information about how energy is generated in the
Sun, transported into the atmosphere and heliosphere, and dissipated through a variety of phenomena on
temporal scales of seconds to millennia.",9,CMR10,,790,109

"our understanding about solar interior dynamics, the evolution and structure of polar magnetic ﬁelds, and
the fast solar wind (M¨uller et al., 2020). Base knowledge from currently available observations from space
missions (e.g., SDO, IRIS, HINODE, STEREO, THEMIS) and ground-based observatories (e.g., SOLIS,
GST, CoMP, GONG, ALMA, EOVSA), accompanied by upcoming observations, will take us to a new level
of understanding of solar dynamics and activity and their impact on the Heliospheric and Earth environments.
The synergy between an advanced modeling eﬀort and a comprehensive analysis of observations has great
potential to shed light on the physical processes behind the observed phenomena. However, as we approach
smaller scales in models and observations, challenges emerge that require the development of new approaches
in data analysis and numerical modeling.",9,CMR10,,871,108

"Substantial development of theoretical and numerical approaches, supported by continually growing compu-
tational capabilities and novel observing technologies, are changing our view of solar phenomena. Thanks
to such developments, we have been slowly moving away from a simplistic, one-dimensional, static inter-
pretation of solar observations toward models that take into account the multidimensional nature of the",9,CMR10,,417,104
"observed phenomena as well as the energy transport mechanisms occurring between diﬀerent spatial and
temporal scales. However, the complexity of the multi-scale dynamics of turbulent magnetized plasma in
highly stratiﬁed inhomogeneous conditions prevents us from creating a single universal model to reproduce
the solar dynamics. Therefore, despite the joint goal, modeling approaches are often targeted to a speciﬁc
class of problems. For instance, realistic-type simulations are focused on capturing a wide range of the phys-
ical phenomena in the solar plasma (e.g., turbulence, radiation, ionization, magnetic ﬁelds, abundances) to
reproduce observed processes and phenomena. On the other hand, data-driven models attempt to reproduce
a particular event or events by forcing a model solution toward speciﬁc observations to create an accurate
physical interpretation of the observed dynamics.",9,CMR10,,895,110
"Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations in the Sun-in-a-box regime aim to solve the equations of con-
servation of mass, momentum, energy, and magnetic ﬂux in a highly stratiﬁed compressible medium, utilizing
3D multi-group radiative energy transfer between the ﬂuid elements, a real-gas equation of state, ionization
and excitation of all abundant species, and magnetic eﬀects. Because of their computational cost, the re-
sulting models cover only a small area on the Sun with a spatial resolution of tens of kilometers or higher.
Nevertheless, this approach demonstrates its capability to reproduce solar observations. In particular, ‘ab-
initio’ modeling of the solar magnetoconvection and atmosphere pioneered by Nordlund and Stein (1989)
demonstrated the importance of the eﬀects of 3D turbulent dynamics in reproducing spectroscopic observa-
tions (Asplund et al., 2009). Since then, such models have allowed us to make progress in understanding the
near surface structuring and dynamics of solar plasma and magnetic ﬁelds. In particular, they have provided
insight about granulation (e.g., Stein and Nordlund, 2001), supersonic horizontal ﬂows (e.g., Vitas et al.,
2011), ﬁne structuring of sunspot umbrae (e.g., Sch¨ussler and V¨ogler, 2006) and penumbrae (e.g., Kitiashvili
et al., 2009; Rempel et al., 2009b,a; Siu-Tapia et al., 2018), convective collapse (e.g., Skartlien et al., 2000;",9,CMR10,,1395,113

"cross-comparison between observations and simulations is crucial for several scientiﬁc issues discussed in the
DKIST Critical Science Plan (Rast et al., 2020).",9,CMR10,,159,110
"Coronal magnetic ﬁelds play a key role in determining when and where solar ﬂares and coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) occur (Gibson et al., 2020). Remote sensing of the coronal magnetic ﬁelds has not
been possible in the past, thus only reconstructions based on magnetic ﬁeld measurements at the photo-
sphere/chromosphere level could be employed to model the 3D structure of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld. How-
ever, newly developed observational techniques, such as visible/infrared (VIR) coronal seismology (Yang
et al., 2020a; Yang et al., 2020b) and microwave interferometry (Fleishman et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020),
have demonstrated the feasibility of oﬀ-limb and on-limb observations to be routinely performed in the near
future using a new generation of already developed instruments, such as DKIST and The Expanded Owens
Valley Solar Array (EOVSA, Gary et al., 2018), and proposed instruments, such as the full-Sun Coronal So-
lar Magnetism Observatory (COSMO, Tomczyk et al., 2016) and the Frequency Agile Solar Radiotelescope
(FASR, Bastian, 2003)",9,CMR10,,1055,108
"Nevertheless, given the remote sensing nature of these newly available observations, they are generally
limited by a line-of-sight ambiguity, which can only be resolved by combining them with sophisticated, yet
feasible, multi-wavelength forward-ﬁtting techniques and data-constrained modeling frameworks, such those
oﬀered by community-developed and maintained modeling tools like FORWARD (Gibson et al., 2016) and
GX Simulator (Nita et al., 2015, 2018).",9,CMR10,,455,106
"Modeling of the magnetic ﬁeld in the corona is essential for the study of the origin of the solar active
phenomena. There are primarily two groups of models to simulate evolving coronal magnetic ﬁelds in
3D: quasi-static (or time-independent) and dynamic (time-dependent). In the quasi-static group, potential,
linear, and non-linear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolations have been developed. These models apply
the vacuum-limit assumption, which reasonably assumes that magnetic pressure dominates the gas pressure",9,CMR10,,516,106
(low-beta regime). Although this modeling framework assumes that the corona is in a static force balance,9,CMR10,,104,104
"that is not aﬀected by states at earlier times, Fleishman et al. (2018) have shown that evolving sequences of
such modeling snapshots may be used to infer the evolution of eruptive phenomena.",9,CMR10,,191,109
"Another, more physics-based group of models are time-dependent models. In this group, “data-driven”
(DD) simulations, i.e., simulations where successive photospheric magnetic ﬁeld observations are used to",9,CMR10,,204,104

"evolve the model’s photospheric ﬁeld, show great promise for investigating the 3D structure of the coronal
magnetic ﬁeld. Lately, two types of DD models have been developed: magnetofrictional (e.g. Cheung and
DeRosa, 2012) and MHD models (e.g. Hayashi et al., 2018). The magnetofrictional model assumes that
the plasma velocity in the MHD induction equation is proportional to the local Lorentz force, leading to a
relaxation of a magnetic conﬁguration toward a force-free state. It is more computationally eﬃcient than
MHD and is suitable for the description of the slow quiescent evolution of active regions, but not for ﬂares.
The MHD models explicitly solve a full set of MHD equations including the plasma properties. The MHD
approach is suitable for rapid evolution during ﬂares but is too computationally expensive to model the
long-term quiescent evolution of active regions. A hybrid framework, where the MF model is used to model
quiescent periods of AR evolution and the MHD model is used to model ﬂaring periods of AR evolution, has
been recently developed within the Coronal Global Evolutionary model (Hoeksema et al., 2020).",9,CMR10,,1138,109
"The major diﬀerence between data-driven and data-inspired models are the observations that the data-
driven models make use of as lower boundary conditions. These are typically some combination of magnetic,
velocity, and electric ﬁelds. Recently several approaches have been developed to derive electric ﬁelds using
observations of the vector magnetic ﬁelds and Doppler velocities in the photosphere (see e.g. Fisher et al.,
2020).",9,CMR10,,431,108
The current eﬀort to capture solar dynamics from the convection zone to the corona faces the challenge of,9,CMR10,,105,105
"numerically describing atmospheric layers with dramatic variations of plasma conditions. In addition, a Non-
Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) approach is necessary on one hand to interpret chromospheric
and transition region diagnostics (e.g., H-alpha, UV, IR Ca II lines, Mg II h&k, He I, Ly-alpha) (e.g. Leenaarts
et al., 2013; ˇStˇep´an et al., 2015) and therefore derive reliable observational constraints, and, on the other
hand, to properly describe the interaction of radiation and matter in the higher layers of the atmosphere.
One of the most advanced codes in this respect is",9,CMR10,,591,112
Bifrost,9,CMTI10,,7,7
"(Gudiksen et al., 2011), which, although in
a simpliﬁed manner, includes NLTE processes in the energy and particle balance (Carlsson et al., 2016;
Hansteen et al., 2017). Signiﬁcant improvements have been further achieved by including additional eﬀects,
such as the Hall eﬀect and ambipolar diﬀusion (e.g., Mart´ınez-Sykora et al., 2012; Khomenko et al., 2020),
and the development of approximations to describe chromospheric radiative cooling and heating (Carlsson
and Leenaarts, 2012).",9,CMR10,,487,107
"However, the computational cost of NLTE calculations poses signiﬁcant limitations on the size of the
computational domain and spatial resolution. Therefore, modeling of the solar dynamics in broad regimes,
from the interior to the corona, necessarily relies on the LTE approximation. (e.g., Rempel, 2017; Wray
et al., 2018).
In spite of this simpliﬁcation, various codes have been used to simulate the domain from
the photosphere to the corona, allowing the study of phenomena naturally driven by near-surface plasma
dynamics, and addressing issues as coronal heating, the onset of ﬂares, and others (e.g., Gudiksen and
Nordlund, 2005; Carlsson and Leenaarts, 2012; Rempel, 2017; Cheung et al., 2019). These models provide
theoretical support for the interpretation of observations. An example of synthetic SDO/AIA observations
of the limb view of the modeled solar corona (Kitiashvili et al., 2020) is presented in Figure 2.",9,CMR10,,925,104
"As alluded to above, the use of state-of-the-art atmosphere models to interpret solar observations is further",9,CMR10,,109,109
"complicated by diﬃculties inherent to the synthesis of speciﬁc observables. Several radiative transfer codes
have been developed for this purpose, each with certain advantages and restrictions. For instance, the Spinor
(Frutiger et al., 2000) code is relatively fast, but computations are restricted by the Local Thermodynamic
Equilibrium (LTE) approximation. The NICOLE code (Socas-Navarro et al., 2015) enables calculations in
both LTE and NLTE, but the implementation of the NLTE approximation does not include partial frequency
redistribution (PRD) eﬀects, which are important for the modeling of chromospheric lines, such as the Ca II
H & K, and Mg II UV lines. The RH code (Pereira and Uitenbroek, 2015) is also able to perform calculations
in both approximations with a primary focus on the accurate implementation of NLTE eﬀects in diﬀerent
types of geometries. The Multi3D code (Leenaarts et al., 2009) is developed for massive calculations from 3D
models of the solar atmosphere of a wide range of spectral lines using the NLTE approximation. However,
the inclusion of detailed multi-dimensional radiative transfer eﬀects comes at the cost of the increased",9,CMR10,,1166,109
"computational time. Moreover, the description of these physical eﬀects is numerically challenging, especially
in the chromosphere where large spatial and temporal gradients often make the codes unstable. Ultimately,
the choice of the particular radiative transfer code depends on the task and the related approximations most
suitable for the physical processes one wants to study.",9,CMR10,,380,109

"The interpretation of observational results often relies on solving the inversion problem, i.e., on modeling
the physical characteristics of the atmosphere which produced the observed emission and spectra. Diﬀerent
codes are available to perform spectral ad spectropolarimetric inversions of observed spectra, but, similarly
to the codes available for forward modeling, the vast majority are targeted at the interpretation of speciﬁc
types of observations. For instance, codes developed for the interpretation of lines forming in the photosphere
and chromosphere are often developed by integrating the radiative transfer codes described in the previous
section with minimization algorithms that optimize the physical and magnetic stratiﬁcation of the atmosphere
(examples include the widely used NICOLE and SPINOR and the newly developed STiC and DeSIRE, based
on the RH code). As such, these inversion codes suﬀer of the same limitations described above. Other codes
have been or are under development to interpret speciﬁc observations, as for instance observations in the He I",9,CMR10,,1078,111
"1083.0 nm line (Hazel), limb observations in chromospheric lines (NICOLE), and ﬂares (STiC). Interpretation
of coronal observations is instead performed by using very diﬀerent approaches, based on diﬀerential emission
measures of the coronal plasma from the related EUV observations (e.g., Cheung et al., 2015). One of the
major drawbacks of most of inversion techniques is their extremely high computational cost. One solution
is to represent the highly-nonlinear mapping of the observed emission and line proﬁles to the structure of
the atmosphere by a neural network trained on the set of physics-based inversions. Such an approach has
been successfully applied for fast inversion of IRIS data (Sainz Dalda et al., 2019) and SDO/AIA EUV
emission (Wright et al., 2019). Although uncertainty quantiﬁcation for such machine-learning-based models
is challenging and still open, this is currently the only way to provide timely data products under one pipeline
with the observational data. The development of such models and understanding and quantifying the related
uncertainties should be encouraged.",9,CMR10,,1100,112

crease the data-volume of both observational and synthetic data. Such massive data ﬂows signiﬁcantly limit
the dissemination of these data among the community.",9,CMR10,,264,106
"On the one hand, sharing of the modeling and synthetic-observables data sets requires dramatic storage
resources. On the other hand, taking these data and analyzing them on a local workstation is often impossible.
As a result, the modeling data are highly truncated (e.g., include only selected layers, model parameters,
and/or limited time-series). The problem is becoming more severe with time to the point that web links
to the data are sometimes failing. Therefore, the development of a data-sharing platform and data-request
system will beneﬁt both potential customers and data providers.",9,CMR10,,593,110

fer codes and MHD models. A database of synthetic observables, obtained by combining state-of-the-art

models capable of describing the non-linear connection between the local physical and dynamical properties
