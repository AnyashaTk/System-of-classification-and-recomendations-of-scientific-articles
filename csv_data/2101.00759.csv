Introduction,11,CMB10,,12,12
"Producing a high-sensitivity radiation detector for dark matter is currently the most crucial
subject. Many groups are trying to ﬁnd a WIMPs signal by various methods and target
nuclei. Although a large volume liquid xenon (LXe) detector set stringent limits on the exis-
tence of WIMPs dark matter candidates[1–3], DAMA/LIBRA group reported the signiﬁcant
signal of WIMPs by applying highly radiopure and large volume NaI(Tl) scintillator. They
observed the annual modulating signal of WIMPs rate due to the earth’s revolution around
the Sun [4]. The event rate and deposited energy of WIMPs modulate with their maximum
at the beginning of June and a minimum at the beginning of December. The DAMA/LIBRA",10,CMR10,,704,93
"group developed a highly radiopure NaI(Tl) scintillator whose total mass was 250 kg. They
reported a signiﬁcant annual modulating amplitude between 2 keV",10,CMR10,,153,89
