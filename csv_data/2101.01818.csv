metric surveys have allowed to explore the outermost regions of
a number of globular clusters, which resulted in the detection of a
variety of extra-tidal structures around them. For instance, tidal
tails have been very recently identiﬁed in NGC 362 (Carballo-
Bello 2019), NGC 1851, NGC 2808 (Carballo-Bello et al. 2018;
Sollima 2020), 4590 (Palau & Miralda-Escudé 2019), 5139

This is due to the fact that the stream slowly drifts from the clus-

"We analyze the outer regions of the Milky Way globular clus-
ter NGC 6981, with the aim of identifying extra-tidal features.
The cluster caught our attention because it was associated to
the accreted Helmi streams, and deposited in an extremely in-
ner halo orbit, with a relatively high eccentricity and inclination
angle with respect to the Milky Way plane in the current orbital
section. According to Piatti et al. (2019), globular clusters with
orbital parameters similar to those of NGC 6981 have lost rela-
tively more mass by tidal disruption than globular clusters rotat-",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,579,67

relied on MS stars, particularly the fainter ones, because they
are the ﬁrst to cross the Jacobi radius once they reach the clus-

that the fainter the range of magnitudes considered, the more ex-
tended the cluster stellar density map.",9,NimbusRomNo9L-Regu,,346,65

Then, we statistically decontaminated the cluster MS segments
