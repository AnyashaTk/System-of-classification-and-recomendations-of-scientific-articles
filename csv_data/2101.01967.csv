ABSTRACT,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,8,8
"Jets are a commonly observed phenomenon in post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB)
binaries. Due to the orbital motion of the binary, the jet causes variable absorption in the Balmer
proﬁles. In previous work, we have developed spatio-kinematic and radiative transfer models to
reproduce the observed Balmer line variability and derive the spatio-kinematic structure of the
jet and its mass-loss rate. Here, we apply our jet model to ﬁve post-AGB binaries with distinct

". These
accretion rates are somewhat higher than can be comfortably explained with reasonable sources
of accretion, but we argue that the circumbinary disc in these systems is most-likely the source
feeding the accretion, although accretion from the post-AGB star cannot be ruled out. The
diversity of the variability in the ﬁve objects is due to their wide ejection cones combined with
a range of viewing angles, rather than inherent diﬀerences between the objects. The nature of
the observations does not let us easily distinguish which jet launching model (stellar jet, disc
wind, or X-wind) should be favoured. In conclusion, we show that our jet model includes the
physical parameters to successfully reproduce the H",9,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,721,97

INTRODUCTION,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,12,12
"The post-AGB phase of low to intermediate mass stars is a
short-lived phase during which the star changes dramatically (Van
Winckel 2003). This evolutionary phase becomes more complex if
the post-AGB star is part of a binary system. Binary interactions dur-
ing the post-AGB and preceding phases can fundamentally change
the stellar properties and evolution of both stars.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,372,70
"Many of these post-AGB binary systems are orbited by large,
circumbinary Keplerian discs of gas and dust (Bujarrabal et al. 2013,
2018; van Aarle et al. 2011; De Ruyter et al. 2006; Van Winckel
et al. 2009; Kamath et al. 2014, 2015). These post-AGB binaries

"these binary systems are likely created by a combination of high
mass-loss rate during the AGB phase and the focusing action of a
binary companion. This focusing action can concentrate the mass
loss on the orbital plane and donate angular momentum, thus cre-
ating a circumbinary, Keplerian disc (Shu et al. 1979; Pejcha et al.
2016; MacLeod et al. 2018; Hubová & Pejcha 2019; Bermúdez-
Bustamante et al. 2020). Their characteristics hold clues to a num-
ber of open questions in stellar astrophysics, such as the nature
of consequence of binary interactions between giants and compact
stars, something that gives rise to scores of evolved binaries such as
cataclysmic variables, or the progenitors of type Ia supernovae (De
Marco & Izzard 2017).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,746,70
"Strong binary interactions on the AGB almost invariably lead
to a common envelope in-spiral and merger, or to a close binary (De
Marco et al. 2015). As such, the existence of post-AGB binaries,
particularly those with periods",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,225,67

"are much larger than post-common envelope periods, but too short to
have avoided a common envelope interaction altogether. Neither do
we understand the non-zero eccentricities of these binaries, since the
tidal forces working on the binary system are expected to circularise
the orbit (Zahn 1977). Whether the period distribution of the post-
AGB binary population is due to their having mass ratios near unity
at the time of common envelope (Oomen et al. 2018; Iaconi & De
Marco 2019), or whether the period is widened",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,519,70
after,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Italic,,5,5
"the binary
interaction on the AGB, is not clear. Neither is it clear whether
these wide binaries will ever form a visible planetary nebula, and
hence whether they will become the elusive, wider binaries central
star population (Douchin et al. 2015; Jones et al. 2017).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,268,66
"A peculiar observational signature of post-AGB stars in bi-
nary systems is an under-abundance of refractory elements in the
spectra of their stellar atmospheres (e.g. Van Winckel et al. 1995;
Van Winckel 1997; Maas et al. 2002). This depletion pattern is
only observed in post-AGB stars with a circumbinary disc (Gezer
et al. 2015; Kamath & Van Winckel 2019). It is currently under-
stood that the pattern is caused by the re-accretion of gas from the
circumbinary disc, since the re-accreted gas becomes poor in refrac-
tory elements after dust formation in the disc (Oomen et al. 2019,
and references therein).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,613,68
"Kamath et al. (2016) discovered that the fainter post-AGB bi-
naries with circumbinary discs are actually post-red giant branch
(post-RGB) stars that have evolved oﬀ the RGB instead of the AGB.
A subset of the entire post-AGB/post-RGB binary sample populates
the high-luminosity end of the population II cepheid instability strip
(Wallerstein 2002). These pulsating giants are referred to as RV
Tauri stars with dust. The photometric variability of these stars have
typical pulsation periods between 20 and 150 days and a characteris-
tic light curve with an alternation between deep and shallow minima
(Wallerstein 2002; Manick et al. 2017, 2019). Some RV Tauri vari-
ables show a secondary long-term variability with a period between
600 and 2600 days (Pollard et al. 1996), known as photometric type
RVb variables. The variability has been linked to the binary nature
of the system and the presence of a circumbinary disc (Waelkens
et al. 1995; Van Winckel et al. 1999; Manick et al. 2017). When
the inclination angle of the binary system is high enough (about
60",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1066,70
◦,7,txsys,,1,1
"or higher), the post-AGB star will be obscured partially by the
circumbinary disc during inferior conjunction, when the post-AGB
star is closest to the observer. This causes a periodic photomet-
ric variability which is synchronous with the orbital period of the
binary system due to variable line-of-sight extinction.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,318,67

𝛼,8,NewTXMI,,1,1
"line has a broad, blue-shifted ab-
sorption feature during superior conjunction, when the post-AGB
star is located behind the companion. The origin of this orbital-phase
dependent line variation is the presence of a jet launched from an ac-
cretion disc around the companion star (Gorlova et al. 2012; Bollen
et al. 2017). During superior conjunction, the jet blocks the photo-
spheric light from the post-AGB star. Hence, the hydrogen atoms
in the jet scatter the photospheric light from the post-AGB star out
of the line-of-sight, causing this particular absorption feature. Due
to the orbital motion of the binary, the light of the post-AGB star
shines through diﬀerent parts of the jet over time, thus allowing for
a tomography of the jet.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,743,70
"In Bollen et al. (2019), we built a spatio-kinematic model of
the jet, from which synthetic spectra were created and ﬁtted to the

"the magnetic ﬁeld in this model is squeezed together in the inner
disc region, giving the outﬂow its distinct X-shape. We incorporate
the most important features of these three jet models in our jet
conﬁgurations. Just as the model by Matt & Pudritz (2005), the
stellar jet is centred on the companion and the jet matter follows the
magnetic ﬁeld lines of the star. For the X-wind conﬁguration, we
include a jet cavity which has a minimum angle of 25",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,450,70
◦,7,txsys,,1,1
". The disc
wind conﬁguration is similar to the X-wind, but the ejected matter
in the model originates from the surface of the circum-companion
accretion disc. Additionally, we allow the jet in each conﬁguration
to be inclined with respect to the orbital axis of the binary system.
Next, we use the best-ﬁtting jet conﬁguration of the spatio-
kinematic model as input for the radiative transfer modelling of
the jet. For the radiative transfer, we assume local thermodynamic
equilibrium and an isothermal jet. This radiative transfer model
calculates the level populations of the excited states of hydrogen, in
order to calculate the amount of scattering that is caused by the jet
in the Balmer lines. These level populations are dependent on the
local temperature and density of the jet. Hence, the total amount
of absorption in the four Balmer lines and their relative diﬀerence
will change for diﬀerent jet temperatures and densities. In order to
quantify this absorption, we calculate the equivalent width (EW) of
the ﬁrst four Balmer lines in the observations, i.e., H",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1072,70

system with an inclination angle, or viewing angle, smaller than
the jet half-opening angle. During superior conjunction, the photo-
spheric light will enter the jet closer to its base, where the density
is high. During inferior conjunction, the companion and primary
star have switched positions. Now, the photospheric light will pass
through the jet at a greater height. Hence, the entry point will be

"The high mass-accretion rate in TW Cam is likely due to the
limits of our jet model. In our model, we assume a constant eﬀective
temperature for the post-AGB star and a uniform jet temperature.
However, TW Cam shows stellar pulsations and shocks, which will
cause a signiﬁcant change in eﬀective temperature. Additionally,
since we observe absorption caused by the jet, we can infer that the
jet must be colder than the post-AGB star, which is relatively cool
(4800 K). The jet density has to be higher at a cooler temperature, in
order to observe the absorption feature in the Balmer lines. Hence,
the combination of the uniform jet temperature and the constant
eﬀective temperature might cause the model to choose a low jet",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,725,70
"temperature and high densities, which then results in high mass-
loss rates. In future work, we will improve on the jet model by
incorporating more sophisticated prescriptions to better model the
shocks and the jet temperature structure, such that we can better
estimate the mass-loss and mass-accretion in such stars.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,318,66
6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Bold,,25,25
"We have modelled a diverse sample of post-AGB binaries with jets,
using the spatio-kinematic and radiative transfer models described
in Bollen et al. (2019) and Bollen et al. (2020).",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,182,66
"Our sample of ﬁve post-AGB binaries comprises a broad range
of orbital parameters and diﬀerent Balmer line variations that are
caused by the jet absorption. Our model can successfully reproduce
the dynamic H",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,207,66
𝛼,8,NewTXMI,,1,1
"spectra for all sources, which demonstrates that it
has a suﬃcient number of physical ingredients to account for the
most important features in the Balmer line variability of this diverse
group of objects.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,205,70
"From the spatio-kinematic modelling, we obtained the geomet-",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,60,60
"ric, kinematic, and relative density structure of the jet. We found jets
with wide half-opening angles (between 30 and 60",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,121,72
◦,7,txsys,,1,1
") and jet outﬂow
velocities in the range 150",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,44,27
−,8,txsys,,1,1
440 km s,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,8,8
−,7,txsys,,1,1
1,7,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,1,1
". Additionally, our results
show that a tilted jet is very common for these systems (the range
is 5",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,99,66
−,8,txsys,,1,1
10,8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,2,2
◦,7,txsys,,1,1
"). This tilt can be explained by precession. Jet precession
is commonly observed in diﬀerent classes of jet-launching objects
(e.g., Choi et al. 2017). Moreover, simulations of jets launched by a
star in a binary system show that the presence of a companion can
cause precessing motion (Sheikhnezami & Fendt 2015, 2018). Jet
conﬁgurations in our model are based on three jet-launching mod-
els: a stellar jet, an X-wind and a disc wind. The best ﬁts assuming
each conﬁguration in turn cannot discriminate between the three
models. This is mainly caused by the relatively small dimensions of
the launching region in all three models, compared to the whole sys-
tem. Hence, it is not possible to distinguish which process is more
likely to be the launching mechanism in these jets. Other observa-
tional techniques, such as interferometric imaging with high angular
resolution, might be necessary in order to get a better understanding
of the jet-launching mechanisms at play in these systems.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,991,69
"From the radiative transfer model, we were able to obtain
jet temperatures and densities. By combining the spatio-kinematic
structure with the radiative transfer model, we found the jet mass-
loss rates for these objects and estimated the mass-accretion rates in",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,262,70
"the circum-companion accretion disc. We compared these accretion
rates with expected mass-transfer rates from the post-AGB star or
from the circumbinary disc. We found that the accretion rates are
too high to be explained solely by mass-transfer from the post-
AGB star to the companion mass-transfer. The accretion rates are in
better accordance with a mass-transfer from the circumbinary disc
to the companion. We conclude that the circumbinary disc is most
likely the main source of the accreted material, however, we cannot
exclude the possible mass-transfer from the post-AGB star.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,586,67
"In future work, we will improve upon the jet model, by imple-
menting a more sophisticated temperature structure and radiative
transfer calculations. We will also apply improved spatio-kinematic
and radiative transfer model to all 15 jet-creating post-AGB binary
systems in our target sample. This will provide us with jet param-
eters, mass-loss rates, and mass-accretion rates. We ultimately aim
to correlate jet and accretion properties with the binary properties,
which will give us more insights on the binary interaction history
of post-AGB binary systems.",8,TeXGyreTermesX-Regular,,562,69
