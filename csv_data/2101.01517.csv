ABSTRACT,10,CMBX10,,8,8
"Scientiﬁc CMOS image sensors are a modern alternative for a typical CCD detectors, as they oﬀer both low
read-out noise, large sensitive area, and high frame rates. All these makes them promising devices for a modern
wide-ﬁeld sky surveys. However, the peculiarities of CMOS technology have to be properly taken into account
when analyzing the data. In order to characterize these, we performed an extensive laboratory testing of two",9,CMR10,,433,111
"Andor cameras based on sCMOS chips – Andor Neo and Andor Marana. Here we report its results, especially
on the temporal stability, linearity and image persistence. We also present the results of an on-sky testing of
these sensors connected to a wide-ﬁeld lenses, and discuss its applications for an astronomical sky surveys.",9,CMR10,,324,111

1. INTRODUCTION,10,CMBX10,,15,15
"Sky survey applications require large format image sensors with high quantum eﬃciency, low read-out noise,
fast read-out and a good inter- and cross-pixel stability and linearity. Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs), typ-
ically employed for such tasks, lack only the read-out speeds, which signiﬁcantly lowers their performance for
detecting and characterizing rapidly varying or moving celestial objects. On the other hand, Complementary
Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor (CMOS) imaging sensors, widely used on the consumer market, typically displays
levels of read-out noise unacceptably large for precise astronomical tasks (tens of electrons), as well as signiﬁcantly
worse uniformity and stability than CCDs.",9,CMR10,,700,119
"However, recent development in the low-noise CMOS architectures (see e.g.",9,CMR10,,73,73
1,6,CMR7,,1,1
") allowed to design and create
a market-ready large-format (2560x2160 6.5",9,CMR10,,73,42
µ,9,CMMI10,,1,1
"m pixels) CMOS chips with read-out noise as low as 1-2 electrons,
on par with best CCDs",9,CMR10,,87,65
2,6,CMR7,,1,1
"– so-called “scientiﬁc CMOS” (sCMOS) chips. Like standard CMOS sensors (and
unlike CCDs), they did not perform any charge transfer between adjacent pixels, employing instead individual
column-level ampliﬁers with parallel read-out and dual 11-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) operating in
low-gain and high-gain mode, correspondingly, and an on-board ﬁeld-programmable gate array (FPGA) logic
scheme that reconstructs a traditional 16-bit reading for every pixel from two 11-bit ones.",9,CMR10,,491,110
"The cameras based on this original sCMOS chip, CIS2051 (later rebranded as CIS2521) by Fairchild Imaging,
have been available since 2009. Andor Neo is one of such cameras and is currently widely used in astronomical
applications, especially for tasks that require high frame rates like satellite tracking,",9,CMR10,,305,109

performance and overall good quality of delivered data products, with the outlined problems related mostly to
the non-linearity at and above the ampliﬁer transition region around 1500 ADU and a low full well depth of
about only 20k electrons.",9,CMR10,,326,109

promising detector for a next generation of FRAM atmospheric monitoring telescopes,",9,CMR10,,259,110

"which shall perform
rapid and precise stellar photometry in a very wide ﬁelds of view in order to assess atmospheric variations in
real time.",9,CMR10,,141,110
"Thus, we decided to perform the laboratory and on-sky characterization of Andor Marana camera, generously
provided to us by the manufacturer for testing. We also run some of the tests on Andor Neo cameras we have
in order to compare the properties of these two generations of sCMOSes based on diﬀerent sensors. As both
cameras perform quite complex onboard post-processing of acquired images, we will concentrate just on their
major user-visible properties, especially the ones important for the tasks of high temporal resolution sky surveys
– i.e. on pixel-level stability and uniformity.",9,CMR10,,589,114
2. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP,10,CMBX10,,21,21
"For testing the Marana camera, we used an existing experimental equipment available at a laboratory of charac-
terization of optical sensors for astronomical applications at Institute of Physics of Czech Academy of Sciences.
That included a fully light-isolating dark box, CAMLIN ATLAS 300 monochromator, CAMLIN APOLLO X-600
Xenon lamp, and an integrating sphere mounted directly on the input port of a dark box. A dedicated photodi-",9,CMR10,,433,113

"As the laboratory environment we used was not dust-free, the camera was equipped with a Nikkor 300 f/2.8
lens, adjusted in such way as to provide illumination of the whole chip with the light from integrating sphere
output window. Due to lens vignetting, this resulted in a slightly bell-shaped ﬂat ﬁelds. The same lens has
been later used for the on-sky testing of the camera photometric performance. For it, the camera with lens were

3. DARK CURRENT,10,CMBX10,,15,15
"Dark current in CMOS imaging sensor is a process of spurious electrons generation in the photodiode in the
absence of incoming light, with many possible sources behind it,",9,CMR10,,171,106
e.g.,9,CMTI10,,4,4
"thermal generation, “diﬀusion” current,
etc. To characterize it, we studied series of “dark” frames acquired with varying exposures. Then the mean
value of every pixel was regressed versus exposure time in order to determine both bias level and dark current
on a per-pixel basis. The maps of these values are shown in Figure 1. While for Neo the dark current is mostly
ﬂat and has a median of about 0.1 e",9,CMR10,,404,110

pattern is again apparent on Marana frames where the signal is processed using high-gain ampliﬁers (i.e. having

"The histograms of a noise on dark frames (see Figure 3) show a signiﬁcant power-law tail towards high RMS
values, which consists of a pixels often displaying distinctive Random Telegraph Signal (RTS) features, eﬀectively
“jumping” between several metastable signal levels due to eﬀect on electron traps inside the pixel circuits (most
often source follower) during either ﬁrst or second readout during the correlated double sampling process.",9,CMR10,,441,114

"The example of such behaviour is shown in Figure 4. Under illumination levels with Poisson noise exceeding
the amplitude of these jumps (which is typically around 10 ADU for both Neo and Marana cameras), these
pixels behave normally and their histograms does not show any signiﬁcant deviations from a Gaussian. Then, on
approaching the ampliﬁer transition region (see photon transfer curves for both cameras in Figure 6), another
eﬀect appears, related to the switching between the readings of low gain and high gain ampliﬁers, eﬀectively
looking like a spontaneous jumping of the value – see Figure 7 for an example. Further increase of the intensity
leads to only high gain readings being used, and pixel values are again stable.",9,CMR10,,731,112

shown in Figure 6 displays a distinctive jump around 1500 ADU, corresponding to the transition between low-gain
and high-gain ampliﬁers. The gain below the transition nicely corresponds to the one reported by manufacturer;
above the transition, the eﬀective gain drops by nearly two times, and its scatter across the pixels signiﬁcantly
increases. For Neo, the eﬀective gains of values with lower and higher intensities are much better matched
together. However, the spatial structures of pixel response – pixel response non-uniformity, shown in Figure 8 –
signiﬁcantly changes with signal level both in amplitude and in shape, with distinctive column pattern appearing
in ﬂat ﬁelds after switching to high gain ampliﬁers. The amplitude of this pattern is sub-percent except for rolling
gain mode of Neo camera, where it is up to couple of percents at the intensities close to ampliﬁer transition.",9,CMR10,,917,116

a digital saturation (65535 ADU), systematic signiﬁcant deviations from linearity start at about half of this value. The
ampliﬁer transition region is easily visible at around 1500 ADU, with the jump amplitude of typically less than couple of

spot still visible on Marana frame more than half an hour after end of illumination).",9,CMR10,,304,111
"This process is related to charge traps in the silicon substrate that capture the electrons when illumination
level is high, and then gradually release them back over time. Therefore, the resulting signal manifests as an
additional “dark current” with exponentially decaying amplitude. Our tests performed by means of illuminating
the chip up to saturation and then measuring the residual current using sequences of frames with varying exposure
times. They all give quite consistent results shown also in Figure 10 – the amplitude of residual current decays",9,CMR10,,557,113

7. CONCLUSIONS,10,CMBX10,,14,14
"The comparison of two models of Andor cameras based on diﬀerent generations of sCMOS chips from diﬀerent
manufacturers according to their speciﬁcations is shown in Table 1. Our results conﬁrms that Marana dark
current is indeed signiﬁcantly larger, especially with on-board glow correction disabled.",9,CMR10,,299,104
"The linearity of Marana is nearly perfect up to approximately half of saturation level, with just an occasional
jump of typically less than 2% at the ampliﬁer transition region. The eﬀective gain, however, drops by nearly a
two times there, also changing the spatial properties of ﬂat ﬁelds above approximately 1500 ADU by revealing the
structure of column level ampliﬁers. The behaviour of Neo camera is a bit worse, with more complex systematic
trends in linearity, again spanning couple of percents level both on very low intensities of light and above the
level of transition to high gain ampliﬁers. On the other hand, the gain values on lower and higher intensities are
much better matched on Neo.",9,CMR10,,702,114
"The amount of blemished pixels in Marana is nearly 30 times smaller than in Neo, where they occupied up to
0.66% of all pixel area and signiﬁcantly aﬀected the photometric performance. The noise at the dark level shows
a random telegraph signal features in a small (0.01%) with a jumps amplitude around 10 ADU. Moreover, the
intensity region around ampliﬁer transitions also shows a pixel value excess jumps related to switching between
readings of low gain and high gain ampliﬁers. All other intensity regions show quite stable and mostly normally
distributed pixel readings over time. On lower intensities, the noise shows some spatial correlations related to
onboard overscan subtraction in Neo cameras and to some other eﬀects in Marana, both fading away as intensity
of incoming light increases. The pixel response non-uniformity also decreases towards sub-percent levels, but the
small-scale structure of ﬂat ﬁelds drastically changes with transition between low gain and high gain ampliﬁers,
with distinct column structure apparent in the latter (high intensity) regime on both cameras. This eﬀect may
impact the ﬂat ﬁeld correction on sub-percent level.",9,CMR10,,1161,113
"Our on-sky tests of Marana display promising performance, with a photometric precision easily reaching 1%

any signs of sub-pixel position related systematics like the ones evident in Neo, which employs a microlens raster
in front of a sensitive part of every pixel.",9,CMR10,,198,114
"Moreover, the overall quality of the images are nice and free of typical CCD cosmetic problems – hot and
dark columns, bleedings from oversaturated stars, etc – due to per-pixel read-out, which signiﬁcantly increases
the amount of scientiﬁcally usable pixels over the sensor area.",9,CMR10,,280,111
