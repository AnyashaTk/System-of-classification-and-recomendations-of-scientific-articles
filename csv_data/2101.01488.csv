Abstract:,9,NimbusRomNo9L-Medi,,9,9
"The fundamental diﬀerence between accretion around black holes and neutron stars is the inner
boundary condition, which aﬀects the behavior of matter very close to the compact objects. This leads to
formation of additional shocks and boundary layers for neutron stars. Previous studies on the formation
of such boundary layers focused on Keplerian ﬂows that reached the surface of the star, either directly or
through the formation of a transition layer. However, behavior of sub-Keplerian matter near the surface
of a neutron star has not been studied in detail. Here, we study the eﬀect of viscosity, in presence of
cooling, on the sub-Keplerian ﬂows around neutron stars, using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. Our
time-dependent study shows that multiple shocks, transition and boundary layers form in such type of
accretion, when viscosity is signiﬁcant, and one or more layers are absent when the viscosity is moderate.
These ﬂows are particularly of interest for the wind dominated systems such as Cir X-1. We also report",9,CMR10,,1028,106

"The problem of accretion of rotating matter onto weakly
magnetic neutron stars can be divided into three broad
approaches.
In Titarchuk, Lapidus and Muslimov
(1998), the formation of a transition layer around a
neutron star was studied in detail. The authors showed
that if matter has to reach the star from a Keplerian
disk, it has to match the angular velocity of the star at
the inner boundary. As the rotation of the star is al-
ways sub-Keplerian in nature, it meant that a Keplerian
to sub-Keplerian ‘transition’ layer is formed to accom-
modate that eﬀect, in the presence of viscosity. Study
of spreading boundary layers on the surface assumed
that the ﬂow remains Keplerian till it reaches the sur-
face and undergoes readjustment on the surface itself
through a thin boundary layer (Inogamov and Sunyaev
1999). Both approaches provide valuable insight onto
Keplerian to sub-Keplerian angular momentum transi-
tions at or near the surface, but assume that the inﬂow",9,CMR10,,974,57
"is Keplerian to begin with, which is still used in re-
cent studies of spreading layers (Abolmasov, N¨attil¨a,
& Poutanen 2020). The third approach allows read-
justment of the angular momentum of the ﬂow and the
spin of star at the surface of the star in the accretion
phase, but also assumes the inﬂow to be a Keplerian
disk (Bhattacharyya and Chakrabarty 2017).
In this
paper, we look into the common assumption of all three
above-mentioned approaches, i.e. a Keplerian inﬂow,
and change it by starting with sub-Keplerian ﬂows. For
such ﬂows with small but non-zero angular momenta,",9,CMR10,,585,56
"in presence of cooling, we study the eﬀect of viscos-
ity in the creation of diﬀerent types of disks, transition
and boundary layers. In Bhattacharjee & Chakrabarti",9,CMR10,,164,58

"2019 (hereafter Paper I), the study of accretion ﬂows
around weakly magnetic neutron stars is divided into
two broad classes: 1. The ﬂow is inviscid, advective
and has a low eﬃciency of radiation. It also comprises
of winds from the companion star. 2. The ﬂow has
a signiﬁcant viscosity to redistribute the speciﬁc angu-
lar momenta. The authors discussed the Class 1 ﬂows
in Paper I, i.e., the eﬀects of angular momentum of
a sub-Keplerian ﬂow in absence of signiﬁcant dynamic
viscosity. The less-explored domain of sub-Eddington,
inviscid accretion around neutron stars (NSs) was stud-
ied in detail using hydrodynamic simulations. Paper
I also argues why a Two-Component Advective Flow
or TCAF (Chakrabarti 1995, 1997; Chakrabarti and
Titarchuk 1995) solution is most likely the generalized
solution for accreting matter around a weakly mag-
netic neutron star as well. For a detailed review of
the studies, refer to Bhattacharjee 2018, and the refer-
ences of Paper I. The TCAF solution has been proved",9,CMR10,,1006,56
"to be a stable conﬁguration through numerical simula-
tions (Giri and Chakrabarti 2013) and have been used
to explain the spectral and timing properties of stellar
mass black holes in a self-consistent manner for multi-
ple sources (Debnath et al. 2014, Bhattacharjee et al.
2017, Banerjee et al. 2019, Banerjee et al. 2020). The
paradigm can also be applied to NSs with some modi-
ﬁcations (Bhattacharjee & Chakrabarti 2017, hereafter
BC17; Bhattacharjee and Chakrabarti 2020). For invis-
cid ﬂows with sub-Keplerian angular momentum, two

of the inner ﬂow, which shows multiple bending insta-
bilities, is very similar to the cases reported in Paper
I. Furthermore, matter is ejected from both CENBOL
and NBOL in the upper quadrant and only from CEN-
BOL in the lower quadrant. The outﬂowing matter
from NBOL undergoes multiple shock transitions (one
before merging with CENBOL-outﬂow, one after), be-
fore becoming transonic near the outer edge. A part
of the ejected matter falls back to CENBOL and an-
other part is accreted onto the NS through more radial
shocks. This fallback onto the star is primarily achieved
due to the lowered angular momentum near the surface.",9,CMR10,,747,57

4. CONCLUSIONS
REFERENCES
In this paper, we report the formation of a normal
boundary layer and a radiative Keplerian disk out of a
sub-Keplerian injected ﬂow around a weakly magnetic
neutron star. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst detailed
study of viscous ﬂows around a weakly magnetized neu-
tron star. We carried out a qualitative study of the
behaviour of three regions formed in the inﬂowing mat-
ter as the ﬂow viscosity is gradually increased. When
viscosity is low, resembling an inviscid ﬂow, matter ad-
justs its angular momenta only very close to the NS
surface and forms the NBOL out of the sub-Keplerian
ﬂow. RAKED is transient in nature for these cases. We
believe this happens in HMXBs, such as, Cir X-1. We
notice that two regions, one on the inner edge of CEN-
BOL and the other near NBOL, eject matter along the
z-direction. A part of these two matter merge and a
part actually falls back to these regions. For higher vis-
cosity, the RAKED is formed in between NBOL and
the sub-Keplerian ﬂow. Here, the RAKED is small and
steadily oscillate. These would be the most general type
of inﬂow in presence of viscosity. We also notice that
the redistribution of angular momentum helps in eject-
ing more matter out of the equatorial plane, even more
compared to inviscid cases. For even higher viscosity, a
clear RAKED is formed and increased in size towards
larger radial distance. This suggests that these cases are
possible in the super-critical range of viscosity. Within
25 dynamical timescales at 30rS, the RAKED reached
the outer edge. The redistributed angular momentum
also leads to an even higher ejection of matter from the
disk. The added viscosity appears to make the ﬂow
more stable and the vertical oscillations become negli-
gible. The NBOL in Case C3 is equivalent of the transi-
tion layer of Titarchuk, Lapidus and Muslimov (1998).
However, our simulations generate the Keplerian disk
self-consistently, compared to their cases where it was
assumed to be Keplerian. In addition to that, we ﬁnd
sub-Keplerian to sub-Keplerian transition layers in Case
C2, which was not reported before. Case C1 is a equiva-
lent to the spreading boundary layer as the layer is very
thin and close to the surface. Here, too, the assumption
of Keplerian disk was not used by us and thus our sim-
ulations present a more generalized solution. We also
ﬁnd that due to the high density of matter near the sur-
face, the inﬂow is more likely to form the NBOL type
layer ﬁrst, before a disk can be formed near the sur-
face. This also connects all the three approaches by the
variation of viscosity in the ﬂow. When a diﬀerential
viscosity is introduced through a Z-gradient, the equa-
torial region with high viscosity forms a disk and the
region away from it, maintains sub-Keplerian angular
momentum in the inﬂow. This leads to the formation
of a TCAF geometry.
