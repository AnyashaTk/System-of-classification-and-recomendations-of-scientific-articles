ABSTRACT,8,CMBX9,,8,8
"We study the evolving environment dependence of mass accretion by dark haloes in
simulations of cold and warm dark matter (CDM and WDM) cosmologies. The latter
allows us to probe the nature of halo growth at scales below the WDM half-mode mass,
which form an extreme regime of nonlinear collisionless dynamics and oﬀer an excellent
test-bed for ideas relating to hierarchical growth. As environmental proxies, we use
the local halo-centric matter density",9,CMR10,,454,86

1 INTRODUCTION,8,CMBX9,,14,14
"The growth of gravitationally bound haloes of collisionless
cold dark matter (CDM) through accretion and mergers is
one of the primary physical processes of interest in the hi-
erarchical structure formation paradigm. The stochasticity",8,CMR9,,235,60
"inherent in the initial cosmological seed ﬂuctuations, coupled
with the nonlinearity of gravitational evolution of a colli-
sionless ﬂuid, renders this problem analytically challenging,
although considerable insights may be gained through simpli-
ﬁed models of structure formation (Bond et al. 1991; Lacey
& Cole 1993; Musso & Sheth 2014). Since dark haloes are

large-scale environment of haloes is expected to yield impor-
tant clues into corresponding correlations in the observed

for investigating the nature of mass accretion, in the form
of CDM-like power spectra which are suppressed at small
scales (large",8,CMR9,,188,59

"), mimicking the eﬀects of a thermally pro-
duced warm dark matter (WDM) particle. The steep cut-oﬀ",8,CMR9,,99,55
in power in such models creates an extreme situation where,8,CMR9,,58,58
"haloes forming close to the corresponding mass scale experi-
ence dramatically enhanced growth, and haloes below this
scale simply do not exist (e.g., Angulo et al. 2013). Simu-
lations performed with WDM-like power spectra, therefore,
oﬀer ideal test-beds for the environment dependence of mass
accretion: any physical model that purports to explain the
nature of mass accretion in CDM must also do so for WDM,
since the physics of a self-gravitating collisionless ﬂuid is com-
mon to both (Hahn & Paranjape 2014). Of course, WDM
models are physically interesting in their own right, from the
point of view of small-scale challenges for the CDM frame-",8,CMR9,,652,66

although this is not the focus of the present work.",8,CMR9,,107,55
"There has been considerable work to date studying mass
accretion by haloes via mergers and smooth (or diﬀuse)
accretion (Fakhouri & Ma 2010; Genel et al. 2010; Benson",8,CMR9,,166,56
"et al. 2013; Elahi et al. 2014), as well as its dependence on halo",8,CMR9,,66,66

"environment (deﬁned typically in terms of halo-centric dark
matter density using diﬀerent smoothing schemes, see Genel
et al. 2010; Fakhouri & Ma 2009, 2010; Maulbetsch et al.
2007; Borzyszkowski et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2017, see also More
et al. 2015). The overall understanding that has emerged
from these studies, regardless of the exact choice of deﬁnition
of halo-centric density, is that denser environments tend to
promote mergers while underdense environments are more
conducive to diﬀuse accretion. There are also stark diﬀerences
between accretion in CDM and WDM, particularly at low
mass, as expected from the discussion above, with low-mass
WDM haloes accreting rapidly and primarily through diﬀuse
accretion.",8,CMR9,,721,63
A related line of study is that of,8,CMR9,,34,34
halo assembly bias,8,CMTI9,,18,18

between secondary halo properties other than mass and halo-
centric density (or bias) measured at cosmological scales
(Sheth & Tormen 2004; Gao et al. 2005). Although assembly
bias has been studied over a wide range of halo mass and
redshift using many choices of secondary variables such as
age (Sheth & Tormen 2004; Gao et al. 2005; Jing et al. 2007),

secondary variables, including concentration, spin, shape and
velocity dispersion structure over a wide range of halo mass
(Ramakrishnan et al. 2019, see also Han et al. 2019). It is
therefore very interesting to ask whether the halo tidal envi-
ronment plays a similar role in explaining any assembly bias
trends with mass accretion.",8,CMR9,,455,62
"In this work, we perform a detailed study of the nature
of the environment dependence of mass accretion by haloes,
segregated into contributions due to mergers and diﬀuse
mass, as a function of redshift and for a range of halo masses.
We will do so using",8,CMR9,,254,63

"-body simulations of both CDM and

us to better resolve the multi-scale environment dependence
of mass accretion due to its sensitivity to the shape of the

"to the assembly bias literature by performing, for the ﬁrst
time, a comprehensive study of assembly bias due to mass
accretion across cosmic time, along with its connection to
the evolving local halo environment, for both CDM and
WDM. Our results reproduce previously observed trends
while extending these to new local environmental variables
such as the tidal anisotropy, and are expected to place useful
constraints on semi-analytical models of halo formation and
growth (e.g., Somerville & Kolatt 1999; Parkinson et al. 2008;
Jiang & van den Bosch 2014), which in turn form the bedrock
of several semi-analytical models of galaxy formation and

which the arrested growth of small-scale structure in WDM
inhibits mass accretion through mergers, as compared to
CDM. The fact that diﬀerences between WDM and CDM
accretion rates are dramatic at low masses is not surprising,
considering that our low-mass bin is at slightly smaller mass
than the half-mode mass for our WDM cosmology (see sec-

that,8,CMR9,,4,4

"Overall, we see that the tidal environments of objects at
any ﬁxed mass are typically more anisotropic at later times,
while most local densities evolve moderately or decrease at
later times. This is broadly consistent with the growth of the
cosmic web such that a larger fraction of haloes at ﬁxed mass
ﬁnd themselves in ﬁlamentary or sheet-like environments at
late times.",8,CMR9,,374,62

jects, we see for CDM that high-mass objects (dashed, warm

CDM accretion rates have also been studied before (see the
Introduction), our analysis represents the ﬁrst systematic

tween CDM and WDM haloes, at masses above and below

such approximate techniques (see the Introduction for refer-
ences). As argued by HP14, any such model which purports
to explain environmental trends of evolving haloes must logi-
cally work equally well for CDM and WDM, since the physics
of collisionless self-gravitating systems is common to both.
As we have seen, however, the suppression of small-scale
power in WDM leads to an intricate dependence of the mass
accretion on local (and large-scale) halo environment, partic-
ularly at masses smaller than the WDM half-mode mass. As
with the mass function at these scales discussed by HP14,
producing an accurate model of mass accretion with the
correct environment dependence is likely to reveal interesting
features of collisionless dynamics in the shell-crossed regime.
It will be very interesting to confront our results above with
excursion set models of mergers and mass accretion (Lacey
& Cole 1994; Mitra et al. 2011; Musso & Sheth 2014), as well
as excursion set-inspired semi-analytical algorithms tuned to
reproduce CDM results (Somerville & Kolatt 1999; Parkin-
