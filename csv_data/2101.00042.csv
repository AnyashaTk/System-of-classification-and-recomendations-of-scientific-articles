INTRODUCTION,9,CMR10,,12,12
"One of the most exciting discoveries in exoplanetary
sciences in recent years is that the radii of sub-Neptune
planets have a bimodal distribution (Fulton et al. 2017).
The prevailing explanation is the atmospheric erosion by
either photoevaporation (e.g. Owen & Wu 2013, 2017)
or core-powered mass loss (Ginzburg et al. 2018; Gupta",9,CMR10,,332,57
"& Schlichting 2019, 2020).
In any case, the promi-
nence of the radius gap implies that atmospheric ero-
sion is probably a stage of evolution that close-in exo-
planets very commonly go through. Since the discovery

of the metastable state of neutral helium and all relevant
reactions that populate and de-populate this state (see
